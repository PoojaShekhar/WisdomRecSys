Restaurant name  Hawaiian Style Poke

Review Text :
Poke! Poke! Poke! Who would have thought that I would find yummy poke in the desert of Las Vegas! I have yelp to thank for that...because Hawaiian Style Poke pops up on my yelp app and I just had to get some poke before I left! First off, DO get POKE here!! Second off, do not follow the directions on google maps on the phone. Because it says that it's behind the palms hotel which is a load of crock. It's actually located on the other side of Wynn Rd. at Chinatown. Towards Spring Mountain Rd. Thirdly, this is not a sit down restaurant. It's a take out deli, but instead of sandwiches they sell POKE! They have ahi poke and tako poke, all made fresh daily! I was able to try the Limu ahi poke, shoyu ahi poke and the tako limu poke! All were so good. My favorite of the three was the shoyu poke...but next time I'm trying the spicy garlic poke! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=o6i23tiQnEs6Z2KMvx91egah...poke! Poke! POke! POKe! POKE! POKEEEEE!I didn't even know this was here until Yelp. I've been craving poke and decided to try this new place out. There isn't a inside seating, but outside there are some stone tables and benches. It was way too hot today so the inside of the car was our lunch table.The BF and I got about half a pound of each:Garlic Ahi poke- pretty good. Good garlic flavor and I like the two kinds of onions in it plus green onions. We asked for a little spice and there was pieces of chilies thrown in it. Wasabi Ahi Poke- this had a creamy sauce base, onions and a bit of green onion. This was no joke wasabi. I complain that most wasabi poke just mix a tiny bit for flavor into some shoyu and call it a day. I like that they aren't afraid to give you wasabi here and I like the creaminess, BUT this was seriously overpowering. I love wasabi, but this was my nasals and eye ducts were burning at every bite experience. Even with taking bites with the other poke and some rice it was a bit much so I tried to scrape some of the cream off. Maybe gonna ask them to go a little lighter next time and mix.Limu Ahi Poke- fairly good, but lacking something for me..I should have asked for a little dab of shoyu to open up the flavor. For those who love the bits of limu- they are generous about putting a lot here. Poke is $10.95 and can be ordered in sizes as small as a 1/4th container to a big ol' bucket. I got a package of rice ($2) to go with the poke. We also got some Arizona Green Teas and I've never seen "Extra Sweet" version of it but they have that here... (is that a Hawaiian thing?). For dessert, some LiHingMui covered peach gummis ($1.75) from their small selection of Hawaiian snacks. I am a big fan of Poke Express (Craig Rd.)  and they are compared all the time on reviews. After trying it here, I would say they are different. The fish is about the same freshness and the way they season their poke isn't even close to being the same so it's about taste preference. Taste preference wise, I think I learn towards Poke Express overall. However, I think this place is good so I want to try more of what they have to offer and revisit a lighter version of the wasabi.Great little poke in the City of Sin!This tiny little place located in the China Town area of LV, is pretty tough to find if you don't pay close attention while driving down Wynn Rd... Once you are here, you will notice that the place is small, unattractive, and simply plain in overall appearance including the cold counter where they they "hold" the pre-marinated pokes...So why did I give it a 4 stars?1)  Flavor!  Love their Spicy Mix Ahi Poke!  Spicy mayo mix all combined with fresh ahi, sesame, green onions and red onions may this poke super delicious!  (Reminded me of those that were in Maui)2)  Freshly made!  Yes... there's not much in the counter, however, all items can be made to order!  Just tell the owner and he will be more than happy to whip some up for you quickly!  And of course, FRESH TOO!!!3)  Decent price!  Price actually cost slightly less than Maui!  So I'm happy to pay for more delicious ahi!4)  Friendly service!  Owner is real cool, real chill, and very nice overall!They have many other varieties of poke to choose from, so I'm sure there is a flavor that suit your tastebuds as long as you are a fan of fresh ahi!Next time you are in town, give this place a try as a nice little appetizer to one of your delicious meals in Vegas... and while you are at it, why not take a picture in front of Floyd Mayweather's boxing gym location just around the corner?If they run out of one of the pokes they will make it to order for you! they make a small batch at a time so the food doesn't sit out. bare bones kind of place so just swing by to pick some up. most everything is $15/lb - pricey if you're coming from LA (bc poke is trendy and everywhere there) but worth it once in a while bc there aren't many legit poke places in Vegas - and none near me.

The food here was surprisingly good! I arrived to my room at the Palace Station Hotel/Casino, dropped off my stuff then hit the gym for an hour and a half. I worked up a pretty good appetite so I stopped by the Chinese restaurant in the Casino and ordered the beef chow fun with gravy to go. I have to give it to this place, it was a lot better than I had expected it would be. There was plenty of beef and chinese broccoli in it and tasty ho fun noodles all stir fried with a thick gravy. Delish!I totally recommend stopping by here and checking it out if you're around this casino.

Our kitchen is torn apart, in the middle of a renovation. So last night, there we were again, hungry, and no way to cook. Delivery choices are limited in our area, unless you want pizza or Chinese. We were pretty burnt out on both. But decided to go for pizza. I sifted through our stack of menus, and came across one for a place we'd never ordered from - Nick's.I was pleased to find that, in addition to pizza, they offered pasta dishes, hot and cold subs, salads, and cheesesteaks for delivery. Score!  We ordered a meatball sub, a cheesesteak, and a caesar salad. Delivery was fairly timely (way better than the 45 minutes Streets of New York delivery!). The goods were a pleasant surprise as well.The caesar salad was HUGE! The round to-go container was jam-packed with romaine lettuce, parm, and croutons. Dressing was served on the side. Thank goodness for that, because we tucked right into the subs first, and were way too stuffed for salad afterwards. That left me with a huge salad to take to lunch the next day. The subs were on a soft on the inside, crusty on the outside roll. The meatballs were nice and juicy, and with good flavor. You could tell it was made with mixed meats (ideally, beef, pork, and veal), as a good meatball should be made. The cheesesteak, on the other hand, was OK. The meat was rather salty, but otherwise good. That tab wasn't too bad either - around $22. I would definitely order from them again.

"Ugh... I'm done!" I said as I wiped away my tears. I've had enough of a certain friend of mine who had talked shit to me for the last time. My sister, feeling my pain suggested that we go where every saddened Indian Girl goes when feeling bad... the nearest Indian Casino!! WHOO!! Well... okay, maybe not the nearest Indian Casino... but the one across the freeway and down the road... the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino. When we go into the Nuevo riche diner... I was surprised by how shiny it all was! There were deli cases showing off desserts that looked meh and these pedestals that showcased modern Native Art... but it didn't mesh well with the decor of the place. The dining room was big and the tables were very well spaced apart.We were escorted to our table, sat down and looked over the menu trying to decide the best way to cap off the night. The menu contained all American favorites in all their greasy goodness. Think of the Late Night Denny's menu but sans the moon over my hammy and you'll be dead on. Were told that Alan (or Alec?) was our waiter and would be by soon to take our drink order. So we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited! The last time I waited this long for a friggin' drink order it was because the bar was being danced on by stripper wannabes getting their Coyote SURE Ugly on!!  Yeah, I'll wait for the clear-heeled ones to vacate the bar... sure, why not? But this was NOT the case at Cafe 24/7. Not wanting to wait around in this crazy color changing world... oh yeah - did I tell you about the colors?! OMG! These damned lights in the ceiling keep changing!! Like from green to yellow to blue to pink to clear and back again!! It's not even a gradual change either!! It's a sudden change and the moment my eyes get used to the new hue, the color changes again! It was distracting and annoying especially when looking at the huge multi-screen TV behind the deli case that for some reason was set to channel 12 and displayed everything in green! But anyway... I digress... I got up and went to the deli case and told two employees that we have been waiting for a very long time. I learned that the staff is very good at apologizing and the hostess took over our table. We ordered and got our food very fast. Okay now the food...Our sampler appetizer that came with potato skins, chicken tenders, onion rings and mozzarella sticks were good and light and crunchy and crispy and nothing was over done or soggy. I was happy and surprised. I don't know why, but I always expect casino food to be bad food. The next round was our entrees. I ordered the Angus burger with cheese and bacon and this half pound bad boy had too much bacon on it!! I shared with the sis who was happy to receive it to go on her Turkey Sandwich, more on that in a second. My burger was cooked well and was fresh as was the toppings and bun. I was delighted but I wasn't happy with having to pay extra for French fries, seriously - it should just come with it. At the other Gila River Casinos, fries come with everything. Boo on Café 24/7 on this faux pas. My sister's turkey sandwich was awesome! It was piled high with nice... real... turkey! Lol! Like, someone took a knife to the bird minutes before it hit our table. No pre-packaged water logged sodium filled meat product here! We ate and I tried to laugh and get my mind off of the night's drama. When we were approached by the Café's manager, he informed us that the café is actually owned by the same company that is associated with Chase Stadium and not the Casino's usual food and beverage department. He also slightly chuckled when I tried to seriously complain about the long wait at the beginning of our meal. *sigh* just like a man huh? Oh well...To my Yelpers: all in all - if you're on that side of town and it's late... like really late and you're over 21 and the thought of going to Denny's by the freeway seems too disgusting for words... feel free to go to Café 24/7. The food options are the same but it's done so much better. The service might be shit like ours was, but get up and to go the deli, complain and you should be alright. I say go but don't go out of your way to go. Oh and leave your rose-colored glasses at home! Cuz the color changing throughout your meal might make your eyes bleed! I'll give it one more try before I die... but just one.

After going to the Secret Garden to see the new white lion cubs, I stopped here for lunch when I found out that you could go here even if not a guest of the hotel. I was promptly seated with a good view of the pool area and the waterfall there.  No sooner than I sat down, my server Cathy arrived with a tall ice water.  She also broguht me an iced tea that I wanted. I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich and I mentioned that I could always take half the wrap home with me.  Cathy pointed out it was a ciabatta sandwich.  I asked her if they could do it as a wrap and she replied that she didn't see where that would be a problem.  For a side, I got fries.The wrap was excellent, filled with much turkey and bacon and the fries were a good accompaniment.  I did not get dessert.  Instead, I got a to go box and took half the wrap and some fries home.It was so pleasant sitting there and watching the tourists--one of my favorite things to do in this wonderful city!  Even though the temperature was in the high 90s, the outdoor restaurant was pleasant.  They have a very good misting system.Since I have a year's pass to the Secret Garden, I think I'll stop more often during pool season when I go to visit the animals.

So this place is in a gas station. So there's that. But overlook the smell of fumes as you order and I have to tell ya, it's pretty solid. The woman ringing me up was DELIGHTFUL. I couldn't help but feel good cramming gyro and french fries in my face due to her pleasant disposition. It takes a bit longer but that's because everything is cooked to order. The menu is extensive, a weird compilation of southern and Chicago style (dogs, beef, gyro). I felt like the price was fair for the amount of food, about 8 bucks for a gyro pita and fries, and I liked that the meat was actually juicy. I do wonder if they're slicing it from a rotating deal or just heating it up, but I was also so hungry, it didn't matter as I scarfed it down.

Review Text :
This is a really small Vietnamese restaurant run and operated by mostly the members of a Vietnamese family.  The dad works in the kitchen, the daughters work the front (waitress, busser, cashier).  Counting the number of seats available, the capacity is probably 34 at the most.The menu is full of pictures to help you with ordering, if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  The price is pretty reasonable, not the cheapest and probably not the most expensive by off-Strip Vietnamese restaurant standards.Most items are under $10.Their Chicken Wings (comes with 3) is pretty good. It has nice flavor and has crispy exterior.  It is served with some salt and pepper, which you are supposed to squeeze some lime juice to form a very traditional Vietnamese condiment.  I think the chicken is good on its own, but the salty citrus flavor gives it a new depth of flavor.I also tried their combination pho on this visit.  The broth was good, on the mild flavor side, but not greasy (I like that!).  The tendons that was in my bowl was very soft, indication that it was simmered for hours to get that nice texture.  The herbs and bean sprouts served with the pho is also very very fresh. It is just a minor detail, but it is all of the little things done right that makes something as pedestrian as pho to be elevated to the next level.  Gotta love that.And I was told by one of my friend that this little restaurant is considered the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas by other Vietnamese!  And after trying some of their food, I can see why.  I will definiately be back for the delicious food and friendly service.I went here once before my yelping days and never went back. But groupon had a deal for $8 for $16, and the budget savvy person in me just could not resist.So I went and told them I had a groupon. They asked me for the coupon and no issue at all. It was one waiter in the place and he was actually very on top of his job. He made sure that I was doing okay and had everything I needed. However, I just wasn't feeling the place. I was quickly reminded once I started eating why I never came back.special combo pho with extra tendon - The noodles were just too soft. Way too soft, I felt like they were extra soft for a child or senior citizen. That is the best way I can explain it. The broth wasn't bad,  but it just had this flavor to it that I wasn't fond of. papaya salad -  I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. It was just plain shredded papaya mixed with shredded carrots and sliced shrimp. They served it with shrimp crackers and the server just told me to use the fish sauce at the table. But I wasn't sure how to use the nuoc cham with it. So I never finished it. I did eat the shrimp crackers though.pork sausage patty roll - probably the best thing I ate. Or maybe not. The sausage looked a little under cooked. Other than that, it was pretty tasty. So in the end, I really wanted to give this place a two but it wasn't horrible. I just didn't care for it. So this should be like a 2.5It's a pretty small place so if you come with a big group it just might be a little crowded. The restroom is back in the kitchen. Just a little uncomfortable for me.Here is an interesting piece about Da Lat. When I first moved here to Las Vegas, after driving for 3 days and over 2000 miles, Da Lat was the first restaurant I ever ate at in this fare city. I thought it was one of the best pho's I've ever had, and ever since then, it has always been in my top 3.Over the next several years, I've had the opportunity to come back here on several occasions. The Vietnamese crepe, bun bo hue, and every other items that I've tried were some of the best that I've ever had!Well, I came here the other day wanting to recreate some of my past experiences here. I noticed on yelp that they have new hours, and they are open until 4am, when they used to close a lot earlier. And I came in at 2am. When I walked in, I noticed that they had done a complete makeover of the place. It had turned into a more sleek and modern vibe, rather than the previous mom n' pop feel. The waiter told me that even though the restaurant went through a renovation, the owners are still the same owners.After scanning their menu I noticed that the prices are still the same, which is good because I thought Da Lat always gave great value for what you got. But, it looks like they have taken their awesome crepe off the menu.. Darn!! So I decided to go with the pho.Combo beef pho - the broth is still as good as I remember, you can taste the beef flavor as well as the spices commonly used in a good broth. The meatballs and brisket was good and plentiful. I can't remember if there is any rare beef that is supposed to come with the combo, but I didn't receive any and I don't have a menu with me to check.So here is the big reason that this is not a 5 star review. They brought out the traditional accompaniments for the pho; bean sprouts, Thai basil, and sliced jalapeños. The bean sprouts were turning brown, limp, slightly slimy and smelled off. The basil was dried up. And, the jalapeños had a dried up as well, noticing the white on the outside. I made the mistake of adding these items to my great soup, and it ruined everything. I've never had this problem before, but I usually have come in at earlier times, when the husband and wife are in the kitchen...I would come back here, but probably at an earlier time. I don't know who is working the menu at late-night, but they need to be trained on what is acceptable and not acceptable to send out to the customers. Oh, and bring back the crepe!!

Came here last night with a friend who was in town. I didn't want to go thru the hassle of going to a club on the strip, and I've seen this place before in passing, so this was the pick of the night. We got there a little early (around 10) so there was no line. There was also no cover which was nice and it didn't look like there was any dress code, but most people looked decent which kept the respectability of the place. There a several bars, A BUNCH of tv's always on a sports game/espn (ya!) and a mechanical bull, which is always fun to watch. I didn't eat the food, and from the others reviewers of this place, i don't think i ever will. The prices for drink were a little on the expensive side so I'm pre-partying next time. A few dance floors, DJ, bottle service (from what I was told) was about $200, which is pretty good. Alot of cougars last night. I mean ALOT. bachelor parties, and whatever else you can think of. definitely a diverse crowd. Truth be told the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because somewhere in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about how this place reminds me of a more classy version of saddle ranch at citywalk in Hollywood (which is not a good look). Its a little off the strip, so if you get tired of dealing with the politics of place on the strip and wanna go for something different, this is your place.Hitting up Cadillac Ranch just in time for their Happy Hour!  As advertised, it's Mondays through Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm - half off all drinks and half off appetizers.  (It's actually $7 select appetizers, but half off all drinks still!)We ordered a couple of drinks off their cocktail menu: * Pear...fect 59 Cadillac "Enjoy our signature cocktail made with Grey Goose La Poire and fresh pear puree." ($10) - We were surprised to see it arrive in a martini glass, something to think about if you're expecting a pint glass.  It was sweet and you can definitely taste the pear puree.* Seville "Experience a delightful and refreshing blend of Sauza Hornitos Plata, Citronge, Fresh Mango Puree and Fresh Lime Juice." ($10) - This arrived in a pint glass and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  Decent overall.  We were initially going to order a bunch of their half off appetizers, but changed our minds after we saw their $7 select appetizer menu.  They did offer a Complete Dinner for Two for $29.95 from Mondays to Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm.  (Add 2 Well Drinks - $34.95)  You can choose one select appetizer to share, one select entree each, and one select dessert to share.* Kettle Chips "Thinly sliced potatoes deep fried to perfection and served with garlic cream sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Finished with a Balsamic drizzle and scallions." - A hearty portion of tasty potato chips with a yummy creamy garlic sauce and a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles.* Candied Pecan Pork Chop "One thick-cut chops grilled and crusted with candied pecans.  Served over caramelized onion mashed potatoes and green beans." - Their regular entree course includes two pork chops, but you only get one in the dinner special.  A nice crust on that pork chop.* Bourbon Sirloin Steak "8 oz. beef sirloin seasoned and broiled to perfection, then placed on a demi glaze.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans." - The regular entree course is a 10 oz cut.  Ours was also served with corn.  * Strawberry Fried Cheesecake - Only available on the dinner special.  Asked the waitress about it and she couldn't say much beyond that she really liked it.  She didn't think it was deep-fried since it wasn't oily.  It's actually a flaky pastry with the cheesecake mixture inside and covered with cinnamon sugar.  Served with a strawberry sauce and cream.Food and service were okay, nothing special.  The busboys were quick about clearing out the dishes as they needed.  We probably wouldn't eat or drink here without it being happy hour or they were offering a special.  Some specials they are offering: Sundays: Salsa Night, 8 pm to close with a salsa instructor from 9 pm to 10 pm$3 Corona and Corona Light (from 9 pm to close)$5 House Margaritas and Cadillac Margaritas (from 9 pm to close)Mondays: Kids 12 and under eat free, from 11 am to 10 pm with purchase of any full priced entree, free bull rides for all kidsCame here last night to meetup with a large group of people to watch the USC vs Hawaii game on the patio.  Our group made arrangements to have the patio to ourselves during the game.I've been here once before and didn't like it, but came here anyway because of the group get together.  The service all night long was atrocious.  Here's the breakdown:Our server gave my table a menu, but failed to mention that even though it wasn't Happy Hour, you could still order from the Happy Hour menu but pay full price for the items.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I thought I overheard someone at the table next to us order Nachos....I scoured the menu looking for them but didn't find it....so I assumed that I was hearing things and we proceeded to order a Pepperoni Pizza and a Mushroom Lover's Pizza.While we were waiting for our food, our glasses of Wine & Beer went empty....then our Water glasses went empty.  We had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each time.....this went on throughout the night.  They brought out the Pepperoni Pizza and we started to devour it....thinking the Mushroom Pizza was still being prepared, I didn't ask about it at the time.  Meanwhile, a huge plate of Nachos gets delivered to the table next to us....what the hell?!  Then another table next to us gets Nachos too!  So, I asked our server....."Where is Nachos on the menu?".....she says "It's on the Happy Hour menu, since it isn't Happy Hour they are $9, do you want to order one?"....I say "Well, if we didn't already order a Mushroom Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza, I would have ordered Nachos".....she says "What Mushroom Pizza?  All I have is a Pepperoni Pizza for you."......now I'm pissed....I told her to put in the order for Mushroom Pizza.  I asked how they knew about the Happy Hour menu and she said that they asked for it.....that's crazy....how are people suppose to know to ask about something they are unaware of?The 2nd Pizza came out after a while, but what a disaster for service all night. The Pizza was good...not great.  The Pepperoni didn't have enough flavor.  The Mushroom Pizza was far from a "Mushroom Lovers" Pizza....very few Mushrooms.  I expected more Mushrooms.  I would have rated the food 3 Stars.Will I return?  Unfortunately, it looks like our group wants to meet here for games all year long, so if I want to hang out with them, I'll return.  Next time I'll eat before I arrive.After a really crappy visit to Cadillac Ranch a couple of weeks ago, I stopped by here to watch a college football game with some Alumni friends this past Saturday.  Because they chose this place, I didn't have a say in where to go....but decided to give it another shot.The experience was a 180 degree change from the last one.  Even though it wasn't Happy Hour, the server had Happy Hour menus out.....which is great because the items on the HH menu are not on the regular menu....I don't care if I have to pay full price.I ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.The Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.Will I return?  While I don't prefer this place, it's the official spot to watch games for our Alumni Club, so I'll be back soon I'm sure.

Had to take care of some stuff in this part of town that I have never had any reason to visit.. On the way home, I spotted this place and had a sudden craving for a Mexican Seafood platter.Mojarra Al Mojo De Ajo: A Whole Fried Tilapia sauteed in garlic  sauce and topped with more garlic sauce. Comes with beans, rice, salad green chile sauce and fresh handmade tortillas.  - The fish was fried perfrectly and tasted fresh from the sea, the garlic sauce was no joke (smothered with Garlic!) and extremely strong but I loved it, the green chile sauce was intensified with spices/heat but did not linger (Very nice!)- Rice and Beans were typical and satisfying- The Tortillas were Mesmerizing!! There is Absolutely No Comparison with store bought tortillas and their handmade tortillas served here.Carne Asada Taco: Litlle diced meat, very soft, not much flavor but their red chile sauce, cliantro and onions, especially the handmade tortilla made it a success.The Price was inexpensive for portion and taste, Place was decored surprisingly vibrant and server was helpful and kind. Would come here more often if it was closer!

Another review from an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) where we had 4 participants who accepted the Pho Challenge that day (Jen S., Bobby Y., James A., and Robert R.) out of our party of 20+ diners.We gathered at the two tables to the right, at the front of the restaurant near the fish tank with the lone gigantic fish (who I think has been eating too much pho during its lifetime).  It's a pretty simple menu, with pho prices ranging from $7-8 for a small, $8-9 for a medium, $9-10 for a large.  And of course, we can't ignore the gigantic bowl for $30 (if you can't finish it in the allocated time).  At a first glance, I would say it's a bit pricier here for standard pho.  The better value is to go for the large pho portions, and then it's not as expensive.  (I think it's probably a better value for two people to share a large, but the waitress strongly discourages sharing pho since it changes the temperature of the soup, etc. etc.)The Husband went for the $10 large bowl of oxtail soup pho.  It's a pretty big bowl with lots of oxtail meat present, so I think he definitely got his bang for his buck.  Whereas I went for one of the regular pho bowls, size small for $7, and it was just okay.  The meat portions are on the smaller end. I'm used to seeing larger cuts of rare beef, but that wasn't the case here.  Also, my soup was just warm and the Husband concurred the same about his broth.I also got to try two variations of their spring rolls - the shrimp and pork ones.  I liked the shrimp ones better since they grilled the shrimp prior to putting it in the wrapper.  The pork ones were just okay.The waitress was a bit anxious with trying to figure out how many people were going to compete, and it was pretty early on when we told her it was going to be four.  She said the cook needed to know how much meat to cut up.  Everyone wanted rare beef only in their pho, and she checked with the kitchen to make sure they could do this and they said yes.  I did ask her if she could serve the competitors first since they had 87 minutes to eat, and the rest of us could get our food last.  In the end, everyone else got their food and finished it long before the four competitors even saw their bowl of pho.  This was definitely not an efficient use of time at all and I think it also affected those who were competing. When the challenge bowls of pho did arrive, it definitely looked like it was more noodles than beef.  It's supposed to be 1.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of noodles, and broth.  The broth isn't such a high priority to finish since she said that by the end, there's usually not that much broth left anyway.  It was super hot when it arrived too.  (Guess that's where all the hot broth went!)  James A. came really close to finishing and he even brought his leftovers home (and finished them).  Word is that him and Robert R. might go for round two!   Pho 87 is a pretty large restaurant from the other Vietnamese restaurants in town, and a bit fancier.  There's a whole set up in the back that makes you wonder if they offer some kind of lunch buffet since they have those self service hot stations.Service definitely makes for an 'interesting' and 'entertaining' experience.  The waitress assigned to us definitely has comments coming from left field that probably are not the most politically correct.  She spent a lot of time discouraging us from participating in the challenge in the beginning, then she encouraged the females in our group to 'give a show' to encourage our male friends who were competing...comments about flashing and fake boobs were included.If you do complete the Pho 87 Challenge, your bowl of pho is free, as well as the bowl.  And she said they'll put your face on a billboard!  She said no one in Las Vegas has completed their challenge yet, but a few from Los Angeles has at their other location.  (Apparently she really wants a " white boy" on the billboard!)It's hard opening yet another pho restaurant in Las Vegas.  Props to them for creating a hook that will bring the customers in.  Not sure if it's enough to make it a regular joint though.This place has big portions, which explains their higher priced menu.  This place is hard to miss, but with the five signs out on the front...  how can you miss this place.  When you go inside you will notice pink sheets of paper with signs stating, "Only order water if you are going to drink it."  and "If our service isn't up to your standards, you should lower them."  Sarcasm at it's best.  So I ordered Pho Ga one time and the owner brought out Pho Tai.  She told me she thought I said, "Pho Tai."   She got upset at me and told me to never speak Vietnamese because I can't speak it.    Wow!  I was somewhat shocked at the service.  I tried to abide by the sign and lower my standards.  The pho bowls are big.  The broth is okay...  the noodles are not the typical noodles that you will find at other pho restaurants.  I decided to give this place another shot.  I forgot how hot it was in there.  The restaurant is big with a weak air conditioner.  There are fans on top of tables to keep you cool, but to make sure your pho stays hot.I took my friend here and she harrassed him too.  Questioned the way he ate his Pho and told him that he shouldn't put Chinese Ketchup (Hoison) because it ruins the broth.  She also asked him where he usually goes, and she mentioned that her restaurant was better. She didn't stop to comment once either. She came back every couple of minutes to see what he thought about the pho. After leaving, I apologized to my friend and said I don't plan on coming back. If you like big portions...  they definitely have big portions.  If you don't care about the kind of noodles, this place is ok.  If you want to lower your standards in Las Vegas or wherever you are from, you can come here and take pictures of the signs and post them on your wall.Pho - 2 starsService - Lowered the standard to 1Outside Sign Arrangement and Decor -1The Food Network sign fooled me too. $9 for 6 egg rolls. $7 the small sized bowl of pho. Am I at a Vietnamese place? The owner had a wry sense of humor, as evidenced by the signs on the wall. I appreciate her trying to joke around with us. That didn't make the pho taste any better. I couldn't smell any of the spices in the pho. It tasted like canned beef broth with meat and noodles. It wasn't mediocre pho; it was outright bland, tasteless pho. We were also overcharged by $10. The owner said she made a mistake and made some joke about being the only Asian to ever fail math. It seemed a little suspicious to me that she was able to write the correct sum of our charges, but when she added the $4 tax, it somehow became a $14 tax. I'll give her the benefit of doubt, but I'd scrutinize my receipt if I were you.Won't be returning.Saw the billboard and decided to go in and try their pho.  My husband and I decided to split a medium bowl of pho, spring rolls and egg rolls and when we ordered it the lady which we think is the owner/server gave us a look like we're crazy for sharing and started commenting about asian specially vietnamese DO NOT share pho and my husband who's white made a funny comment that we would like to share it because we're not asian!  Well, I'm filipino (100%) and so my husband made that comment to be funny and the server looked at me and said oh that's why I married my white husband because I'm not asian, I took this very offensive and then when we're done I asked her for a to go box and she again made a sarcastic comment abut bringing left over home!  Very RUDE and TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Food is nothing special for me to come back!  I think the owner forgot that there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurant in the valley that she's competing with! Definitely a mistake and waste of money trying out this place.  I will have to just go back and stick with PHO KIM LONG!WHAT THE PHO!I tried this place out months ago and I didnt think it deserved a review. The only reason why im doing this now is because I had a what I thought was a weird dream until I woke up and realized it was a nightmare!Bare with me. So here's my my Nightmare on Pho Street. Me and my wife just happen to be driving down Jones Blvd wondering what to eat for dinner. We see the sign that they were on the food network. Can't go wrong with that right? So we mosy on in and see that it is a nice sized restaurant. I see plenty of tables but only see one person eating soup by herself. Weird because it was around 6:30 dinner time. Out of nowhere this old crazy lookin lady sits us down. I look at the menu and wonder if the prices were in Vietnamese knowing that the US dollar has slipped a little bit. So im thinkin a small bowl of pho and a small bowl of oxtail soup wasnt gonna max out my credit card. All the while the old asian lady was throwing out suggestions like an announcer at a horse track only with a heavy asian accent. "You want try eggrolls?" No thanks. "How bout spring rolls?" No thanks. "You want order drink?" No thanks just water. "You wanna no soda?" Just water.So off she went to go submit our order. I don't know if she was mad or if it was normal because it sounded like she was having some sort of argument with what I assume was the cook. After about 8 minutes she brought out our food. My wife was in the bathroom at the time so I decided to to take the opportunity to photograph our food. All of a sudden the asian lady comes out of nowhere and says "What you doing? You should eat the soup right away. It's good hot!" I explained to her that I was about to take a picture and that I was waiting for my wife to come back. She just gave a "I don't understand confused look." The two stars are for the pho and oxtail soup. I thought it was tasty BUT that's the only positive thing. Since we both ordered small bowls, we weren't hungry any more but at the same time we could have eaten more. Kinda pricey for small bowls too. That and the "Hurry up and buy!" attitude of the old asian lady did not help either. Im not makin fun of her. All that I described was what actually happened.So I guess you can say she was Freddy Krueger and we were the hapless sleeping victims. I don't think I will be coming back. If you want good Pho place at decent prices and better service, I recommend Pho So 1. That's my go to Pho place.Yelp really needs to allow negative ratings.I've been there a total of three times now. The lady watiress/owner, from the first time she TALKED, I already knew she was a rude one. However, it's an Asian place so it's expected. So I ignored her attitude, ignored her snide/not-so-funny comments, and just ate my food because that's what I went for. Plus I always go with a group of 6 or more people so I always have my friends to chat with and make jokes with. That way, her little signs of lowering my standards won't be so annoying. But our recent trip was, by far, the worst. THE WORST. I don't think I've ever been treated this poorly in any Asian restaurant. And trust me, I've been to plenty. I wasn't really feeling all that well and that's why my friends were willing to go to pho instead of the originally planned ramen shop. Bad idea. I think my stomach would've preferred the thick ramen soup. The wait for water/soda: 40+ minutesThe wait for pho: 1 hour and then someThe wait for the food was so long that my stomach had begun hurting before the food got here. And even when the food DID get here, the food did not help cause the damage was already done. So instead of sitting back and relaxing in contentment of a full stomach, I was busy cringing in pain. Who the shit serves pho an hour after the order? So my boyfriend brought me a bottle of vitamin c tablets for me to take prior to everything. It was a new bottle, so all the plastic wrapping and cotton inside was put on the table cause where else are we going to put it? So what did the owner say when she took our orders?"CLEAN UP YOUR MESS PLEASE."THE FUCK, LADY? You think YOU won't have to clean up the mess AFTER we eat? Or what? We eat and WE CLEAN the TABLE FOR YOU BEFORE WE GO? The shit?Needless to say, we didn't tip much and got a sarcastic comment from her because of it. "THANKS FOR THE HUGE TIP!! You're so GENEROUS!" Then she repeated it as we were walking out the door. Why do I have to tip you if you're going to take an hour to bring out pho? ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. LET ME REPEAT. ONE HOUR. I normally can get in and out of a restaurant in one hour, not wait for water and food for an hour. Oh, the food wasn't anything that special either.But yeah, I suppose you can blame us for not leaving asap but I was trying to not to be rude to people and in front of my friends. Normally I don't have a problem with waiting cause we're in a big group and we always have a lot to talk about but this was a little bit too much. It was one of those:Hey, it's a lil long but maybe it'll be here soon. .. toWe've already been here this long -_- might as well.DO NOT COME HERE!!My family and I use to come here years back. I stopped coming after I orders a rice plate and I got really sick from it.  Couple years later (which is now), I wanted to take my boyfriend because he's been wanting to try this place. We walk in the restaurant and the lady just tells us to come over to her. Doesn't say hi or welcome. All she said was "Come here!" We sat down and I look at the menu. First of all, they don't have a lot of selection. Secondly, they are very pricey. Regardless of how "good" their soup is. I don't remember them being THAT pricey. It was $21 for a medium bowl!The lady was very rude and rushing us. My boyfriend asked a few questions and she just answered it carelessly. We then decided to leave because of the bad vibe. We told the lady we'll try it out some other time. She snatches the menus away and says "Well, come back when you have money and eat our good food!" Then, as we walked out, she then turned to the only people there and said "Can you believe that these customers walked out because of our price". I think that's very unprofessional. So, this review doesn't even deserve a star. No customer service at all. All you get is a lady that has some bad attitude. There are other pho places that will treat you better and they're still good. I think this place just blew their heads a little bigger just because they were "featured in the food network". And, I've actually seen that episode and they had 5 minutes of fame, which is nothing. I wouldn't want anyone to get treated the way we got treated. Never coming here and I will tell people not to come here.

I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!I love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a "scene". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!We escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free "luigi" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. The downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding "specialty cocktails". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and "martinis". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. Food was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!All in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines. I loved the chill, yet upscale, atmosphere.PS - Tuesday is $1 burger night.. maybe someone can make it out there and check out how good these $1 burgers are!!

Restaurant name  360 Gourmet Burrito

Review Text :
Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.The lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).The Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.Anyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.Will I return?  No!The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier "I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?"  She said "No" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, "Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.That does it for me, I will never eat here again.Return Factor - 0%Is anybody ever REALLY excited about being stuck eating airport food?  The options are extremely limited, most are unhealthy, and the prices are always significantly higher than you'd find elsewhere with a significantly lower quality of food served.So imagine my surprise when I discovered a 360 Gourmet Burrito shop during a recent 2 hour layover at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'd actually eaten at a 360 Gourmet Burrito restaurant in San Ramon, California (Near San Francisco) and really enjoyed to food there, so I entered this restaurant with high hopes  in spite of their two star Yelp rating with over 60 reviews which would normally have caused me to steer clear.I decided to switch it up and try one of their bowls, and chose the curry bowl with steak that comes sauteed with veggies over rice.  I can't say that it was the best curry bowl I've ever had, but it was still far better than a lot of airport food I've endured.  The steak was not overcooked, the rice was fresh, not starting to dry as if it had been sitting around, and the quantity given was decent.  It was far better than fast food would have been, yet not quite up to my memory of the other 360 Gourmet Burrito location I visited.  All in all, I don't regret having eaten here and would probably do it again if stuck on another layover here.  Better than your average fast airport food.  There wasn't really anywhere inside you could sit down to eat your food, but my plan was to take it back to the gate to eat so that wasn't really an issue for me.

Restaurant name  Hurry 4 Curry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I visited Hurry 4 Curry on a Saturday evening for a take away dinner. I believe I visited on their second or third day of operation.I entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean. Having read about the restaurant in the Republic prior to arriving, I immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order. Ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the Indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine.I ordered butter chicken, naan bread and Basmati rice. This came to $8.50. It was a pleasure to see, as is done in many other countries, that the tax was included in the price of each item. While I could have swiped my credit card to pay at the "menu monitor," I chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash register. She also validated my parking in the AZ Center garage. My butter chicken (you can choose naan or rice as a side) was $7.50 and my naan was another dollar, which brought the total cost of my meal to $8.50. Because I was ordering take away, I did not order a drink. I did, however, see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license; presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no "bar" in the quick service space.After a wait of maybe five minutes, I received my food in what one might describe as "higher-quality" Chinese food boxes. The naan bread was wrapped in foil.After a short drive home, I transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner. While the rice was very well cooked (generally fluffy and not clumped together), the naan (as the Republic also reported) was somewhat disappointing. While it was definitely naan and not pita bread, I found my serving to be almost cracker-like in texture and too cool of a temperature. (I assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day. I wonder, though, if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven?) My butter chicken was flavorful, but also rather cool in temperature. Portion sizes were more than adequate.When I visited, the restaurant was empty. Because I hope this restaurant will survive (I think the concept is novel), I sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner. Would I return? Sure. I enjoyed a healthy, filling and flavorful dinner for a fair price. And, when I return, I will be happy to adjust my star rating upwards if some minor improvements have been made.ok so here is the skinny on a place I have been anticipating for quite some time. Hurry 4 Curry is small, basic, and completely neat-o.Ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid for by swiping your credit card. If you want to pay cash, you can do so at the counter. You'll slow things down for sure, think of the visa commercials. They are pending a liquor license right now.The people working there were nice, and offered to help me with the ordering process. Sorry, if you can't figure this out, you need to go off yourself immediately and stay out of the gene pool. The food is premade, and in 5 pots in the middle of the kitchen. When you order, they go get a plate, put some rice and some main dish on it and bring it to you. The food I got was tasty, albeit a bit underspiced. They are planning on staying open until 9pm nightly. I thanked them for their ambitious plans and let them know I hope they don't give up like a lot of places do. If you live in the city, and like this place, I ask you to do the same. It would suck if I got used to this for dinner and they changed to say, 6pm closing.

This is actually my second time here. The first time, we waited ten minutes to be seated at the almost empty restaurant. We eventually gave up before walking two does down to Bachi Burger. I decided to give it another try. I have to say, both food and service are unimpressive at best. I will not be returning.After tonight, i'm increasing my previous visit last month of a 4 star rating to 5 stars!!!!!Tonight the Po Tak soup, pork satay and Panang Curry were all delicious!  Jasmine tea with free refills is something a couple might enjoy sharing, we did!Archi was in the kitchen overseeing his operation. Nice to see he takes ownership to his ownership, so to say; ensuring excellence.Closed on Tuesdays.Open til10pm the other 6 nights.As always...excellent service, impeccably clean restaurant including restrooms, beautiful wood decor, pleasant background music.

Review Text :
My youngest daughter and I stopped in here after spotting it as we were driving by with an eye peeled for something for dinner that was:1. Not fast-food.2. Not a chain.I consider Mimita's a find.  Service from our waiter Ty was very good.He answered many questions that my daughter had and helped ease her comfort level about Cuban food.We started with papas rellenas which are essentially big balls of mashed potato that are filled with creole ground beef, rolled in some light coating and fried.  So fried meat n' potatoes.  Tasty.Next we shared a sandwich, the pan con lechon.  It was pulled pork, sauteed onion and mayo in fresh bread.  Also quite tasty and large enough to share.We finished it off by sharing an order of dulce de leche.  Wow. It is not a very large dessert but the 2 of us could barely finish it, it was so rich.  Great caramel flavors with wholesome vanilla and cinnamon, perhaps a hint of rosewater or something else.Prices are good.  Our app, sandwich and dessert cam to about $20.Yes... you can indeed find Cuban food in Arizona; you just have to search for it!  Or join Yelp AZ's International Supper Club - we meet on most third Thursdays of the month and this past week, we met at Mimita's.Standout appetizers for me were the yuca frita and the papas rellenas.  I also had a small "ensalada de tomate y aguacate" (tomato and avocado salad) and went with the "filete de pescado al ajo" (fish fillet sauteed in butter and lots of garlic) for my entree.  Yes, it was a ton of food since the entree also came with rice, beans, and perfectly cooked sweet plantains, but everything was really delicious.  I washed it all down with Mimita's mango iced tea. Warning - the tea is tasty but sweet!Kelly was our server and she was wonderful.  She's got a fabulous Venezuelan accent!  Prices are moderate and portions are healthy.  The restaurant is kid-friendly too... I did bring the baby, but if you're going to do so, note that there is no changing station in the bathroom. Last note: the garlic sauces and dishes are really garlic-y, so be forewarned!

Restaurant name  Deejai Thai Restaurant

Review Text :
OK, a few of my foodie friends are obsessed with Deejai and I just didn't get it, well I got it today at lunch. YUMMMMMM. We ordered a lemongrass, ginger beef, green curry chicken, and a spicy ground chicken dish. Of course, I ordered my green curry spicy, it did have a kick but it wasn't as hot as the other dishes on the table. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. A little one star addition for this cute, modern establishment. Deejai also offers a private dining room downstairs that can accommodate up to twenty people and outdoor seating. It's on my radar now.Deejai Thai has stolen a piece of my little Thai-loving heart.... and soul. I've ventured in a few times, on a whim, and have always found something worthy of plate-cleaning. I've ventured in only for dinner but would happily oblige a go at the lunch menu. The location tends to be a bit finicky with parking. Get here for dinner during a 7pm or 9pm movie at The Manor and you'll be hard pressed not to find parking along one of the neighboring streets. I've made the mistake of trying to fight for a parking space in the lot outside. You may find yourself up against a few soccer-mom buses. Savvy? Either way, once you find yourself inside of Deejai's dimly lit and relaxed dining room, it's all downhill (in the best freaking way possible).Staff is always very welcoming and quick to seat you. There is lovely seating along the side of the building and great on temperate evenings. Candle-lit dinner seekers, this is your area. Very romantic and sometimes rather quiet despite resting so close to Providence Rd. Here's my recommendation: Basil Rolls. Filled with basil and shrimp and accompanied with a light and perky plum dipping sauce. I'd drink the stuff if I could....that may be a little audacious, but it is really good. You get two with each order so maybe ordering a few plates for your table is in order. You won't regret it. Pad Thai. Bet you didn't see that one coming. I've always loved it at Deejai. Sweet and balanced with sour from lime wedges. Tender rice noodles and filled with veggies and tofu. You can get tons of other proteins in your order. Duck, though pricey, is definitely worth the venture. Curry Fried Rice. So filling. Generous portion of rice and vegetables. Wonderful yellow curry flavor and the eggs are a wonderful addition. DESSERT. This is the coup de grace on your appetite. Ready? Mango with Sticky Rice and Ice Cream. I died and went to dessert heaven the first time I had this. Sweet, hot, cold, chewy, creamy, melty, fruity heaven. This is the perfect balance of textures, temperatures and flavors for a dessert. I'm not typically a dessert person, but this beats the pants off anything else I would choose to end my meal. Well done, Deejai. I'm a believer. Deejai has an expansive menu with wok options and sushi. I've yet to try these but plan to in the near future. Price point is rather fair. My wife and I can eat here for about $30 (including dessert but not drinks). If Thai is what you're seeking, Deejai needs to be on your list. Cheers!

Review Text :
Walk in, seat yourself.  Beer prices incredibly high, it is indeed $8 for a Guinness.  They offer PBR.  PBR, at an upscale restaurant, for $4.  This is a fairly significant fail, simply given the fact that i've never seen such swill (at those prices!) offered at a place like this.  There was Stella and Hoegaarden offered as well, but at $7, who wants that?  We should have immediately abandoned all hope of ordering beer and turned to the fairly impressive-looking wine selection, but no one in my party was inclined to do so.  So that was the first disappointment.  Miller High Life and other domestics do not merit $5.  I honestly wondered whether this was an intentional choice, aimed at adding a touch of irony to the menu, but finally must simply conclude that they're attempting to drive people to the wine list.  The burger options: there are three pre-designed burgers, none of which quite seemed to call out to me, and one yellowfin tuna sandwich counted among the burgers.  I elected to build my own.  13 different cheeses are named and a brief description is provided, along with the source.  Refer to the menu if you're confused.  I thought this was an excellent touch.  There are extras (ie, bacon, toasted tomatoes, etc) and sauces (ranch, garlic aoli, bbq, so on) that can also be added.  I opted for a simple combination of midnight moon cheese and jalapeno bacon.  I didn't say it was a good combination, I said it was relatively simple.  They offer a side of 1000 Island dressing with any burger, along with basic lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onion according to your preferences.  I ordered mine rare.  Our table of 4 also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, ($4) which were good.  The burgers emerged not long thereafter.  Mine was medium or medium well, only a little pink towards the side.  This was the other disappointment of the evening.  Unevenly cooked, and cooked far beyond my order, I was more than a little let down given that their name (supposedly) refers to the specific temperature difference between a medium rare and a well done burger. Thankfully, the burger was still juicy enough that I wasn't forced to apply loads of ketchup or resort to the dressing.  The cheese was excellent, mild, and the jalapeno bacon was quite tasty as well.  The bun used is a very fluffy white bread, which combines with the thick patty to make the whole package rather intimidating when it's first brought out.  I did thoroughly enjoy the burger, despite the goof-up with the cooking.  I didn't check to see how my companions' burgers were cooked, but they claimed to enjoy theirs as well. Another note: we asked our waitress about the beef used and she did not answer with confidence, informing us that the beef was 100% ground sirloin, 100% grain-fed beef.  I kind of assumed a burger place like this would consider the beef a selling point, but she hemmed and hawed a bit, seeming only too glad to move on with the conversation as soon as her questioner's curiosity abated.  She didn't have to prove anything about the beef to any of us (I don't think we were expecting really low-quality meat), but she could have been a slightly more enthusiastic salesperson, in my opinion.  It looked like lack of training.  The decor is eclectic but very upscale on the inside, the patio, where we sat, was pretty plain.  The service was really good - other than the brief description of the beef; I have no other complaints for our servers.  There's nothing wrong with this place, in fact despite my little disappointments, we all enjoyed our meals very much.  A few fairly small adjustments, and I'd easily award this place 5 stars.  But this beer selection, in this day and age where beer drinking is no longer vilified even among higher-end restaurants, is an absolute joke.  Many diners will be even more incensed at the failure to prepare the burger correctly - I felt that the juiciness of the burger at least partially redeemed this error.  Perhaps those that prefer their burgers medium to medium well will be less dissatisfied.  I'll almost certainly be back, and I'd be glad to see these issues resolved on future visits.  This place is too nice to not have substance to match the flash.25 degrees + date night = great night. We tried out 25 degrees tonight and really looking forward to our next visit.We started out with some beers. It was a 1st for me trying out a Dirty Ho which is quite the funny name for a Guinness and Hoegarden beer (similar to a black and tan).  We were on our way to see a movie so unfortunately didn't have time for full dinner.  We tried out 2 appetizers and both were  amazing. The cheese and smoked meat board was really good. Definitely ask the really friendly staff for advice on selecting which cheeses you want as I had not even heard of some of the cheese options before.We also got the tuna and eggplant that sounded odd but wish we had time to order a 2nd plate. It was just that good.Next time we will try out the burgers as those sounded really good.  25 degrees is a must visit!

11/18/10On the day I stopped by here for what I thought would be just a cup of coffee and some down time to write a review or two, I found out that Coffee & Tea Express had experienced a burglary-- windows were smashed and a TV was ripped off the wall.  This happened in the early morning hours, and had I not overheard otherwise, I'd never have known it-- the place was disheveled just enough to show that customers read the news while they enjoyed a cup o' joe, grabbed a bite, and/or worked on their laptops.  The barista/phone operator/sweeper/cashier had his work cut out for him as he took my order for some coffee and a salmon burger (I was failing at my attempt to hold out for the OYE at the Pink House an hour later); answered my questions about the ingredients in their bread products; and jotted down a phone order for takeout, all while maintaining a clean environment.  He said I could pay for my meal at the end, when I was ready to leave.  How convenient!Did I forget to mention that the barista made my coffee from beans he'd just ground up right before my eyes?  Talk about serving a fresh cup, and all for $1.60!  The salmon burger was made w/ previously frozen Alaskan salmon fillet.  I knew this, bec. the otherwise tasty, buttery, crisped, yet flaky salmon patty, w/ crisp large-leafed lettuce and tartar sauce, on a buttery, crisped, and flaky croissant had edges that were still frozen.  If it weren't for the fact that I had an OYE to go to, where there's a promise of more food and drink (in actuality, there wasn't!), I might've felt more disappointment over this mishap, but I took cutting away the frozen bits as an opportunity to lower my calorie-intake at the coffee house!  :)Free wi-fi, good coffee, and sincerely friendly customer service make this coffee shop a winner that I wouldn't mind visiting again!

3.5 stars This location is in the Meadows Mall. I purchased a $6 for $12 groupon which ended up making me feel better because I wouldn't pay regular price...ever.The menu at this location is limited so don't expect the regular JR menu if you want to eat at this one. I ordered a rocket double without lettuce or tomato and fries. I really enjoyed my burger and fries. They were both made fresh to order. My total was $12.92 for just the burger and fries, no drink. That is too steep on the wallet if paying full price and not even getting a drink. With a coupon I would come back again.There is a counter if you want to eat at JR or you can sit in the food court.OMFG this place is loud!  FIFW consider bringing earplugs!Pert and perky service with a smile the two times I've been here, FYI.Food is okey dokey neighbor!Prices are fair 'ta middlin' for the burger joint grub.This place is awash with hard surfaces...even the ceiling tiles.  Hence the loud music and other hubbub careens around and leaves you with ringing ears...

Arcadia is such a mecca for upscale lunch places (Wildflower, Pita Jungle Chelsea's Kitchen, La Grande Orange, Acacia and more are all within a few miles of each other) that it's easy to miss some hole-in-the-wall lunch spots that compete with (or beat out) the more well-known places in the area. The first spot like this that I discovered (and was surprised to see that only a few people had reviewed) was Bertha's Cafe. Then, thanks to Joel L and Sean O's reviews, I stumbled upon Chestnut Lane. What a great place! Truly. The atmosphere is striking with refreshingly simple and minimalist decor that's interrupted only by gorgeous brightly-colored fresh flowers. The  menu is up on a simple board with a few cafeteria-like selections in glass cases. The woman who either owns or manages the place is clearly passionate about what she does and is very friendly and efficient in running the place. What about the food, you ask? Well, what I've tried is been really flavorful and satisfying. A few standouts: the house salad with arugula, orange wedges, parmesan and candied walnuts (I don't love salads so if I like one, you can bet it's good!); the pumpkin black bean soup; and the tuna melt. I have not yet had the pleasure of trying the corn chowder (the soup rotates on a daily basis), but I have this feeling that I will love it, especially if it's paired with the delicious crusty bread. Personally, I thought the blackberry lemonade was a bit sweet, but I can picture watering it down with some club soda (and maybe some vodka?). Now that's homemade I can truly appreciate!Definitely check Chestnut Lane out if you're in the mood for a fresh, good-quality and affordable (for the area) lunch. You won't be disappointed.Wow... After reading the previous CL reviews and hearing from Joel L that he thinks I would like this place and that I must try it, I finally gave in.  I wanted to see if I could really trust Joel's opinion, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about!I didn't realize that Chestnut Lane was a tiny little spot, nor did I realize that it's the type of place where you order at a counter and then sit down... I must note that they have limited seating.  Luckily, my lunch companion and I met on the later side (1:30 on a Thursday), so we had no problem getting a table outside and luckily, it was in the shade.We walked in and I was blown away by how fresh and delicious all of the salads looked in the case... I was torn between the old fashioned egg salad, lobster cobb, chestnut lane chopped, and asian chicken salad... and the farro looked amazing too.  I went with the large version of the lobster cobb and was not disappointed.  It consisted of fresh lobster mixed in with butter lettuce and just the right amount of avocado, tomato, bacon, hard boiled eggs, and a light lemon vinaigrette dressing.  Served with a fresh baguette - it was the perfect lunch.  If it were not so filling, i would've gone back in for a side of farro or one of their scrumptious but healthy sounding pastries.My lunch companion had a turkey BLT sandwich on whole-grain bread that was stuffed to the gills with turkey, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and mayo... it looked amazing and he ate the entire thing along with a cup of chicken noodle soup.  I am quite sure that I'll be back again soon to experience some of the other organic goodness that CL has to offer.  And kudos to Joel L for insisting that I would enjoy Chestnut Lane... I guess you can get to know someone pretty well from their Yelp reviews!

Almost entirely vegetarian chinese restaurant (they serve some dead fishies. boo!)  There are like um no veggie or vegan restaurants in las vegas and this is an oasis in the oasis (ha!)...if you are a veggie or vegan or a connoisseur of fake meat, you MUST try this place. amazing. order the mongolian beef, tomato beef chow mein, sweet and sour chicken.  support this place if you live in vegas or are visiting vegas on more than a stripper and coke binge.  or fuck it, even if you are on a stripper and coke binge...stop by for a respite from the madness! l will be eating here again tomorrow night so I will have another update when I get back. everyone, please sit tight.hours: 11:30 am - 10:30 pm every day.  CLOSED SUNDAYS.  learned this the hard way.

Bland & Boring BUT Cheap. $9.99 per person.Smallest buffet I have ever seen. Very limited selection,dessert selection is the WORST.Nothing special-the pictures tell it ALL.Service was fast & friendly but didn't make up for the food.I won't be back unless it's FREE.It matches the name.Of all the drunken places I ended up at WHY couldn't i have been at Secret Pizza!? Or at least Earl of Sandwich! this is how it went down.waiter: what would you like?me: nachos!!!waiter: that ended at 11pm.me: NACHOS!waiter: that ended at 11pm.me: okay, loco moco.waiter: how would you like your beef cooked?me: medium rare.waiter: we don't do medium rare. medium well?me: what do you mean medium well? no no, MEDIUM RARE.waiter: we don't do medium rare.me: then why did you ask me how I wanted it f*#$&#(*cking cooked??? okay I'm sorry sir I didn't mean to cuss at you. Medium well. FINE.*texting on group chat*I'M DRUNK AND I AM SAD BECAUSE THEY ARE COOKING MY LOCO MOCO MEDIUM WELL WTF. AND I AM EMO. AND IM NOT WEARING A BRA AND IT'S COLD IN HERE AND MY NIPPLES HURT AND MY LOCO MOCO IS MEDIUM WELL!!!!!!!!!!my friends: what the...Yea I don't know what happened man. All I know is that it was barely edible to me.I came with a friend and we arrived at the S7 buffet at about 9:15 on a Saturday morning. The prices were reasonable and the guy at the counter told me that you get an extra two dollars off if you have a players club card. I thought that was a nice discount and it was worth getting signed up for.The buffet was pretty good and it covered the basics for sure! I was in breakfast mode so I hung down towards that end of the buffet. I grabbed a couple of plates of scrambled eggs and bacon and then I poured gravy all over it. As of late, I love going with that gravy option when it is presented to me. I will call this my gravy phase lol!The people that worked there were nice and they had this cool vegas lights kind of mural on the wall next to the booth that we were seated in and that made for a good back drop for our pictures. The gal that took the pictures was a good sport because I get a little picky when it comes time to take pictures.

Was looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).There are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.While I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I noticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said "Sangria" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's "non-alcoholic".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!Within a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with "Everything", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.Overall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!Will I return?  Orale, of course!

Review Text :
Have my bar prayers been answered by the Phoenix Gods? The Turf quietly opened today and the only reason I know is because I walked by on my way back from the Matsuri Festival. Thank goodness we decided to walk up 1st instead of Central! It occupies the same space as Sens and PastaBar and is a very welcome addition downtown. A large space that straddles the fence between traditional pub and modern resto-bar Turf fills a void that exists in the area. Its a place that my husband can enjoy a beer (they have a decent selection on tap) and I can get a mixed drink. (Rum and cokes are cheaper than Smithwick's!) You can choose between the comfy bar stools, a high back leather chair at a table, a booth or a high top.Obviously its still finding its identity but I have high hopes for the new kid on the block. If they can figure out music it would go a long way. They don't have a full menu yet, just burgers and wraps, but the wrap our neighbors at the bar ordered looked huge. The bartender, Jonie, was very friendly and informed us they will be open full time for lunch and dinner, plus happy hour specials, starting next Friday after their soft opening.I'm a fan. Turf is what you get when you want an average Irish bar crossed with a high end urban pub with leather-backed chairs. This is nothing more and nothing less and has been delivered downtown to much success.I do like that they know me and my friends already after one week, and have handled complicated car key situations, Mayor Gordon sightings with grace and easiness. Kudos them.i'm giving turf 4 stars for now, i expect 5 stars will be on a follow up.first time here and i have to say i already love the place, its within a 7 minute walk from my apartment and that is something i have been dreaming of since i first signed a lease. my only full bar options are Portlands (meh) and carley's (good god no!!) and the bikini (way too far to stumble home, and HIPSTER) and sidebar (close, but not really stumble home close). so here i am meeting my roomie for drinks after work, i walk in and wow. i expected allot worse from the reviews from John V and Pierre. let me correct the misconceptions, its not in any way empty space, yes it's not overly crowded (yet) but i had a mental picture of the brickhouse empty. it is nothing like that. the floor plan is laid out with seating for sit down comfort..split with a bar and tall bar sit up tables. i was also expecting barren walls. but from what i can tell there wasn't a barren wall in the building.as far as pierre, i havn't trusted a review of his since i read his review of Sing High (god awful) so his interpretation of a dive bar is completely off. after reading his review i expected to walk into an updated classy newsroom..but was surprised to find a complete opposite. just a nice bar with a really friendly staff.the seating at the bar is attractive green tweed swivel stools. (tweed..what is more irish then that?) adjacent to the bar is a comfortable seating area with leather arm chairs and high back booths. the prices are far below what i expected. 8 bucks for a sandwich and fries. completely acceptable. this is certainly going to be my go to bar. i expect many years of being trashed and being sweeped out the front door at 2am. turf thank you for opening, and thank you for the quaint patio for the smokers of the downtown area. much appreciated.after i get my shit together, expect me here weekly, in fact i'll forward my calls to this place like Norm on cheers.5 star review surely in the future. bless you.oh and since i know you will read this, it was nice to meet you Melissa.come on downtown yelpers, this WILL be the bar you are at on a regular.Yay! I'm a fan!Tried out Turf last night for HH.. and even though I arrived exactly at 6pm when it was ending, I saw that the waitress still gave me $0.50 off my Strongbow.I was actually surprised at how busy it was! We were able to finagle some extra chairs for our table from the nice firemen next to us, but at one point throughout the 3 hour visit I had, the whole place was slammed!I don't think that they were expecting such a crowd, so the service was a bit slow until they had another waitress show up. She was probably at home watching sitcoms and pissed she had to come in on her day off, but whatever.I ended up selecting the garden burger, which was delicious and paired with waffle fries. I was really surprised that they had as many veggie options as they did. They also have a veggie boxty, grilled cheese, cheese quesedilla and a couple of salads!I could not resist trying a slice of the whiskey cake. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!! Check the photos for a shot of it :) I swear, it will make your night!!!I will be back, especially since the Roosevelt/Central light rail stop is like 1/4 mile away!!!!!!!!I have been to Turf twice now.. Once for breakfast .. I got your typical English breakfast, cant say it was the best ive ever had, or memorable for that matter, but it was alright. My bloody Mary was good, but I swear the second one only had half a shot of vodka in it.. and if im wrong I am sorry, but I could only taste Mary mix. As my friend put it, the bartender was a "charisma vacuum".. and yes, I didn't catch his name, but he wasn't cool at all. They had various sports teams playing on all the TV's, which is great if youre into that. Second time I came I was with a group of extremely inebriated people.. and I FELL ASLEEP at the bar. I did not get kicked out, so 2 cool points for that.. I still cannot believe myself and how I got away with that I do not know. Either way, I remember a lot of weird shit going on, and everyone I saw, for the most part, was laughing. I have nothing bad to say about Turf, but I also have nothing to rave about. If you're hungry or want a drink and are in this neighborhood, try it out for yourself, and try to stay awake. Its a little embarrassing when you don't.I'm at Turf pretty often.  I never order food there.   On more than one occasion I have ordered Pizza Hut, walked across the street to pick it up, and proceeded to eat it while sitting on the Turf patio.  This, for me, is not a culinary destination.  Its my neighborhood bar.  The fact that they allow my friends to do things like bring in outside food (we have also brought in Pasta Bar...) is one of the reasons I love this place.  They are willing to turn an eye to all of my friends' ridiculous antics.  Jonie knows us and always takes care of us, whether it be by refilling our drinks without having to ask or turning on the DBacks game for us.  (She is by FAR the best bartender there).  The drinks are cheap and the bar stools are the most comfortable of all time.During First Fridays its fun because it actually fills up with people and feels like a bar in some city with a thriving downtown.  Other Fridays you may just find my friends and I square dancing to whatever live band they have playing that week.  It all depends.  I don't think you can really go into Turf expecting it to be one way or another (Irish pub, sports bar, restaurant...) because it is whatever you want it to be.  It's a space to gather and catch up with friends, however you define that.  So if you are ever looking for me you can find me tucked into one of their bar stools drinking a rum and diet.One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry.  Went there today with Jacqui and Dave.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so.The fish fry was perfect!  Not too much batter on the fish and it was perfectly crisp.  If you've ever had fried fish with so much batter that it doesn't all get cooked and you're left with soggy batter then you know what I'm talking about.Regular steak fries.  Great atmosphere.OH and they do comedy on Mondays.  I'll be performing Monday November 9th :}* Now that the weather has cooled here in AZ, I can look back on the Roasting HeatFest that was summer and comment on some of the more enjoyable moments... *It is Saturday afternoon.  It is hot.  There is time before the Dbacks game.  Where should we go?  Hey, how 'bout the Turf!?  And so starts the afternoon/evening in Phoenix...I am an Irish girl, and have a soft spot in my heart for Irish pubs.  The first time I visited the Turf (randomly in the morning after a HUGE breakfast... too early to do any real damage) I knew I wanted to come back.First off, we were able to secure a great parking spot right around the corner and in the shade, too.  Score!  Be aware that the parking spaces are metered, so bring quarters and keep an eye on the time.  Nobody likes a parking ticket (no, I didn't get one).The Turf has two things near and dear to my heart.  Comfortable bar stools and purse hooks.  Oh, and the fact that the staff is friendly, the prices are fair and the food is good doesn't hurt, either.Boddington's on tap?  Why yes!  Those were paired with fish & chips with steak fries (to which the vinegar was liberally applied).  For some reason the bartender ended up with an 'extra' Hoegaarden that he gave to us as well (nice!).Too bad the Turf Bar isn't closer to my corner of the world - I think it would be a fun place for Happy Hour.  Well, there is always next baseball season!"AY! HAAAAYYYYYYYY!! DUUUUDE. Where arrr youuu maaan! come to Turf me an Anthoneee are draaankin!" my brother slurred into the telephone. "what? where are you?" I said confused and mildly entertained.   "TURFFFF!" he replied overly enthusiastically "We been drinkin' all morning duuude!" ensuing giggles and faint slurred speech is heard through the receiver as he and Anthony chortle with one another and assumedly forget they were on the phone. "Hello?....uhh Hello?" I respond after a few moments ignored on the opposite end.  "HEY YO BOB!!!" a sloppy sounding anthony gargles into the phone, "Wherrre arrr yoo's! gedduh fugg down heer!"   "YEAYUH GET DOWN HERE!!" Justin echoes beamingly from the background.    I exhale a deep sigh, realizing how much liquor I'm gonna need to tolerate their company, "Dude, it's like 3 in the afternoon, you guys sound trashed..." I half heartedly say, to which they respond with giggling and more entreaties for my presence, "Okay I'll be there in 15."   When I stepped foot inside the Turf Bar, after enjoying a leisurely bikeride in the winter sunshine, I spot Justin and Anthony bellied up to the bar. They were unmistakable, and belligerently drunk, after a morning spent in various Irish bars in the downtown area. I cautiously walk over to them surveying the interior- mostly deserted except for a bemused barkeep and a few disinterested patrons enjoying a beer battered brunch of some sort. I strolled up behind them removing my wayfarers and smile, as I clasped their shoulders, they greeted me with the vivacity that only an overtly imbibed brother and good friend can. I could smell the stale reek of alcohol on them from a few feet away.  What followed was far too many rounds of liquor, and beer that could've pleased Andre the giant. We were warned by the bar tender to ease up on the profanity, my brother forgot to tip him, and Anthony rode on my bike handel bars most of the way home until Justin leapt at him T-boning the bike and flinging him onto the ground, they both laughed till they were red in the face. All in all I have to thank the Turf Bar for an interesting sunday afternoon that ended in my brother and his friend passed out on my front lawn and a brand new pair of my clothes with permanent grass and mud stains on them after angrily wrestling my brother into submission.

This place is great for burgers & steaks. A friendly atmosphere with great service.Add the salad & soup bar for under $4pp. Lipton Tea-nice & strong.Steak was tender & juicy cooked to perfection and baked potato was great too.Strange how I only see seniors here but they know a great meal & great deal when they see one!!This place has taught me not to judge a book by it's cover.  The first time I came here two years ago I was seated and ordered then went to wash my hands before the food came.  I was so appalled by the condition of the restrooms I cancelled my order and walked out.  It was horrendous!!  The filthiest bathroom I've *ever* seen with the most bizarre decor.  Prior to that I had never walked out of a restaurant...and I'm not even that picky really.  Ever since then this place has been an inside joke between my husband and I.  He's always teasing me and threatening to take me to Dessy B's.  Went yesterday 11-22-15 at 4PM for dinner.  The place is in bad shape, TBH.  The parking lot desperately needs to be re-paved...it's all uneven and the lines have faded from the spaces.  They have been filling the pot holes with kitty litter.  There's one right out front if you want to take a look.  The weeds out front are out of control and it looks like they fired their landscaper long ago.  The inside looks really dated, worn, and the cleanliness is questionable. I didn't go to the bathroom this time out of fear that I would lose my appetite.  I'd rather spend the night in a haunted house alone than go in that bathroom again.  $55.53 got us a filet steak dinner, a NY steak dinner, two soft drinks, and cajun cheese fries.    Both of our dinners came with one trip to the salad bar.  I thought the salad bar was going to be some wilted iceberg and a bottle of ranch by the looks of the place but I was pleasantly surprised with the salad bar.   Most things were fresh and they had some things I didn't expect like ice cream, pound cake, a taco bar, quesadillas, soup, and fried chicken.  If I ever go back I think I'll just do the bar because by itself it's $8.99 and pretty much worth it, IMO.  I fed my boy a couple pieces of cantaloupe from the bar and they didn't hassle me about it.  The cajun cheese fries were quite tasty and came out piping hot.  They dusted them with cajun seasoning and poured some neon cheesy goodness on them.  I had the 10 oz. filet steak dinner special for $28.99.  Kinda pricey but it was the third best steak I've ever had.  It was thick, cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  My potato was only partially cooked and I pulled a huge raw potato-iceberg out of the middle of it.  Didn't bother me much and wasn't worth complaining about.  Husband was truly irritated with his $18.99 New York Steak dinner.  He asked for medium rare and it came out more like medium-well.  He found it pretty tough although he really enjoyed his potato which was cooked perfectly. I'd be really surprised if this place was open in 2017.  I enjoyed it because it reminded me of places back home in Tennessee but it seems to be on its last legs.  Good luck and God speed, Dessy B's.  I hope you make it.

Tandoori TimesVolume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  Dateline 7 May 2009Scottsdale, Arizona    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."I am remiss in not writing my review of our dinner Tandoori Times a little sooner.In my defense, my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the background music for the belly dancer and I was unable to concentrate on the screen long enough to write a coherent sentence (at least I think that's why I can't write a coherent sentence:)The Beautiful Carin and I met the utterly delightful Jim and Audrey W. for dinner at Tandoori Times last Friday evening.I keep saying it, but one of the things I like about Yelp is actually meeting and getting to know real people in "meat world", as opposed to only getting to know someone online.It really gets down to the art of dining...pleasant conversation with convivial company, good food and drink, in an interesting setting. We had all of those things Friday evening, and more!We also had Indian food at Tandoori Times! I love Indian and Pakistani food. I play squash and I got to know Indian and Pakistani food from the kitchens of the wives of some of my squash buddies...incredible meals and incredible hospitality...we could all take lessons:)We started with cocktails, 4 kinds of Naan (the Onion Naan was incredible...crusty and crunchy on the outside, literally filled with chunks of soft, savory/sweet roasted onion:)Appetizers included Aloo Tikki, a potato pancake with gravy (and you know how much I like gravy:)...good stuff. We passed things around, family style.We ordered dinner as we enjoyed our conversations. It was great to get to know Jim and Audrey better and I'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served (really wonderful food...Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Masala, Lamb Korma and Kahari Shrimp...everything perfectly prepared, spicy and flavorful). The service was warm and friendly:)All of the food was served family style with rice and more Naan to sop up the gravies and sauces...so good!Then came the belly dancing and music...there may also have been a fire engine parade and a Boeing 777 landing in the parking lot...it was so loud we'll never really know. The sound system was really cranked for the lovely belly dancer and it was fun to watch  her for the first 15 minutes or so. But after an hour or so, the fun of watching belly dancing kind of wore off, we wanted to get back to conversation (even though the belly dancer was brandishing swords and candles...it was a little like watching NASCAR...you don't want to see the wreck, but you don't want to miss it either. I'm happy to report that nothing was cut off or burned during the performance:)Sadly, conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the fact that someone had turned the amplifiers up to 11.Jim would ask me "what do you do for a living" and I would answer "I sold my motorcycle in 1978", with a smile, and he would look puzzled:)Audrey and Carin were having similar difficulties...it's just hard to have quiet chat when the background music is up around 107 decibels:)That said, we truly enjoyed the evening with our new friends!And we really enjoyed the food at Tandoori Times...I just recommend calling ahead to ask about the belly dancing, and bring the ear plugs if you go on belly dancing nights:)The Atlanta Yelp Empress, Kathleen M, came to town this week to help out with the Yelp Rocks event, so since she's a fan of ethnic cuisine, I decided we'd try Tandoori Times.  It is kind of hidden in the shopping center - I suggest they get some better signage.  But we're smart girls, and we found it... it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table, we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!).While our service was attentive enough, our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different.  For example, when we ordered the chicken tikka masala, he suggested we order chicken chile instead.  No thanks!  And when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish), he suggested something else too.  We stuck to our guns though.  We were girls that knew what we wanted!In addition to the dishes above, we shared a house salad, rice, and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven).  We would've ordered an appetizer of sorts (Ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that.  (Kind of odd, huh?!)  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything although I added a lot of hot sauce - it didn't have much kick without it.  Gotta love that hot sauce!I really enjoy Indian food and don't eat it as often as I'd like.  It seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating... I don't get it!  Regardless, I'd come back to Tandoori Times in a heartbeat.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service, decent ambiance, and moderate prices.  Thanks to Kathleen M for trying something new with me!I have to start with the garlic nan. My favorite part of indian cuisine is the nan. We oredered 2 orders of garlic nan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt. Completly ruined the meal.  The Tiki Masala and Vindaloo were both good but for the price...I can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else. The prices were really over the top. You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one "small plate," nan, rice, and one drink cost us. We were both just full but had I been with a guy or my step father, we would have needed more food for 2. The atmosphere is great, the place looks really clean. The nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect, I still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else. I had more reasonable meals at the best indian cuisine restaurants in San Francisco!Our server was good, however, after our "small plate" she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals. She did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask. With all the sauces on the meals, mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer.Won't be back. Just not worth the price.

Stopped here for a bite to eat before the Holiday weekend, had a great time! My son and I enjoyed a nice meal together, with great service and good food. I ordered the pasta with chicken and it unfortunately was different from what I remember, so I am not sure if they changed their recipe or if my taste buds have changed. It was a little dry and not as flavorful and spicy as last time, but it was decent. My son of course had the chicken fingers and french fries, he was a happy camper! Their baked potato soup and bread is very good, I was told by my 5 yr old we have to go back every day just so he can eat the bread lol! Will definitely try some of the fan favorites next time and look forward to another interaction with the polite and smiling staff. Thanks guys!

Sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and live jazz music some evenings. The large building that backs up to the canal was most recently home to the Calico Cow. The floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Rat Pack favorites.  Guests can now enjoy delicious house-made New England clam chowder and perfectly seasoned, slow cooked prime rib accompanied by live jazz or in a private dining room with a Western theme. When it cools off, I'm sure the patio will be a popular spot!They have been open for one week and I've been there 3 times. Here are some of the things I've tried so far:The clam chowder ($6) was a real highlight: loaded with littleneck clams, Yukon potatoes, fresh dill and double cream. This soup is not thick and corn-starchy, which usually prevents me from even considering it. The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail ($11) is poached in Riesling and served with a cocktail sauce spiked with cognac. The steak bruschetta ($12) lines crostini with thinly sliced rare filet mignon, gorgonzola and a balsamic reduction and a pairs them with a side of diced tomato, onion and basil to be applied at your own discretion.The prime rib ($18, $20 or $22 depending on the cut size) is perfectly seasoned and not too fatty.The chicken lahvosh ($16) is a generous serving of 2 breasts, pounded and encrusted in lahvosh crackers. Served with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms and tomato in a chardonnay sauce. The night I had this there was not much sauce. I hear that is not the norm. There was so much chicken, though, I took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad. It was even better the second day!!Menu items are a la carte, so if you want potatoes or veggies you'll have to add those at $5 a pop but they are served family style and there is enough for at least 3 people per serving. I've tried the whipped Yukon potato that is creamy and buttery - just like mom makes! But, watch out for the potato au gratin: the table may fight over this scrumptious blend of potato, green onion and bacon loaded with Jack cheese! At lunchtime, there are a few more salads to choose from and sandwiches, burgers and wraps averaging $7-9. Sandwiches are served with your choice of garlic scented fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, salt & vinegar chips cottage cheese or coleslaw. I had the roast beef au jus with garlic fries and would have liked to see a little more meat on my sandwich and a little more salt in the au jus. I hear great things about the blackened mahi-mahi so that's next on my list!The owners are not new to the industry, having previously owned Jackson's in Flagstaff. A perfect match for Sunnyslope: a close family team that loves community. You'll find them making the rounds in the dining room greeting patrons and striking up conversation. And, while an upscale dining experience, there's no pretension to be found here. I wish these guys the best of luck and welcome them to the neighborhood! It's so great to have yet another choice for dining out in Sunnyslope!Prior to Sunnyslope's Art Walk, I decided a drink was in order.  After all, what's the point of walking without drinking.  Otherwise, I would be driving the Art Walk and then they would have to change the name to Art Drive and no one would go.  So Central Grille with it's generous parking fit the bill.We sat on the patio which is quite nice, once the table with the screaming brat exited.  By then, I really needed that drink.  They have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of house wine, $3.50 well drinks and import or draft beer.  The house wines were not appealing to me, but all of their wine prices are quite reasonable, although the by-the-glass selection is limited.We ordered two appetizers at only $5 each.  However, they were small, so definitely order more than one unless you're the girl that never eats in front of your guy.  I'm not that girl.  We had the artisan cheese plate and the fig jam crostini.  The cheese plate included a blue cheese, a goat cheese, and a third soft cheese (some kind of cream cheese).  The cranberry-walnut bread was a nice touch, even if the cheeses were somewhat ordinary.  The fig jam crostini was so crazy delicious though with carmelized onion and melted gorgonzola as well.My husband wanted dinner, but since I didn't think there would be sofas along the art walk, we opted to have only an entree, no side dishes.  I went with the stuffed salmon.  The stuffing was made with crab meat.  Unfortunately, the salmon was undercooked around the stuffing.  Had I been resting after dinner instead of walking, I might have actually sent it back, something I rarely do.The happy hour portion of service was actually a little slow considering the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but our server was friendly.  All in all, an enjoyable time.If you are ever having a bad day and want to get treated like the president, head on over to Central Grille. Seriously. Both times I have been here (Once for Sunnyslope Art Walk and once for Happy Hour with a girlfriend) the entire staff is friendly and extremely attentive. They will sit down and chat with you, bring you extra bread and are always right there with refills. The eggplant appetizer is an absolute winner. I think there are about ten pieces of delicious fried eggplant with mozzarella and marinara sauce... all for $7..I also enjoyed the cheese plate. It is $5 on happy hour special and comes with three big slices of cheese (I believe there was a blue, Gouda and one other type) along with bread. They serve Iily Coffee and Espresso and it is a strong cup! Pair it with one of the really, REALLY tasty desserts! I cannot remember the name of what I had, but I think it was called something layered. It was similar to tiramisu and you got your own side of warmed chocolate to drizzle over it. My mouth is watering thinking about it!!The inside is kind of a tamed down version of Durant's, but the outside patio is amazing. They have cute lights up and wicker chairs with comfy seat pads. When the weather is nice you can sit out there for hours! As a bonus, you can hear the live music from the patio even though they play inside. They also have a large variety of Happy Hour appetizers for $5... My friend really enjoyed her tacos! The $5 House Wine and $3.50 well drinks are also an awesome way to compliment your tasty appetizers. I'm super stoked that Central Grille is right off of the canal because I can ride my bike there (its a 2 mile ride from my house - score!).  I love this new addition to the 'Slope!Central Grille has been slow to grow on me, but it's getting there. I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a full meal from Central Grille, but I have had many drinks and appetizers from there. The staff is always friendly even laughing at some of the rowdy subject matter from conversations with friends. I feel that they're aiming for a Rat Pack lounge  type of vibe in the bar area, but they're just a bit off when it comes to the music. One evening there was a little old lady playing the piano, another time it was a guy strumming a guitar and singing very boring music. The bar area would be a cool spot to hang all night but the music kills it at times.I have tried a few of the appetizers which were a-ok, but one thing that was ordered that was AMAZING was the au gratin potatoes. YUM! I highly suggest you try them. Try them by themselves! You won't be sorry.I hope to visit Central Grille again soon to try their other menu offerings

OK so I made a mistake...tried a new place prior to checking out Yelp!!! Reason being as we knew there was a sushi place around the corner from our house however could not think of the name nor locate it on google. So we said what the hell, we are here let's check it out. When we walked in the place was empty, we were the only customer. Hmmmm? OK so was around two o clock so maybe the lunch rush had passed? First time dining here so I ask which is your top seller boba tea since they have a variety of flavors of boba smoothie and teas. Her response was "No "No" you order what you like??? Are you freaking kidding me? Wow...I ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll, crab, avocado, shrimp tempura, cucumber. I asked that they leave out the cucumber. What a disappointment, the amount of crab was almost non existent, did not taste or see any avocado, tasted like a plain white rice roll with crunchy flakes. No flavor and they were skimpy with the eel sauce which would have helped with flavor if I could have dunked it in some. I also ordered a strawberry splash smoothie boba, this was good! It was not a comfortable experience, we were the only customer and the two ladies working sat at a table staring at us the whole time. It was ridiculous! Beyond insane staring! Have no clue why either? Almost to the point of being offensive. I am a customer not a criminal, no need to stare me down every bite, every sip. Maybe they made a bet on which one of us would throw up the nasty specialty roll they call sushi first? lol No sushi chef on duty, was a server lady and a lady that took forever making our two rolls. This place is bad in many ways! The only savior is the boba smoothie was good. That alone is not enough to ever get me to come back. The bad: Service Food QualityPortionOffensive staring from staff while dining.The good: Boba Smoothie We could not wait to check the Yelp rating and knew it would not be good after we experienced what we did dining here. Never...Never...Never again!!! Please do not waste your time or money here, I speak the truth with no exaggeration. It is truly horrid! Pictures of our visit are attached, notice the smiles are prior to taking a bite. Looks ok, but taste bad.I will go without sex before I eat here again!!!

I think this place was fantastic.  We went here to watch the penguin game and ended up eating, I'm glad we did.  We got the Chicken and Waffles Sandwich and the Roasted Reuben, two things I would highly recommend and get again.  The Reuben meat wasn't shaved but cured and pulled, something I've never experienced on a Reuben and wish they were always like that!  The Chicken and Waffles sandwich was solid also and the spicy syrup dip set it off.  TVs from every angle made sure no matter where I was I had a good view of the game.  For all the highlights I just gave you, they all pale in comparison to the eclectic vast collection of beer.  Ghost Pepper beer, stouts, IPAs, light, heavy you name it they got it.  You can get a 3 beer sampler they offer and try to fit in as many tastes as you can before you inevitably would need carried out.  Some beers boast a whopping 14% alcohol content so the buzz hits quick.  They are supposed to have a different themed nights every night of the week and from what I hear trivia is a must go night, I just might have to.  They had a really cool second bar that I didn't get to sit at and some beers and food I still really wanna try making this place a for sure revisit until I've had my fill. If you're in the Greenfield area of Pittsburgh I highly recommend this place for dinner and a drink.  I also gotta say the crowd and the staff are really cool and everyone just mingles and talks and hangs out, I loved it.  Will be back.The best way to describe this place is that it is a laid back neighborhood bar.  I feel bad for Hough's, I consider them being located in an underappreciated neighborhood that doesn't seem to get much love from the rest of the city.  However we not need worry about Hough's they know how to hold their own, that is for sure.When you walk in you are greeted by a wide open space that doesn't necessarily feel like a bar.  You do see a great big bar, but that is not all you see.  There are tables throughout the place that lets you know that you don't have to be seated at the bar in order to get service here.  But if you choose to do so, it is a much better experience.The bartenders are friendly and charismatic.  They greet you with a smile and ask how you are doing before going into their routine of telling you the specials.  They don't mind taking a moment and sit around and chat with you, that is when they aren't busy pouring orders which never seem to stop coming for them.I only came here to take advantage of the atmosphere and the multitude of beers they have on tap.  I can't talk to the food since I didn't order any type of bites to eat.  But I can guarantee that I will return to try a few of the items on the menu.I visited Hough's with two friends for dinner this Sat. at around 7pm.  When they wanted to get together for dinner, I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards, and Hough's stood out for having solid reviews and being close to their place.  I suggested it, and they were game, so we decided to check it out, since none of us had visited previously.As others have mentioned, they have a legitimately huge beer menu with something for everyone--including non-beer drinkers.  Each of us decided to go with a cider, with two of us trying the Mackenzie black cherry, and the other trying the Magners pear.  I originally wanted to try the Thistly Cross blackberry-pear, but they were out of it, so I tried the black cherry.  It didn't disappoint--it had a deep, rich flavor, and was on the sweeter side, but not overly so (like Woodchuck, etc.).  The price, at $5/bottle, seemed reasonable as well.For food, two of us ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich ($11), and the other ordered the monte cristo ($11).  The chicken and waffles sandwich is a unique take on this classic brunch dish, and is available at any time at Hough's.  It was extremely filling, but was a bit bland without the syrup.  However, the addition of the syrup solved the blandness issue in short order.  My friend who had the monte cristo said that while it was decent, it was a bit too homogeneously rich and fatty in taste.  Although the menu stated that it had horseradish mayo, which would have cut the richness, she told me she couldn't taste it.  Each of our sandwiches came with a side (we ordered fries, tater tots, and a salad), as well.Service was a bit on the slow side, but was friendly nonetheless.  At the time of our visit, there were only one or two other tables full, as well as some people at the bar.  Unlike other "trendier" bars, there was no loud music, so between that and the sparse crowd, the atmosphere was very conducive to carrying on a conversation, which I appreciated.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Hough's, and would recommend it if you're looking for a low-key bar environment with a great selection of beer and decent food.

Review Text :
I know there is a danger in going to restaurants on their first night, but all things considered I think Moira delivered. The red miso soup was incredibly flavorful, and plentiful at $6 for a crock that is easily large enough for 4 or more to share. I snuck a few bites of Christine and Myles' ika sansei squid salad which I enjoyed and would order on a future visit. We ordered several rolls and I found each to be well rolled and the fish fresh. We tried a Fuji, Philly, and Sakura and each one was great. The other rolls ordered at our table looked equally amazing and I cannot wait to try more of their specialty rolls. (That's not to say the "traditional" roll we ordered wasn't good, it was, but they have a lot of really inventive specialty rolls). The specialty rolls are reasonably priced in a range of $10-13. We did order from the hot kitchen (yaki itame) which I thought was just your basic Chinese dish, with basic flavors. With so many sushi options I'm not sure that I would order the hot dishes regularly. One thing that I do think they do well is portions, the speciality rolls, soup, and entrees were all well sized. My husband sampled a karma martini, which he really liked. They serve the martinis out of the shaker table side, which is always a nice touch, but they should think about using smaller shakers because the regular shakers are slightly cumbersome in the tight space and resulted in some inconsistent pours at our table. One of the big hits of the night were their sake bombers- for $9 you get a 22 oz Asahi and mini carafe of sake. Three drinks can easily be made of this. The atmosphere was fun, with blue and red lighting throughout and exposed brick. The space has a warehouse feel to it and executes it well in comparison to other places. There is a large sushi bar, as well as various tables in the long, skinny space. I found it to be somewhat loud, but could easily be cozy on a slower night. Although the chairs look like they may not be comfortable, I loved them! Our service was a little off, but I attribute that to first night jitters. Our party of 8 ordered a lot of sushi and when the rolls arrived they were on one large platter that was difficult for us to share at a long table. This was confounded by the fact that we had to try to figure out what each roll was since our server wasn't sure. (Granted it's the first night and the place was packed, I assume that this will come with time). Even though the service was obviously hectic because of opening night, the owner Linda was more than gracious and was running around making sure everything was running as smoothly as possible and patrons were happy.  I would love to see Moira offer a Happy Hour, I'm not sure if they do but I didn't see any information about it.  I anticipate that you will find us at Moira often! Thank goodness for sushi downtown, now all we need is a tapas place!3 stars= A-OKRed miso soup was lukewarm, ehhhh, whateverSalmon nigiri cuts were subpar- no equal veining of fat lines... but still tender!  Though I would have preferred the veining....Toro was excellent!Rolls were good, but the rice was a bit on the dry sideService was excellent, but the sushi did take awhile (I assume this is because of the new-ness of the place)I did LOVE the fact that they had fresh wasabi (extra charge and it was pureed)I did LOVE that they had Vietnamesse iced coffee and sweet green tea!!So yes, I will be back.  Hopefully the sushi chefs will have more experience.  Still a few bugs to be worked out, but the owner was awesome and I have high hopes!Rice was very grainy, fresh wasabi wasn't chopped wasabi and was charged extra for, no uni (not like one should even consider eating uni here), above average prices, all sushi came out at once, rolls with weird looking and tasting vegetables like marinated peppers, and weird tuna tataki roll.Miso soup: There is no seaweed in it.Salmon was ok but nothing spectacular. One of the rolls had lemon on top of the Salmon. For me there's nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it.Toro: Mediocre at best. I've had regular Bluefin that was superior to this over-priced Bluefin Belly (11$ for Nigiri).The Vietnamese Ice coffee, while good and flavorful, was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant."Meh" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. Miso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it. Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here. Good sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant. The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish). Wait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room). I could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the "food" review.Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! Saba...not bad...Sweet Shrimp....foul tastingToro.....couldn't even bite through itA good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..Drinks:Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restroomsAll in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!I hate to write a review of a place on the day it gets ROTD, but why not? I'll bask in your glory, Kristin S. Moira is hot. Like, super sexy. This is the kind of place you take a date to seal the deal. Sexy decor, sexy lights, sexy sushi chefs (if that's what they are called?), sexy bathrooms, sexy metal bead things that lead to the bathrooms, sexy music. Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit, so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one. It's easy to tell that the quality of ingredients are above average and super tasty. They have a delish white ale. The HH is awesome and prices in general are fabulous.Words to the single ladies out there, hit up Moira when you are looking for some sexy. Sushi is way less complicated than a man!How did I miss this? I'm the chick that bitches endlessly about the lack of sushi in the downtown/midtown area. Seriously, how.... in the hell.....did I miss this?? Anyway, I love this place. The sushi was fantastic (in my opinion) but then again I'm not some self important sushi snob, so take that for what it's worth. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great. The only complaint I have is the chairs..... who's brilliant idea were those horrible wire chairs. My bony ass was not happy after sitting there for an hour and a half. Whatever, I found a new date spot. The bf was as impressed as I was and since we live so close I'm sure Moira will be in regular rotation.Screw you ZenFirst off you must consume enough sake and beer to warrant a visit to the restroom. That way you can pass through the sexy, cold, metal chains dangling in the hallway door. Reminded me of the beads I had in my bedroom in 5th grade. Yep. Beads. Don't judge. It was the 70s you know!? And the restrooms themselves were fabulous as well. But this isn't a site on reviewing johns so let's get to the good stuff. Immediate greeting. Quick seating. And minutes later...lots of EATING! The gyoza was orgasmic. Thin, crunchy with shrimp and veggies! The mussel appetizer was good, not great, but creamy and hot. Reminds me of Taylor Lautner...muscles, creamy...well you get the picture. We dove into the sushi; tuna, yellowtail, freshwater eel...you know, the standards. All delicious...yellowtail being the best. The rolls, though I don't remember any names were all very good. One in particular was made with soy paper? Is that right? Soy paper? It was a nice break from the seaweed. Soy paper? We spent about $50 a person...worth every penny. The vibe inside on a Monday night was pretty happening I must say. Sexy lighting and great tables along the window. Our server, complete with a big poofy mohawk was fantastic! Wasn't crazy about the chairs. What? Did they recycle some shopping carts?Moira! I want moira you!First, it was that shit-show of a night: First Friday. Where all of suburbia exclaims "Oh, we do have things going on in Phoenix!" Moira was slammed, servers filling and refilling water cups of those who are too cheap to buy drinks, but want to take advantage of Happy Hour.Still, the staff was smiling. They hustled and I had 3 people ask if we'd been helped. When we were seated our sever was jovial, made light of the situation and suggested we order most of our items at once so that we'd get everything promptly. Now, while it wasn't the best sushi I'd ever had (it just wasn't). I am telling you, unequivocally, it was the servers that made my night. At the end of our meal we were approached by another server who made sure we'd had an enjoyable experience. She was extremely sincere and reminded us to come by on Thursdays where the wine is half priced, and the joint is half-filled! : )I don't know how ya'll do it, but you're fucking rockstars!Foodwise: Squid Salad: Generous portionCalamari: DeliciousAvoid:White Blossom roll. I've had a baked scallop roll before. This one...tasted quite funky : /After watching an Indie at the Film Bar, we wanted to find a place to pause for awhile and, lo and behold, Moira Sushi.  Mind you, it was past 9 PM on a Tuesday night.  And I thought it was so awesome that it was still open for those of us who despise going home right after seeing a movie.  The place is so chic, great ambiance, food and service.  It was kinda dead given it was a week day night, but still happening in a quiet sort of way. We ordered various sorts of mouth flavoring bites. Everything was MWAH! Pick something, anything.  You really can't go wrong! It's a good thing I was accompanied by sushi savvy people.

I came here not too long ago to get a quick take-away bite before heading to school. It took me some time to figure out what I was going to buy... I was QUITE indecisive. I wanted to get the freshest, tastiest looking wrap possible to start my studying day off right! On the shelf there werent too many options, but among them there were a couple that looked quite stale and one being out-of-date. I handed it back to the lady at the till, then proceeded to choose. I went for the spicy bean wrap. I was crossing my fingers that I'd be able to handle the amount of spice (yaneverknowright?), and opted for this. I remember it being around the region of 2.95. Took it away, and hopped on the bus. When I finally had my first opportunity to take a nice bite I found out the wrap. was. spiceless. Now when I say spiceless I mean 1. no spicyness 2. no flavour. I paid 3 pounds for essentially a wrap with black beans in it. No salsa, not much else... oh and they said there was cheese in it. WHAT CHEESE??! SO disappointed. Now I don't know whether Henderson's is one of those places that poorly represents vegan/vegetarian food to be bland and tasteless... but I was disappointed. It was a very poor wrap.  I like vegetarian food! Henderson's you gotta represent better! You're gonna give vege food a bad rep, man!

Review Text :
wahoo!! after wantin to fly to ny just for the damn frozen hot chocolate they opened one up @ ceasars!! this means more lv trips! =)so we parked at ceasars and walked toward lv blvd cuz serendipity is rite there u can see on the strip. its this building with lovely pink awnings! loooove it. we went in the place is pretty small but they have indoor/outdoor seating plus a togo line outside.  we got the frozen hot chocolate, a footlong hotdog (we wanted the bachelorette hotdog (FATTER AND EVEN LONGER!! but we ordered wrong....) cheddar cheese burger, and some more desserts!  everything was super yum. the 6 of us girls just dug in! the burger looked PERFECT hannah s. said it looked so perfect it looked fake! hahha hotdog was YUM im not sure if it was NORMAL but i havent had one in awhile so it was great.  it came with a side of sauerkraut, cheese, mustard, relish and onions so u can top to ur hearts content! the hotdog & burger comes with either waffle or sweetpotato fries.  the waffle fries were different...i swear they poured some sugar on them!the frozen hot chocolate is pure heaven. seriously. i took 3  lactase pills so i can enjoy it and it was all worth it! i posted pictures u can see my pills next to the weenie hahha check out my fone next to it too u can see how long the weenie really was!all in all it was a great spot but one bad crappy thing? service is soooo super slow. place is small( for vegas) but took nearly 30min for a seat when no one else was in line at the time and our server my gosh took FOREVER to take our orders and to bring us our food! patience is impossible when u are waitin for chocolate =XI came here in mind for one thing, and one thing only. Frozen Hot Chocolate!!Ordered the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=2GqvSuIZfL0RB7_fqBGcGg). The waitress stuck so many straws in it. She obviously thought that I was going to share. Hah! All mine!! The drink is basically a pre-made hot cocoa drink, blended with ice. In this case, 'double' has ice cream blended in also. Yummy! Except difficult to drink unless it has melted into a light slush.Food here may seem a bit pricey, but the portions are huge!!! And its Vegas anyway, so spend that moneyyyy!stopped by again on this trip! fine fine...i admit we stopped by TWICE!! but only ONCE did we get frozzen hot chocolate! i promise!!!!this time we walked from ballys to serendipity...that is a short walk but please remind urselves it was 115degrees this weekend ( ugh!!!!!!!!!! ) so hannah and i took the death walk here and the wait was 20minutes so we ordered from the TOGO window outside. we both got a frozen hot chocolate in a 16oz for a lil over $8 the 32oz was over $16 i think...the 1oz is good enough...it was sooooooooooooooooo yummmy. chocolatey and delish like the first time around. if ur a firsttimer/newbie i suggest u dine in though because its sooo much prettier then the togo plastic cups!!the second trip here was for us to pick up some frozen hot chocolate milk chocolate, crunch bars, and milk chocolate with almonds & the DIY frozen hot chocolate powder packages!! the chocolates for $2.50 each and the hotcoco was almost 5bucks.seriously all lactose intolerants BEWARE but MAN if im gona indulge in one extremely lactose item its gona be this one!!!!This review is only for the FROZEN CHOCOLATE! I've been to the original Serendipity in New York and I like that restaurant a lot more. There's more character to that place. The one in Vegas is way too orange and pink. I guess it fits with Vegas. I have to admit there's a lot of room here. Very different to the den-like feel of the NY location. My friends and I were at the bar and ordered the frozen hot chocolate. I barely tasted the "hot" part but it was still so good. Maybe it was the 115 degree weather outside or all the walking my friends and I did on the strip but that frozen hot chocolate hit the spot. Frozen blended goodness! It was truly refreshing! 3 of us shared it and we still didn't finish it. It was a huge portion. Love the chocolate shavings! I wish I could have another one right now. MMMM!"I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " With "Ooh La La" by Ronnie Wood & Ronnie Lane playing in the back of my mind as I am writing this review, my experience at Serendipity 3 may have been different had I ordered their frozen hot chocolate that all the other reviewers seem to have enjoyed.  Unfortunately, without yelp by our side for the weekend (I didnt feel that I needed to play $13 for wireless internet when I was on vacation), we could only rely on our waitress.  "I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " We were just there for dessert, and I was definitely not ordering their Golden Opulence Sundae, which was available for $1,000!!  Yes, $1,000!!!  The Golden Opulence Sundae actually holds the Guiness World Record for "most expensive dessert."  O____O.  Yeah, so... No, we did not order that.  We were recommended their "Can't Say 'No' Sundae," which was $14.  It seemed like a good idea at the time compared to the 1k sundae.  The sundae cup was glued down to the plate with chocolate fudge.  It had two bananas, peanut butter chocolate cake, two scoops of coffee and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream (which was 50% of the sundae) and a cherry on top. "I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " It was definitely not worth $14.  I could have easily made myself a better sundae than the one that we had.  "I wish that I knew what I know now...."  I would have probably ordered their frozen hot chocolate and probably would have been a lot happier leaving there.  Not sure if I would return, I'll consider it.... but Meh!  There are just way too many choices in Vegas for dessert that I'm not sure Serendipity 3 deserves a second chance...."I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. ""What do you want to do in Vegas Marthie?""I don't really care what we do. Well... I do want to go to Serendipity! :)"Finally, and I mean FINALLY! I've been wanting to go to Serendipity's ever since I watched that movie Serendipity and that was circa ten years ago. Now that they have  a location in Vegas, my wish finally came true. This pink/orange, girl decorated restaurant makes you feel like a little girl inside. It's decorated mostly white and pink with all these fancy plates that make you feel like you should have some tea and crumpets. Well, not all of the plates, just some of them. There was also a bar in the corner, and from the looks of it, it's a full bar? I never knew Serendipity's swung that way. Any way, luckily part of my group went there early to get us a table and they only waited 15 minutes. (If you don't want to wait, you can also order to go!) I expected it to be much longer but I'll settle with 15 minutes any day to come here. The place was packed and it took a while to get our orders in, aka the waitress took a while to get to us. A bunch of us hadn't eat all day (it was 4:30pm) and were ready to devour our own plates although the prices here are pretty hefty. I decided on the...Summer Bries. It's a sandwich, an open faced one (aka only one slice of Raisin Pumpernickel bread), with turkey, cranberry mayo, brie cheese (melted), and crunchy-fresh apples. Can I tell you something? It was DEEEE-LISH! :D It made me so full that I could barely get out of my sit (or maybe that's just me since I hadn't eaten all day). And it also came with a side of cheese potato chips that were quite cheesy.. seemed like parmesan cheese I believe. That $16 sandwich was well worth my money.And for dessert, well for the appetizer, a group of us shared the famous.. drum roll please... FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE! That sucker was so hot (not literally) that it was oozing out of the cup. Mmmm, whip cream, with a frothy, creamy, milk chocolate. It gave me some shivers, as well as a brain freeze. (I couldn't keep myself from drinking it all! Too bad I didn't have my own, because I would have devoured that sucker.)What a wonderful time we had, my frozen hot chocolate and sandwich, and me. My Serendipity wish finally came true and I'm so happy it did :D (Cue Happily Ever After Music)We were SUPER hungry after the LV Rock N' Roll Half Marathon, so we decided to make a pit stop before heading to the airport.  It was about 2:15, and there was still a 30 minute wait for indoor seating.  We opted to sit outdoors since we wouldn't have to hurry to catch our flight.  There were heat lamps, so we figured we could deal with the cold.  One of our heat lamps wasn't on at all, and when we told one of the workers, they said..."oh no..its on"...and then walked away.  Ummm...if we can touch it, its not on.  They finally came out to check it when someone else complained.I wanted their famous frozen hot chocolate, but since I was sitting outside in the cold, I figured a regular hot chocolate would be better( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/UVGh4r1nVItdL2eqcm8sXQ/l ).  And then I ordered a cheeseburger with waffle fries( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ayHA76-OUgfSRC6mHswuMA/l ) to fill up my hungry belly.  The portions here are quite large!  I ate about half my burger and then started picking it apart to eat the meat.  The bun was fluffy and fresh, and the fries were nice and crispy.  Except for the minor heat lamp incident, the service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I'll have to come back again for that famous frozen hot chocolate!From the last Yelp-Elite party in San Francisco, I was chatting with one of my favorite Yelpers and she gave me few places to go in Las Vegas. One of the places she suggested was Serendipity 3, which is located at Caesars Palace. The New York restaurant is one of my personal bookmarked businesses. Until she mentioned it, I didn't know there was also one in Las Vegas. So after I dropped off my luggage at my stay at the Platinum Hotel, which is only a "long" block away from Caesars Palace and the lively Las Vegas strip, I was excited and hurried my ass to Serendipity at Caesars Palace. The restaurant is cute and crowded, but the bar was empty and had the crazy football game between the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals showing on their huge television. Looking at the huge menu, the restaurant serves your typical American food. But my main target was definitely-the Frozen Hot Chocolate with chopped peanut butter cups and clouds of whipped cream for $10.00. Since I was at the bar, the popular frozen treat was prepared at the bar and came really fast and presented in front of my face. I was shocked on how my treat was made with the pretty design and the liquid flooded all over my dish. One sip of my first Frozen Hot Chocolate, I was blown-away on how sinful this treat was. I was enjoying my frosty treat while watching the football game and watching the agile waitresses and gifted chefs working hard in the kitchen. My treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?userid=HYQoxBC1y1DGPq6pGP09TwThe treat may contain 10,000 calories, but you'll need it after burning off all those calories walking on the overpass to get across the street and into the next casinoRemember, get the popular frozen treat at the bar. You'll get it quicker. My Visa was accepted here and picked the right time of the day to enjoy my treat. Serendipity is the "Real Deal!"Eating at Serendipity in Vegas is kind of like being in a giant's land because all the plates and cups are so big. Also everything is amazingly pink so if you don't like that color you might want to stay away.While the menu is traditional American and none too adventurous if you're looking for an easy, albeit kind of pricey, lunch I recommend their delicious waffle fries alongside a Summer Bries sandwich. This sandwich is made of turkey, apples, cranberry mayo and brie served open faced on raisin pumpernickel bread. It is as good as it sounds.Also good to know - they have sweet potato fries if you're a fan of them like me. Although here the waffle fries are better tasting I think. And of course, you can read the rest of the reviews to find out about desserts. As for me I went for the 25 cent gumball on my way out. ;-)On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. So, we ordered: - Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA - ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. - Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.FOOD: i ordered the blue cheese and bacon hamburger...sorry yelpers i'm not sure what the exact name is.  The burger was pretty tasty, the hamburger was juicy and all the flavors mixed in perfectly.  The bun looked really cool, but i thought it was a tad too dry. I also enjoyed their sweet potato fries..these are a must try!  the burger was 16.50.  i wouldnt say it was worth the price, but then again it's vegas, so u can't expect cheap prices. Frozen Hot chocolate: we ordered the smallest one.. it was around 9.75.  let me tell u, this taste MUCH better when u order it in the restaurant.  Last time, I ordered it from their To Go area and it wasn't as tasty.  I love how it taste more like REAL chocolate and not filled with the heavy milk flavor.Service: SUPER SLOW!!! our waitress was pretty lame.  she never checked up on us and passed our table at least 5 times before she took our order.  all in all, the food was pretty good but didn't outweigh the high prices and slow service to be given 4 starsThis is a review for the To-Go menu of Serendipity. For those that are too cheap to pay a $15-20 dollar tab for Serendipity's dine in menu, there is an alternative, somewhat inexpensive To Go menu. Here you will find hot dogs, pizzas, among other things, including their famous "Frozen Hot Chocolate."For $8.50, the Frozen Hot Chocolate was rather unimpressive. Although the price isn't too bad upon comparing it with other places on the strip, it just doesn't make sense to order a cup of chocolate powder, whole milk, and ice for that high of a price. Knowing that I could have refilled my Fat Tuesday margarita for $9.00 made buying a Frozen Hot Chocolate without splitting it impossible. With this in mind, it's my recommendation that you split this drink with a friend or boo. This way you'll get the chance to try this famous drink without feeling too jipped. Happy drinking in Vegas! (of Frozen Hot Chocolate, OF COURSE.)People know the BF and I are very respectful and appreciative of restaurant staff so it will probably come to a surprise that our experience was so upsetting that I will make sure they lose more business than just mine.  I will pay for my friends to have a dessert on us somewhere else if they promise not to set foot at a Serendipity. Sure, I'm treated like you didn't need my patronage, but you sure as fuck don't know if I would have been treated with respect I would come back every year and bought myself a stupid Gold Opulence or wanted to throw a Serendipity party....even if I didn't throw mad money around, every customer is a valuable person and valuable advertising.So I have out of town visitors from Seattle here who had Serendipity on their list. I call to inquire about closing time and they said they close at midnight....then she adds, but that depends on how much wait there is. I asked what she meant and all she did was repeat herself. Whatever, we had plenty of time so hung up and walked over there. We got through one of the side doors and standing in the dining hall was a bit confused...we stood there and no one greeted us. So we figured maybe the hostess was on the other side and walked there to inquire about where to sit because I don't want to mess up their zoning system and sit myself where I'm not supposed to. She said dining room seating was closed but that the to-go station was still open for frozen hot chocolate so she said to go ahead and go to that line. At this point it was 11:28pm....they said they close at midnight.As soon as we got in line there was a guy who decides to give the couple in front of us a sign that says its end of the line. He said "oh sorry, but they're the last people". We were already standing there before hand.  I explained how we've been standing there and that the hostess told us to line up and that it was okay to still order to go. He then goes "No, it's closed and I already told them that they're the last people and they're gonna get free frozen hot chocolate". Seriously? You can't let 3 more ( paying ) customers get chocolate? I really didn't care about the asshole giving the people in front of us free. I just wanted my guests to be able to get all they want out of their vacation. I was willing to pay and still hold the fucking sign.  "The line has to end somewhere and it ends with them". He was very high and mighty about it. He looked like he ENJOYED turning us away. The hostess told us to come order since we were standing for quite a while waiting for table service. We didn't want to argue with someone who wouldn't budge from being the way they are. No one else around us looking remotely like they wanted to line up, we were already there and were just 3 people looking to pay for some premade fucking drink 30 minutes before closing...it's not like it's much trouble.  My BF is non violent, but he wanted to punch this guy in the nuts. I told him it's too kind. Now that might seem like an exaggeration to go punch someone over chocolate, but it's the principle of being treated like dirt. It's about customer service and holding a standard to where your reputation upholds expectations of an great experience. It's rare you meet someone that hell bent on "winning" battles because of their positions to make themselves feel better....Yes, you ruined my day so you got what you wanted and hope that one day this attitude will reap you some rewards and get you royally fucked. Just because this place is famous doesn't mean it'll hold up for long. Sure some folks will come for the name, the signature dessert  but with more and more people doing reviews and spreading the word- you're going to tank if you don't know how to treat people. A bad reputation exceeds the good and seems like I'm not alone here in the reviews. A woman scorned from her desserts has a fire like no other. You already lost 4 customers plus the hundreds of tourist I know. Believe me and my texting powers- I'm fucking viral with a nickname as "The Yelp Ambassador".  My goal is to let people  have the best experience possible in Vegas. I can't ever let them step foot here simply even for the fact that how can I guarantee them a good experience? I can't and that looks bad on ME if I didn't tell them about my time here. Dessert is supposed to be fun....where is the JOY in this place? PLEASE- walk over to MAX BRENNER in the Forum Shops. It saved my night! (see review) And you know what? Their chocolate granita shit on the frozen hot chocolate here. It was definitely higher quality chocolate at MB's.  I'm already planning my trip back there.Dessert fans unite!I am not one but the wifey definitely is...  She dragged me to the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and we've been to this one in Vegas quite a few times.   It's almost always a dessert trip here so I don't have any advice on the food.  I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert's I've eaten from a restaurant.  They don't do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they "bread it" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  My wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn't feel like a complete sugar overload.  The apples had a perfect tart contrast with the cobbler and ice cream and it created a nice addition to the mix.I'm a fan... are you?It was so disappointing to see that the Serendipity 3 in Vegas looks nothing like the Serendipity 3 in NYC. The decor has been Vegas-ified; it's the cheap knock off version of the real thing. We came in right before closing & the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our waiter wasn't completely unfriendly but it was obviously the end if a very long, busy shift. Our order was small & simple but still completely gluttonous:--  nachos: a humongous portion of chips (yellow corn & red-colored ones) covered with cheese, beans, tomatoes, onions & chicken. Tasty comfort food, but I can't say I'd ever get it again. We ordered it b/c you have to eat *something* before you can have dessert. -- banana split: even shared amongst three people, this was a sickeningly gigantic portion of vanilla, strawberry & chocolate ice cream topped with traditional toppings & 2 bananas. If you don't control yourself, this dessert has the potential to give you a serious tummy ache. Been there, ate that. I only needed to experience Sependipity 3 in Vegas once. The food is average, which can be said for the NYC location as well, but at least they've got the ambiance & quirky atmosphere to justify the visit.Ugh. I was made to go here because I have family in town and they really don't understand my values are a big deal to me. If I boycott a place I don't care if I'm starving I won't do it. But the louder of opinions in the group won and I have no say since it isn't my vacation. So the BF and I kept them company while they ate their over priced and over rated items. There wasn't anything that was gonna get us to order something or even taste what people are ordering so I have nothing much to say on food and will just quote what people said at the table. My one brother who's definitely a foodie wasn't happy with his frozen chocolate what he said was "a melted milkshake" and he would have been better off "with a In N Out milkshake". Then I found out he wanted to come with me instead to Max Brenner. *sigh* (And we did go the next day while family shopped). Another brother got coffee and it was nothing special. The kids liked their desserts, but they're KIDS. I can put sugar on roaches and they'd think it's a crunchy goodtime. My sister had a sundae and it was fairly standard. My cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftovers but he said it was good. Service wasn't rude this time, but it wasn't really hitting service standards. It was more like- take the order, bring it, and if you need the check go find them. Desserts took about 35 minutes to come. One person came late and ordered after everyone else. They got a slice of cake and that didn't come around until way later when most people had their desserts done....Cake doesn't even need to be prepared so it shouldnt take 50 minutes to receive it! Just put it on a fucking plate and add whip cream and a strawberry.Well, just confirms to me- I wasn't just "hating" in my first review, this place isn't that great with service nor expediting orders.  Dessert shouldn't take almost 2 hours specially since we're one of the last reservations of the night. Stop buying into brand names. Serendipity lost the charm that made it sucessful in the first location decades ago. Serendipity doesn't live to its name and is just bad misfortune with each visit. AVOID.Colorful, one-of-a-kind dining is an exact description of Serendipity.They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their humungous desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes, deep fried oreos, and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's a paradox, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. I haven't figured out a good time to come here without having to wait over 30 minutes for a table. If you're in a hurry, they have this grab-n-go service, which is on the side of the restaurant. There is a smaller menu of their most popular items for take-out.I am a sucker for sweets and Serendipity has established it's own little place in my heart; especially when one of my all-time favorite movies is Serendipity!Out of the 3 times I have come, each time was one-star for me! The purpose for each time was to try a different sundae (although I'm not so much into ice cream).WHERE: It's part of Caesar's Palace, but it is it's on building right outside of the casino itself. You must park at the garage/valet, walk through the casino, and out to it.Each of the sundaes I got to try were all large servings!! I shared with friend, and still didn't get to finish it =(. Such a bummer!-Deep fried orea sundae: TOO MUCH DEEP FRIED OREOS!! I couldn't do it anymore after just one!!-Banana Split (coward portion): If you are also here for dessert, I recommend this sundae! The coward portion was pretty decent sized too, I miss homemade banana splits back in the day! =)I did get to try the onion rings! They were actually pretty good, and I loved the presentation!! The little cafe is cute & really PINK, but the food is over priced - that's for sure! OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE WORTH.*NOTE: Proceed with caution!!I had the same exact thoughts as Claire L., I'd rather get a frosty from Wendy's.Not worth the wait. I don't even get this whole waiting thing when there's clearly enough space to sit everyone! Maybe their huge menus are taking up space? Haha!We ordered a regular, which was meant for one person but my friend and I couldn't even finished it. Felt like a $12 punishment. UGH! There goes my six bucks...Two words my wife and I said to each other as we were walking out."Never again"$14 for a sundae that was just ok while Max Brenner is just a walk away!  I knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews.  I'd rather buy 3 different pints of Ben and Jerry's from the supermarket.First off, the frozen Hot Chocolate is overrated, so don't go in expecting to be blown away. I found the other selections to taste better overall. I ordered the NY steak sandwich, and saw that this bad boy was $21. $21 for a sandwich?! This better be ginormous. It was. I had to tilt my plate to be able to give my friends room to eat. It contains a whole 10 ounce steak, with fried egg, bacon on a whole loaf of bread. This place is packed also during lunch hours so you may want to try and hit it up during off hours so u can avoid the crowd.Dear Serendipity, You suck. Craig R. I had wanted to try their famous frozen chocolate drinks and massive sundaes for a long, long time. When I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, my group of four went to the restaurant at about 10:15pm on a Friday night. When I walked in there were many tables open in the main dining room and on the outdoor patio. When I asked how long the wait was for my party I was told forty minutes. I wasn't sure I heard the hostess correctly so I asked "I'm sorry, did you say forty minutes?" To my question the hostess rudely replied "YES, I DID. Just wait outside and we'll call you when we have a table available". Once outside we encountered a couple also waiting for a table and they said they had already been there twenty minutes and they had seen many diners leaving but they still had not been seated. After waiting about ten minutes (the couple still had not been called in) my group and I decided to just go to their walk up window. We ordered one large frozen peanut butter hot chocolate, one regular frozen hot chocolate and a chocolate cake sundae. The large frozen PBHC was huge and pretty damn tasty but I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it in one of their big glass mugs topped with mounds of whipped cream. The regular frozen HC was decent sized too and equally as tasty. Honestly though, I felt they charged too much for their to-go drinks. The price for the to-go drinks are the same as if you were to get them in the restaurant. Since you're not getting the true Serendipity experience I thought they'd at least cut back the $13 price tag for the large drink ($10 for the regular). The sundae wasn't very good. The piece of cake in the sundae seemed like it had been setting out a while. The cake itself was a tad stale and slightly crunchy. At least the guys running the to-go window were friendly. I'm still not sure why the wait was so long when they had so many open tables. I saw a bunch of servers when I was putting my name in so I don't think they were understaffed or anything like that. After looking over the many reviews on Yelp I see a lot of people complaining about the bad service they received. Maybe Serendipity thinks because they are so popular they can treat people like garbage because they will never be hurting for business. If that's the case, which I'm assuming it is, then they can take their big frozen hot chocolates and shove it up their behinds. Besides, Max Brenner is only five minutes away from here and I know from experience that they truly care about their customers and that their products, especially their shakes, are top notch. I wouldn't return to Serendipity's now if you paid me. They suck.Been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I'm glad I finally got the chance to!A group of friends and I came here because we were so undecided about what to do on a friday night since we were not clubbing. I keep hearing about the frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 sundae and $69 hot dog! ( which I hope to try soon! ) Since I didn't have $1,000 to splurge and I didn't hear about the hot dog until recently, I got the crab cakes which was good. It had a good amount of crabs and the sauce complimented the crab cakes very well. From the looks of it, a spoonful of salad with two good size of crab cakes didn't look like it would fill me up at all, but it did! I also got to try a proscuitto sandwich and that was also pretty good! The bread had a nice and soft texture, and the veggies were fresh. Their alfredo is also pretty good too!The one thing I didn't care too much for was their frozen hot chocolate. We got the popular flavor which was the peanut butter one with a shot of alcohol. ( I forgot what alcohol ) It was good, but I just feel like I was eating reese's peanut butter ice cream with alcohol and I could get that for 4 bucks a carton at albertsons and just add a shot of baileys to it. Overall, I had a nice experience and I would make my trip back here just to try the hot dog and the golden opulence sundae if I was ever ballin.***Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is pretty good (and is topped off with some nice whipped cream), but it is quite overpriced at $11***I have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.The frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.They top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.Service was quick on my one visit.Prices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.Now that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).Serendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Overpriced for some okay quality food. I came here on my last night in vegas for some late dessert with some friends. Nothing special. They sell hot dogs, nachos, sweet tooth dessert and more. I ordered the nachos and chips wasn't fresh and cheese was already COLD. Gross. My husband and friends all got the frozen hot chocolate and it was too sweet for my taste. I like it here because when it's 100+ degrees outside in Vegas I can sit in their patio with the water sprinkling on me while I eat. It's refreshing. But I don't see myself coming back here.This is a spot I take non-local friends/family.  It's right outside Caesars Palace next to the Absinthe tent.  They always have crazy lines for to-go and dine-in so reserve a table. The place is cute if you're into girly stuff: pink, beanie babies, totes, chocolate, desserts, etc.  They have indoor and patio seating.  I'd rather sit inside because the view from the patio isn't all that wonderful: ruins of Bill's Gambling Saloon, Flamingo and Hot Babes Direct to You mobile billboard passing by every few minutes.I like their desserts (Deep Fried Oreos and Ice Cream, Black and White Sundae, Banana Split, Red Velvet Sundae)  only if I'm with a group because their portions are huuuuge and I don't feel like spending 5 hours at the gym trying to burn the calories from their desserts! Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is a must-have though - but again, it's meant to be shared.For their savory items, I've tried their Ahi Tuna Salad (wishing it had negative calories to lower my caloric intake from the hot chocolate! Ha!), ABC Burger (avocado, brie and caramelized onions), Foot Long, Egg White Frittata, Chicken and Waffles and their High Heel Pump (prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, pesto and balsamic Glaze).  I've always wanted to try their Foot Long Haute Dog with gold leaf, truffles and foie gras but they only have it their New York shop (which was closed due to rat infestation the last time I went).With Serendipity, I'm guilty of my willingness to pay for cute, the name (which the movie was named after and a portion was filmed) but mediocre food. I still like them for their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.My friends have always talked about the frozen hot chocoloate at Serendipity in Vegas, but I'm not much of a sweets person so always just thought "meh." However, while in vegas the past couple of visits, my sweet tooth kicked in and I decided to see what the hype was aboutNormally it gets packed late night and the hostess will get your # down on an ipad which will text you when your table is ready. You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.Everything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.Frozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn't overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the "for 2 size" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it's cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It's fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it's icy and not too thick (for those that think it's a milkshake)Hangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.Crab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn't too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. Mint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10/18/13, we decided to order this 'cause I'm a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he's not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it's their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candyMake sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points! A lot of the reviews here say the service isn't good, but we've always had great friendly service the past couple times we've been here. Food comes out pretty quick. One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)BTW if it's your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you'd like. I saw a couple of tables get the can't say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyesPink, orange, pink, orange!  I love the color theme here!!  Yes, it's kinda girly, but hunny came with me anyway & we had a great time! We came by for late night desserts & sat in the patio area.   It was perfect as we got to people watch over the Strip.  There are some crazy people out there. Oh ladies, you shouldn't wear heels to walk around the Strip.  Too many people are walking around in pain!We got the famous Frrrozen hot chocolate for 2 ($15).  That thing is huge!  And they know my style, lots of whipped cream!   :D  The famous drink is pretty good & chocolatey but wasn't blow my mind good.   I would like to try the other flavors (there are a few if 'em) eventually. Inside the restaurant,  they love Hello Kitty as much as me!  They had a bunch of HK items.  They also sell the Frrrozen hot chocolate mix to make at home!   ;)I really liked the ambiance in the patio,  but not so much in the restaurant. Oh, when you give your name to the host,  they take your cell phone & text you when your table is ready!   Love that! They offer traditional American food & have menus posted on the front of the restaurant.The line is ridiculous most of the time. I hate lines, but I'm willing to wait for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate or their Deep Fried Oreos & Ice CreamSerendipity 3 isn't some place to visit while on a diet, but who the crap is gonna go to Vegas and diet? ...Seriously. Frrrozen Hot ChocolateA guilty pleasure. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it is a sure thing. It's definitely something that makes me feel good from the inside out.Deep Fried Oreos & Ice CreamDeep Fried Oreos, Cookies 'N Cream Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, & Marshmallow SauceI die. Deep fried Oreos are like mini orgasms waiting to be had. No. Joke. Oreos are so freakin' delish as is.. Then deep fried?!!! That's just asking for it. And then with ice cream and marshmallow sauce (I can deal without the fudge) ?!!!!! Excuse me while I go change the panty. LOL. #forrealdoeAs far as reg food goes, it's just ..."meh."The sweet treats are where they at.VERDICTThese kinds of treats make more sense in a tropical-24/7 climate like HI. Hey, hello, HI. #justsaying #isthatagoodenoughexcuseHaha. But I'm glad I know where to go when I'm in need of some cheering up while in Vegas!After being forced to watch the movie, I knew I wanted to try out this ice cream shop!  I've been avoiding stopping by since this place is always busy.  I mean lines wrapping around and everything!  That means it must be good, right? So on one of my recent trips, I decided to brave the sun and the long line and tried me some Serendipity.I only tried one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one.  I had the much talked about Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It was decent, the serving size was overkill, and it was a truly decadent and rich treat.  It was just a little too sweet and powdery for my liking and I think it had more whipped cream than actual frozen hot chocolate.  I think I would much rather spend my money inside Caesar's Palace at a delicious dessert shop with the best macarons ever.  For a frozen hot chocolate though, I think I'll stick with San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.This ice cream shop is sickeningly cute.  Like every other place on The Strip, the theme is rampant and the atmosphere is worth a few selfies for Instagram.  Stop by if you're an ice cream fanatic.  I hope you don't mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that makes up Serendipity.Meh... My experience here back in June with friends wasn't that pleasant. We got seated a few minutes after I checked in since I made reservations for me and friends. I ordered the Mint Frozen Hot Chocolate and it was okay. Our food twas taking forever to arrive and we've noticed that the tables surrounding us that were seated maybe 20 minutes after us got their food before we did. We found out that our server didn't even put our order in so we sat on our table literally waiting for nothing. We all got irritated and told our server to cancel our order and left. I guess at least I got to taste the frozen hot chocolate but whatevs.Before coming here I was warned not to eat inside as Service was really slow. Well, seeing that I'm from England (renowned for slow crappy service) that didn't bother me but I do have to agree it was a little slow, nothing bad enough to irritate me yet took around 15 minutes from us being ready to order for someone to come over and then roughly 20 minutes once we were done to get our check.With that said, I was really excited to come and eat here and came at just after 8am. Hubby and I decided to order just one entree as I planned to have the Mint Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate - $13 as my Breakfast. Yes, Really.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#TRbbI2waOPt8MckXWqWCuQ) He choose the Crescentwich which I had a small amount of and where the place is cute we both came to the conclusion that it is severely overpriced. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#ONQT8eOiIEaClhkXjN9Dnw)The Crescentwich was really not worth $16. It was good but not to the point I would pay that much for it again and the Potatoes that came with it were cold and hard. Server didn't even check back to make sure everything was ok so we didn't have the chance to have it corrected.As for the Chocolate... meh. I expected something amazing seeing that the Server bragged that it was ''made with a blend of 11 different types of Chocolate''. It tasted watery with little Mint flavor and very icy, I was so bummed as I was expecting this delicious rich Chocolate. That didn't happen. I won't be back.I see RED.  RED Velvet, that is.After missing a chance to visit the original location in NYC last year, I was thankful I had some time to to drop by the Vegas location for dessert.NOTE:  Seating is indoor or outdoor.  There is actually a takeout window that offers some selections from their regular menu.  Not sure if the full menu is available at the takeout window though.We arrived slightly past 1pm,  and much to my surprise we were seated immediately despite the restaurant being very crowded.  Since we had just finished a very filling lunch, our agenda for this visit was strictly dessert.I was almost tempted to order the popular frozen hot chocolate, but since it was a chilly Vegas day, I decided on the regular hot chocolate instead.  In the end, my friend and I shared a red velvet sundae.  And indeed it was a true sweet treat.  The chunk of red velvet cake was surrounded by vanilla ice cream, whip cream, hot fudge, and rainbow sprinkles.  Needless to say, we lost the battle in our attempt to finish it, but it was more than we could manage.  The sundae was a generous portion, and quite possibly four people would have finished entirely.BOTTOM LINE:  A sweet treat in Sin City.  I hope to (eventually) try the frozen hot chocolate on a future visit.The desserts here are delicious!!! We ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the red velvet sundae! I think I'm obsessed with the red velvet sundae!the reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the food wasn't up to par. We got the the pulled pork sandwich, portobello mushroom burger and onion rings. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But I just expected better!!! Enjoy the sweets!!!!Xo, Naomi!Our friends wanted to meet here to have lunch. When my husband and I arrived to this gigantic, pink restaurant that said Serendipity 3 on top, we knew we were at the right place. Not sure if I was so hungry, but the 40 min wait seemed like hours! We couldn't go far or else we would lose our table after 5 mins after they texted you to tell us our table is ready. And everywhere in Vegas is a far walk so we just stayed put. When our table was finally called, we sat on a long table at the back end of the restaurant. They handed us our menus and holy moly prices were so high! A fricken hot dog was $18!! Macaroni and cheese for $19!! Ugh! I was craving a hot dog too! So even though I didn't agree with the price of the $18 hot dog, I still got it!.. My husband got the Sliders for $18. We paid $1 extra for bacon, but they didn't put the bacon! My husband said the sliders were really good and flavorful, but so small! My hotdog was a 12" hotdog that came naked with a little plate of sauerkraut on the end. Where's the ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions? $18 for a hotdog, I would assume it came with all of that!I was already thinking of my "make-up" meal. This place is sooo over rated!!Talk about dessert full of craziness, but lets just get to the point.  Once again, I didn't know what to expect.  I knew of the original location in New York, only never had the chance to visit it.  We had reservations here, and I was open about giving it a try.  Yes the dining seemed all white, pink, and cutesy, but to me it just felt another big name restaurant with too much to offer at a high price.  Service was good, which pretty much guaranteed a second star.Here's what we ordered:~ Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for two ($18):  Yes, eighteen bucks!  Meh, a lot for whipped cream and coffee beans.  It was good, but personally too sweet to me.  Nothing spectacular as advertised.~ Deep Fried Twinkie Sundae ($16):  Now this was heavenly!  The ice cream and crunchiness of that twinkie, mmm mmm mmm!  You've got to try it for yourself.  Okay share it, because you won't finish it alone.  But still, ice cream and twinkies... eh!~ Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ($19):  Toasty, buttery, and a cheese lover's dream!  One bite into this and you'll feel the fat go straight to your butt.  Well, for men, it'll be your gut.  But $19 for cheese and bread, ha!  They could at least put tuna in it.  Or maybe they have a tuna melt that I'm unaware of.  ~ Ahi Tuna Salad ($23):  My friend had this.  She loved it, but bit her lip not once but twice while eating it.  I guess that's what happens with you eat something healthy here.  Anyways, I'll probably give this place a second chance, but not anytime soon.  Definitely a place for dessert, but only if you're in the ice cream mood.  Check out the prices and judge for yourself.  Even with a rewards card, you're only saving a dollar.  Big whoop!  OK, nevermind, I'll pass next time around.Ehhh....only come here if you're desperate to try their restaurant staple; the frozen hot chocolate. It's basically just taste like a chocolate milkshake. You can add extra fixins/toppings to your hearts content. Personally, I'm not a fan of sweets so I can definitely forego this item.Food-wise.....this is really below average. They serve your typical American food; hotdogs, onion rings, burgers and sandwiches, small bite tacos, pizza, a couple of pasta dishes and appetizers like nachos. I ordered the Three Amigos Tacos with my choice of crispy fried fish. It was bland...even if I added pico de gallo, squeezed the hell outta the lime. My friend's Chicago hot dog was hugeeeeeee!!!!! This will definitely fill you up. This place is definitely a tourist trap. Especially to those who've seen the movie. Restaurant was dirty too. Stains on the tables and chairs. Yuck! I came here once in 2011...thought the restaurant was A-OK. 4 years later....it's still the same.We were walking out of Caesars Palace and trying to get back on the strip. As luck would have it, we were on the back side of Serendipity 3. Yes, the ever famous Serendipity from the movies, and the place that the celebrities go to. They are known for their frozen hot chocolate.I wasn't feeling the wait and nothing on the menu really interested me. However, I had to try the frozen hot chocolate. On the back side of Serendipity 3, where I was at, they had a take out window. Yay, I was finally going to get to try the frozen hot chocolate! They had a lot of tables and seats back there, so it was take your pick. Be careful to look before you sit though, because a lot of the seats had bird poop.I went up to the window and ordered my frozen hot chocolate. It was $10 and served in one of those plastic drink cups. I was actually watching the woman make it. She had chocolate syrup and threw it into the blender with some ice. Then, she added whip cream on the top with chocolate shavings. Was it worth the $10, probably not. I'm going to have to agree with all the other reviews that said it tasted like Swiss Miss blended with ice. You could probably make this at home for 40 cents. At least I can say that I actually tried it. Another food item crossed off my list.This place is soooo overrated!!! I have been wanting to try this place for the longestttttt time and finally I had the opportunity to try it. We went in and waited 5 minutes just to get seated. We were seated and ready to order but no one even came by after 10mins we just walked out and I decided that I would just order to the to go line. Got the frozen hot chocolate and had a sip I was sooo not impressed. I actually didn't even enjoy it one bit. It's totally a waste of money and I wouldn't even come back.  At least it's off my bookmarks of places to try. Should've listened to the other Yelpers who said the same thing.Overpriced...Overrated and Bleh!

Review Text :
See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!! Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!! Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green! We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future. Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with "SuperiorMaster"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan. The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage. We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table "Cha Cha Chicken"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.   Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of rice ..wimp. We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!Time for a review update... My initial "oh-my-god-there's-a-vegan-restaurant-a-mile-from-my-house" infatuation is now over. I live very close to LH, so I go there a lot.Loving Hut is pretty good, they have some very tasty dishes (Spicy Cha Cha, BBQ Bagutte are some of my favs) and they have some not so great dishes.The real reason for my drop-down in stars is that it's always a pain in the arse to order what you want at Loving Hut. You would think that a vegan restaurant would be totally okay with substitutions, omissions, etc (as that's what vegans must do at most restaurants), but no, it's always a royal pain at loving hut.The other day my wife wanted to try the "Tuno" (faux tuna) sandwich on the baguette roll instead of sliced bread. I called in to place a phone order and tried to order it. I made it clear that I would be happy to pay a bit extra for the baguette bread if necessary. Didn't matter. They would not do it. No way, no how. I tried to bargain with the phone employee who blamed it on someone else and said she had to go "check with the cook" if it was possible. How would it not be possible to use a different type of bread that they already have? Either way, they would not budge at all. So I couldn't get what I wanted, very annoying and frustrating.I've also tried other substitutions and dish modifications and it's always a pain.They no longer give free refills on Iced Tea (citing costs), which is disappointing.One day I asked about the complementary appetizer soups that they give in store, asking if I could get it for to go orders. The employee I spoke with explained that they don't give it out on to go orders because of soup container costs, but if I brought in my own soup container they'd be happy to give me some. So the next time I placed a to go order, I brought in a little plastic soup bowl and requested some. They barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it.Bottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching, as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back.Changing up the menu by offering unique, limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place, as much of the menu seems to be very similar (the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything).Hoping they can improve...Came here with my brother on a recent trip to Phoenix.  This is a medium sized restaurant.  You order at the counter and your food/drinks are brought to you by servers.  We arrived to find quite a long line of patrons.  The staff was definitely on it but getting our order placed and then served took longer than I would have expected.  We did get a free order of spring rolls while we waited since the staff knew that it would be awhile till we got our food.  I ordered the pho, which the attendant at the counter said was her mother's recipe.  The chunks of veggies were pretty large, like a whole stalk of bok choy, but I felt that it was a relatively small serving with a scant amount of veggies and tofu.  I am used to being served a plate of fresh basil and sprouts with pho, but there were none of the traditional condiments served as extra.  It was good, but some sriracha sauce and some basil and sprouts would have made this dish much better.  My brother had the Loving Hut Burger. He said it was OK but could have been more flavorful. The service was wonderful, the whole restaurant is very clean and bright and I liked the fact that it is healthy food, but I would have enjoyed more flavor from the vegan options that we chose.  I would come back to try different menu selections to see if something catches my fancy.

Restaurant name  Green Tomato Buffet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Buffets aren't uncommon these days - they cater to people who don't want to wait, which as you know is also not uncommon in our world.  But the most common type of buffet is probably the Chinese Buffet.  Strangely, that variety of restaurant has the most trouble staying in business on the East Side of Charlotte - the China House (three times, once for relocation purposes) has gone out of business, as has the Super Buffet.The King Buffet also folded, followed by the Jamaican restaurant Pop A Top, and I'm not sure if they even opened for business.  Now the Green Tomato has decided to open in its space.  Their theme?  Buffet.  But with a twist.  It's Southern Cooking - fried chicken, meatloaf, mac and cheese and of course fried green tomatoes.I'm not really sure what took them so long to open the place, because the interior doesn't look that different from when King Buffet was there.  Maybe Pop A Top had done something and they had to clean it up.  But the place is light and airy, while well-staffed.  They kept glasses full to the point of almost overflowing.  Just take a sip and they will be there to top it off.The food, while not outstanding, isn't bad - and since it's Southern-style, you probably won't go back for more than a plate or two.  This is likely a good choice for a buffet, as they aren't going to lose too many bets on people who like to pack it on, just because it's so heavy.  This isn't your gradnmother's cooking, but it isn't a horrible substitute.You'll find a couple of buffet lines for the real food, as well as one for salads and one for desserts, so there are plenty of choices.  Each day has veggies and sides, while you get different specials for the day of the week (fish on Fridays, for instance).  Probably worth checking out if you like to get some Southern cooking and don't want to go through the trouble yourself.

Restaurant name  Pete's Fish And Chips

Review Text :
You know what I like?I like cocktail sauce with my fish and my chip. And , I like cocktail sauce on my fish sandwich:)Pete's Fish and Chip's (a wholly owned subsidiary of Montgomery Burns Enterprises) takes a page from their bosses handbook when they say "let the masses have their tar-tar sauce".That's right they put cocktail sauce on their fish sandwiches. That is, in fact, the sole (pun intended...it's definitely not sole in their fish sandwiches) reason to visit Pete's (Phoenix institution, I know).Try to get them to do that at your MickieD's, or your Wendy's!I know that Pete's makes other things...burgers, chicken, hot dogs, etc. For all I know, they make filet mignon on a skewer...I've never ordered any of it. The sign says Pete's fish and Chips...I think I'm skating close to edge by having them put the fish slab on a bun:)Pete's makes a pretty decent fish sandwich...not much better than the aforementioned McD's or Burger King, but certainly no worse...in fact, it just may be the same fish sandwich...unidentifiable, generic as to type of fish...possibly even a soy based fish like food substance...I couldn't tell you...if this thing was ever swimming, it was months ago:)But, you put cheese on it and add a little cocktail sauce, and I'll swing through drive through every 6 months or so.If you want to re-create this much-revered Phoenician favorite at home, here is a very simple recipe: 1) don't buy fish  2) find stale old breadcrumbs in your "cupboard" - form crumbs into a flat, oblong shape and insert into recycled oil from the last batch of fries you made (perhaps last year)  3) slowly bring oil to a boil, cook until a soggy golden brown 4) remove from oil and place onto an entire roll of Brawny® 5) open food-service grade can of tartar slop. dunk fried oblong into slop, bite, chew, cry. repeat.If you're a real seafood aficionado, throw some crusty horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there.I've yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of Pete's Fish n' Chips. The name is a lie.R.I.P. Pete's fish and chips... I've been coming to Pete's for 42 years, since I was old enough to drive and was in high school. What happened in the last month or two??? The new recipe for breading of the shrimp is nothing like it was. My wife and I were so disappointed tonight and won't be back. We'll miss it. We drive from Ahwatukee foothills to Indian School and 44th St, roughly 35 miles, to get our fix every couple of months but, I'm sorry to say, this has been our final trip.  Whoever decided this was a good idea did Pete (RIP) a serious disservice and he would be sorely disappointed to see what's become of his business as a result of this poor business decision. They should have tested this move with long time customers before screwing up the food. If this is a money making decision, charge more, don't screw with 60 years of tradition....For those of you who've lived in Tucson, Pete's Fish and Chips is probably the closest thing to Lucky Wishbone that you can find in Phoenix. Every once in a while I stop in and get myself some scallops, shrimp, or crabettes with fries. Yes it's all deep fried and probably not very healthy, but sometimes that hits the spot.Oh and remember, it's cash only but they don't take anything bigger than a $20!

Restaurant name  Qing Hua
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I was a bit disheartened to see that some of the dumplings are served from frozen. Others are made fresh to order, which is what I expected (and hoped for). The dumplings at Qing Hua are also 15-25% more expensive than at Restaurant Mai Xiang Yuan in Chinatown, where I normally go and love (and where EVERY order is made fresh.)I was also disturbed that Qing Hua is a cash-only business and that I had to ask for a receipt because the cashier was making my change without having entered my order in the POS system. I find it incredibly dishonest (not to mention illegal!!) to charge a customer the sales tax and pocket it rather than remit it to the government like every business is supposed to.The dumplings might be good, but I won't be back.

Oh Tamari, how do I love thee... let me count the ways!I can't believe I've taken this long to write a review for my most favorite Pittsburgh eatery.  I guess I always thought words wouldn't do justice for this restaurant.  Each and every time the DH and I come here we are blown away.  We've come here with huge groups of friends, romantic dinners, happy hour, and even the chef tasting.  The chef tasting is by far my most favorite experience.  Chef Roger actually gives you a call before your dinner to see what you expectations are.  He pays particular attention to what you do and do not like.  He hit the nail on the head with our dinner.  To start off with the portion sizes were very large for a tasting, but it was so amazing we had to finish each and every last bite.  We even thought of giving up eating out all together and just saving our money to do a chef tasting there once a month, it was that good!  In addition, the owner Allen is so sweet!  He's always walking around to make sure everyone is satisfied with their meal, and remembers his patrons quite well.  This is by far the best restaurant in the burgh, and one that I recommend to everyone when they want to try something new & different.  Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed.

Review Text :
Sula BBQ Buffet in the Macy's Home Shopping Center right on Spring Mountain has joined the AYCE Korean BBQ craze.  We've watched for months as the sign illuminated their existence, but waited for the doors to actually open. Last weekend, The Husband, a friend, and I finally decided to see what the fuss was all about.  We sat down a little after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread before us.There seemed to be a good amount of banchan to choose from, including white rice and purple rice.  Quite a selection of meats to choose from as well.  Their cooked items were okay - ranging from dumplings, fish, and tempura.  Their dessert selection though is something to cry about - jello, canned peaches, fresh watermelon and honeydew, old sesame balls, and deep-fried pineapple chunks.Price for adults on weekends: $19.95I do have to agree with other comments regarding the staff hounding you.  The managers would come by our table all the time (we were seated close to the register), and take a survey of the restaurant.  It made me wonder if they were watching how much we were eating.  At one point, the waitress put the bill on our table and I was a bit shocked.  I said "Is there a time limit?" under my breath, but she then told us to take our time.  (Take our time eating or take our time paying the bill?)  Either way, getting your bill during our meal is a bad sign.  Don't do it.  And yes, we also experience the older Korean owner too.  I guess I said something out loud about not having any lettuce, and a little green salad showed up at my table.  Weird.  Service is okay - drinks come immediately, and they also help with cooking your meat too.  Our grill got cleaned once while we ate, which looked super easy because she just wiped it with a paper towel.Overall, Sula BBQ Buffet was okay, I think there's a bigger selection over at Woo Che, and it's cheaper there too.Sula is a BBQ buffet. If your preference is to buffet style, versus having to  put in an order every time you want some kimchi or a more kalbi, this place is a great all you can eat Korean BBQ in Vegas.  You are able to cook your own meat (whether it be beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, squid, or octopus).Chefs slice out many different kind of fresh meats, poultry, seafood, etc. You pick what you like and barbecue it at the table. It is a great set up allowing you to cook your meats as much or as little as you like.There is a variety of choices for meats, side items and sauces so you are not limited. In fact, I found this a great way to try items I had never tried on a regular korean menu (i.e. I didnt want to risk paying for something I didnt like). Servers are surprisingly very attentive and friendly. If you do not feel like cooking, or do not know how to, the employees will come around and help you. Be warned, they will charge you $5 for wasting. I didn't have this happen to me... but there is a BIG sign in front of the buffet that says so. =)It's very hard for me to ever not like Korean BBQ. I love it so. My favorite in town is probably still Woo Che, but Sura is pretty good as well. I'd rate is a solid 3 1/2 (so I rounded up despite the lack of sides). The restaurant is large and well maintained. They have a pretty large selection of proteins to bbq. Their banchaan selection isn't great, but it'll do in a pinch. The salad and other sides were just fillers. Not really necessary and not particulary appetizing. I adore kalbi, so I usually fill up on that and their marinade was ok.The service was pretty good. They came by to refill our drinks and check on us pretty regularly and changed out our grill when necessary. All in all, I enjoy this place for what it is. I can't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's good and it satiates my late night KBBQ cravings. I wouldn't object to coming back again. Good food, good service, happy me. Yum.Several people have told me so much about this place, so I decided I wanted to try it for myself! It happened to be midnight & on a whim.  Firstly, if you claim yourself to be a carnivore, then you are heading towards the right path walking into this restaurant!WHAT:  Sura BBQ is a buffet-style korean bbq spot! I believe it has been one of the Las Vegas hot spots as of recently!  Instead of ordering the type of meat that you'd like, you get just just get up out of your seat whenever need be & pick out the meat yourself!  (FYI: the meat is raw when you pick it  up). You then take it back to your table and cook it to your liking (there is a hot-pot/stove top in the center of each table). Besides meat, there are additional sides you can also enjoy such as rice, salads, appetizers, & even sushi rolls!WHEN:  This spot is open from 10am-3am! Saturdays & Sundays all-you-can eat price is a standard $19.99 for everyone!  During the weekdays, I believe it is still $19.99 for adults, but $13.99 for children.WHERE:  Located on Spring Mountain, between Arville & Decatur!!WHY:  If you want meat, just came from the bar/clubs & have been drinking, or if you want to try something new!SIDE NOTE: Do NOT, I repeat, Do NOT get too excited about cooking everything up! Please make sure you finish the food you do decide to cook because they charge $5 or more depending on how much food you waste! So please portion your food wisely! =DThis is where meat and kimchi lovers explode. I belong here. As I was getting my kimchi craving satiated, I overheard a couple talking. Obviously, it was the bf's first time.Dude: "So, this is a restaurant where you have to like, cook your own meat?"Girl: "Yup! You bring the meat to the table and cook!" Looks at him with the biggest smile, ever.Dude: Looks lost and kinda grossed out. Holds up meat. "Oh. So, what is this?" Looks at the meat suspiciously.Girl: "That's chicken"Dude: "Are you sure? I bet it's cat."Girl: "No! It's chicken."Dude: Looks disgusted. "I bet it's cat. This whole buffet is cat. Cat!"This exchange embodies cross-cultural clashes. I love it. A great and clean cook-it-yourself Korean bbq restaurant. It's so much better than rival Woo Che BBQ a few blocks west. The concept is straight forward: server heats up the grill; you choose from a buffet of uncooked meats, salads, appetizers, soups and bring it your table;  start grilling your meats, eat, and enjoy. Repeat. I loved it. The combination of fresh flavorful cooked meat and spicy fermented cabbage is deliciously intoxicating to my soul. I also enjoyed the cucumber salad, noodles, and pumpkin soup. I frequented so many times with the meat that a gentlemen next to our booth remarked, "I like your appetite!". Guilty. At $20+ per person (during dinner), I wanted my moneys worth, duh. My only gripe is that I wish they had more veggies to grill (i.e. eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers) and dessert options. Strawberries would've been a perfect ending. Service was friendly and our waitress helped clean the grill frequently. The blend of fresh ingredients, friendly service, and a funny overheard exchange permits a recommendation.Best Bang for your Buck All you can eat Korean BBQMeat: 5/5 The quality of the meat is pretty good, I'm not much of a great meat critic but it was good to me. The seasoning on the bulgogi was yummmm that's my favorite dish there. Also the short ribs I can't get enough of their recipe. You can also grill Shrimp and squid which is also tasty Sides: 5/5 They have a great variety of sides from kimchi to cold noodles to fish cakes. Depending on what day or time you go it changes. I love the kimchi square radish, spicy/tangy/crunchy Sushi: ?? They have a small variety of sushi rolls pre-made just your simple California rolls or tuna rolls. I've never tried them because I'm there for the Korean BBQ meat not sushi. Soups: 5/5 The soup changes but they usually have 2-3 big pots of soup you just serve yourself. My favorite was the kimchi tofu soup its a great starter before the meal. Value: 5/5 All you can eat Korean BBQ for $20 per person. WOW I remember when Korean BBQ used to be $20 a plate. Their lunch is $15 a person WOW & if your craving Korean BBQ late they're open till 3AMParking: 4/5 Pretty decent lot, it shares a parking lot with a reflexology office and I believe a sears home furniture store. During peak dinner hours it can get a little packed in the parking lot but as long as you don't mind walking a bit it shouldn't be a problemVerbatim: "People NEED to know about this place!"I recently re-introduced my brother to the food of our people and he was more than enthusiastic over the taste and value of the Sura BBQ Buffet. You're charged a flat rate of $23 for dinner (they're open for lunch too.) And as long as you don't mind the bad service, you'll leave not only stuffed, but satisfied.Korean BBQ is all about one thing--meat. Many times have I wandered into this red-meat cal-fest and I've never questioned the cuts or quality. From the beef to the chicken to the seafood, every dead animal cooked up at the table has been delicious. The sweet soy marinade used for the kalbi and bulgogi are going to be the crowd favorites. But for the odd-balls that don't eat red meat, there's chicken, shrimp, octopus, and squid.  If you don't eat red meat, pork is probably on the list to avoid. But  for those of us in the "I HEART BACON" club, there's chunks of pork belly to be enjoyed. Put them on the grill first. Once all the fat has rendered and has cooked down, a delicious piece of pig fat is yours for the eating.Las Vegans take their buffets seriously. Without variety, the over-eaters won't see value. There are two types of rice (red & white), lots of soups/stews, and a variety of korean and chinese appetizers. Odd ball, they've got California Rolls too. Taking into consideration that a plate of kalbi alone would cost around $25 at any normal Korean resturant, Sura is my #1 stop for Korean BBQ. Its cheap, delicious, and great for groups. Introduce a friend to Sura's Korean BBQ and go eat like a hippo.The cleanest and biggest AYCE KBBQ in town.  Grab plates of raw rib eye, brisket, kalbi, bulgogi, squid or chicken - but get only what you can finish so you don't have to pay extra.  While you wait for your food to cook, you can grab some shrimp/vegetable tempura, noodles and sushi.  I skip that part since I don't want to waste stomach space.Grab a small saucer of salt with sesame oil to dip meat in and chopsticks.  My favorites are rib eye, pork belly and brisket.  You'll probably want to go here towards the end of the day/ when you have no plans to go somewhere afterwards because you'll end up smelling like smoke/ BBQ.Sometimes you'll get a friendly server, other times you'll get the grumpy/impatient one who'll grab the tongs/ scissors from you and make you feel like you don't know what the heck you're doing.  Nevertheless, I do like this spot.I went to Sura tonight.  I usually come here every other week.  For the record, I am the Duke #1 regular here on Yelp.  I've checked in 23 times throughout 2-3  years.  Unfortunately this will be my last.  I bring a lot of friends and family here and recommend it to everyone.  This will also not happen anymore.  So what happened?  I was doing what I do every time I come here which was cooking Kalbi beef on the grill.  There seemed to have been a very irritable waiter who did not like the way I was cookng the meat.  He told me I can't cut the bones out.  I replied with, "do you want me to eat the bones?"  He then leaves the table and says it's ok.  I proceed to cut the meat the way I want.  I basically just cut the bones and chunks of fat out and eat the lean meat.  5  minutes go by and this overzealous waiter comes back and says the Owner said I can't cut the meat like that because the price of beef is going up and they will charge me extra..... I personally think this waiter guy instigated the whole thing and don't think the Owner had a problem with anything.   I politely asked him how he would like me to cut the meat and that I have been cutting it this way for years.  He didn't really show me how he would have liked me to cut it.  At this point, my buddy got annoyed and suggested we just leave.  So we did.  Honestly, who wants some punk waiter hovering over you and telling you how to cook your meat?  It's not even his meat ! I want to add this is the same clown that I dealt with last week that throws the bill on the table in the middle of the meal and says there is a "shift change" and to pay the bill right then and there.  But after further observation, my table was the only one that got hit with this "shift change" tactic.  The other tables around me didn't get this premature bill.  Did he think I was going to run out without paying?  Very bizarre individual.  I ended up going to Via Brasil in Summerlin where the wait staff was superior to Sura.  It was like night and day difference.  That Sura guy with the purple shirt and the glasses needs to apologize AND offer me a comp for me to come back and lift the boycott.  Otherwise, you will be seeing a new Duke here very shortly.Yelpers all know by now that I'm a 4th generation Japanese-American. But, what many of you don't know is that my Mom is actually Korean.  A significant reason I choose to identify as  Japanese over Korean was because since my childhood the Korean community has always rejected me. I just turned out way too Japanese looking, and my Korean features are philosophically just an non-observable genotype.  No matter how hard I tried to reach out to the Korean community, I was always pushed away.  I've probably only gotten along with 5-6 Korean people in my lifetime, and most of them were Zainichi Koreans or Koreans from South America. Because the Korean community pushed me away my whole life, I grew up not knowing anything about Korean cuisine. So I don't know if SURA is considered "good Korean food" by Korean people, but what matters is that I enjoyed every second of it. Of course my favorite Korean BBQ joint is and always will be Mr. Jake Lee's Honey Pig, but SURA has some advantages. The main advantage(and maybe the only advantage) is that SURA is a buffet style restaurant and you don't have to wait for a server to bring you more meat. Personally, I like Honey Pig better because they accommodate Japanese people and will give you Yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.  Also at Honey Pig they cook the meat for you, so you can just sit back and relax. The first time I came to SURA, I badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area. The server ran over.... and she looked really really pissed. I really liked the Kalbi here. I also really liked the pork bulgogi. You can tell it's been marinated over night because of the intense flavor. Even the California rolls were pretty good, and I don't even like California rolls. I'm actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because I've noticed that most Korean yelpers tend to give out a lot of 1-star ratings to Korean owned businesses.  They always complain about how the food is not as good as it is in Korea or "Ellie"(note- "Ellie" is how a lot of FOB Koreans pronounce L.A.).  I'm giving this place 5-stars because unlike full-Koreans, I actually support Korean business. btw... why is it that every Korean person has an Iphone 5? Shouldn't you guys support Korea and buy the Samsung Galaxy? How unpatriotic!my reviews are weirdNOT A KOREAN JUNK FOOD BUFFETIt's our first time and  the other couple had dined here ten times or more. One of them is also a Yelper (dormant).  I made mention that the reviews were either stellar or abysmal. They are the fussiest when it comes to comfort, service, food quality and value. I am also cognizant that at $25 per person they will be even more critical. Let's just say they want their money's worth and at this price level it's their threshold for dollars spent on a meal.We started at 5:30 pm and dined here for two and half hours.  Plenty of table service which included changing out the griddle five times and constantly removing dishes from our table.  Sometimes they were too vigilant trying to keeping our table clean and uncluttered. Yu-go had fun people watching too. Most interesting attires were being modeled by patrons. Glad the smoke from the griddle didn't obscure his vision.  LoLYu-go did most of the cooking which was our big advantage.  He doesn't mind all the work and in fact enjoys it. Besides he gets to jazz up the meats the way he wants it. Fortunately everyone at the table is adept to spicy and garlicky.There's nothing like a Korean bbq buffet to socialize and dine. Just remember that if you stay long enough, you'll eventually smell like a walking Korean bbq buffet. Pets at home will cling to you with affection as they think they are about to be feed Korean style.  LoL.I love korean BBQ and I love Sura's style concept.  The restaurant is buffet style. You pick the meats and dishes that you wish to have and bring it back to your table to grill. A server will bring you drinks and clean your grill ever so often. The food isn't bad but it isn't great. You might find some pieces of meet that are still frozen if you pick from the middle of the tray. I went to the restroom while eating here and witnessed an employee leaving the stalls without washing their hands only to later see her behind the buffet line serving meat.  True story. I was so disgusted I wanted to return back to the stall and puke. Since Sura's AYCE menu is around the same price of the others in town...I'd go elsewhere especially after using their restrooms.Been here at least 4 times already so yeah, a review should be done so here it is. First off, if you are a carnivore like I am, then this is the place for your All You Can Eat (AYCE) meat cravings. They have plenty of options like Beef Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Belly, thinly sliced Brisket and Cow Tongue. For dinner they have the good stuff like Short Ribs and small thick cuts of Ribeye. Not a meat lover? Well they do have Sushi, a Salad Bar, and a separate section of hot items like Fried Rice, Tempura, and Steamed Fish just to mention a few.If this is your first time, the rules are simple. Get food that you like whether its already cooked or not and sit down. Start eating cooked items while you are waiting for raw items to get done cooking. The servers take away your dirty dishes and refill your drinks. That's it. If you dont like how your the items you cooked tastes, then you have nobody to blame but yourself!This is my rule of thumb, always try to sample some of everything and then decide what you like the best and knock yourself out! Always get your money's worth! Even better when you have been here before because you should already know what you like.Service is hit or miss. One visit I barely saw my server so I did not get much refills and we had dishes all piled up at the edge of the table which was obvious our server was lacking. Another visit our server was checking up on us like every minute which was awesome! The hours here are pretty good. They are open from 11 am to 3 am every day! Also take note of the prices. Lunch is usually a little bit cheaper because there are some items that are only available during dinner which in turn means that the dinner prices are more expensive. Refer to my pic for full details on pricing.Some random info: Dont wear nice clothes when eating here. You will get grease that splatters from the grill on to your clothing not to mention the barbeque smell. Try going to any semi formal event after eating here and you will get people craving Korean barbeque as soon as they smell you. Lol. They have several flat panel LCD's so if the big game is going on they are more than likely will have it playing. Make sure to eat most of the food you brought to your table or they will charge you extra!Lastly, the 3 stars is mainly for the price and quality. Several years ago I remember dinner prices used to be around 20 bucks. They also used to have raw mussels and shrimp as well but now those are gone. This last time I went it was about 27 bucks a person without drinks. I can understand the price hike so that they can make money but taking stuff away while increasing prices is no bueno if you ask me.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #147 "Vegetarians need not apply"

02/07/10Ordered take-out, Whitey's White (white cheese pizza, alfredo sauce, and garlic.  Crust was too thick for mel- no crispy bits ANYWHERE.  Taste was OK, but not good enough for me to order again; I also had allergy issues after, but it's to be expected at chain locations such as this.  Tried reheating a couple of slices the next day, but they weren't any good (didn't crisp up, flavors gone), so I had to trash the rest.  Too bad- it would've been a great take-out place to hit up after visiting w/ friends in the area...

Review Text :
I think I may have just found the one.It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as "a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef." So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... Alright then, moving on...As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison.The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)

We came here after going to Casavino Winery and reading all the great Yelp reviews.  Typically I'm in agreement with fellow Yelpers, but this time I feel like they lead me astray.  The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the terrible service.  They were fairly busy, although not in a crazy way.  When we walked in the owner seemed more annoyed that she had another table to deal with than excited to have our business.  We asked for water when we sat down, which never came.  The food and wine was very slow to come out, and our server didn't come to check on us that often.  There were a few times that it felt like they forgot us!  There are a ton of great Italian restaurants out there, you may want to skip this one.

I'm sitting here emitting small, burgery burps of pure delight as I write this...no, sorry, there are just some things that you can't unread:)I walked over to David's for lunch today and found a Texas Burger, fries and a vanilla malt sitting on the counter in front of me...what was I supposed to do...ignore them?No...you can't ignore destiny and destiny was calling to me, in the form a 1/3 lb's burger, with an onion ring, crispy applewood smoked bacon, Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese and barbecue/ranch dressing/sauce (you read that right...they mix them together for the burger and damned if it doesn't work!) with a platter-full of fries:)This thing was everything you want from a diner burger, wrapped in wax paper and served still popping and sizzling from the grill.I was tempted to hoover that thing down in about 3 bites, but reason took over and I sat there at the counter and savored the burger and the experience of finding a new burger joint, sipping my malt (pretty decent malt, BTW), having a few fries and just letting a feeling of well being wash over me, like grease from a great burger down the front of the white dress shirt of my lunch hour (it's a metaphor:)This place is right off Scottsdale Rd., and in an era of flash and dazzle, this place won't win any interior decoration awards, but it's clean and relatively modern, they do have a big HDTV (doesn't everybody these days?), and a fireplace at one end of the place...the fireplace wasn't getting much of a workout today.David's menu aligns almost perfectly with the name of the joint...there are burgers and mexican food, and not much else. It's family owned and operated and nowhere near as busy as it should be!I haven't seen the pairing of burritos and malts anywhere else recently and that will be an interesting combo to try out one of these days.I'm gonna need to stock up on Pepcid AC:)The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)So I thought, "OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...You're Welcome!David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, "Delilah", She's a Lady" and, interestingly enough, his version of "Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)After our Farm Session and Old Town Farmer's Market tour, we walked around Old Town for a bit.  By now my daughter was hungry and everyone else in our party said, they could have a "snack".  We had coupons that Kevin N. had picked up so we were good to give David's a shot.  I was kinda torn between nachos and a Texas Burger.  I waffled but when it came time to order I went with the burger.  My daughter had a hot dog.  The Texas Burger is like the Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheese Burger which is one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Except this was a real pattie that looked like it had been shaped by human hands.....not shaped by a round or square cookie cutter.  And it tasted like a real burger should.  The bacon was crispy, cheese was melty, and the onion rings were crisp.  This was a good burger in my book.  The fries were crispy on the outside...just the way I like them and fluffly on the inside.  My daughter gave the thumbs up to her hot dog and devoured the whole thing.  My companions enjoyed their food as well.  The one drawback I would say is that the service was slow.  We waited for our drink order to be taken and the waited for our drinks.  Our drinks were not refilled very quickly.  It was not super busy when we were there so maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Will I go back...yes, because the value was there.  It was a good burger for the price, with or without the coupon.Found this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:Texas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizwHot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0QThe food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAgI went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.Next up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-QCooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.Fries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.Return Factor - 90%3.5While I'm almost a fan, I should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering.  Had it been Julio's Mexican Food & Other Stuff, my order would have been a wise choice.  But instead I ordered a carne asada quesadilla made by David who specializes in hamburgers.In all fairness to David, it was not bad.  I'm not a big quesadilla person, but the Mexican plates seemed to large for me to consume and expect to walk around the arts festival afterward.  And if I can't take it home, I'm inclined to stuff it down.  I didn't care for the meat in the quesadilla (not the seasoning, but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd), but it was perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggies as well.  My husband's hamburger, however, looked great and I was full of envy as I watched him finish it in record time.  That envy quickly turned to resentment as he sampled my quesadilla and remarked "yep, mine's better."  He would pay for his insensitivity later that afternoon.  I like that they will add flavorings to your soft drink, but my Cherry Coke needed more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice.I do love that this restaurant has not be redesigned to fit into the trend of turning "Old Town" into North Scottsdale, from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booths on the other.  I just think I'll still with burgers and shakes.  Well, who am I kidding?  I'll order David's Mexican food again.  I can't turn down anything in a tortilla.Apparently I'm the Duke on @Yelp or the Mayor on @FourSquare or something so I should probably write a review huh?So I've been in probably four times and liked it four times, in particular the guacomole burger with bacon and grilled onions.  They make a good, straightforward guac here, no tomato to adulterate it, no bastardization with mayo or some other foreign spread.  Just avacados, peppers, maybe some lime or lemon juice and some salt.  That's all guac needs really.Service has been great every time, the prices are reasonable...people, why aren't more of you eating here?  This is a great local spot for burgers, BLT's and the like.

Ok, if you want real Chinese food, this is the best one in town. As real as it can be--please don't order orange chicken, lemon chicken, or hot and sour soup...ect here, not saying they are not good in Jade house, these are American food, get them somewhere else. So talking about real Chinese food, you don't even need a Chinese menu to order, try anything that shown in the pictures along the wall, they are all good!! I live in north Phoenix cave creek area, I drive to there for dinner twice a week. Yes, more than 60 miles every time, totally worth it.

Three point six seven nine stars.I have some gift cards from Carrabba's and I must say that even though I am fairly anti-chain and pro-independent...Carrabba's ain't half bad.  As a matter of fact it's better than half good.The service here was outstanding and the food was well beyond just ok - better than I was expecting from a chain.We ordered several things to share amongst the family - spaghetti with meatballs, chicken caeser salad, mozzarella sticks.  I particularly enjoyed the chicken caesar salad.I still prefer independents but Carrabba's is a safe chain apparently.  I think.

So The wife and kids are out skating and I have zero coordination so I eat instead. I drove to one place, closed! I drove to another, closed! So at this point I will just have another freakin drive through or something. I see a place called Burger Studio, there are several people walking around and the place looks busy. I walk over and realize it is friends of the owners and their kids, 2 owners and 3 workers. Not exactly clients ya know. The place is brand spankin new. They opened last week. The decor is a modern, decor. (hence STUDIO) There are about 5-7 tables that seat about 4 at each. It looks really cool. The owners are really nice, they can fill you in about the type of beef they prefer and why it is better then the rest. They are really enthusiastic about the place. It is certified Angus beef and a full 1/2lb, cooked to order on a flat grill, not a fire type grill. The beef is specially made for them by a company in Colorado. They are frozen but the owners said you still can taste the difference. They season the meat and toast the buns. The bun is a torta sized bun and is excellent! OK, so I am a huge burger fan, but I like a flame grilled burger, this one was good but not my style. I also can pick a frozen burger out of a line up, no matter how good the beef is. There is no substitute for fresh beef. I hope in time the grill will be better seasoned and give the burger a little more crispy burntness. I liked the fact they only had burgers, not like all the rest of the burger, dogs, chicken etc. places. If you are going to do one thing do it the best you can. I will be back and I will send people their way.The husband and I came here after work because I was starving.  Upon walking in, I was really excited and I felt like this was going to be a 5 star place.  The decor was simple and clean, and it kind of reminded me of my house.  Then it became a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollars.  A little pricey for me.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that touted applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tots.  Yum!Our food arrived, and well, I subtracted another star because it was sloppy looking and frankly, a tad unappetizing.  My tots were pretty dark but I happen to like mine overcooked so they are really crispy.  Other people may be very disappointed with this.  The burger was very large, but the patty was very commercial.  My bacon was the biggest disappointment.  It was translucent!  I expected nice thick cut bacon when ordering an expensive burger.  The taste was no better than appearance.  It was incredibly grease laden, so much so that it made the bun soggy.  Additionally, I am 99.4% sure that everything they used comes from Costco.  The patties were definitely the same ones that come in a big stack with sheets of paper between them.  The bacon was definitely the kind that comes in the big giant reseable Kirkland bag.  Yikes.  Not good.  We're down to two stars.After I didn't finish eating my burger, I felt pretty gross.  It took a few minutes to sink in, but I realized I just put an immense amount of grease into my tummy.  I am not one to shy away from greasy diner breakfasts and the like, but holy crap, this was a new level.  I didn't feel well.  An hour later, I am definitely sick  Now we are down to one star.  I have a wicked stomach ache as I write this review.  Ugh.  I want to vomit so I can just get this crap out and pretend it never happened.  What a disappointment.We were not greeted when we walked in the door.  The lady running the counter gave us a surly look and went back to restocking the counter items.  Then, after she changed the small garbage bucket, while wringing garbage juice off her hand, she asked what we wanted.We just stopped in for a snack and I had wanted to try their food, so we ordered the sliders to share along with some sweet potato fries and a tea.  No thank you or smile or anything, we were obviously just in her way.Our sliders arrived with sweet potato fries that were obviously sitting out for the day.  Cold, lifeless and disgusting.  I went back inside and asked for a fresh batch and got dirty looks from everyone.  While waiting for the fresh fries, we ate the sliders, which were pretty good.  The burger, bun, onions and cheese were tasty, something I'd be happy having again.  But not with service like this and I also noticed that mid afternoon while the staff stood behind the grill eating (2 people observed eating while working, one was garbage juice hand girl), the main garbage remained overflowing with disgusting refuse spattered on the white garbage stand.  Ick.While the sliders were fine and the fresh fries were pretty decent, the service, attitude, people eating during their shift and lack of clean up were not something I'd like to plan my meal around.  I predict an upcoming health code violation.  No gold or silver stars in their future...

I'm another New Yorker reviewing the pizza here.I can't tell you how many pizza places I've tried before I happened in here one night. And I am SO glad that I did. I figured I'd leave disappointed - like usual - but holy shit.This pizza reminds me of the place that I used to go to around the block from my house in New York. It's literally perfect New York pizza. I am SO thankful that I found this place, because I couldn't stomach choking down another slice from another stupid NY pizza knockoff place.I mean it, no other pizza place in Las Vegas will have my business from now on. If you're from New York and you're really craving a slice, I don't care if you're driving here from Nellis Air Force base. Get your ass over here, splurge on your gas bill, and enjoy a mouth watering slice of authentic New York pizza.I started to write a 4-star review on this place and thinking about the food made me hungry, especially seeing that they offer pizza by the slice,so for the first time I drove down there (I have only used their delivery service) and decided pick up lunch.My first impression was the place is incredibly clean.  I would trust them with my food based on this alone.  The staff was very friendly, quick, professional.  I was amazed by the enormous menu.  This is not a pizza joint; much more a restaurant.  I sat gazing at all of the choices on their menu for the entire time I was waiting for my order and will probably be calling them for dinner.  It does not seem that their online menu does justice to all of the options they offer.The pizza is always stellar, the baked ziti flavorful and .... screw the adjectives... its just good.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Hands down it is the best pizza establishment in my area.  I would probably even call these guys over Rosati's if they were still around here.It is nice seeing a family run business with good food and friendly staff.  I would give them my business for that reason alone.... it is a huge bonus that the food is phenomenal.

Review Text :
After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.We rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.We sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.I ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.As the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.Those who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of "scene."  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!

Depending when or if you eat here, service is really night and day. That being said, I'm breaking this review down to food/service in AM and PMNight:  4 StarsAt night, I noticed that there was only a handful of servers working.  But this wasn't an issue since our food was prepared and delivered pretty quick. The servers are also very attentive and at the same time in no rush to get your out of the restaurant.  For dinner, I had their special, which is their half chicken for $7.99.  Starving like a madman, I ended up getting 2 orders making that one full chicken for me.  Yes, I finished it. Yes, I was stuffed. This was pretty and cheap considering how much I got.  The rest of the menu actually looked pretty good and there's enough of a selection for everybody.Morning: 2 StarsIt's actually busier in the morning and they know this. My issue, service really lags here.  With 8 servers working, you would think that water and our orders would be quicker than 15 minutes. Food comes out quick once you finally get someone to take your order.  It's the pre-order part where you need some patience.  What's worse, once you get your food, your check is also handed to you. It's almost like they can't wait for you to leave unlike at night where our server told is to take our time.  For breakfast, I got their 3 egg white omelet w/spinach and mushrooms. This was so delicious that I almost moved the stars up to 3.I had a good experience at night and a poor one in the morning.  I think that my overall rating of 3 stars is fair.The Promenade Cafe is the cafe of the J.W. Marriott Resort at Summerlin / The Rampart Casino. It is the go to restaurant for casual dining in this Summerlin property.  In the last couple of months when I was in the area I had dinner here. What strikes me about Promenade  Cafe is that it is inside an attractive casino resort that is surrounded by golf courses and upmarket homes, yet charges prices similar to a Boulder Highway casino. On both visits, I'd enjoy a taste of Boulder Highway in the heart of Summerlin.   The two meals that I enjoyed here have been the chicken fettuccine and spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccine is one of three $9.99 deals where you pick a soup or salad, a listed entrée, and choice of a listed dessert. Of course the beverage and tip accelerate the bill to around $15 which is worth it. The food was good. The strawberry cheesecake was puny. On this visit the tone of the service was Allright with the exception of a major restaurant etiquette no! no! When a guest is still working on the entrée, you never ever place the dessert on the table. Talk about being hurried. And why? I was one of the few guests in the restaurant. On Saturday, I stopped here after Dessert Shores where I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs that included soup or salad. It costed $7.99 comparable to an old school casino. Spaghetti with meatballs is also one of the few $9.99 dinners. The $2 difference is the puny dessert. The chicken noodle soup was in a bowl in lieu of a cup that is the standard in many resorts. I appreciated the larger portion. The spaghetti with meatballs was okay. To be honest this is fool proof course that is impossible to mess up. But it fell short of the spaghetti & meatballs that I am a fan of in the Railroad Pass Casino. Three meatballs accompanyed the spaghettis. It would of been nice if Promenade Cafe offered Grated to put on the spaghetti as most places do. Maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor.   Spending some time here, I observed that the Starbuck's down the hall closes around 9 P.M. In the later hours of the evening this is the spot for coffee.  In conclusion, Promenade Cafe is a decent restaurant  to enjoy an old school casino style dinner in the heart of Summerlin. Compared to the cafe in the Sun Coast  a traffic signal south on Rampart Boulevard, I prefer it over the Promenade Cafe. My final verdict: Promenade Cafe 3 Stars.

Review Text :
My daughter and her boyfriend had spotted a "Grand Opening" sign on this little restaurant in a local strip mall recently and wanted to try it so all three of us went here on Monday April 18.  Wow--great place!  The server couldn't have been sweeter, more informative or more attentive.  They have all the usual dishes, plus more unusual ones like Alligator, Snails, Anti-oxident drinks.  I ordered the Quail, fried (or you can get it rotisserie-style), daughter got a chicken dish and shared her delicious rice with me (mine only came with accompanying greens but no noodles or rice), her boyfriend got a combination Pho soup that included pork, liver, quail egg, squid, crab, shrimp, rice noodles and we shared some crispy egg rolls for a starter.Everything was top quality and fresh and very reasonably priced (about $6-8 ea).  We were very happy we went here and the server gave us a coupon for 10% off our next visit.  I will definitely put this one on my go-to list for future trips.Since October, I have had an obsession with the Pho at Blue Moon. Since discovering this little Pho jewel, I've probably come for dinner 14 times - 3 times by myself (I can't believe I'm admitting this to you..). So, clearly I'm a Pho-lover, and as far as Pho goes in the Valley, this place serves some of the best. It's run by a very nice Vietnamese family - always friendly and smiling. The location itself is small and modestly decorated, but it's bright and clean and usually full of people! Most of the times I've come, the majority of the other patrons have been Vietnamese families, which I'd say is a good sign for the authenticity of Blue Moon. Soup has to be one of the most comfortable meals around. At Blue Moon, they serve traditional Pho with rare steak, tripe, and tendon, and also have brisket and meatballs. Don't be shy, get the large! I alternate between rare steak and meatballs, the chicken pho, and then the pho with veggies, and I load each one with a healthy squirt of sriracha hot sauce, sprouts and basil. The veggies usually include carrots, bok choy, and broccoli - colorful, crispy, and plentiful. Love it. If I am very hungry, I start with the egg rolls - shrimp and pork goodness in a crispy wrapper. Although I only ever order the Pho (they have a 50% off special - $3.50 for a great meal!), the rest of their menu looks delicious. They have family dinner specials (for 2 to 6 people) with several different dishes that are a great deal. They have other noodles and soups, as well as meat, chicken or tofu dishes served with rice. They also have seafood appetizers and main courses, like sauteed clams or salted catfish. One day I'll branch out from the Pho and try the other Vietnamese delicacies, but for now, I am hooked on Pho!

Best... Steak... EVER!!That's it. Those three simple words sum up my experience this evening. Oh, you want more?! Okay!!Upon entering the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino on my rez.. the Gila River Indian Community, one can find new slot machines, a lounge with waterfalls that can make someone drunk just from staring at it, fresh clean(ish) air... and my favorite amenity... the Verona Steakhouse!!Entering the nice clean and dare I say it... swanky Chophouse Steakhouse... is both casual and fine dining. Grandma's in their Blue Light special tunics and oxygen tanks sit enjoying enormous Cesar salads that was made table side (!) by well trained servers. I looooove the decor! I small found small touches that reminded me of home, the tortoise shell ceiling that melded traditional Pima basket designs with Italian decals, interesting. There's a nice mural and huge windows that with Cafe 24/7 encircle a very beautiful fountain. (I'm assuming this is to recreate a whirlwind design, which is a well known symbol to my tribe, "all crazy times are a whirlwind" - Pima proverb) If you're dining indoors, especially in the day time its very nice to have these huge windows, I kinda wished we were sitting by one of them! Our server Jessica presented us with some bread and made a dipping sauce made with Bellagio olive oil, balsamic vinegar, freshly grated parm and cracked pepper. Lovely. I couldn't get enough!I ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!! Never, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward. My mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH! I know I know... ugh, some ppl! :P) But it was very good... even if they ruined it to her specifications! We ate to our hearts content and walked away very happy with our meal. I ran into my biological mom (long story) and her husband celebrating their wedding anniversary, I told the waiter and he hooked them up with a free dessert! How awesome is that?! The manager walked the front of the house asking everyone (including us) how our meals were going. They pay attention to the small details, which is something I notice and appreciate. I may not be able to afford it ALL the time... but I will DEFINATLY be back with MANY more in tow!! I wish they were open 24 hours like the other restaurant at the Casino, but alas - they have lunch and dinner service only. To my yelpers, I say... GO, GO NOW!! What are you waiting for?! I don't care if you're not in the area... GO! Its not THAT expensive... quit crying! :P Go and enjoy yourself!! Try some wine and give the Cesar salad that's prepared table side! And don't forget the cannoli! I hear it's yummy! And be sure to play a few slots on your way out! ;)Verona is a welcome addition to the valley.  I don't care for casinos and the smarminess that seems to infuse them.  But once you pass through the smoky crowds and in to Verona, you are in a different place.  For new construction, they managed to pull off some old school steakhouse atmosphere.As for the food:  Let's start with the premise that I don't like steak.  I never order steak.  I ordered a pasta dish and my fabulous wife ordered a surf' n 'turf special with a lobster tail and an 8 oz filet mignon.Next time I'm getting that.  I told our waiter Anthony that I don't really like steak but I would come back for that steak.  Since I would order it medium well, how would they prepare it?  Anthony told me that in that case they would butterfly the cut so that it could be done to my satisfaction yet retain its tender juiciness.  And the lobstah?  I lived in New England for about 3 years before arriving in Phoenix...I've had lobstah that is moments from the boat.  Verona served up a pretty good lobstah tail, particularly considering we are in the middle of the desert.  The roasted new potatoes and asparagus that came with this dinner were delicious as well.My pasta consisted of penne pasta with a rather sweet tomato and cream reduction sort of sauce with Italian sausage and panchetta.  Very tasty but not fabulous.  In true form, this place is all about the steak.We also shared a caesar salad which had a nice and authentic caesar dressing.  By authentic I mean that the anchovy flavor came through nicely.  Oh and it comes in a bowl made of fried cheese.  Seriously.  Take a bite of that bowl.They have a nice wine list and I recommend the listed table red.  Good stuff.  We shared tiramisu for dessert.  Again, very tasty and made authentic with mascarpone cheese, not custard.Service was very good throughout.  My one small complaint was that my water glass went empty several times and it took a few minutes to get a refill.  In fairness, many restaurants miss this mark because I am one of those diners that puts down about a 1/2 gallon of water with a meal.  Just leave the a pitcher after the second or third refill.The Better Half and I had dinner here recently.  We were excited to give it a try.  We ordered:Fried Ravioli, $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Cb5qWTxGOT-CTNHRd_Cuowhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=8SLMGwC5pH0GiMsjM-pT9wSalad, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=jhtp-tVJy5UzPsx55WUs2QOnion Soup, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=5Dyslao6BSIQ0VxV1_Z9pQRigatoni Al Forno (Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Peppers, Red Onions, $16)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=US3FGoiG1caGrHhaFRgZTwFilet, $24http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=ajrFcMCfbTBkt_A-qPCoHQSide of Spaghetti, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Q7bhq4rZOvCuZuvQdHrcPwCheesecake, $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=u4L7008Zsgwss-u8uvih9wThe Fried Ravioli was just OK.  It was very oily and was a little bland.  Not what I expected from this dish....looked a little undercooked or the fryer's temperature was too low.The Salad and Onion Soup was pretty good.  Onion Soup was full of flavor.I had the Filet and thought it was a little tough....the flavor was good, but the Filet was not tender like I'm use to.  The Better Half had the Rigatoni and gave me a little to sample.  It was just OK too....the Sausage tasted more like a Kielbasa rather than an Italian Sausage....not what I expected.  The side of Spaghetti was decent, but again nothing spectacular.The Cheesecake was very good....nice and fluffy.The service was a little spotty.  Our server disappeared for long stretches....which was odd because there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant with people dining.....what he was doing was beyond me.Overall, it was an average experience.  Not what we were expecting from a joint like this.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day?Return Factor - 40%

Ok so the first time I tried these guys I gave them 2 stars. I don't know why it took me over a year to try them out again but I should of done it earlier! I remember the pizza was just ok. This time I tried their wings because it was 40 cent wing Tuesday. 60 Wings for 25 bucks is not a bad deal at all. They have some good choices for your sauces. The 6 flavors I got were Spicy Bbq, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Medium Hot, Tangy Carolina, and Honey Barbeque. All were good. I also had two orders of the garlic knots. Man they are addicting! You cant eat just one! Comes with marinara sauce to dip it in. They have all other sorts of food items, like chicken fingers, wraps, and calzones just to name a few. Their large menu has all these and more so if you cant make up your mind, just pick something and come back another time to try the other stuff.These guys have all sorts of specials. If you check in you can get 5 dollars off any 18 inch pizza. They also have a 10 for 20 dollar offer. If you look on their in store to go menu and website, (www.deluciaspizzeria.com) All the daily and weekly specials are on there. My favorites are the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 5 dollars lunch deal and 40 cent wing Tuesdays.Service is good. They are a family owned restaurant so you know they are always trying to work hard to earn your business. Some random info: Hours are Mon thru Thurs 11 am to 9 pm, Fri and Sat 11 am to 10 pm. Closed Sundays. They have a flat screen HD tv so you can watch your favorite sporting event while eating or waiting for your food.So Delucia's im glad I checked you out again and I will be back for sure!I have never been so disappointed in my life after waiting for 40 minutes , I received my order went home and opened the pizza boxes and BURNT BURNT to a crisp , I called and explained to them that the pizzas are burnt they said to come back and I could get a new one . However I live 10 minuets away and the kids were hungry and couldn't waste any more time to on driving back and waiting another 40 minuets to get pizza , so I told them I wasn't able to come back today then she said she could give me 10% off my next pizza really not coming back NOPE not for a 1.50 off 1 pizza after I sent $40.00 bucks .. SO DISAPPOINTEDI've been here twice now and that will be enough for me. The first visit I stopped in on a lunch break around 11:20 am. I noticed a sign outside promoting a 2 slice and drink deal for $5.99, so I asked the lady at the register for that. She rolled her eyes and said they had only opened at 11, so I'd have to wait for the pizza to be made. The lady made me feel like I was bothering her by coming inside and ordering during regular business hours. If they open at 11 then why not have pizza ready or close to ready at 11? I arrived almost a half hour after they were opened she should have been prepared to serve customers and with a friendlier tone. I had planned to eat inside, but asked for it to-go since I felt uncomfortable eating inside because of the vibe I got from the employee. Whens she handed me the food she never said thanks just "here you go" and then went back behind the counter. I often eat at Cugino's on Decatur near the 215 (walmart parking lot) and they also sell pizza by the slice and sometimes run out because they get busy and the older guy there always takes the time to make fresh pizzas and first warn customers how long it will be for the pizza to be ready. I never mind waiting there and wouldn't have minded waiting here at Delucia's if the service and food were worth it. The pizza I had was not cooked all the way. The crust was raw in a lot of spots and I couldn't even eat it. Complete wast of time and money.I met hubby for lunch earlier this week and he picked the spot, being this place, blah. He knows I love pizza and thought we could try this place. He didn't remember this was the spot I told him about not that long ago that served me somewhat raw pizza and that I didn't want to go back. Since he took the time to search the place out I figured I'd give it another try. This visit there were 2 different ladies working behind the counter and they were very friendly and a big change from what I experienced a few months prior. I decided this time to try the pizza again, but this time priced at $6.99 I chose a special that included 2 cheese slices and a side salad. When I opened the box and saw the burnt spots on the 2 cheese slices, it just didn't look appetizing. I bit into the first slice and the crust was stale tasting and burnt. I looked underneath the slices and sure enough it was burnt. I couldn't eat much of it because the flavor was just terrible. I moved next to the side salad. When I first opened the container and saw the salad, I thought it looked very good. The lettuce looked very fresh, but when I mixed up the salad, I found rotten veggies under a big pile of black olives. Gross! Hubby had the same problem with his pizza being burnt and he called a bit later to let them know and they did offer him 10 percent off the next order, but really that's it? The proper thing to do would be to refund the order or better yet, remake the order and try to keep a customer. I noticed in other reviews and pictures that other customers have been having the same issues with burnt pizza and the business responds, so clearly they are aware that this isn't just a random issue, but an issue that keeps happening. I know darn well that the person making my food saw what she boxed up and should have never served it to a customer in the condition it was in. They are fully aware of the type of food they are really putting out. No 3 strikes for me, it's 2 and you're out!Terrible terrible terrible!!! My pizza was burnt and tasted stale and old. I don't know if they heat up pizzas from the day before but it tasted that way. I ordered my food for take out and when I saw how burnt and not edible the pizza was I called to let them know I wasn't happy and they only offered a small discount on my next visit. Pfffft like I will visit here again! The lady on the phone could have cared less and she I'm sure saw the pizza she boxed up and knew it was burnt. I want to see this lady feed her family food just like I got but I'm sure they get fed better. She should have offered a free meal on another visit or that day offered to correct the burnt one. Clearly by other yelp reviews and pictures of burnt pizza that others have posted you can see this place is not a legit pizza place but not even edible. The prices on their menu, website and take out menus all have different prices too which makes the place not look honest. A response from the owner filled with excuses like I see she's done on other reviews means nothing to me you'll never win me back.

I love this place! My kids love this place! My friends live this place!Dragon Express the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. When we lived in Chandler, we ordered from Dragon Express delivery at least once or twice a month. The food was always fresh and delicious. The manager was super sweet and was always the driver when we ordered. Now that we live in Mesa, we are out of their delivery area so we eat in the dining room when we venture over in that area. It's such an awesome feeling being remembered by the staff since visits are few and far between these days. Hot n Sour Soup, Crab Rangoon, Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian Beef.... Honestly, I don't think we've tried one thing that we haven't loved!Nom nom nom nom... Oh, what's that? That's the sound of me stuffing my face full of food from Dragon Express. The food here is super fresh, perfectly cook (that zucchini - flawless) and has fabulous flavor! Service was friendly and patient as we hummed and hawed deciding what to order and the food came out fast in under 10 minutes. Couldn't be happier with the experience!

Review Text :
This review is for the restaurant only. Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. Hostess: Can I help you?Me: Yes, reservation for David.Hostess: What time?Me: 9:15Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. Me: OK, can we be seated still?Hostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.At this point my wife says to me "let's go".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.I had a really fun dinner here on Saturday night with four girlfriends. This is the perfect spot for dinner before a night out. We shared several things but the highlights were the seabass, the vegetarian dim sum, the sweet and spicy lobster and the chive noodles. Skip the truffle duck. It was a huge disappointment. Cocktails were sweet and strong and the wine we ordered was great. Our server, Brian, was excellent. The macaroons were surprisingly good, albeit a bit random for a Chinese restaurant. After dinner head to the lounge and then the club. Sure to make for a great Vegas evening!3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:OUTSTANDING DISHES:Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included "Try a Little Tenderness" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  DECENT:Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.DON'T EVEN BOTHER:To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.This is a damn good restaurant, I can see where all the hype comes from.  Multiple people in past months have told me that Hakkasan serves some of the best food they have ever had, I had a hard time believing that until yesterday.  The food is exceptional.  My fear was that the plates were going to be small and that I would have to order a lot to get full, but quite honestly, as long as you order one small and one large entree, you should be fine.Highlights for me (carnivore) were the duck salad and the rib eye entree.  Good lord, the duck salad does not look very appetizing when it first comes out, but oh my it was good.  It almost looks like the duck is on a bed of dry grass (looks strange), but do not worry, for a party is about to start in your mouth!!  Clean pieces of crispy duck accompanied with those greens (not really sure what kind they were) with fruit like pomegranate.  The salad was lightly dressed, didn't need help with much of a heavy dressing.  Simple, clean flavors, wow!The rib eye, I have never had rib eye this tender in my whole life.  I need to learn how they prepare it, very exceptional dish.  Cocktails done right!  I suggest the Broken Promise if you are into bourbon.Happy dining!!Having heard about Hakkasan from friends in London and Hong Kong, I was excited to dine at the restaurant with my friends. As a vegetarian, I was impressed not only by the large variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant, but also by the relative authentic flavor of the dishes. Without doubt, Hakkasan is a restaurant that is friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores. All my friends agreed the soup in Hakkasan are authentic and well executed, and they highly recommend the soup to Yelpers. Their favorites are chicken soup and the lobster soup. The former composes of red dates, black chicken and several Chinese medicine ingredients. According to one of my friends, she never had this soup outside of China, and was impressed by Hakkasan's effort in creating this dish. Another friend of mine also greatly enjoyed the lobster soup, which had lobster, tofu and mushroom. In her perspective, the mushroom enhances the flavor, while the tofu complexes the textures. For vegetarian Yelpers, I recommend the mushroom lettuce wrap, which is a refreshing alternative to the tofu lettuce wrap. While the pine nuts increases the texture of the dish, I suggest the chef increasing the ratio of mushroom to pine nuts in order to further enhance the flavor. I appreciate the waitress promptly refiling the lettuce for me. The vegetarian dim sum platter is a beautifully decorated dish that I would suggest sharing amongst friends. Although each dim sum was well executed, it tasted very similar to each other. All the dim sum were mainly composed of mushroom and used similar sauce. I recommend the chef increasing the variety of ingredients and sauce for the dim sum platter. While my friends and I greatly enjoyed the food at Hakkasan, we recommend the manager to provide more training to the waitresses. Our waitress was attentive, but she did not seem to know the menu well and asked my friend repeatedly where she saw fresh lemonade as a drink. As the lemonade was advertised as fresh, I hope Hakkasan will provide fresh juice instead of the sparkling lemonade in the future. I recommend Hakkasan to friends and couples, who are looking for a Chinese restaurant with well-executed food and a hip vibe.Tip for Yelpers:You can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.Ummm ...seriously it will probably take me a few hours just to start this review as I am still in a food coma from Friday night when we all dined at Hakkasan.We made a reservation and were seated immediately, cha-ching. We were all overwhelmed with the menu as honestly EVERYTHING looked spectacular. At the recommendation of our waiter as well as a friend, we ordered:* duck salad - umm yeah so when our friend said "oh you guys should try this" we were all like mmm yeah...duck...about that.... None were interested to try this at all. I am NOT a fan of duck...not just like the polite "oh no thank you" but the like "get that away from me". When it arrived, I was looking over like "should I try it? What do I do?" Everyone else was eating it. I'm supposed to be the foodie over here...Ahh. So I caved. I went for it. Wait for it...wait for it...Hi, I'm Melanie and I now like duck. The flavors all blended together so smoothly that no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. It's scrumptious! A must order. All of us enjoyed it (rare, but then again, it was in a salad, and my friends on the trip only ate salads...women!). I was all like "let's get the fried dumplings" and they're all like "mmm what about a salad?" NO! We are on a vacation and so dumplings we ate...with the salad of course.* hakka steamed dim sum platter - MMMM especially the one with the scallop! AHHH I wanted to order 100 of these. * shanghai dumpling (which I asked them to make steamed rather than fried and they honored this request) - the dipping sauce was out of this world as were the dumplings themselves. I LOVE dumplings...like if there was a word that described love multiplied by 564376724724 to infinity and beyond, I would use that to describe my feelings toward dumplings. It's a sick obsession. Therefore, I have very strict standards of what a dumpling should taste like. Trust me on this one, these dumplings passed the test. I am still dreaming of them.* stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce (I switched the duck for shrimp which again they honored) this thing was like 12 buck$. If anyone can complain in a Yelp review on here about price and portion size, please don't ever dine at a fine dining restaurant ever again. This portion was bigger than a regular full-size dinner portion and yet was listed on the "sides" menu. It was more than satisfying and honestly if I just had this in itself, I would have probably been full. So it honestly ALL depends what you order and you have to pretty much get a sense of the menu to see what the bigger portions will be (or simply just ask). * steamed red snapper in spicy assam sauce - holy moly. Flavor order-load. You just have to experience it for yourself. Seriously. Do it.* cod...yeah I'm just going to put cod because I can't remember which damn one we got (ugh, what a Yelper I am). Take a gamble on this one folks, you have a 50/50 chance of eating what we ate (although I'm sure the other cod dish is equally as good).* fruit plate....yes as we were adjusting our belts (from all the food) and getting ready for a night filled with laughter and cocktails and all that heartfelt butterfly crap (aka a night on the town in Vegas), then the fruit plate came. It was like a scene out of jaws, you know the "dun dun, dun dun" music was playing in our ears and there it was...almost half the size of my entire body. Ok no, but you get the point. It was huge and SO well presented. I seriously did not want to eat it!!! But we did...and it was like we were so full we were about to burst and just couldn't stop eating it...I don't know what else they put in this fruit place besides, well fruit, but yuuuuuuuum! Fruit never tasted so good.With such an extensive menu, of course you are going to have a huge range of things to order and various prices that go along with the various dishes. If you want to dine on a budget, order one main course and maybe 2 sides. There ya go and now stop complaining, geez. You can find things on the menu that are EXTREMELY expensive...if you are on a budget, here's a tip, don't order it. There are reasonable things as well. However, I wouldn't suggest dining at Hakkasan on a strict budget as you really should order many dishes to get the full experience (but it can be done). AMBIANCE. You just have to check it out for yourself...let's just say: amazing. This was definitely a meal to remember and definitely the next time we come back, our first stop will be Hakkasan.3.5 stars so I'm rounding up. I went with a group of beautiful friends. I had a hard time finding this place since I lost my glasses. But if I would've known to look for a big blue wall, I wouldn't have ended up outside MGM! We were still waiting for a few people so we had drinks at the bar. I got The Hakka.We ordered from the $118 prix fixe menu but they also have prix fixe menus starting at $66 as well as a la carte. We had a vegetarian in the group and their vegetarian options actually seemed promising enough for me to want to try it. But no, I'm a carnivore - who am I kidding? From the signature menu, we got a lot of dishes.The Hakka:Vodka, sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice.SMALL EAT:Hakka Fried Dim Sum Platter (roasted duck pumpkin puff, XO seafood puff and crispy prawn dumpling).Jasmine Tea Smoked Beef Short Rib: Seared Scallop with Fresh Mango and Chili Sauce:MAIN:Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey:Crispy Roasted Duck with Kumquat and Mustard Sauce:Braised Tiger Prawn Claypot with Taro in Mandarin Sauce:Stir-fry Rib Eye Beef with Black Pepper and Merlot:Stir-fry Sugar Snaps and Cloud Ear:Egg and Scallion Fried Rice:DESSERT:Coconut Pudding:Coconut pearl pudding, lime financier topped with caramelized spiced pineapple.Chocolate and Black Sesame Cremeux:Black sesame Florentine and yuzu ice cream.Although one might argue that you can get Chinese food for much less in Chinatown, do understand that their version is a bit more sophisticated. They use wagyu, truffles, abalone, etc. which aren't cheap. You're also paying for the location and ambiance.I've been to other Asian restaurants on the strip, and they have one or more of the following issues: low quality food, sad excuses for portions, and/or overpriced dishes.  It's odd to say, but fortunately Hakkasan only suffers from that third one.The interior is really one gigantic space, but seems like a big labyrinth with multiple rooms and halls due to the tall partitions set up throughout.  There are many dining tables and a bar tucked away in the back.  Some drinks were creative, others were easily available elsewhere, but they'll all run you $15-$20 each.The menu has many appetizers, sides, and entrees to choose from, as well as a few tasting menus available, which require four people in your party to order.  For a party of six, we ordered four tasting menus and a few other dishes to round out our meal.  For a set menu that is meant for four, it comes with a surprising amount of food that easily filled up the six of us.  Nothing was disappointing, but the standouts for me were the crispy duck salad (they do not skimp on the portions here, if you enjoy duck, get this dish), duck with truffle oil (again, good portions), and the wagyu beef stir fry.The food was well prepared, in generous portions, and left all of us feeling satisfied.  The part that makes Hakkasan hard to recommend is the pricing.  The tasting menu we ordered was $118 per person, and most dishes are $30 each.  Total for our meal was over $1,000, which is ridiculous for six people eating Chinese food.  Fortunately, and the main reason we came, we were able to enjoy a promotion that got us 50% off our entire bill.  In the end it was around $80 per person, which is much more reasonable, but arguably still a lot.The pricing at Hakkasan makes it hard place to wholeheartedly recommend, but unlike other Asian restaurants on the Strip you'll actually end up with a good meal if you decide to spend the money here.Swanky Anglicised Cantonese served in a modern, chic Asian inspired dining space.  The food; the dog's bollocks.  Excellent.  Unfortunately combine it's Michelin one star status in London with the typical markup on anything Asian on the Strip, the prices will make you ask if they are taking the piss and leave you gobsmacked. (OK enough British slang).Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices. So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***This was a late addition to my Restaurant Week lineup.  I'm so glad I made the change.  I was warmly greeted at reception and asked to wait until one of the people who seat you arrived.  A short time later, I was taken to my table through what appeared to be a maze of small hallways and dining spaces.  I was seated at a table in a section near the bar that was L shaped.Soon, the server, Carmen, arrived and she asked me about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea and that was brought quickly with a small container of simple syrup.  I had studied the menu online and I knew what I wanted except for the main course.  I asked Carmen for her advice.For the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.For the main course, I went with the stir fried venison with spicy yellow bean sauce.  There were three thin slices of venison in a great spicy sauce.  With the venison, I was served two sides--a small container of fried pak choi with garlic and a small bowl of vegetable fried rice.  Carmen brought me a knife and fork for this course knowing it would be easier to deal with the meat.  I had requested wooden chopsticks (they don't have them) because I am very poor at using plastic chopsticks.  Things slip off plastic chopsticks very easily even when I'm just looking at them.  I'll have to bring in my own wooden ones or my screw together metal chopsticks that were a gift.  Again, the dish was spicy but it was not overpowering spicy.  It was quite enjoyable.There is no choice for dessert.  You get a passion fruit panna cotta with, as the menu says, citrus supremes, guava gelato, and blood orange sorbet.  Carmen had me listen to a crackling sound when she first brought the dessert.  She wouldn't tell me what it was but said I should try it and we'd talk about it when I was done.  I had two things in mind for what it was.  I was correct with the second idea.  They put some pop rocks on the panna cotta to make a bit of a texture play.  The panna cotta was very good.To sum up, the food really is the "dog's bollocks!" (Thanks R).  Portion size was just right and they downsized the sides because I was dining alone.  The room is delightful--not one large room but made up of many smaller areas.  The restaurant really isn't all they big in the great scheme of things.  Service was excellent.Before bringing the bill, Carmen brought me a coupon good for $50 on my next visit as long as it's used before April 10.  She said, "It's like having your dinner tonight for $.14."  I will be back and use the coupon.  I have to do the sea bass which she said was their most popular dish and is excellent.  One short aside:  I can hike in the desert where there's no trail.  Leaving last night without an escort, I ended up almost in the kitchen.  Then I realized I had almost made a complete trek around the outside ring of the place.  I did make it to the door and was somewhat embarrassed getting lost in the small space.  It's a like a maze!I'm glad that Restaurant Week gives me the chance to try some new places that I normally wouldn't.Amateur hour as far as management and staff.We had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly.  The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine.  That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered.  Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.Hakkasan's Restaurant Week menu looked like a winner, and after sampling its offerings, my dining experience here proved to be that and more.  First off, the place is quite classy and elegant.  It has an upscale ambiance with seating divided into small cloistered sections by iron and wood partitions.  Cushioned half-booth seating features different colorful Chinese dragons embroidered on off-white expensive-looking fabric.For the appetizer course, a Steamed Dim Sum Platter featured a woven basket holding big bite-size morsels of Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Chinese Chive Dumpling, and a Black Pepper Duck Dumpling.  The fat dumplings were all very well made by hand, and delicious.  I liked each one, as well as my bite of Diane's Crispy Fried Prawn Dumpling that was rich with prawn meat, enhanced by fruity and sweet but not overpowering Plum Sauce, and decorated with Fried Rice Paper Noodles sprouting out of the prawn's top.An add-on of Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, suitably spicy, and filled with delicate thin noodles.  But in retrospect, I wish I had instead ordered the Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken because I was later informed that it was identical to the vegetarian variety with chicken added, and both soups were priced the same.  To help wash everything down, I enjoyed excellent house-brewed Mint Decaf Hot Tea, with the tea leaves blocked by a tiny strainer. My entree of Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey, alongside a few fried Enoki Mushrooms, was very tasty.  Sections of well-cooked moist white fish burnished by the honey flaked off nicely onto a fork.  Fine, generously portioned sides of glistening, stir-fried Pak Choy with Garlic and Egg Fried Rice rounded out and embellished this portion of the meal.Inventive Summer Exotic Cold Watermelon Soup with assorted berries and Lychee Sorbet brought our memorable dinner to a refreshing close.  Service was exemplary throughout the night, and wet towels were produced at meal's end for a nice final touch.  It was a great Restaurant Week meal.In sum, Hakkasan offers a very refined Cantonese dining experience that is expensive, but worth it!  Now that I have had a taste of its stellar cuisine, I will surely be back to enjoy more.A friend and I came here last night to have their Golden Week prix fixe menu offered during two weeks coinciding with the Golden Week in China.  Except for a service glitch, the meal was excellent!My dining companion and I decided we'd like to try the crab and sweet corn soup as well.  This was brought first and even though we were sharing, we were not brought smaller, separate bowls so we just ate out of our communal soup bowl.  The soup was not exceptional in any way.  In fact, I tasted just like egg drop soup.  We were not finished with this extra soup when servers brought out our small eats--the Peking duck and the steamed dim sum platter.  This was the first of two times when we were rushed by bringing out dishes when we weren't ready.  It didn't happen again when it was made clear that they should hold up on more main dishes.The Peking duck was fantastic.  Small pieces of duck with a small amount of breast with crispy skin, a thin rectangular pancake, and some crispy cucumber.  The duck was topped by Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar.  The flavors of the caviar with the duck and the crispy cucumber was great.  The dim sum platter consisted of har gau, scallop shumai, a perch dumpling, and a black pepper duck dumpling.  The flavors were again wonderful!The mains started arriving a bit too quickly and this is where we asked them to wait until we were finished with these first ones.  The three mains brought out were the braised whole sea bass in claypot, the crispy prawn, and the fried rice with diced abalone.  The crispy prawn was a spicy dish.  It had three green peppers with heat and it was served with dried chili and cashew nuts.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and there were nice pieces of tofu with the bass.  The fried rice was very good!After a break, we got the last two mains--spicy Szechuan rib-eye beef and the roasted crispy chicken.  The beef was a star of the meal.  The beef was in a rich sauce, not very spicy at all despite its name, and served on a bed on enoki mushrooms.  The chicken was fairly moist and the crispy skin was a delight.  The mushrooms with the chicken were wild mushrooms and the chicken was in an oyster sauce.  For dessert, we got black sesame and chocolate dumplings with ginger/yuzu tea.  There were some small boba like lime balls on the dumplings and the dumplings were filled with a semi-sweet chocolate.  Wow!  What a way to end the meal.We were each given a large Hakkasan bag--a takeaway gift--of two yuzu macarons with a chocolate cream filling.  They did make it home, but I ate them later.  The chocolate cream and the macarons were perfect!This was a special meal and it's not a 5 star review for me this time because of the service.  With a meal like this, pacing should have been better and dishes not brought out before others were finished.  Our server, Leigh, was very knowledgable and very pleasant and she answered questions when we posed them.Hakkasan remains high on my list.  It is Las Vegas Strip pricing plus, but I think it's worth the splurge now and then.On a Sunday, our first night in town, the wife and I and a couple of friends went to dinner at Hakkasan.  We started off with drinks.  The wife's Smoky Negroni, while pricey at $18, was well made with top shelf ingredients (barrel aged Ransom Old Tom gin, Carpano Antica vermouth, Campari, and Grand Marnier all infused with smoke in a decanter) and possessed the expected traits of the classic original with bold, but pleasant smoky notes.  My Manhattan ($17) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, atomized Oloroso sherry, and Angostura bitters was no less successful possessing nice nutty notes on the nose from the sherry.  Sadly, Hakkasan's cocktails were the highlight of our night. Rather than pick items from the dinner menu, we decided to leave it in Hakkasan's hands and ordered its $88 Signature Tasting Menu figuring it would be a well thought out sampling of its signature items.  Our meal started off with the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter consisting of har gau, scallop shumai, perch dumplings, and black pepper duck dumplings.  The selection of dim sum was beautifully presented, flavorful, but not much different and certainly no better than what you can find being pushed on a cart in a traditional Chinese restaurant.  With the exception of the Roasted Mala Chicken with Cucumber and Cloud Ear Mushrooms, the Stir-fry Asparagus with Dried Shrimp and Preserved Vegetables and the desserts, the remaining dishes we were served were surprisingly one note in their preparation and/or flavor profiles as they were either fried (Salt and Pepper Squid, Crispy Silver Cod with Superior Soy Sauce, Crispy fried Red Snapper) or topped with a sweet and sour style sauce (Sweet and Sour Pork with Pomegranate) or a combination of both.  Taken as a whole, the tasting menu was inexplicably strange and disappointing.  Nothing tasted off or bad and it all seemed properly prepared, but the food was not appreciably better than what you could get at PF Chang's or your neighborhood Chinese take-out joint and the food definitely never came close to meriting its $88/person price tag. The only things that saved this from being a one-star review were the solid (albeit pricey) cocktails and the attentive service we received throughout our meal.  However, for an acclaimed restaurant brand and a Michelin-starred chef, Hakkasan and its tasting menu was easily the most disappointing and worst value meal I've ever experienced.  Save your money and skip.

Review Text :
I came to the incredible realization last night that I haven't written a review for Soul yet?! Since I've eaten here, oh, I don't know seven or eight times, you think I would have gotten around to it by now. Nope. So, here we are. Months later and I've had many a dish at Soul. The interior is cozy and dark, the staff has always been friendly and helpful while choosing from their extensive menu. Yes indeed it can get crowded, so plan your evening accordingly! Here's the low down on the dishes I've tried:White Bean & Goat Cheese Dip: 3/5: Tasty white beans mixed into a (cool) creamy goat cheese. Served with snappy little pita chips. I kind of wish it was warm, but the flavors make me come back to it often. Goat Cheese Crostini: 4/5: Toasty balls of goat cheese atop a lovely crostini piled with tomato and onion. Yum.Shrimp Ceviche: 5/5: Bangin'. Just damn good. Perfectly prepared and full of flava. Guacamole Stack: 2/5: Meh. Not bursting with flavor and I'm always searching for some type of carb to pair with this lovely stack of avocado. Tuna Tacos: 3/5: I love the fresh tuna & the sauce but I dislike the overly fried flavor of the encompassing taco shell. Soul Roll: 5/5: DELISH. One of my favorite sushi rolls in Charlotte - 'tis flavorful, punchy and super fresh.Gyro: 2/5: I prefer Showmars, frankly. The meat or mix within the meat tasted sweet?! A bit strange. Cupcakes: 3.5/5: I've tried two types and had two different reactions. My first was a cookies & cream - it was tasty but dry. Sad face. Then, last night I tried the snickerdoodle cupcake - delicious, not dry whatsoever. Mouth watering cinnamony sugary goodness topped with buttery frosting. Nom. I know I'll be back to this eclectic eatery soon - there is truly a dish for every bud and tastebud!I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.I have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who "greeted" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word "greeted" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a "Hello" or a "Welcome", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a "How many?"  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was "obviously very small" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.A bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, "Well did you settle your bar tab?"  I've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.The waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.Food was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.I think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.I will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone.This place has got soul! Too cheesy? It's okay just keep reading it gets better I promise. I just had to! Originally this was going to be a 5 star review but after a prompt return visit the hostess's bitchiness and ineptitude caused me to take away a star. More on that later. Buckle up kids this is going to be a long review.I probably have to give Soul the award for some of the most creative and tastiest cuisine I've ever had in Charlotte. Yes it's that good. Even when you order something that sounds fairly normal, they managed to give it a creative twist. I'm so appreciative of that! The interior is very small, crowded and very loud. So be prepared for a long wait sometimes, especially since they don't take reservations. But the staff is nice without being over the top, and water refills are kept up. I especially like that they serve it with cucumber instead of the usual lemon. I never like the taste of lemon in water, but I do love the flavor a slice of cucumber can infuse!My first trip here I went with tuna sashimi tacos, an amazing duck confit pasta topped with crispy sweetbreads and foie gras, and grilled toast topped with wild mushrooms and a fried egg with a Dijon vinaigrette. Finished with last but not least goat cheese ice cream. This meal contained probably some of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere in Charlotte. Lets start with the tuna tacos, I've had something similar to this dish while I was in Cali, it was a deconstructed fish taco and so I was excited to find it here! It did not disappoint at all! The guacamole was flavorful and added dimension and fattiness to the tuna while the fried wonton wrapper gave it a lovely crunch, yum.Next up came the duck confit pasta, now if the last dish was awesome this would qualify as a masterpiece. The duck confit paired with the delivered such amazing flavors that this dish could have easily fit into a high class restaurant. The foie gras' earthiness and richness complemented the pasta and gave it amazing depth of flavor, while the crispy sweetbreads brought the whole dish together some much needed texture. This dish is best eaten in small amounts though because it had such a rich, luxurious mouthfeel I felt quite sated after finishing half of the plate.The last savory course of the evening was grilled wild mushrooms with a dijon vinaigrette over charred toast and topped with a fried egg. I wasn't even going to get this dish because I was quite full but I saw the table next to us get it and I had to have it. I thought this dish was the most balanced of the night with complex flavors and textures melding together in glorious harmony. Just get the thing and you'll be singing it's praises too.Feeling like an overstuffed plush at this point, I decided to go all in and order the goat cheese ice cream. You could taste the grassiness of the goat cheese and the ice cream felt surprisingly low fat which surprised me. I think I'd prefer it if the flavor kicked me in the face next time like *WHAM* that's goat cheese alright! and maybe make the ice cream a bit more decadent? I just feel like you want to go all out for dessert and this let me down a bit.The music here is very very very loud. I couldn't hear what my dining partner about a foot away was saying, I almost contemplated just texting each other across the table. The hostess the first time was perfectly nice, but my second time was so rude, unfriendly, and nasty that I just took my business elsewhere. For such excellent food though I'll brave all these missteps and take my chances.Goodness, Soul. You make Tapas and Gastronoms fall in love so easily. There are quite a few things worth trying: Brunch: On Sundays. Best Greek Yogurt with honey I've ever had. Perfect and pretty sure its made in house? Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepeño give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin. LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time. Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic. FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing. Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch. Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting. The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night. Love Soul. Places like this make Charlotte more unique. The dining experience is different every time and there always seems to be something new to try. Culinarily daring, busy as all get out and worth every penny.So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch. I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits. Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too. _________________*Depending on your perspective, I suppose you could say that I bothered a lot of strangers.Soul has made a lot of changes since I've last visited when they first opened. I've recently gone back to meet star bartender Andy Maurer. If you're looking for a great, fun and creative cocktail experience...this is where you need to be. None of that crazy "mixology" stuff, just great drinks for real cocktailers. Also great food! The Korean BBQ wings, amazing! Friendly staff and great music. Most Monday's are old school night. And, I mean real old school. Marvin, Teddy, The Spinners, real deal music. Even if you just go for brunch, make sure you get there!This place is amazing. By far the best food and drinks I've ever had. And it's in Charlotte! And so close to my house. The food here is seriously like sex in your mouth. Everything is delicious. This night I got to taste a friends lobster soup and I swear I wanted to jump in the bowl and live in it. I haven't had anything here is didn't like. Example cold meat plate. I would never order that but it's amazing. And of course the lamb skewers are incredible. Better than a filet. Truffle fries, well yes please! This place need to never close down. And don't get discouraged by your long wait. It's totally worth it. In fact order as much as you can with a friend or many friends and share. Taste as much as you can. I haven't had the brunch but that's hopefully going to be my next visit.People ask me all the time for suggestions on where to go to eat. This is easily one of the places in Charlotte I mention the most.No, they don't take reservations. Just go ahead and get over it. Sure, it would be nice. You know what would also be nice? If they gave me free cocktails, but they don't do that either. See, it sounds pretty ridiculous now doesn't it? Expect a wait. There's a wait for a reason. Go early and put your name on the list, then walk downstairs to Twenty-Two or over to Workman's Friend for a drink. They'll text you when your table is ready.If you looked through the user pictures on here, you've probably figured out that the pork belly tacos are the most popular item. I agree, they're my number #1 at Soul. I also like the tuna tacos, soul roll, and hamachi with jalapeno. My most recent adventure here was with the lovely Sarah C and we felt it was our duty to order the giant shells and cheese stuffed with pork belly. I can't think of anything on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. My roommate and her bestie love the shrimp ceviche. Cocktail menu is also great. I usually always start with a Tito's Cucumber Mule. Price-wise, this is a place where you can very easily spend a lot of money. It's easy to get caught up in the delicousness and order a bunch of plates. Sarah and I split four small plates and three cocktails... $87 before tip. Only other thing you really need to know: parking blows. The JLC WearHouse across the street closes at 7pm, so I'll park there or the breakfast place next door to it. Just make sure to pay attention to all the signs in this area before you park.

Review Text :
THE SASHIMI DEAL OF THE CENTURY!!!I hang out with a couple of Enlightened dudes (and yes, they are the real deal) and the other day as we were chewing on the Dharma one of them said, "I'm going to show you a place that is going to blow your mind, and I mean, really blow your mind." When an Enlightened being tells you that, you better hold onto your ego (if you wanna keep it, that is) 'cause mind-blowing is their forte. But how many times have I heard "I've got the BEST sushi place in the city!" only to have it be a decent but standard restaurant?Once we got to Poke Express, however, my mind WAS blown. Poke Express is not your typical sushi restaurant. Hell, it's not even a restaurant, it's more like a sushi deli. Scratch that, like a SASHIMI DELI! This place is run by a bunch of laid back Hawiians and they sling some of the best damn raw fish that I've ever put in my mouth. Poke is basically sashmi cut up into bitesized pieces and then dressed in various sauces. The Salmon was awesome (although I love it best when I squeeze a bunch of fresh lemon on it). The Ahi is incredible and can be prepared several different ways. I highly recommend Wasabi style and Hawiian style, but I can't imagine that any of the styles would be anything but lip-smacking GREAT.You buy it in 1/2 lb and 1 lb containers. A half pound is great for lunch, but if you're a glutton, you can get 1/2 lb of one and 1/2 lb of the other and really pig out. "But wait," you say, "A POUND of sashimi? That's gonna break the bank!" Au contraire, mon fraire! This uncooked sea dwelling yumminess goes for only $9.00 PER POUND. Yeah, I said PER POUND! Holy Hamachi, Batmansan, one could get THREE POUNDS OF SASHIMI for the price of an All You Can Eat sushi deal, and it's SASHIMI, not the rice laden sushi that we AYCE suchi buffs have to tolerate to get our little fishy friends down our gullet.Friggin MAKE THE DRIVE to Craig and Revere and check this place out. Buy some for today and buy another container for lunch tomorrow. I'm going to be finding excuses to make it over to this part of town every chance I get. If Can, Can. If No Can, No Can!Yes, Poke Express is all that and a bag of chips!  Bringing the Husband here earned me some definite brownie points - we liked it so much that we returned twice within a week, despite us living all the way across town!They have a generous selection of tuna poke, salmon poke, dried fish, and a bunch of other edible goodies that one would expect from a place like this.  Upon entering, we were warmly greeted and took our time perusing they offerings.  When they learned it was our first time, they insisted we try their fish selection.  They wanted us to be sure we liked what we ordered and we happily obliged. Our first visit, we finally walked out with: * Ahi Poke Chile Water Style ($10.49/lb) - Tuna poke that is fresh, tasty, and with a bit of spice.  * Spicy Salmon Poke ($9.99/lb) - I love spicy sauce that is mayonnaise-based with masago mixed in and they do this right! Yum!* Ahi Poke Limu ($10.49/lb) - I slight mix-up in my order since I wanted the Spicy Tuna Poke, but decided to keep it nonetheless since we had already left.  Still tasty and fresh! * Raw Kim Chee Tako ($16.99/lb) - An acquired taste for those not too sure about raw octopus.  The Husband and I like this slimy concoction and they offer it two ways here.Our return visit, we also added an order of:* Top Shell Poke Kim Chee Style ($17.99) - These sea snails aren't for everyone with a slight rubbery texture.  They will mix up the raw fish with whatever sauce they have, so it's pretty much mixed to order!Poke Express is a deli of sorts, unfortunately there's no tables inside or out for eating right then and there.  But I'm sure you'll find a bunch of customers chowing down in their cars right in the parking lot, like us! Be sure to call ahead to find out when they close.  We came the week before Christmas, so the hours varied. They are also CLOSED on Wednesdays!  Also, they ran out of salmon poke during our order so ask to be sure about they have left if it's near the end of the day. They are located in the shopping center where Big Lots is!Thank you yelpers for bringing me here! We'd probably be here everyday if it was closer...thank goodness it's not then!So, we found out that most of their poke is from the islands.  No wonder it taste so freakin' awesoooome!  It tasted like the real deal.  Worth every bit of a detour in Vegas if you're Hawaiian or if you just love eating poke.  They're in North Las Vegas though so it's impossible to get there without a car or forking out some cheddar for a taxi.  Thankfully, we had a car handy, but I wouldn't mind paying a taxi fare to go there though...yeah, it's that good!The people at Poke Express are cool too.  They allow you to get some samples if you're unfamiliar with a certain item they sell.  The customer service at Poke Express is incredibly good.  True Hawaiian kind.  We left the young dude that helped us with a pretty good tip...it's Vegas baby, Vegas!  Gotta reward good customer service.Anyways, check out my pics to see what I got.  I liked everything but my favorites are the Raw Crab Poke Kim Chee Style and the Wasabi Raw Tako.  You can't go wrong when you're there.  Just ask for a sample and let the poke take control of your senses.  Peace out, brothas and sistahs.I won't lie, I was hesitant to pop in here because of the location-I mean who gets quality, fresh fish in North Las Vegas? Really? Really?Poke Express is a refreshing change from the below average chain establishments that litter Craig Rd. from east to west, offering not only the freshest catches but Hawaiian products and customer service that is really unparalleled.North Las Vegas. I KNOW. Hear me out.I've stopped in here a couple of times and I believe the owners are a husband/wife team and I've been helped by both individuals while there. Maybe being a lifetime Las Vegan has conditioned me to not expect good customer service....anywhere. I don't know why I'm always surprised to be treated well when I patronize an establishment, but I was really caught off guard by how genuinely nice, helpful and friendly the owners of Poke Express were. Samples. Check. Thorough explanation of daily offers. Check. Recommends of nearby eateries, including what they might consider competitors. Check.But let's get down to what really matters: the fish. You'll have to dig deep in these parts to find ahi this fresh, but I'd dare say that you'd have to do some serious digging around town period to find ahi of this caliber. Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. They have different kinds of poke which I didn't know was an option (my knowledge of poke is minimal, so thought that poke was just another name for tuna)-shrimp, octopus, other kinds of fish-raw and cooked all available in a variety of flavors. I've ordered the spicy ahi and wasabi ahi and recommend both, but the spicy ahi was my favorite. If you come earlier in the day you can get samples and all available varieties are out on display. The first time I went was later in the afternoon and the glass case was mostly empty, but one of the owners explained to me that when it's that late in the day, they make it to order. Prices are market price and they charge by the pound. I found the prices to be pretty reasonable as again you are paying for top notch seafood in the middle of the desert. And their top-notchedness (yup, just made that up), isn't relative to surrounding crappy food establishment-Poke Express sets the bar city-wide for quality. Simply amazing. I would have left here pleased even if the customer service was just so-so, but the owners are quality which made the experience really count for me. I hope they liked me as much as I liked them. Because they're going to be seeing a lot more of me. Soon.I went here since I was craving some fresh tuna and it's close to home. They have a lot of options: spicy, Hawaiian, wasabi, octopus (tako), crab, imitation crab, shrimp, salmon. There also also garlic bulbs, edamame and kimchi. They have Hawaiian goodies such as Hawaiian popcorn, chocolate covered macadamia nuts, lihing powder, crackers, guava jelly, etc.I got a pound each of their wasabi ahi, spicy salmon and Hawaiian ahi - per the boyfriend's request. They gave me a free tub of wasabi ahi! The ahi and salmon were so fresh (not mushy and gross) and packed with flavor.  A pound of fish is about $14.  The wasabi ahi can clear your sinuses without a problem.  The spicy salmon isn't spicy at all - it has a mildly spicy mayo and masago.  Everything was soooo delicious!I had to make rice for the boyfriend since they don't serve rice at Poke Express - which isn't a big deal to me since rice is easy to make and I don't even eat rice.  They don't have tables and chairs - it's mainly a to-go place.The owners (husband and wife) were nice and very friendly. We were talking about baskteball and that sealed the deal for me! Good conversation + excellent food = happy customer who definitely will be coming back for more.Came here because of Nelson Q. and his wonderful UYEs.  Their poke is wonderfully good!  I love both their traditional style pokes as well as some of their explorative variations.  I don't think you can go wrong here with what you order, but even better than that is the fact that you can taste anything before you buy it!...I'm told you need to come earlier do that consistently though since they run out of some of the prepared items.  If you need a place to start though, check out their   Ahi Shoyu, Spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu,and Limu Tako Poke.Some have complained that they are a little expensive...I still think it's worth it though and don't know of any better poke around...so if it's poke you want Poke Express is a must.They are a counter style small business without any seats.  Nelson brought us a few doors down to 808 Mixed Plate since they're owned by the same family and allow you to eat Poke Express items in their...plus 808 is tasty enough to check out while you're there as well.Some of the best things come in small packages. Case in point. Just like the "Hole In The Wall" and "Mom and Pop" places, if you are not paying attention, you can drive right by this place. Ironically, this place is also family owned, so both clichés apply.With that said, the 100+ 5 star review average is a definite eye catcher.  As soon as I saw that, I knew I had to check it out hoping I wouldn't get disappointed. Well I am happy to report that the 5 star average is legit.As soon as you come in, you are greeted warmly. When you look around, they have all sorts of Hawaiian themed merchandise. They have drinks, hats, seasonings, and even poi.As for the main products. Just stroll on over to the big glass case where they have all the good stuff. Tip: Come right when they open so you can sample all the products because as soon as the afternoon comes around, most of the good stuff cant be sampled any more.I ended up sampling the Crab Combo. After that first bite, we knew were getting at least a pound of that stuff. It has imitation crab meat and vegetables mixed with some kind of spicy chipotle mayo sauce. A pound of it came up to about 8 bucks and some change. If you ask me, I think they put some kind of drug in it because I couldn't stop eating it! As for the different kinds of Ahi, we went with the Kim Chee Ahi, promising to come back to try the other mouth watering options just based off the pics alone. We got a pound of it which came out to about 14 and  some change.So in closing, probably the only thing that might subtract a star would be their hours. They are open Mon thru Tues, Thurs thru Sat 10 am to 6 pm. Sun 10 am to 5 pm. CLOSED WEDNESDAYS! Remember, this is a market/store type of place so the hours are not as weird as it seems. Their food and service more than make up for a potential subtraction of one star. So a "Mahalo" seems fitting for these guys and an "Aloha" from me since its the end of the review.Freshest poke I've had in Las Vegas!   No reason to go into too much detail about Poke Express since it's been done with all these reviews on here. If you love fresh poke and never been to Poke Express, then you're missing out.  All the 5 star reviews for Poke Express isn't hype.  If you crave fresh "as good as it gets" poke, then Poke Express needs to be on your list.

You can enjoy your poke standing inside, grubbin' in your car, as take out, or do what I do from time to time...I take it to Teriyaki Madness next door and eat it with a bowl of brown rice. -Expect to meet the nicest owners.  It's been a long time since my previous visit and they still treated me like they know me.  They definitely know their regulars by name. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (054/366)I'm not going to pretend I am an Ahi Poke expert. I'm not going to claim I know what Poke is suppose to taste like. But I will say this-- BEST POKE I HAVE EVER HAD thus far. I've been wanting to try this place out for years but for some reason Poke Express always loses the argument when it comes to other places to eat. Today I wanted something small & not a big meal so I opt for poke! Definitely not what I had imagined. It's a very small store. You can't sit anywhere to eat, not a restaurant. You just tell them what you like and you gotta get outta there. The Pokes weren't out because we came around 4 & they make it to order at this time of the day. If you come when they open, 10am, all the Pokes will be out so you can actually try them all out before you decide which one you want. The staff were very helpful to us first timers. I decided on the Spicy Ahi & the crab combo. & they were sooooooo good! The crab combo had a good kick to it. The ahi wasn't spicy at all but nonetheless still really good! Only bad thing about it was, I didn't order more! Next time I want to try the Kim Chi Ahi & the wasabi ahi! Definitely coming back!If there is ONE thing that I love, its raw fish!! People think it's weird that I only like my fish raw, not cooked..but damn, I feel like that's the way to GO! Poke Express is a Hawaiian Poke Deli shop. It almost has an Asian mart feel with lots of choices for those seafood lovers, baby! There IS more food than just poke, but I haven't tried them yet!! Still trying to cover the whole poke area of the store. ;P They have quite the selection!It is located kind of in the corner of a shopping area, so you -really- have to look to see it! AND ya can't eat there because they don't have seats, so please just don't stand there and eat..that's weird! Go home!The owner gives out great customer service! He tells everyone to come in at 10 AM to try free samples! He was also super friendly, patient, and helpful in explaining all of the food to my boyfriend, who had never eaten poke before :) Also, they do give a military discount here, which was pretty cool of them. The only two poke flavors that I have tried are the Hawaiian and Garlic poke, but I really loved both of them. The quality of the fish is excellent~ It's as fresh as it gets and delicious, too! The prices are pretty reasonable as well!So if you want a taste of the Island, stop by Poke Express--it's a place to be!!!My Yelp buddies deserve all the credit for pointing me and my wife in the right direction for a terrific lunch in North Las Vegas. Poke Express is a no-frills eatery; actually, it's more of a market with a few shelves of food products and two refrigerated cases of their sublime poke. Although traditionally served raw, there are many varieties of poke offered here: on your left are the cooked and on your right are the uncooked versions. These include different types of seafood, but I still prefer the standard tuna.  What makes Poke Express five-star worthy is not only the seafood, but the stellar service. Our server was thoughtful and friendly, and he encouraged us to try the various poki while explaining each. Even after a few samples he persuaded us to try others and we happily obliged. Finally, we settled on two uncooked selections: the poke with oyster sauce and the spicy ahi poke. Both were amazing: the tuna in each was fresh, meaty, and flavorful. We enjoyed each one, but gave a slight nod to the spicy ahi poke, with the spicy sauce being an excellent blend of heat and flavor. You pay by the pound here, with most in the $14.99/lb range, and they have plastic containers to show how much you'll receive. For our two half-pounds, the final total was just over $15 with tax. Again, nothing fancy, just our containers of fresh and delectable poke (and two pairs of chopsticks). My wife and I could not wait to eat our lunch, and we devoured both containers in the car, A/C keeping us cool as we stuffed ourselves to the gills.PHONE YOUR ORDER AHEAD OF TIME!!!! The tuna poke goes FAST. I was already warned to do this, but I didn't because my schedule was very loosely planned. *shrugs*.I was still able to sample some stuff and enjoyed my order thoroughly. \LOVE that they do tako wasabi here. The kimchi octopus is tasty as hell too. I usually get this at sushi boat places but they sell it here by the lb! In the end I wound up with tako wasabi and spicy salmon poke. SO GOOD. Wish I had some chips to eat it with..They also sell Hurricane popcorn by the bag. Service is prompt and they've very friendly. P.S. This place is way out in the boonies.. like, the hood. If you don't have a car, don't cab it.Oh yes, POKE!!!!!!!  Real Hawaiian POKE!!  I bookmarked this place for months and finally went last year as it was a little out of the way.  Lots of variety of poke and they even had salmon poke!  (not many place do salmon besides lomi lomi).  Well I just moved and I'm way closer to Poke Express and I've gone twice in the last 2 weeks already!  heheI've been going close to closing time so I'm not sure if it's different during the day - but they make all my ahi poke fresh from scratch.  I love that since I know it wasn't sitting out all day and getting dried out.  They also have freezers filled with mochi ice cream, icees, frozen salmon parts, and other "Hawaiian" staple foods like noodles, buns and even pasteles.  They also have dried goods available for sale.I met one of the owners the other day and he was really cool to chat with.  I miss local people (I lived on O'ahu for the last 8 years) so it was nice.  The other guys running the store have all been really cool and nice as well.  This is definitely a must try for anyone wanting some poke on the mainland.When my friends told me that the best Poke on the mainland comes from the desert of Las Vegas, I thought they were kidding.  How could it be?  Surely they were messing with me, I thought as my GPS took me through an industrial area of North Las Vegas.  Then like a mirage in the middle of the desert, I see a shopping center appear out of no where.  Located in the midst of the shopping center was Poke Express.  As I entered, I was greeted by the workers working there.  When it was my turn, the girl helping me was great.  They had different flavors of Ahi and Salmon poke.  If fish isn't your thing, they also had octopus, mussels and seaweed salad.  As usual, with so many choices, there was no way that I would be able to pick.  But, it was okay, Just like Costco, they let me sample all of them.  They even offered me more when I couldn't make up my mind.  I ended up getting the Spicy Ahi Combo with avocado, cucumber and crab, and the Ahi Poke with sweet Chili sauce.  They had just ran out of rice when it was my turn, but, that was okay because I ordered more poke.  The Poke, both the samples, and the two I ordered were great.  The fish was fresh.  The flavor was better than anything that I have ever had.  In Southern California, Pokinometry is the measuring stick for good poke.  The wrong standard is being used.  Poke Express is much better and should be the standard that all other Poke should be compared to when outside of Hawaii.  Poke Express is better than all other Poke places I have been to.  Their friendliness and service is better than any of the places I've been to.  They may be a little far from the strip, but, it is worth the drive.  Believe it when someone tells you that the best Poke is found in Vegas.  Even though you might think that you are headed into some industrial area, you won't go wrong coming here.

Review Text :
All-you-can eat pizza buffet & drink for $7. It is just buffet pizza lots of different variations and you can request any you can imagine-mac n chz,hot dog, pepperoni & jalapeno,hawaiian & more. There's about 10-12 varieties on the buffet at a time. There's lots of people here so there's usually something new every time back to the buffet. They also have 2 salads, soup & bread sticks plus 2 desserts and they serve Coca-Cola products. It's cafeteria-style seat yourself and there is a small arcade and several flat screen TVs. For buffet pizza this place is OK. BUT for pizza it's crap-No flavor, sauce was weak, thin flavorless crust or thick & doughy, all the toppings were over processed and the cheese was invisible. Worst yet less than 5 minutes after leaving this place I had the uncontrollable feeling that everything needed to exit my body from one end or the other.I recently discovered Cici's Pizza over the Summer thanks to a friend of mine that lives near one in the Northwest part of Vegas.  Since then, I've visited 3 locations in the Valley.  This was the third one.My Son and his friend wanted to get some Pizza before the UNLV Football game on Saturday.  Since this location was on the way to the Stadium, we stopped here for lunch.  AYCE Pizza Buffet priced at $3.99 per person is pretty good....don't you think?This Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!Overall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!Will I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably.

Ohhhh when it comes to Pakistani / Indian cuisine in the Valley, Z-Grill has my heart and taste buds.  For those of you who don't do dive-y joints quit reading now and move on.  For those more adventurous you will be pleased.  Located inside Zam-Zam World Market on 40th St, North of McDowell, you can blink and miss it.  Wander in to the back past the butcher and you order at the window.  They may not have everything listed on the menu so you may have to ask or reorder. It is a small but flavorful selection, they don't skimp on the seasoning or the spice here.  Thus making it an even more euphoric experience.  I stick with the Naan and the poori for your side options...the last time i tried the rice it tasted like it was steamed in the burlap sack....unless you mixed it with the curry...But this was not enough to deter me from going back every 4 days for about a month...Which reminds me I need to get back there soon!Only in town for the evening on business, I hopped on the trusty ol' Yelp app to see what the locals were saying.   My ego was fragile and my belly empty, so I skipped the Yelp Talk and went right to the "nearby" button. Imagine my surprise when a Pakistani / Indian / Afghani place popped up a mere mile from my hotel!  This restaurant sits inside the Zam-Zam World Market, and boasts a solid lineup of dishes from three countries, all at very reasonable prices.  I could write nothing about the food here and still give it 5 stars because of the service we got here.  Our server was genuinely excited for us to be there, and happy to recommend what he believed to be great dishes to match our relative tastes (mine being super spicy, and my companions being the opposite).  I love it when I get actual recommendations, not the typical, "everything is good."  When he learned I wanted something he would traditionally eat, and also super spicy, he easily sold me on the Goat Karahi with the chili naan.  Having never tried Goat, I was super excited.  My buddy went with the kabobs per his recommendation, with one being mild, and the other with a little spice.  Great recommendations all around.We started with the samosas $1:50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#tno1avQ14jhuMNrXANswow), and they were executed perfectly, with a cilantro chili sauce that had a great kick.  5 StarsGoat Karahi $10  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#bHaip3hWpni9l_SB9pB3pwThis was basically a short rib dish with garlic, onion, and lots of spice (your cumin, turmeric, red pepper blend being very pronounced).  It was fire hot, and the meat was like a pulled pork consistency, and almost creamy.  I wish I would have ordered regular naan, because every time I went for the naan to balance out the fire, I was met with thai chili on top of naan.  Needless to say I was smoking out my ears by the time I finished. 5 StarsThe kabobs were great, and with the Tandoor oven banging out quality naan, this was a meal I easily could have eaten when I was in the region.  Fantastic service, fair prices, and great tastes.  If I'm in Phoenix again, I'm here.5 Stars.

Review Text :
Definitely 5 stars. My review here is of the vegan menu at Sinatra. However, I should note that many dishes on the vegan menu are also found on the regular menu with slight alterations so I'm assuming taste and quality wise, we're all on the same page. When Chef Theo Schoenegger was given the task of creating a vegan menu, he didn't choose to treat that as a chore and create a menu chock full of salads and dishes a 2 year old could whip up. He obviously rose to the challenge and created a passionate menu with hearty vegan dishes. As a vegetarian, I avoid vegan entrees at Italian restaurants as I'm not a fan of vegan cheese and cream-less soups/pastas. Sinatra really wowed me with what they created within these boundaries. The vegan menu here is astonishing. There are 3 starters (a Caesar salad, a beet salad and a butternut squash soup). 2 pasta dishes and 3 main courses and 3 desserts. Some dishes use Gardein protein. We ordered the soup to share. A smooth, creamy (?) soup with a kick in it. Marinating in the soup were vegan ricotta cheese dumplings. Neither me nor my husband are fans of butternut squash but this soup hit the ball out of the park. For our second course (yes we did the Italian thing and had pasta and a main), we each ordered a pasta dish. My husband ordered the vegan ricotta cheese dumplings in an asparagus cream sauce. Divine. I didn't even realize the cheese was vegan. The asparagus cream sauce was light yet robust in flavors and when scooped up with the dumpling, it was the perfect explosion in my mouth. I ordered the Pennette. This is also on the regular menu. Tomato sauce and penne mixed with sweet peppers onions and Gardien Sausage. Yes....talk about comfort in a bowl. The generous helping was delicious and was definitely what I expected (if not better!). For our main, we shared a "Chicken" Marsala. A Gardein chicken breast that was baked and spiced was the main attraction on the plate. On top of it was a creamy, woody, mushroom (oyster) sauce that covered the chicken. Surrounding the "chicken" were billowy gnocchi that were smooth, simple and complemented the bold flavors of the sauce and chicken. Considering I've never had the opportunity to have a Marsala sauce since it's usually served with chicken, I take this first taste as being an exquisite experience. For the finale to the meal, we shared a Campari and citrus sorbet. Presented beautifully, it was a light ending to a perfect meal.I don't really have to elaborate much about the ambiance and the service. This is the Encore and there was perfection executed all over. My favorite Italian experience thus far, has been at Aranciata Blu in Rome. Sinatra came so close to that experience that it was scary. I never thought I could enjoy such an ethereal experience just 20 minutes away from home.  Vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore or whatever palate you have, Sinatra is a well worth-it experience. Oh, and the wine list here is also very impressive. Sinatra...keep yourself Just The Way You Are....Sinatra inside the Wynn, I love you.I was taken here for a surprise birthday dinner and it was the highlight of my birthday weekend. The decor is beautiful and our table was against the large windows with a view of the outside garden area. The menus are cute too, each has a picture inside of Steven Wynn and Frank himself.The service was impeccable beginning at the entrance of the restaurant. When I arrived the hostess handed me a handwritten birthday card, and throughout the entire dinner all the staff went out of their way to wish me a happy birthday.The food was so delicious. Our party ordered nearly everything on the menu, including several bottles of chianti. One of the specials for the night was a black truffle pasta which was heavy but delicious. I had little bites of everything. The entree item I ordered was the pennette. Italian sausage ragu over pasta, amazing.Desserts (panna cotta and tiramisu) came out with candles on them and "happy birthday" written in chocolate. I will post a pic here on Yelp. It was a fantastic ending to a wonderful meal.I'm very much looking forward to my next experience at Sinatra.

Review Text :
It's a shame this great tiny Cuban Place didn't remove the former Mexican Restaurant's sign with the name Bisteces. Also the old Mexican Food Bisteces Sign is still on one side of the shopping center too so if your looking for this place the Bisteces sign might still be up. This very casual place is very tiny and only has 5 or 6 tables.We started with the Papa Rellenas (fried mashed potatoes with a tangy seasoned beef center) I didn't know that they would be so large and the size of grapefruits since they were only $3.45 and they gave us two of them. This variation wasn't breaded and seemed lighter than others. The beef inside was very flavorful but not hot with spice.I had the Pollo de la Plancha that is basically pounded chicken breast seasoned with lime  garlic and onions. The plate didn't look very attractive but the chicken was moist and very flavorful. They gave me an extra generous portion of rice with it and the plate was garnished with a light salad. ($6.99)My companion had the Ropa Vieja. The beef was very flavorful but not hot with spice.  He found some bay leaves in his Rice and Beans. We've seen at some other Cuban Restaurants that when you find a bay leaf in your Rice and Beans it's like a prize and you get a free drink. I doubt they do that here as I didn't ask but it might be a fun thing to know. ($7.99)The only thing I didn't like was if you need a restroom you have to walk threw a work area.Someone from Yelp needs to remove the Mexican food reviews from Bisteces from this place. I think the food from here will appeal to most people.Que Rico! Brush up on your spanish, because the real Cuban foodies know where to come! This little hole in the wall Cuban restaurant is seriously as authentic as it gets.  I grew up in Puerto Rico, and  I'm telling you, this food is like no other.  Don't try to compare it to the likes of Havana Cafe in Phoenix . This super casual, obscure 5 or 6 table Cuban Cafe and Bakery, is tucked away in a strip mall.   Please believe me, they serve THE best tostones, croquetas de jamon, pan con bistec, ropa vieja, empanada de carne and crazy delicious flan. I'm sure everything else is tasty too, but I get stuck on my faves. This probably doesn't mean a lot to some, but they serve coca cola in tall glass bottles. This is the way the serve it in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Cuba. It just tastes so much better and it goes great with a cubano (cuban sandwich). There is usually one girl serving the tables, and working the bakery, the owner and one or two other people in the kitchen...so service isn't what you would expect at a 5 star restaurant, but it is what you would expect at a Cuban neighbors or friends house, and that is exactly what you get.  And if you venture into this cafe a few times, the people working there will remember you and you will automatically feel like family.  Prices are great, portions are good and the food is excellent!Buen Provecho!Muy Rica! The food brings back memories of Little Havana from our trip in 2013.The HUGE Cubano is easily enough for 2 people. Syaked on crust bread with of course traditional pork , cheese and taa daw pickle this sandwich is the  real deal.  We were more than please with our food. Extra bonus is the generous pieces of postres , desserts such as flan , tres gracias cake, eclairs and more. We shared and were satisfied with the rich but not fake tasting flan and tres gracias cake. I look forward to going back. My one wish is  that they would put in a soda fountain instead of cans but I can deal,  no problema.If you're looking for authentic Cuban food, go here!! It's a ways away from my house, but whenever I'm in the area I make sure to always stop for a Media Noche and coffee. It really doesn't get anymore authentic than this place. Family owned. I've only tried their sandwiches. Maybe one day I'll try their other options.

So the first thing that strikes you when you walk in is that this is a beautiful restaurant. You can't help but be seduced.We were greeted warmly at the door, seated immediately and given water and menus promptly. Each of the staff came through and introduced themselves, our server Rebecca tells us this is a family operation and apparently so because her mother and step-father (guessing here but probably got enough info to make this accurate) eventually come through, introduce themselves, offer to help with menu selections and we all feel welcome and well attended.Food was very solid...rib appetizers, awesome. Green papaya salad was entirely tasty, but not spicy. Pad Thai and Thai Basil were not my choices but I certainly wasn't complaining either. Food was well prepared, pacing was perfect, rice was perfect.If I had one complaint, it's simply the prices which just seem to be more than I would have to spend elsewhere in a good Thai restaurant (though I'm not going to name any names for comparison). Price setting is a marketing decision that they have made and perhaps given their location, decor, quality of food, many will think their pricing is reasonable but I don't.Food, staff, experience all say 5 stars, pricing says no and that's my opinion.Had to jump in for beauty supplies next door w me mum so the outside of this place really caught my eye! We decided to stop for a bite. It was a late lunch maybe 4 tables were occupied the place felt a tad small inside so we opted to have the patio all to ourselves. Waiter was nice and helpful. I ordered the Pad Thai w shrimp and my mom did the red curry. The shrimp were a nice plump size they were cooked perfectly, I wish there would have been more shrimp on the plate but ce est lavie. The veggies were nice and fresh I thought it was very flavorful compared to other places I've tried Thai food. Not too many places have even left an impression on me the food is usually pretty bland. I tried my moms red curry and it was delicous. The Thai Tea was awesome I wish I had one right now. It was good I will return!

The Sandwich was pretty tasty, but damn was it greasy or buttery.....whatever, I felt really guilty after eating that thing.The Big Cheeseburger was ok....it's my staple grub at JITB.Overall, the joint was fast and food was cheap.  Not bad.Return Factor - 50%

Review Text :
I'm a huge fan of Sunset Soul Food, I usually try to stop in at least every two weeks.  For some reason, I just can't get enough of their desserts.  The chocolate cake, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie are all to die for.I'm not a huge fried seafood eater; so I can't really comment on their seafood, but to date I haven't been disappointed with anything I've eaten here.  I was even brave enough to give their chitterlings a try and I was pleasantly surprised :)  To my knowledge most of the fried items are cooked to order; so if you're getting something fried, I would plan on around a 20+ minute wait.The overall restaurant is rather small; if memory serves me correctly they only have about 4 tables and a few seats along the wall near a pub shelf.  I typically get take out, and I wouldn't recommend taking a large group (5+) to dine in.One interesting thing about this place, is that they also cook Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey dinners.  I've had them do my Thanksgiving dinner for 2 years in a row now and my friends have always been impressed with the meal.  The pricing is fairly reasonable to, if I remember correctly a turkey, with 3 sides, rolls, gravy and a pie run around $69.Customer service wise, the staff is friendly and fairly attentive.At Sunset Soul Food (SSF) they serve up some really good, down-home, southern style Soul Food.  I've had the chance to try a few different things from Sunset - the Crab Cakes are what I usually run, and I have to say, they are better than you might expect.  I mean they aren't Baltimore Inner Harbor good, but they are Beatties Ford Road GREAT!  I've also tried the scallops, and the wings and would order both again without question.  But listen people, this place is worth going to for the SIDES alone.  You simply will not find Candied Yams any better in this city.  The Mac-n-Cheese?  What?!?!  Out of this world!  Cheesy, greasy and horrible for you, just as good mac-n-cheese should be!Can't give this place 5-STARS however bc of the ordering process.  There are all sorts of rules and stipulations such as $5 delivery charges, minimum orders for delivery,  and you can't even place a pick-up order over the phone, I believe you have to do it all online now.  Then if you go and order in person, you are usually waiting due to the fact that business is always steady and that each meal is made to order.  Despite the quirks about the ordering process, SSF is a solid 4-stars and a must-try if you're in the area (or even if you're not).  Don't play with this spot, you won't find better soul food in the Charlotte area.

Review Text :
My first visit to Buono's I walked up to the door sporting my Red Sox hat (purchased on Yawkey Way in the heart of Chowdah Nation) and stopped dead in my tracks at the huge Yankees logo on the door.  A couple people looked up from behind the counter.  I gave a huge shrug and threw my hands in the air as if to say "WTF!"  A tall gentleman behind the counter laughed and beckoned me in.  He informed me that they could help Boston fans as well and that if I just kept right on walking there was another door on the other side that I could leave through.This was Dave.  We have since chatted a bit about baseball, the abomination that is the new stadium in New York, pizza, people from the east coast, etc.I have had pizza from here twice now.  Once I picked up a couple pies to share at the office, yesterday the family and I went for dinner and shared a couple pies.  We actually had enough to have it for lunch today.  Great NY style pizza.  We will be going back to try the subs (grinders for Chowdah nation).Dave is a good sport and takes merciless ribbing pretty well.  When we arrived last night the Yankees had just gotten spanked at Fenway for the second time in a row.  My daughter wanted to walk in singing "Sweet Caroline".  So we did.  Walked in to the crowded restaurant surrounded by NY memorabilia belting out "Sweet Caroline."  (If you're not familiar with Fenway, it's a recent and odd tradition during the 8th inning, more on that here: http://www.bostonspastime.com/sweetcaroline.html)  We certainly got a lot of looks from the patrons and a big laugh from Dave.  I met another Red Sox fan (from Fall Rivuh) that enjoys Buono's pizza to much to stay away.Buono's pizza compares with Grimaldi's but they are cheaper and more down to earth.  So we'll see you for a pie at Buono's from now on.  We miss the NY style pizza and that great east coast attitude.

I went to Big Earl's yesterday because, unfortunately, Bryan's BBQ across the street was closed. My daughter ordered the kid's meal chicken fingers with fries and a drink. I ordered the kid's meal grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and a drink.The girl behind the counter is very friendly, yes. But that doesn't change the fact that they use styrofoam cups (step it up for the environment!), or that the sweet potato fries were dry and stale, or that the grilled cheese had maybe one slice of cheese for the whole sandwich and was a bit burned. My daughter could not eat because she was so appalled at all the different types of flies crawling on the windows (inside). She is 8 years old, and said "Mom, this place is disgusting. They don't even clean the floors, and there are crumbs inbetween the seats here". I think that says it all when a child can see how filthy a place is. One fly landed on her little cup of ketchup...ON the ketchup. (Shuddering at the memory).For me to like a place, it has to be free of insects crawling inches from my food, or even ON my food. I have had better fries at fast food joints, which is sad. And, furthermore, my daughter refuses to go back.Not good.I am on the fence with this one.  While the atmosphere is relaxed and fun (who wouldn't like that retro gas station ambiance?) and the service was quick and friendly, the food is not enough to keep me coming back for more.The outdoor seating is casual, with picnic benches and tables surrounding two 70's style gas pumps.  The setting offers a perfect view of the world going by on Cave Creek Road.  Dogs are welcome (yay!), and you will see plenty of furry friends enjoying the day.  The interior is small, but the space is used well with a few tables, and a small bar which also serves as the counter where orders are placed.  Looking forward to big juicy burgers, we chose:Big Earl Burger ($5.75)Bleu Burger ($6.99)Side of Onion Rings ($3.75)Vanilla Milkshake ($5.75)The milkshake was by far the best item - thick and creamy.  However, at a price of $5.75 I was disappointed to see it came from a machine.  The burgers were OK - I enjoyed the ample bleu cheese on mine, but the beef patties were thinner than I expected.  The onion rings, while indeed greasy, were not the best I have tried.  That award hands-down goes to Rocket Burger.  On this visit, we had a 20% off coupon.  The woman who took our order seemed a bit confused by the math, and we ended up only receiving a 10% discount.  Shame on me for not catching it earlier, as the line when we left was very long and I did not want to wait to request a correction.All in all, Big Earl's is a good place to sit outside and enjoy the view.  Maybe with a beer or two but not for the food.Well they may live up to its "greasy" name but they also have some surprises up their sleeves. For example, they also have salads and chicken sandwiches besides tasty looking burgers and milkshakes! On my first visit, I enjoyed the Big Kahuna Chicken Sandwich which is their take on the teriyaki chicken sandwich and I used all the will power I had to not order the fries to go with it. Instead I went with the side salad. I sat on the funky patio and enjoyed taking in the old gas station scenery such as gas pumps. I also noticed a sand volleyball court in the back and it looks like they do volleyball games and activities on occasion. The meal came out fast, by the server with a huge smile on her face. The chicken sandwich was juicy and tender and the sauce on it was pretty flavorful. I was surprised that it was a creamy-based teriyaki sauce which turned out to be pretty tasty and the grilled pineapples were the perfect touch. The food was decent but nothing that I'd say is a "must-try" but the atmosphere and decor has a lot of character. All in all, it's a nice spot to visit for a casual meal during a day in Cave Creek. Next time I visit, I'll try the Kobe burger and a milkshake, but for my first visit, I can definitely confirm that I'd visit this greasy eatery again.

It's like going to East Africa without getting on a plane.I just went there for lunch today, and let me say that for 1/2 an hour I sure wasn't in America any more - it was an immersive and tasty experience that I'm sure to do again, soon. For a start, they didn't have a menu, so I asked what the lunch special was and he started saying a few things in a strong (Somali/Ethiopian) Arabic accent that included goat, so I said - "Sure I'll try it" without really knowing what was going to happen.  And now to the experience. He brought me a can of Pepsi (no diet drinks here and I didn't wan't to risk the ice cubes in the water) and gives me a fork, a spoon and a banana. Whatever, I think "well this is different" as I wonder when to eat my banana. As I'm drinking my Pepsi I started looking around and realize that the only other people are male east african taxi drivers eating injera and curry with just their RIGHT hand.  Well it's a good thing I know how to do that too! (because I didn't want to stand out even more than is possible as the lone white guy speaking english in a restaurant full of genuine Africans speaking Arabic).Then the food arrives - a huge plate of buttered rice seasoned with green herby flecks of stuff and smelling delightful. And the guy says - "you wanted goat - yes? Because it's grilling and will be out soon" So I said yes and started on the rice. A minute later a huge plate of cubed goat and a side salad with Italian dressing comes out and lands in front of me.  I say cubed goat because that's was happened to this poor beastie.  The meat consisted of apparently random 2-3 inch cubed chunks of goat ribs and legs complete with attached tendons, a couple of arteries, some fat, muscle meat (steak) and so on. It tasted GREAT! Seasoned well, and grilled with seasoned onions too.The other customers - As I was eating my rice, salad and goat with just my right hand, more of the regular clientele came in and looked universally stunned to see me there. When they looked down, saw that I was eating with just my right hand in the same Arab manner as them, in mere seconds they accepted me as just another diner at lunchtime. It was actually really cool to see the waryness and prejudice on their faces evaporate in seconds to be replaced by acceptance.Would I go there again - heck yeah! But, and here's a BIG but. I wouldn't ever go with that person at the office that we all know, you know - the one who makes loud and snarky (sometimes racist) comments when they feel uncomfortable in a new situation.  At lunchtime the Tariq Restaurant is a working (East African Arab) man's lunch place.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a women-only group to go for lunch and feel comfortable.  If you're a woman and want great East African food, then this is the place, but from the vibe in there I reckon you'll enjoy it more if you go in with a man, or in a mixed group.Understated, huge portions, and delicious!  Love Gavin F's first comment - it's so true!  The whole East African Center around the restuarant only adds to the authentic feel.  I headed there on a lazy Saturday to check out this place I've driven by 248 times and my expectations were definitely exceeded.  First glance over the menu shows literally everything listed at $9.  There's a kicker to that which I'll touch on in a moment.  The atmosphere was definitely strange, but didn't detract from the experience.  It was a little weird watching Gladiator on TNT and dining on Northeast themed table coverings (lobster and lighthouses? What the heck??).  I grabbed the curry chicken, which was listed at $9, and did not expect the sheer size of the plate that was to come out.  It was about the size of a Domino's medium pizza and was packed with really good chicken, a small salad, and plenty of rice.  It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, and ended up leaving the place with that classic American, uncomfortably-full feeling.  The icing on the cake was when I went to ring up my chicken and a bottled water - the total was $7!  I must've hit a lunch special on the weekends or something but needless to say I left happy.  Definitely worth a try even if you've never had African food before.

Oh man. This place is a triple threat!The hot dog. Check. The toppings. Double check. The Bun. HOLY CRAP IT'S AMAZING!Why am I so excited about the bun? Because it was incredible. It was fresh, it was tasty and it was toasted. That combination is lethally good. I ALMOST want to say it made the whole thing, but I think the toppings combined with the bun did it in for me. The funny thing is I used to not even really like dogs. I've always had them served to me very blandly. The only way I'd eat them later on in life is if they were straight off the grill. But now that there's all these gourmet offerings, I've tried my fair share of dogs around tahn. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this has probably taken over as my favorite. There's over 20 different choices of dogs, which is hard to believe. I kinda wanted to try them all, but ended up choosing the Illinois and the special of the day, the Arkansas dog. The Illinois (tomato, banana peppers, celery salt) had a bountiful amount of banana peppers and not too much bacon (which surprisingly, I liked). But I really liked the Arkansas dog (bacon, cheddar and scallions, horseradish) because of the horsey sauce on top and the. The prices aren't bad at all. Around $2.50-$3 for what I call a "gourment dog" is great!I also tried the potato salad which had the right amount of mayo in it. It's hard to get that nice balance. But I will say, I enjoy a lot of it! Throw in fresh squeezed lemonade and I'm a believer!I can't wait to work my way through the menu, because... it. is. happening!

Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. The place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.A little patio with a little waterfall and little birds flitting about.A little bit different than your average local mexican, since it's NEW mexican style.A little bit of $ for a little more food than I could eat at once.A lot is how much I like Gil's food and service.A lot is how much effort the proprietor seems to have put into creating a unique, quaint, homey, and comforting menu and atmosphere.A lot is how much effort you should put into finding this little gem.

Thank goodness this meal was paid for with the expense account because it was basically a sit down Panda Express with fancy cocktails. You know that taste you get in your mouth when you've eaten too much sweets... yeah, expect to get that after dinner here.My facorite location, after a few days non stop drinking in Vegas, I really need salty food to absorb leftover alcohol in me to feel slightly better...I've always liked the decor and seatings here.The hangover cure food I usually like to order: Chang's vegetarian lettuce wraps, made with tofu: so yummy, no matter how hangover I am, I still need veggies ;p Hot & Sour soup, chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms, balanced with hot white pepper and vinegar: this is a MUST for hangover! Always makes me much better.... Very deliciousPepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favoriteHunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover! I like all those dishes with Taingtao beer, service is always good. Funny I like Americanized Chinese food much better than authentic Chinese food, I like salty sometime for some reasons, but never greasy and oily, P.F.Chang food is salty without greasy, just what I need & love sometime! ;pGREAT WALL OF SALTWe came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. We decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. Our waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.I started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.We then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.For dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. Everything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.I would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. To recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me.

Another afternoon in the Summerlin area, we decided to trek over to the Suncoast Casino for some grub.  I'm so happy we encountered this place that serves happy hour deals all day everyday!   Appetizers are half price in their large bar area.  The Tuscan Spinach Dip was served with fresh (warm) tortilla chips.  Their $1.50 bucket of fries weren't really served in a bucket, but were way worth it.  A high point of our dining experience was the sliders, each for $1.50 on the happy hour menu.  With a nice charbroiled taste and caramelized onions, we ended up ordering more.  A low point was my incomplete house salad.  This order usually comes with croutons, cucumber slices, and a garlic breadstick.  I pretty much had a small plate of just lettuce.  They did bring me a garlic breadstick later though.Speaking of bringing it...all the waiters work as a team, tending to all patrons.  I must've dealt with six different waiters after we were seated.  Service was with a smile and diligence!  The drinks weren't bad either during happy hour.  I tried their Electric Lemonade which was like kool-aid with a little kick.  Their $5 Margarita, with 1800 Silver Tequila, was flawless.  The next time I visit, I will partake in their Endless Soup, Salad and Bread Lunch Deal.  From 10am to 4pm, $4.99 will get you all you can eat soup, salad, and bread.  What a freakin deal.  Hell...I might just have to get a slider or two while I'm at it.

So Ive been on a low carb "lifestyle" as of the first of the year so options aren't all that plentiful when visiting my friends out in the 'burbs. Fortunately the wings at BWW are fried and not breaded. So for about 3 carbs for every six (less the sauce) you can have a pretty good and satisfying meal. The garlic parmesan (2 carbs per oz of sauce) wings are pretty good with a side of ranch and some celery, perfect! The service was really friendly but for a bar type place the dining room was packed with kids. Not that I cant stand kids just that with all the beer served it just doesn't seem like a family kind of place, talk about a bad example. Do you really want your kids hanging out in a bar?Im just glad that there are more low carb options out this way.. though leave the kids at home or take them to Olive Garden!So I typically check into a place, and maybe leave a quick tip.  My experience tonight has inspired me to FINALLY write a review.  This is not a good thing.  For me to take the time to write a full review takes some serious impression upon me from the restaurant.  In this case, the impression was so piss poor I couldn't help but come home and sit down directly to cyber-lambast our evening's activity.  This Buffalo Wild Wings has been closed for over a year, and I honestly think they should either A) hire a competent staff with a great manager or B) close their doors again because they clearly have no idea what they are doing as a team.  To begin, we are a party of 6, well 5 1/2 since the baby doesn't count as fully human yet.  We were told that a booth that seats 6 would open up momentarily and would we mind a brief wait.  No sweat.  I like sitting on my husband's lap, but NOT at dinner in a restaurant.  After sitting for a few we were told to follow the host.  He sat us down at a small booth that literally squished me up against my husband and the baby's car seat.  When I questioned "Is this the booth for 6?  It's awfully small." The host said, "No this seats 4, but you could wait if you want for the large booth."  I thought we had made that choice already, but I suppose ignoring your customer's preference is ok. The host said he could bring a car seat sling since we were squashed.  Having 3 older hungry children I acquiesced to his offer.Our server appeared promptly, and she was very upbeat.  OK, things were getting better.  She took our drink orders and gave individualized attention to the children which was great.  My husband ordered a beer, we all ordered sodas.  She returned with the sodas and said the beer was on the way.  She took our appetizer order and the meal order.  She asked if we would like the appetizer before the entree and we said yes. The beer still hadn't arrived.  When she checked in a few mins later the beer STILL hadn't found it's way to the table.  She personally grabbed it from the bar.  As my husband took the first sip he noted that the beer was skunked.  (bad flavor, sat out and got warm and then was re-chilled).  he mentioned this to the server and she stated "Oh yea we have some issues with beer at the bar getting bad.  Happens a lot."  Really????So at this point the entrees come to the table.  Where is the appetizer??  No one knows.  Also the carrot/celery order magically changed into 4 orders of celery.  The server says she will check with the kitchen about the status of the appetizer and grab some carrots as well.  We just started eating our food because we were hungry.Now the food was good.  I can't complain about the wings at all.  The kids liked their kids meals.  The portions were good.  This was the ONLY saving grace of the evening.The server comes back with carrots and says the appetizer is coming.  We keep eating and notice there are no extra napkins.  With chicken wings you sorta need napkins...wings are messy.  We are messy. Our fingers and faces are messy.  It's hard to feed a squirmy 9 month old and try not to get the hot sauces on our fingers mixed with the not hot food she's eating.  The appetizer still is MIA.At this point all the kids are done eating.  I am full.  I am requesting a box.  My husband is done eating.  He asks for a non-skunked beer.  The beer comes and the appetizer is STILL not there.  The server says "Do you want the kitchen to just box up the appetizer?"  The nice lady I am says outloud "Yea I guess so."  The furious b***h inside me says silently "You can tell the kitchen to shove the appetizer up their A$$"  So we get an appetizer in a box well after the entree to go home with.  We ordered a sampler platter (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, nachos, and some wings) none of which is too tasty after getting cold and spending a night in a fridge.  We pay our full bill...not even a sorry was offered.  I honestly didn't even feel like paying the $12 for the platter but I was just too disappointed to say anything.  We rarely go out to eat since we are a large family.  Spending $100 for dinner just isn't always in our budget.  I didn't want to mar the evening for the kids by complaining.  They thought everything was terrific, so I let them maintain that belief.  When I got home I opened the sampler platter just to see what was in there....the three sauces were in the box with no lids and the sauces had managed to spill on everything and mix together.  I now have a bunch of snacks swimming in a melange of ranch, cheese sauce, and marinara....not my idea of a flavor explosion.  We don't eat out often, and it's experiences like these that keep me from wanting to go dine out.  I know it's a chain and not Chez Robertfancypants, but I expect my appetizers at the table before the meal and most certainly not in a box after the meal has been eaten.  Sorry Wild Wings.....we gave you a shot, but I don't think I want to drop $100 again.  Ever.

How could I pass this up. FREE Grand Slam breakfast to anyone showing up from 6am-2pm.This is Vegas so anytime there FREE food to be found people crawl out from under their rocks and show up.Knowing this I went early at 6am to this location across from the College of Southern Nevada in the Wal-mart shopping center.When I arrived it was fairly busy but no line or wait.Service was fast & friendly they were very excited about the big promotion.We ordered coffee & water-we both got scrambled eggs,2 bacon,2sausage linkss and 2 pancakes.They food was pretty good. Fresh and hot but still just fast food. I like my bacon crispier and I like hashbrowns instead of pancakes but what they hell it's FREE,right?The service was really good so we tipped $5 and spent $5 on coffee for 2 people NOT Bad. By the time we ate & paid there was a line out the door and past the first 3 stores in the shopping center. I drove by again around Noon and the line was still out the door.I did not let that deter me...........read my other reviewDenny's is crap most of time anymore but this location is hit and miss and when you hit it, it's good. My last meal the manager was very cool and checked on us often making sure we liked the food and all. My soda was never left unfilled. On other visits the manager has been lousy, doesn't check on tables and customer after customer complains resulting in some sort of compensation with the bill. If only the lousy manager could learn something from the good one. IHOP tastes better to me but a few times a year I get a late night craving for breakfast and with the $2, $4, $6 and $8 meals it's usually worth it. Parking can be cramped during the however late at night it's better.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #302 - #365.                We were staying at Encore just a 2 minute walk north of our hotel and wanted a budget friendly breakfast. So we decide to eat at America's favorite diner, "Denny's!"The restaurant was packed and we only waited for 10 minutes before getting called. Our server was friendly as well as the rest of the staff. I ordered the Grand Slam and orange juice, the food was just ok in my book. We were always checked on for refills and if the food was cooked perfectly. I like how the staff goes out of their way to please the customer. If I'm staying at the Encore again, I'll be sure to come back to this Denny's location for an affordable breakfast and good service. I know the food in Encore will cost an arm and a leg!This is probably my second time at a Denny's ever. A friend and I came here for food after having a late night adventure around town. People always tell me that Denny's is just cheap diner food, but nothing was really open in the area that sparked our interest so we decided that Denny's will do. I know I shouldn't expect much because it's not fine dining, but here it goes...When we first arrived, we weren't even greeted and two employees glanced right at us and continued their conversation. I don't like interrupting people (and I know they acknowledged our presence because they glanced at us) so we just waited until they stopped. We were seated shortly after their conversation ended and were greeted by what seemed to be the only person working the front end. This guy was friendly, but service was slow for a night that wasn't busy (there were a total of two tables dining in, including our table). I ordered the fish & chips.The fish & chips are white fish fillets fried to a crispy golden brown served with fries and a side order of your choice (I went with their steamed broccoli). It was good for something from a chain diner, but it wasn't anything that I would rave about.Service was basically non-existent because our waiter didn't show up through our whole meal except when we were almost done. He made a snarky comment  after he noticed we grabbed a ketchup bottle from the empty table next to us, since the one on our table ran out and we were almost done with our meal. Like I said, the service wasn't there and it wasn't until we were getting ready to leave and pay for our food that the waiter starts having these long conversations about his past, and at the end of the night we just wanted to go home (we wouldn't have minded if he talked to us during our meal, but we literally were done and paid for and it was kinda awkward for us to end the conversation). Here's the bottom line: come here at 1 in the morning if you want to hear oldies music while Law & Order SVU is playing on their TVs on mute, and at the same time you can hear the employees having inappropriate conversations in the kitchen. I'm not gonna lie, it definitely was a unique experience to say the least but I don't think I'll go back. Maybe it would've been a better experience during the day, but then again it's just a Denny's...

I may bump this place up to 4 stars on my next visit.  The presentation was very good, the food smelled great, the service was very good.My criticisms are that the mixed grill was mostly overdone.  Not so much that it was bad, it was very flavorful.  But the shrimp was chewy and the lamb was overdone as well.The garlic naan was awesome.  The chicken tikka was very flavorful and was very different than other places I've had it.The portion on the naan was great, less so on the tikka and the mixed grill.The place has a nice, open layout and features accents of broken plates worked into the columns and other areas.

Just another new breakfast / lunch spot in the Vegas Valley. Of course, it's close to my old condo so i had to give it a try. Ate there twice for breakfast while i was making the move - place was hoppin' ( it's in an industrial park area - most of the customers were workers in the area ) decent $2.95 breakfast - the usual 2 eggs, potatoes toast, bacon/sausage/ham. Also tried their version of the grand slam - cost $5.95. if in the area and need a quick bite at reasonable prices, i recommend. Go out of your way for a special breakfast/lunch ? not the place. happy eating !We were tipped off by a local about this place after working a freelance job in the area. It's really a great hole-in-the-wall. We arrived for lunch seconds before they closed (they serve breakfast and lunch only). The kitchen seemed less than pleased (turn off that "open" sign!) but we were warmly welcomed by both our waitress and the owner. I ordered a pastrami on rye.It was a very good sandwich, although the pastrami wasn't stacked high like a deli would do it. After my first bite I thought it lacked something. Seeing a bottle of mustard on the table it clicked that this was the missing condiment. After spreading some mustard on the marble rye I was quite satisfied.The owner spent some time with us, telling the stories behind some of the pictures on the wall.  He was a very congenial fellow and we enjoyed the tales of his family history.Prices were fantastic. The food and service was great. But...uh-oh..the bathroom was rather messy with garbage overflowing and toilet paper all over the floor (yelp removed my photo - see below).

I was stuck for a few hours in a neighborhood that I wasn't familiar with, so I Yelped for a good lunch place to head to in the neighborhood.  I found Mr. Mama's and was quite pleased!My hubby came to pick me up for lunch and we headed over to Mr. Mama's.  We walked in and stood at the front for a few minutes before we were greeted.  We were then told to sit anywhere we wanted too.  We grabbed a table and were greeted by our server pretty quickly.  We ordered and our food came out fast.  My hubby got a Reuben and it was delicious!  I had the chili cheese burger and it was ok.  The burger was awesome but the chili was weird.  I am a chili con carne style chili girl and the chili here was more of the Midwest style of a more tomato-y style.  If I had just gotten a regular cheese burger I think I would have been much happier.  Oh well.  It wasn't bad, just not the style I really like.  Don't get me wrong, I still chowed down on the burger though.We finished up our meal with a cinnamon roll that our server recommended.  It was one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  It was a big one and we decided to split it.  Once we started eating it though, I think we both wished we had ordered two so we wouldn't have had to share.  Ha ha!Overall Mr. Mama's was a good place to eat.  Good solid food, ok service, and a pretty decent menu.  Yum.Mr Mama? Sorry, that just doesn't sound right. Do they have a lunch/dinner place called Miss Daddy? Am I the only one that thinks this is weird? Anyways, how's that for an intro to this review?Now that I got your attention, Mr Mama's sure got mine after having lunch there the other day. I was impressed in a lot of ways.For starters, from the outside, the place looks like a nice little hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place. But when I opened the door and walked in, I had to do a double take. It's kind of like that one closet from that Narnia movie. Yeah, that closet. So I am directed by one of the many servers to any table that's available. The menu's are all ready to go on all the tables. What a concept. You come in, grab any available table, go over the menu, order, eat, and you're out. These guys definitely got a system down. I would say I was helped out by at least 3 different servers. That's why their service is very good. They are constantly running around. As for the food, I noticed a lot of good choices. But that day, I was really hungry and I was not gonna settle just for any burger. No sir. So I got their biggest burger called Mama's Burger. Damn. This was a case of my eyes being hungrier than my stomach. Two half pound patties, slices of avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and an onion ring. At first glance, I didn't know how to attack it. I kid you not, I was rotating my plate just looking for a chink in the armor. In the end, I ended up trying to smash it down with the palm of my hand in hopes of getting it down to the size of my mouth. Needless to say, I could only eat half of it. At that point I felt like running away crying to Mr. Mama himself (or is it herself? I don't wanna assume anything you know?). Ok, so I had dinner covered.The only thing that might be a disappointment is their hours. 6 am to 3 pm. What if I wanna redeem myself for that burger and it just happens to be dinner time? *flashback to that lunch moment* Ok, I take it back, that's not really a disappointment.So, umm, yeah go check this place out. Don't forget to redeem your free beverage when you check in.Today was a multiple stop day and I included breakfast on the list of things I had to do.  I've been going to try Mr. Mama's for several months and today was it.As soon as I entered, a server told me to sit anywhere I was comfortable.  That's what they said to everyone entering the restaurant and it's really a nice way of saying, "Come on in.  You're welcome here.  make yourself comfortable."I had coffee quickly and the server gave me the password for the wifi which was quite zippy.  I like when it works the way it should.  I ordered the Cali omelette which is Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Topped with Avocado.  With it came hash brown potatoes and two slices of swirled rye toast.  The menu says all omelettes are made with 4 eggs. The breakfast was really very good.  My coffee was refilled and I had a good time watching the cooks do their thing behind the counter.  They do a fair amount of take out and it was interesting to watch them get the boxes and bags ready.Mr. Mama's is in the commercial area in the Valley View/Decatur area and there are a number of car repair places there.Besides the good taste of the food, the thing I most take away from my visit is the genial nature of the staff.  You are welcome there and they let you know your business is appreciated.  Thank you Mr. Mama!Had breakfast here yesterday~Thanks Vegas yelpers for the great reviews!My gf and I shared the breakfast burrito and popular french toast.Pocket friendly prices, great customer service, lots of seating, clean bathroom and no problems with parking. Love the hours!!!Will come back to try more things of the menu!-Miss Yelp 2013Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama! Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!Having passed by Mr Mama's on numerous occasions over the years, I was finally able to stop by to try them out. We were greeted warmly by Mr Mama himself and were seated quickly. As we perused our menus, our drink orders were take and Mr Mama chatted with us a while. He told us they have been open for two years now and 80% of their business was tourists, which I found pretty surprising seeing as they are in a relatively industrial and local area. The place was packed but service was hospitable and quick. Refills were on point and the food came out quickly. My ham and cheese omelet was solid and so was the albacore tuna melt. Very tasty and reasonably priced. Everything we had was fresh as well. Definitely sad that it took me so long to give Mr Mama's a chance.With service and food as fabulous as it was, I anticipate returning to Mr Mama's often.Bottomless CoffeeButtermilk BiscuitJumbo Cinnamon RollDouble Chocolate Chip Pancakes with Two Eggs and Bottomless Coffee (Daily Special)Single Serving of French ToastOne of the longest standing members on my breakfast 'to-do' list and a place to which I'd purchased a $20 discounted gift-certificate some six months prior it was finally on Saturday that I drove down to Mr. Mama's and although the small breakfast and lunch spot is unlikely to win any awards for innovation it can only be said that this truly is a place committed to putting a smile on each patron's face.  Undoubtedly a locals institution in which nearly every other customer was a regular with orders frequently anticipated by staff it was just past 7:15 that I was invited to seat myself and with no less than three servers offering to get me coffee as I perused the menu it became immediately apparent as to why the restaurant was filled to capacity by eight o'clock.  Focused mostly on diner staples with a whiteboard of specials just left of entry while prices trend far lower than almost anywhere else in the 702 my meal began with Mr. Mama's oft-raved $3.50 cinnamon roll and with a soft, yeasty base rife with cinnamon and butter beneath sweet frosting the hype proved justified, a smallish biscuit proving less worthy its $2.75 tab, though still quite good.  Preceding next to plates more hearty it was with a thin slice of French Toast that my meal moved on and opting this time to bring my own maple syrup from home the result was improved, though still nothing to write home about, particularly when compared to fluffy flapjacks studded with dark and white chocolate, a daily special matched with two eggs and at least six cups of coffee for less than $9.Likely generating its fan base more through low prices and friendly service rather than by location or particularly excellent food I cannot say I'll be rushing back to Mr. Mama's soon, but for locals on a budget or those with little one's looking for a good breakfast at a great price the restaurant definitely fills a niche - the open-kitchen of blazing-fast line cooks and televisions tuned to college football providing a bit of entertainment for those interested in such things, as well.Stopped at Mr. Mamma's for brunch today, which is almost hidden in a small strip mall.  The owner (who happens to live a couple of developments down from me in Henderson) greeted us as we walked through the door, added us to the wait list, and gave us a menu to peruse while we waited.  He advised that there would be a 15 minute wait, but it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.  While we waited I noticed that he interacted warmly with everyone who came in and kept a keen eye on the food coming out of the open kitchen as well as on the service.  This is an owner who takes great pride in his restaurant (IMO) and I appreciate that.  Once seated our waitress was quick to take our order and bring our drinks.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and I am told the coffee was very good ($2.50 each).We started with the cinnamon roll to share.  This thing is huge!  It came out hot and fresh.  The icing was too sweet for my taste, but I ate around the icing without issue. $3.50I had the short stack pancakes (2 cakes) & eggs with extra crispy bacon.  The pancakes were also huge, but they were fluffy and had a nice traditional flavor.  I almost got through one!  The scrambled eggs were good and the bacon was thick cut.  $7.45My dining companion had the steak and eggs w/ hashbrowns.  He advised that the hashbrowns were fantastic, and that the steak was okay, but he would likely order something different in the future. $9.95We felt that the pricing was reasonable, the staff fast and friendly, and the food was good.  I like that you can order breakfast all day, but the burgers and some of the other lunch orders coming out of the kitchen also looked appetizing, so I may try one of those next time.As we were leaving, the owner shook our hands and asked about our experience.  Nice to see he cares this much.  We will be back.On this trip to Vegas we made it a point to venture off the strip and find some awesome eating establishments that were considered "local gems". Then I found Mr. Mama on Yelp. We headed over for breakfast before heading to Red Canyon...there was a 30 minute wait, but if this place is THAT packed and people are waiting with no problem (and they have over 1,000 reviews...) we knew it'd be worth the wait.I'm still pretty blown away by how good it actually was. You know the feeling...you read the reviews...you see the photos...you over hype a place in your mind so much so that when you actually eat there it's a let down. Well, not here. Mr. Mama delivered! First, we have to start with the hostess - who is Mr. Mama's daughter. She greeted everyone with a smile. Handled the list like a pro. Bussed tables. Sat people. Even helped bring out plates. We had to tell her at the end of the meal how awesome she was - I really meant it. That place runs like clockwork mainly because of her. She made it a point to say her dad taught her - love family run businesses!Ok, so on to the food.Giant Cinnamon Roll - fluffy, gooey, sweet, delicious. WHOA! Get this. Mind you it really IS MASSIVE...so share it. But man, this was hands down the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. *come to think of it, it was the only homemade cinnamon roll I have ever had, but still....get it!Choice of meat and eggs - 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. $6.75. WHAT? First of all, it was delicious - BUT THAT PRICE THOUGH!?!?! It's crazy they can make a profit on it. The hashbrowns were great. Eggs are eggs...and the bacon was thick and crispy! It was quality food...at a super discounted price!The wife had the Cali omelet (minus the sausage) - I took a bite and it was delicious as well.The coffee they serve was also really good. They bring little french vanilla creamers which might not impress most people, but I thought it was a super nice touch.Overall, we left stuffed and only spent ~$25. If we lived in Vegas I'd be the DUKE of this place, I have no doubt about it. If you're in town visiting and looking for a great meal on the cheap...hit it up! As for you locals....I envy you.Standard breakfast offerings with low prices and great service- this place frequently makes the list of top restaurants on Vegas' Yelp homepage and even made the list of top 100 restaurants on Yelp for 2014. But I'm not sure they live up to the hype.I'm not much of a breakfast person but I love a good breakfast burrito- opted for one here and the tortilla was soaked in so much grease that I went through several napkins wiping down my hands after each bite. The tortilla was so soaked that it was transparent in parts. The filling had a limited amount of flavorless cheese, plus peppers and onions, but was virtually void of salt and pepper. Bacon was requested well-done but seemed undercooked and added no texture to the dish.I did not eat or save the second half of my burrito as I'd originally planned. For $7 I wasn't particularly bothered.This may be a great place for an omelet, but it's pretty hard to screw up an omelet. Portions are decent and service is friendly, but the breakfast burrito shouldn't be on the menu if it isn't done well.Came in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Located in a strip center parking was no issue what so ever.I saw the chicken fried steak was popular but instead ordered the ham & eggs with hash browns and wheat toast. The price was reasonable and the portion was generous. The ham was tasty, hash browns crispy and even the coffee was yummy!The service from all the waitresses was spot on and I would return here in a heartbeat, no wonder this place  is popular with locals!#77 on the list of "Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the U.S. for 2015" (printed 1-22-15)The best thing about Yelp is meeting a fellow Yelper in real life, going somewhere that you've both Bookmarked, and having a new friend!  This is what happened on my most recent trip to Las Vegas, the 9th Hawaiian Island.Terri R. & I agreed to meet here because of the great reviews from Nadine J., Russ C., Mike O., Lilian N., Norm K., and other friends.  I arrived first and was greeted warmly by the owner who welcomed me in from the gray, overcast, cold, rainy morning.  Terri was right on time and we both got to choose where we wanted to sit!  We shared the fluffy Short Stack Pancakes and I got the deliciously light Greek Omelet with the crisp but moist hash browns and wheat toast - everything was perfect!  The serving was so large that I had to take the leftovers to go!  The prompt and friendly service, the yummy food, and the "blue" environment was excellent!I will for sure return for more breakfast!  They should be opening soon at their new, larger location on Jones Boulevard.  Can't wait to return and dine again with Terri R.!

We were looking for a quick bite to eat and didn't feel like venturing too far from where we were. After texting friends where we were (they were gambling) they said they'd join us later but to go ahead and start without them. The restaurant wasn't busy when we walked in, in fact there was only 1 table occupied. This probably should've been a clue. I wasn't impressed with the food nor the service. It took awhile for anyone to realize we were waiting to be seated. There were no servers nor was anyone standing in the front. A server walked out of the kitchen area toward us, didn't greet us, probably did a mental head count and told us to follow her. She plucked the menus on the table and walked off. I wasn't impressed with my chicken Cobb salad. It tasted bitter. Don't know why and couldn't figure it out. The chicken was dry and not seasoned. On the plus side it had lots of avocado and I love avocado. I ended up picking through my salad and eating only the avocado. My friend had the prime rib and it looked pretty sorry and very unappetizing. He said it had mostly gristle, and had no flavor even after dumping the sauce on it. Maybe we came here on an off day. We ended up not finishing our meal.Our waitress didn't check on us or ask us how our meal was. Overall the meal was meh and the service was blah. I guess they'd rather have you in the casino gambling than eating. While we were walking out, my friends had finally pried themselves away from gambling to join us. Sorry you guys missed the boat but that's probably a good thing.Skip this place unless you're really desperate and dying of starvation.

I came here with a friend a few days ago for dinner and drinks. I found it on Yelp of course. =)I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the chicken tenders and my friend ordered the fish and chips. The chicken tenders were ok. I wish they were a little bit crispier. For drinks I ordered the Fresh Strawberry martini. I loveddddd it. Not only was it well worth the $9 but it was made with fresh strawberries which I loved. My friend ordered the Appletini which was also quite tasty. I would definitely come back for their drinks. They do have a happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7 which I'd like to come back for the drinks again and to try their appetizers.The only thing that got me was we got charged for sides of ranch. I ordered chicken tenders so I felt that it should've already come with the meal not be charged extra. The service was really good. Our waitress was really friendly. It's a really good place to just hang out and watch a game for all you sports lovers. =)When we rolled in to Blue 32 last Saturday I was such a grouch.  I hate leaving the house on Saturdays, especially this close to Christmas.  But I wanted to take Mr. M to Fox Cigar Bar because we always have a good time there, so we were in the area.  I had a few coupons burning a hole in my pocket for some stores in the San Tan Village area, but it was so crowded I couldn't bring myself to get out of the car.  No way, Jose.  Saving 15% is not worth my sanity.Beer.  That's what I need.  A nice cold beer.Based on some friends' recommendations we decided to try Blue 32 and as soon as we walked in we were greeted with 2 screaming kids.  Give me a freakin' break.  I almost left, but we were seated in a corner table up by the window, so the screaming was off in the distance a little.  Started out with a couple of Sierra Nevada ales and the shrimp and bacon quesadilla.  Both disappeared in about 2 minutes.  We ate that quesadilla like it owed us money.  Great flavors and grilled nice and crisp.  Not floppy like a lot of places who are in a hurry to get the food out.  Then I had a house salad and a cup of the potato soup.  Mr. M had the wings and rib entrée.  We proceeded to have a little feast of our own.  GREAT wings and ribs!  Nice fresh little salad, and PERFECT potato soup!  I used to make 2 soups/day from scratch for a couple of restaurants a hundred years ago, and I love soup.  This baked potato soup was the best I've ever had and I'm craving it again.  They need to build a Blue 32 in that dying plaza near me at Alma School and Queen Creek.  I'd be over there every day eating soup and drinking beer.Our server was Marysa and she was the best.  When we were talking about soup she said we should try their chili and brought us a sample.  No beans, and perfect as well.  GREAT chili.  A customer sitting behind us said they have the best chili in town.  I'm inclined to agree with him.  They have plenty of TVs for all the games going on.  Personally, I'm just killing time until baseball season starts again.  Hockey will do for now.  Overall, I would happily go back to Blue 32.  When we left I was no longer a grouch.  Great visit!

Restaurant name  In-N-Out Burger

Review Text :
I cant believe it. An In-N-Out only 3 miles from my place. This is bad... Very bad...This place just opened... and it showed. Well, in a good way I mean. I drive by and the dining room seems empty. Its a Friday night around 10pm and I figure this place would be somewhat busy.I roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there. She proceeds to take my order and I drive up to the cashier window. The cashier then proceeds to confirm my full order. Finally I pull up to pick up window and my food near ready. A brief 2 minute wait and our food is ready to go. Here's a list of what we ordered:- Cheeseburger, Protein style.- Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion. - Fries, Animal style- Regular fries- Chocolate ShakeWhen we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.On a side note: While I was waiting, I did notice they had a lot of workers standing around waiting to make food... The problem is that it was slow so there was no orders to make!Of course, pictures included!!I woke up bleary eyed from after the second night of my Vegas bender and thought "TODAY is THE DAY for my first In-n-Out burger." So, without shower or makeup touch up, I walked to the convention I was supposed to be attending for about 5 seconds, turned around, walked to the front of the Venetian, hailed a cab and said "To the closest In-n-Out burger please!" Then I let the cabbie work his magic while I sat in the back trying not to throw up on his seats. Good start to the day! We make it there and sit in the drive through. There was an employee in the parking lot with a computerized handheld thing taking orders. I told him I'd never been before so he explained what they have...burgers, burgers, burgers. I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds! I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar. I wish they would put one of these on the strip somewhere so that I could go without spending $20 on a cab ride and $6 on food but I think for my first experience it was SO worth the money and I'd do it again in a second!If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I'm not that bright. So it shouldn't surprise you that I embarked on a 4.5 hour hike up a desert mountain with minimal supplies and only a few grapes for food. Or that I got lost on the way down. When I finally made my way back to civilization, I was what I like to call "Angry Hungry," Or, "hangry." Meaning, if I didn't eat anything soon I would have to hurt someone.* And even though I had reservations at a lovely French bistro later that evening, I knew what I needed, right then and there: a Double-Double, Animal Style. It was served with a genuine smile, which I rudely ignored in favor of immediately tearing into that burger like it had called me Stuart.** It was animalistic, indeed. And this thing was not only the best fast-food burger I'd ever tasted, but also a damn good deal at $3 and change. I don't always eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer In-N-Out.__________*Or more likely, weep uncontrollably until my mommy made me a snack.**I hate being called Stuart.Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, "What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -"If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now."Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand.1st to Review? @IN_N_OUT_Burger! Located near Sunset station & Galleria Mall this place is hopping!15 cars in the drive-thru @ 2 pm. BUT anyone who's eaten at In & Out KNOWS -It's always worth the wait.One of these days I'm gonna order a 10x10 and see how long it takes to finish it!Today however I went for the Double-Double Extra Pickles & Onion with sauce. My Usual!Fantastic down to the last crumb of bun!I hear there are now 7 locations throughout the valley-we could do with 10 more or the nice catering truck they have at In-N-Out!Attended the Coffee Crisp UYE here hosted by Jennifer C & Elle C.  I brought my Son along to enjoy the grub and Yelp fun.We were first to arrive and since it was packed, we ordered before everyone.  We ordered:2 Double Doubles Animal Style ($3.05)1 Cheeseburger Animal Style ($2.05)2 French Fries Animal Style ($3.25)We brought our own bottled Water.After a 15 minute wait, our food was ready.....it was already 1 pm and we didn't see any other Yelpers, so we started to eat our food.  The Double Double Animal Style was juicy & sloppy....just how I like it!  (see pics)  There's something about the spongy, toasted Bread, gooey Cheese, fresh Tomato & Lettuce, Special Sauce, and Grilled Onions that makes me want to never stop eating this stuff.  The Animal Style Fries were fantastic as well.About 1/2 way through our meal, I spotted Paolo D & Jennifer C at the door waiting for everyone.  I went over to introduce myself and let them know that we had room at our table and that we'd also keep an eye out for nearby tables to open up so we could all sit together.  We were eventually able to get everyone together.  We all enjoyed a nice meal plus we shared in some Coffee Crisps & Caramilk Bars for dessert courtesy of Elle C from Calgary! (see pics)What a great day & meal.  Great Food & Great People = Good TimesWill I return?  This location is very far away from where I live, but if there's another UYE here, I will try my best to make it.FRESH BEEF THAT'S NEVER FROZEN2013 INOB celebrated its' 65th anniversary. Yu-go chauffeur even got a t-shirt to commemorate the occasion. I think he has a dozen of their cool t-shirts representing different years.Their beef burgers are never frozen. Buns made without preservatives. Hand leaf their lettuce everyday. Fries are peeled and diced daily from fresh Kennebec potatoes. And, the fries are cooked in 100% cholesterol free oil since 1948.Extra thousand island dressing and grilled onions and it's burger time for us. Tough to beat the quality, price and service. Been coming to this location for ten years and it never fails to deliver my burger as I want it.Love the fact that you can get filled up at one of these Burger joints and not let it break the bank. The food is always freshly made and the service is very friendly.This particular location is in the Fiesta Mall parking lot and it can get pretty busy during peak hours. Usually get here before the lunch rush and eat quickly so I can get back to work in a hurry.3X3 with Onions, add Pickles and Chili Peppers, please. Sometime I'll treat myself to an order of their tasty and freshly sliced French Fries. Definitely can't resist a giant pile of the spicy complementary Chili Peppers. Oh Yeah!They have several ways that you can order your burger here. Just do a quick google for their Top Secret ordering instruction and you will be amazed. Animal style is a typical favorite and you will probably see a few during your visit.See ya there next time and remember to enjoy the moment. Life is Good. SAY CHEESE!3.75 STARS

This is an A&W/LJS-so everything taste fishy & fried-jkReally its a pretty good fast food burger & hotdog but the fried stuff is just too greasy & heavy for me.I jumped on the $.90 papa burgers on Fathers Day & this is one of the best bargains you will ever find at a fast food joint.I still hang on to the memories of yesteryear when A&W was just like Sonic with the roller waitresses and drive-up ordering unfortunately the food is no where near the same as it used to be.Just too damn FAST!Mmmmmm soooo good, I was sucking my spoon silly!***2011 Entertainment guide, buy one get one coupons***Yummy! My sister and I had a craving for a refreshing root beer float, also had a two for one coupon.The service is awesome for a fast food type of chain!We got our Yummy RB floats and were so happy just moaning and enjoying every sip and spoonful.The combination of the almost buttery tasting golden soft serve along with the A&W root beer is just amazing, the perfect blend!We will be back for sure! I want to experience this sensation again and again and again!!!It made me feel so darn good! The taste is out of this world!Mmmmmmmm yummy baby :)I like it a lot!

Right, so I had the fish tacos there, and I seriously had to search for the fish. I mean I am sure there were some itty bitty teeny tiny pieces of fish, more like they waved a fish over those tacos.. Humph.. bummer, I wanted to like this place, but that was a major disappointment.. Pass...

What a pleasant surprise!  Found Miko's tonight.  Story is, MIko and her husband Greg lived in SF, never operated a restaurant before -- moved to Vegas and after 5 years here, decided that their search for good tempura was futile.  They should do it themselves -- so Miko's was born.  And their tempura is yummy -- but so are the kalbi -- the sushi rolls we tried (Caliente and Fire Roll were our favs) -- oh and the agedashi tofu was amazing.  We shared some unfiltered sake and both got kirin (which is now on tap).  UNLV students -- please note - they serve 1/2 off beer and hot sake after 10.  Greg informed me that their karaoke machine is on the fritz at the moment, but they tend to have 3 separate demand generators:  lunch -- for the I've only got 30 minutes, gimme my tempura chcken crowd; familiy dinner with the kids crowd, and then the industry folk who begin to arrive around 10.  They're open late -- the food's good, the service is lovely.  Chi (probably not spelled right) has the energy and spunk for which she's named.  Miko is lovely and hospitable and very very interested in getting to know her customers.  The chefs are accommodating and friendly as well.  The interior  - despite the bright yellow walls -- is pretty sterile and simple, but the counter is fun and interesting and you can watch the full line.  They're not super crowded like Ichiza -- but that's location, too.  Off the 215 going southbound, they're in a new strip mall on the right hand side.  I'll definitely go back -Driving down E. Windmill Lane, we couldn't ignore the "izakaya" sign.  Spectacular reviews on yelp gave us the final push to check out this restaurant we've been so curious about. Weekday evening and happy hour has just ended (5 pm to 7 pm), so we're seeing an 'interesting' mix of people hanging out at the sushi bar.Upon seating, it's hard to ignore the menu because there is just so much to go through.  There's the Sushi and Sashimi menu, the "You Pick" Menu that includes Side Orders, the regular a la carte menu, the dinner combination menu, the Vegetarian menu, and the beverage menus.After some careful perusing, we decided to go with items from the You "Pick" Menu, Pick 3 - $15.95; Pick 4 - $19.95; Pick 5 - $24.95.  The waiter suggested we do the Pick 4 since we planned on ordering other things as well.* Wafu Yakiniku "Tender sliced beef with Miko's special sauce." - Steaming plate of tender and juicy pieces of beef.  Pretty good.* Shishamo "Grilled roe capelin" - Four pieces of smelt in this order.* Sashimi "Chef's choice of sliced raw fish" - A nice selection of raw fish, about five large slices.* Oyako-Don "Topped with simmered chicken and egg" - This dish arrived last.  It was a steaming bowl of chicken, onions, and scrambled egg on rice with sauce.  We were too full to enjoy this, so we packed it for home.* Tonkotsu Ramen "Ramen noodles and pork flavored soup.  Served with Miko's Gyoza" ($9.50) - Looking quite pretty with it's hard-boiled egg, fish cake, and vegetable greens floating on top, the soup looked pretty authentic.  However, the tonkatsu wasn't quite what we expected.  We're used to pork cutlet that's been breaded and fried, and this wasn't the case.  There was pork in the soup, but not what we know as tonkatsu.  (Maybe they got the order wrong?)  The gyoza was also a bit different - it's completely deep-fried and looks more like a flattened eggroll than a gyoza. (Update!  Candace C. was so nice to point out that tonkotsu ramen is actually a pork bone broth ramen, so that was our mistake that we were expecting tonkatsu - the deep fried pork cutlets!  See how one letter can change what you're expecting! At least now we know!)* Agedashi Tofu "Fried tofu in special broth" ($3) - The lone block of tofu was more fried than I hoped, and there wasn't much of a broth.  It was more like a light sauce on the bottom.Beyond the food, we couldn't help but notice the dynamics of the staff.  Sure, it definitely seemed like it was bit understaffed as the owner's husband was the waiter and busboy for the evening.  We also noticed one lone sushi chef and a prep cook behind the sushi bar.  The latter two were not the most professional using language like "asshole", etc. from behind the sushi bar and hollering up to the front.  I also found it weird that the girl who was hanging out at the sushi bar when we arrived eventually went behind the sushi bar to help out.  (Maybe she works there?  Her purse and phone were still by her seat.)Service was a bit slacking, only because Miko's husband was responsible for front of the house and he was alone.  We did have to ask for plates, refills, etc.  He did bring us complimentary miso soup though before our meal, which was a nice touch.  Before we left though, he chatted with us a bit and told us more about his wife's restaurant.  Having opened in September of 2008, they were doing quite well.  Then with the struggling economy, they have since expanded their menu to accommodate more diners and their various likings. A 65 year old Japanese chef overseas the kitchen and the recipes are authentic Japanese ones.  However, with the younger staff up front, they do maintain a different image for the younger crowd and dominates this restaurant and has pretty much taken over the sushi bar.I'm torn, I want to like this place for what it stands for and where it came from.  But I was turned off by the antics of the kitchen staff.  When I'm looking for more authentic Japanese home cooked food, this place would be a good consideration.  I think they need to work on getting the food out at the proper times too.Sake-To-Me!Literally! So I should have called Sangeetha to tell her I was coming here, but I just stopped by after a visit to Tokyo Discount...Greg and Miko warmly welcomed me, and when they learned I was engaged, I got cold unfiltered sake on the house!  yum.  My meal consisted of the long-awaited spicy tuna bowl with soft shell crab on top, nimono, and saba sashimi, plus matcha iced tea (surprise, surprise).The bowl: soooo good, fulfilled my cravings.  The soft shell crab was very crispy and tasty, but not greasy at all.  This was served beautifully with cucumbers, masago, lemon slices, and daikon.The nimono: This is basically Japanese comfort food.  Daikon, carrot, potato, taro, fish cake, and maybe burdock cooked in dashi-esque broth.  Warm, soft, delish...The saba: Cured to perfection, delicate but flavorful, cut by the master.  I ate the daikon and the perilla leaf too.The tea and sake: satisfying counterbalances :)and yes, it was packed in there fairly late on a Thursday!Look for an upcoming UYE one of these days, super-vegetarian-friendly!I love how vegan-friendly this place is!! REAL sushi roll options (not just boring old cucumber or avocado).  Agedashi tofu without those pesky bonito flakes.  Yakisoba, mmm.  And egg-free tempura.  Kimpira! My problem when I go here is that I want to order EVERYTHING.  Everything is so good and reasonably priced.  I am partial to the age tofu roll, and I will swoon over the tempura.  You really can't go wrong.  Check for the veggie special of the day!How could anyone of Japanese lineage give this place more than 3 stars?This place is completely marketed and designed for Westerners. When you walk inside all you see are: White folks, Hawaiians, and a random Korean guy sitting in back.  There were absolutely  no one of Japanese descent eating here.Before I write my review, let me tell you a personal story about my Dad. Everyone from Hawaii will tell you stories about that one Japanese family who lived on their street who absolutely refused to assimilate to Hawaiian culture. They didn't speak in that "Wakki Lakki talk", hated saying Aloha, refused to call their brothers: "brah-duh", and thought surfing was the sport of idiots. These Japanese men raised their kids in a traditional Japanese style. And, that was how my Dad was raised. So, he knows good Japanese food when he sees it. My Dad came to Miko's about 2 years ago and hated it so much that he called me and told me never to come here. I didn't believe him back then because my Dad literally hates everything for no reason. He even hated Urusawa(the most famous sushi bar in LA), and got into a fight with the chef. So, when I walked in Miko's today, I had totally forgotten everything he had told me about this place. For the first time in my life, I actually agree with my Dad on something. This place wasn't a Japanese restaurant.  When I first walked in, I stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before anyone even said "hi" to me. The man working here(who looked like he was half white and half Hawaiian-Japanese) was too busy kissing the asses of the regular customers to even bother seating me. The regular customers here get all the priority. Even if they order 15 minutes after you order, they will get their food before you do. When I was finally sat, it took him another 5 minutes to come back over and take my order. And after he dropped my bowl of Ramen off, he never came back over again. This whole time I was here, he was acting lazy and having fun with all his regular customers.Some places use a Tonkotsu base for their Miso Ramen, while  most places use a chicken bone base. Miko's Izakaya uses water mixed with a powder. The 2 slices of Narutomaki were nothing more than generic prepackaged "swirl" fish cakes you buy at Greenland Market. It's a product of South Korea.The hanjuku egg was nothing more than just a hard boiled egg with no soy sauce. And the egg was VERY hard boiled. The Charsiu tasted like it was made days in advance. It didn't even taste like pork. It tasted like an oven roasted piece of dried out turkey. The Miso Ramen's broth tasted 100% identical to Nissan Ramen's Instant Miso Flavor, which you can buy at both Greenland Market and Japan Creek.If you want good Ramen in Las Vegas, go to places like Ramen Sora, Shuseki, Yagyu Yakinku. Anime Ramen has not been the same since Ryosuke went back to Japan, but it's still far superior to the instant cup of noodles you get at Miko's. This was a 1-star experience. The food was 1-star, and the service was 1-star. The only reason I am giving this place another star is because when I was leaving, the Sushi Chef(a true full-blooded Japanese man) tried to get my attention.  He then gave me a certain unique look which I remembered from my youth with my Dad. While I was eating, I did notice the look of concern that the traditional Japanese Chef had on his face when he noticed I was being ignored. Traditional Japanese men do not have to use words to express their feelings of regret. When I was walking out the door, he let me know with facial expressions and body language that he felt it was wrong that I was treated so badly. I thought it was a kind gesture.

L'Orignal has done me and my friends so wrong.  I don't know where I can get the same quality and delicious of a meal back home.  The restaurant is on a cellar level, hidden yet present on the streets of Montreal.  The inside is cozy and romantic, with a great emphasis on game-to-table type of food.  This was no doubt the best meal of our weekend.To start, our table ordered the Bison Tartare (game is game, right?).  This appetizer comes with a touch of Middle Eastern style - the way they separate the different ingredients - onions, cheese, pickles, meat, sauce with a fried pita bread.  We all enjoyed the game meat, just a tad different from what we normally eat.  Next, we ordered their special appetizer - salmon salad.  Raw salmon, with cucumbers, peppers, capers, and acidic goodness.  It was a salad not to be missed.  After that, they sent us a "complimentary salad".  What came out was two huge plates of salad, with kale, carrots, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, and more.  The dressing was good, making the salad amazing!  The appetizers didn't stop there.  Next, we ordered the beet risotto with walnut pesto.  Another creamy creation.  Moving on, everyone settled down to their own plate of entree.  My friend and I shared the special entree - I can't remember the specifics, but it was a trout or some kind of white fish.  Steamed fresh, took a while to cook, and decorated with tons of delicious greens.  The fish was meaty and tender.  If they keep this special entree up, you've got to try it!4.5Pricey... but the meal is worth it. For my first meal in Montreal, I had the good fortune to share it with the reigning reine of the City of Saints, Risa D. As I wandered through the narrow streets and alleyways, I wondered what she had in store. As soon as I opened the door, heard the strains of an awesome Spotify playlist and smelled what was going on in the kitchen, I knew I was in for a good night.Set in what looks like a hip hunting lodge basement, L'Orignal is original. Behind us was a Montreal version of the Sex & The City ladies. To our right was an older man and his young, buff male escort. Further in the dining room was a rowdy table of Canadian bros. Never would I think to put all these disparate types together, but it works. All this observing and judging made me thirsty, so I began the evening with a Grape Escape cocktail. For a time, I was on a muddled grape kick so this vodka concoction really fit the bill. Not only that, but it was a nice pairing with my soupe courge (that's butternut squash to you non-francophones). Warmed up and feeling good, I ordered the pasta of the day (rabbit cavatelli) and a robust Bordeaux to accompany it (Château Puy-Landry). The pasta was a revelation. Living in New Orleans for a few years, I'd had rabbit more than a few times and I was never that big a fan. Going with the dish based upon the recommendation of our waitress, I held some skepticism. It was for naught. The cavatelli was delicious and the rabbit bore none of the nasty gaminess I remembered. In fact, the meal was positively decadent and spot-on for a chilly night in Old Montreal/Old Port. Be aware that taxes run high and tip isn't included in the meal (I'm used to getting gouged with auto-gratuity in Miami).

Review Text :
Tried the seafood pasta special here a year or so ago and was underwhelmed- too much crayfish and not much flavor, as I recall.  Desserts here are much better, though; Warning: those with a sweettooth should be extra careful dining at The Eagles Buffet next door, especially on Mother's Day... unless you have the discipline to put extra time at the gym!Had lunch here today (3/10)- turkey club (smoked turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and mayo on fresh croissant) and crispy sweet potato fries as my choice of side.  Yes, I chose this spot only bec. I had a craving for SPF!  I only had 30 minutes' time alloted for lunch (which explains the lack of photos), but I thought a simple sandwich and fries wouldn't take much time.  Was I wrong!  First of all, it took 5 minutes from the moment I was seated at the table for my server to take my order.  Second, my order took more than 15 minutes to arrive, but I had to send the fries back as they were very soggy.  After a few minutes, however, these fries were perfect!  The sandwich included processed turkey slices (circular slices straight from the bag) and a lettuce leaf that was just large enough to span the length and width of the croissant.  I did appreciate the fact that the slices of bacon were pretty lean- I am one to trim off cooked fat from bacon before placing them back in my sammies.  (I know I'm NOT the only one that does this!)  I wouldn't recommend the turkey club or other sandwiches where processed meats might be used.  Perhaps the entrees would be your best bet (pun intended!).  I DO suggest you try the desserts (I spied small glasses of milkshakes being delivered to their lucky owners) and the extra-crispy sweet potato fries.  Neighbors ooh'ed and ahh'ed over their lovely slices of strawberries and cream cake with coffee.

Review Text :
I have visited GFOM four times.  I love the food, I think it is a little expensive.  Our check average was $66 without tip.  So, be prepared if you are one of those people that love to graze and order everything your heart desires!  Tonight I tried the pork bun and it was delicious.  I sometimes get hooked on an item in a restaurant and this is one of those times.  The pork bun was dripping with natural juices from the pork and hoisin sauce and then you would get a crisp bite from pickled veggies.  It was served on a cute little square cutting board, I would lift the cutting board to my mouth so it wouldn't drip down my chin.  YUMMY!One complaint is they do not do separate checks, which in this day and time with computers, it's so much easier.  If you haven't been to GFOM, strap your wallet on and go have a great meal!Third time's a charm for Good Food! Yes, we've tried to eat here twice before and both times the wait was astronomical (2 hours, 1 hr 45 min). So, that's the first tip for everyone - the folks at Good Food do not take reservations, um, ever, I think?But onto the evening, inside GFOM is simple, understated yet elegant. There's a pretty and low key bar, a fair number of tables and wonderful staff. Hubs and I were seated within minutes and tried a sampling of dishes. Before I get to the eats, I will concur with others - I think the plates (small and large) are a bit on the pricey side. So, perhaps it's not the most fiscally responsible move to head here when you're super hungry as the portions are small. Food time...Mixed green salad: 4/5: A lovely salad, delicious and light with baby parsnips, cranberries and hazelnuts. Super light and a perfect way to start the feeding.Smoked Salmon: 5/5: I don't even really like (or order) smoked salmon and I loved this dish. The fresh, smoked salmon with egg, potato & capers with dill creme fraiche was a perfect blend of flavors. The little chippers were great! Seared Scallop w/risotto: 3/5: My lease favorite of the dishes as I was expecting more complex flavor. While the items reads beautifully, butternut squash risotto, shaved fennel & bacon, my scallop (there were 2 on the plate) was quite undercooked and lacked depth. Steamed Bun: 4/5: Nom worthy. It's been a long time since I've had a steamed pork bun of this caliber. The five spice rubbed pork belly was perfectly tender yet crispy on the edges and I loved the hoisin & pickled vegetables.Baked Cavatappi: 3/5: A good baked pasta dish w/fresh, gooey mozzarella. Coming from a family of very talented Italian cooks, I wasn't wowed by the sauce but I did really love the Italian sausage mixed in. Pork tenderloin (the only large plate we ordered): 3/5: The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and intense with smokey flavor yet the fried mac 'n cheese triangles were underwhelming. I didn't taste much cheese! Pumpkin Bread Pudding: 5/5: Drool. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order bread pudding because I get so disappointed when it turns out all French toast like. But this bread pudding was moist, bursting with delectable pumpkin flavor and topped with a gorgeous sliver of pumpkin seed brittle and some of the most delicious cheesecake ice cream I've had. Get it. Since the menu is eclectic and certainly inspired, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more good food from GFOM!Why was I so stubborn?  When i first saw this place it looked a little shabby from the outside and its name, well was not so imaginative. I saw the yelp reviews and couldn't believe this place was that good. I was completely wrong.The inside of the place is so much more appealing than the outside.  Tapas style american cuisine is how I would describe this place. My friend and I asked the waitress what we should start with.  She told us the mussels were the best in Charlotte.  She wasn't far off.  Drenched in a nice smooth curry sauce the combination was unbeatable.  From there, I moved onto the scallops.  The scallops were pretty good, but the cous cous underneath was some of the best I had. Since the food was good and I'm fat I decided to order the pork tenderloin as well.  This portion was considerabley bigger and was just amazing.  The pork was cooked to perfection and the chorizo hash & chili demi really set this dish off.  I will be back and my friend has been telling me that he will be taking his girl here when she comes down.  Bottom line, looks are decieving and this place is a diamond in the rough.Finally made it out for an early dinner at Good Food. Can't believe it has taken me this long to check it out so I can write this review. Seeing as how this is one of Crown Town's more popular spots, the time was nigh to get in and sample the fare. A small, and plain building. Not too much going on inside. Just tables, booths, high-tops, and bar seating. Such close quarters that the aromas from the kitchen fill the dining area and inhabit your clothes. Not a bad characteristic. First off, I have to express my love for these guys having Northcoast's Scrimshaw Pilsner on draught. Not a common tale for most places in town. This alone sets the bar apart from the rest. I can recognize that tap handle from anywhere....5/5 for this. Ordered a smattering from the menu. Cheese plate: 4/5. Camembert, bleu, honeycomb, fig spread and two others I can't recall. Served with grilled bread. No combination that was undesirable. Falafel: 3/5. Rather plain, and the greek yogurt on top seemed to add to the plainness. 5/5 for presentation, though. Pork Bun: Unreal. 5/5. Perfect texture, flavor and presentation. I was absolutely thrilled. Corn Rissotto: 4/5 Sweet, and wholesome. Nothing over the top, but just right. A rather large portion, too. Gnocchi: 5/5. Just perfect. Amazing flavor and all of the mushrooms were wonderful. I didn't want it end. The addition of the chicken was fine, but could have gone without. Dessert: Apple cobbler with seasonal ice cream 3/5. Just nothing groundbreaking here. Presentation was fine, flavors were fine, but just didn't seem to have that special element. We made it in at 5:40, right after they opened. I would emulate this again. Nice having an early dinner and missing most of the crowd. Service was incredible and so fast. Very knowledgeable about the menu. Very much looking forward to returning!Just had one of the best dinning experiences of my life and it only lasted 35 minutes because I was running late, but I can not wait  to go back to Good Food.  At first glance Good Food is very inviting, with cork block walls and wood ceilings, a nicely stocked bar and an open kitchen, but what really gives it a nice fealing is its warm and inviting staff and of course the food. Our waiter Jeffrey was amazing we didn't tell him we were in a hurry, but our food moved out of the kitchen quickly throughout our meal and we never felt rushed. We did not order alchohol that night and he still treated us as if we were his only customers. Oh and did I mention our food?   We indulged ourselves in perfect portions of pea risotto, Korean beef stir fry, heirloom tomato  homemade mozzarella salad, and a cheese plate. When we went to leave our waiter said no dessert and we explained we were in a rush. He said no problem and quickly brought out our check and thanked us for coming, Another waiter saw us get up and asked if  everything was ok? He was truly concerned we were unhappy and we could not be more delighted with the service or our meal. Loved it!  Never have I seen a staff take so much pride in a restaurant. Can't wait to come back!Many of my area foodie-cronies oft-hail Good Food as "the best restaurant in Charlotte". Though it's located but a stone's throw from my office, I had never taken the opportunity to dine there. Perhaps because of the heavy, universal praise it receives I had relegated it to some mythic status worthy only of an extremely special occasion. Through the birthday wishes of my esteemed friend Katherine, however, my hand was forced, and on a breezy Tuesday evening in October I finally cracked Good Food's threshold. We had on this night a crew of seven, which pushes the limits of Good Food's per-table capacity - but though they take no reservations, they easily and quickly accommodated our party (just by glancing through the restaurant's open front glass as I walked up past the posh little stuffed-sofa lounging area on the patio out front, I had taken note of the bustling little bar and seemingly cramped dining space and pessimistically doomed-and-gloomed us to not getting a table any time soon - way to prove me wrong, Good Food!). We were seated in the back near rear the rear exit and greeted promptly by our server...If I may break from my review narrative for a moment and go on a not-colorful tangent: Our waitress was extraordinarily pregnant. I'm not sure why I found this so troubling, but it vexed me greatly. While I completely understand an expectant mother's need and desire to continue working and earning money while gestating a child, that somehow doesn't gel well with a dining experience. In my mind, very-pregnant women should not be on their feet serving me food and drinks. It's odd. It makes me feel like a jerk. I wanted so badly to offer her my chair and maybe even go so far as to extend to her the courtesy of foot massage. Yet, circumstantially, most would argue that that would have been an odd thing to do. I felt like I was in a weird social trap with no chivalrous outlet. So, ultimately, I just sat up really straight and tried not to curse too much. Back to the review: Good Food's dining area is nothing short of "adorable" - the quotes are for implying a sort of quaint/artsy/charming/small aspect to that adorability. It is dim and loud, with various eras of exposed brick lending their geometry to the perimeter, browns and yellows and old bronze colors filling the whole of the palette, and ornate crossworks of fused forks and spoons and knives creating the lightshades and wall-art. There's nothing exceptional about the decorations of the space itself, but it all coalesces into being very successful at establishing what it means to. Drinks here trend toward wine and fancy cocktails, not surprisingly, but there are a handful of well-selected local beers available as well. I tried the elderflower martini - it burned soft and was cleverly earthy, but somehow felt unbalanced. On subsequent rounds I just ordered NoDa brewing's Hop Drop n Roll. The beer felt uncouth for the situation, but it's what I wanted.  Katherine, being the expert on Good Food's multi-round-small-plates ordering methodology, got us started with some pomme frites, a couple hot little dishes of steamed broccoli and battered cheddar, and a rather fancy cheese plate. All served quickly, all tasty, and all presented cleanly without pretense - I appreciate a subtle plating. Yet, I was not quite impressed.For a "main course", my ladyfriend and I went splitsies on the seared scallops and a daily special of grouper served atop mixed veggies. Others at our table opted for the gnocchi or the garganelli pasta - which we all bandied about and sampled from incautiously, which seems to be the way of Good Food. Again, each dish was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, and promptly served... but I was still not quite impressed. Katherine, now five martinis in and guffawing heartily at AJ's even silliest quips, was ready for more and so we commenced desserts. We all shared spoonsful of a decadent chocolate-and-peanut butter brownie cake type thing as well as a so-sweet-it-hurt strawberry cheesecake. With these I was nearly impressed - but I'm hardpressed to qualify desserts as a reason to elevate a restaurant's food-status. After paying our three-hundred-dollar tab, we left feeling happy, not too full, and a little bit buzzed. Which I supposed is a very grown-up alternative to the stuffed-and-wasted condition through which my friends and I usually stumble our way out of a restaurant. In the end my assessment is that while good, Good Food is not great. There are a dozen restaurants in Charlotte that, in my mind, are just as tasty for half the price and twice the fun. But I also accept that perhaps, gluttonous and ravenous that I am, I might not be Good Food's ideal patron. If you're sophisticated, overpaid, and perpetually on a diet... this is probably the best restaurant in Charlotte.I would eat here every weekend, if possible. I love Good Food on Montford. Love.Looks are deceiving, but I think that is what they were going for when they picked this location. From the outside, it's nothing flashy but a solid frame with floor to ceiling glass front windows. The interior is modern, contemporary and very tasteful. They nailed the minimalist and cozy ambiance. They have each table set and ready for your arrival.I really like the small tapas plate concept. You can pick and choose various dishes to share with your partner. Awww, romantic. Tip: Get 2 steamed buns so you won't end up fighting over it; it is that delicious you each want your own. I'm going to make it my mission to try each item...the quail wraps and Korean beef were very flavorful. They focus on seasonal dishes using local and/or organic options. Fab. The wine selection was very good and the servers make great recommendations. Last, but not least was the dessert. They had the most fantastic blackberry ice cream (yes, it was a few seasons ago) paired with a cake or cobbler dish. Mmmm.The service was fantastic! Just the perfect amount of attention balanced with privacy. The most perfect dining experiences are when you lose track of time, deep in conversation, eating fantastically prepared food, and dishes are each a work of art. You will get all of that at Good Food. My favorite. Just wish they would accept reservations.I live in New York City, and a client of mine took me here for dinner one night. I have to say, this is one of the best restaurants that I have been to-- ANYWHERE. The drinks (I got some sort of Gin drink with egg white in it?) and wine list area great. But the food is the star. I can't remember EVERYTHING we got, but I cannot think of one thing that we got where I wasn't saying, "Oh my GOSHHHH!" every time I tried it. Here are the things I can remember: Cheese plate-- deliciousPomme Frites-- OH. MY. GAWD.Steamed Bun-- Delicious... very very good.However, the stand out dish for me was the mussels dish  (Green Curry, Coconut Milk & Cilantro). This is last meal of your life good. Like "you are thinking about it when you leave contemplating how fat you'd appear to be if you went back after your work function and got 7 orders of it to go to your hotel room" good.The dessert, cappuccino, service, everything was top top notch and I've been to some of the best restaurants in NYC. To top it all off, the place is not even remotely pretentious. Friendly bar tenders, servers, even the manager/owner who knew the client I brought was talking us up the whole time. It's both laid back and upscale at the same time so you can put your elbows on the table and enjoy a good conversation while getting a great, upscale meal. That is, if you can fit anything else on the table along with all of the plates filled with delicious food.I cannot WAIT to go back.Pro tip: Sit in the back bar!! *Person in back of crowd screams* "There's seating in the back? I thought it was just cramped tables??"Yes. There is seating in the back. And it's spacious, intimate, and wonderful, and on a weekday, it means you can probably skip the wait 100%. And now you know.The Lady and I went out for a nicer dinner, put our name on the list, and was told about 25-30 minutes, if that. And guys, that was fine with us. We tried to find a place at the bar where we could squeeze in and order a drink, and lo and behold there were 2 seats for us in the back. Score. Plus, that station is the dessert station, so you get to see the dessert prep throughout your meal. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.Drinks: Wine for the Lady and Dark n' Stormy for myself.Food: Parmesan Gnocchi. Fantastic flavor, super rich, good consistency for the gnocchi. Loved the mushrooms in it.Battered Broccoli: Wish that there was more salt, I suppose the vinegar in the jalepenos was supposed to provide that, but I didn't get that in a majority of bites. Solid flavors though, just lacked a bit of seasoning. Steamed Bun: This is what I came for. Awesome. Much satisfaction. Go get one now. Shrimp: These were surprisingly stellar!! I actually asked the chef about the cooking method for these and got a mini recipe, so I'm very thankful that they were willing to share that. The combination of the apple, sweet potato, and shrimp together made a fantastic dish that I want to try to replicate. Great night. Great restaurant. And I feel it's a bit underwhelming to say that it's just *Good* Food. Yelp, it's GREAT food.

I'm a sucker for a random breakfast place. It gets me right in the feels.Landings is a prime example of this; small, a tad outdated, and the aroma of hash browns hangs heavy in the air. I chose this place based strictly on the randomness of it, not the food pictures or reviews. This place could of had a 2 star average rating and I still would have eaten here. I sat on the outdoor patio hoping to catch a glance of a few planes landing and maybe Danny Zuko himself, John Travolta, walking out and joining me for a cup of coffee. This didn't happen, but some food did. I went crazy and got the Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and hash browns. Pretty basic carb filled breakfast. Steak was cooked right, the eggs were fluffy and the hash browns to seared to a crispy perfection. I really can't complain about anything. Landings is a greasy spoon, but disguised as a nicer and cleaner eating venue. Great place for a low key meal and view of the strip. PRO TIP: Sunday is the only day they serve Eggs Benedict. Nummers!

I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for, but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's ! Some updated reasons why I love this place:*Happy Hour pricing during all football games*They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck*Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain.*They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast . *Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching.*No gaming, no smoking*Huge menu Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !I have to admit BJ's is probably one of my least favorite chain restaurants, so I'm never too excited to go to any location. I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist. We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy. As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless. I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit.

I love Zoe's! But don't try to go here in the middle of lunch hour. By 12:30 all the tables inside and out are filled and there's a line out the door.But should you be one of those lucky ones who can go to lunch at 11:30 then it's a perfect place for lunch. The food is good, reasonably priced and fresh. There is low calorie fare as well as some items that have a little more than you would like but who cares it's your day off counting calories anyway.The Steak roll-ups and chicken roll-ups are my favorite but having just tried the kabobs I think that's about to change.One thing to remember is that if you have a smart phone, join the club, take a picture of every receipt you have from a meal there and they will e-mail you a coupon for something. Usually it's a soda or chips or a side salad, but the other day it was for 1 free entree . . . and that steak kabob was mine.

Restaurant name  OTB Bicycle Café

Review Text :
I stopped by last night (Thurs.) at 7pm for a casual dinner date with CM.  OTB was recommended to me by my table mate from brunch at the Zenith, who is the manager at REI and a friend of OTB's owner.  Since I had a City Dining Card and was intrigued by the idea of burgers incorporating peanut butter, I'm a cyclist and found the theme interesting, and the location was somewhat convenient for a Waterfront run, we braved the frigid weather and craziness of the South Side to check it out.Since our waitress informed us that Thurs. night is quarter seitan wing night, we ordered six wings ($0.25) dressed in buffalo sauce with blue cheese, along with some soft pita pieces ($1) for our appetizer.  Although it bears mentioning that the "wings" were more like oblong chunks (see photo), they had a great coating and texture, and the buffalo sauce added a nice zing to them.  Additionally, we each ordered a bowl of soup ($3.99 each): tomato-based vegetable for CM and tomato soup for me.  My tomato soup was nothing too special, but was nice and thick, though I would have preferred if it had been made with milk instead of water (I can always tell).  Because he was feeling a bit under the weather, CM really enjoyed his soup--although I didn't sample it due to concerns about his contagiousness.For my entree, per the recommendation of my table mate at the Zenith, I ordered the dirt rag delight: A burger topped with Wholey's peanut butter, American cheese, and dill pickle slices ($9.49).  Because I don't eat beef, I went with a chicken patty, and of course, I just had to add bacon ($1 upcharge).  This burger was definitely one of the most unique burgers I've ever eaten, and it didn't disappoint!  The peanut butter had a wonderfully gritty, homemade texture and just the right hint of sweetness, complementing the savoriness of the pickles, cheese, and bacon perfectly.  Despite the copious number of components, the burger didn't fall apart as I was eating it, which is the hallmark of a good quality bun.  Because he was trying to eat on the healthy side due to feeling under the weather, CM went with the roadie panini ($7.99), adding chicken for an upcharge of $3.  Again, I didn't try it due to a desire to avoid contamination, but he enjoyed it, and ended up taking half home.  Both sandwiches came with a generous side of fries, which were coated with a nice, crispy batter with a hint of ranch flavor.Service was about what I'd expect at a place like OTB: Generally pretty quick, if not super attentive, with slight awkwardnesses at times (e.g., we weren't greeted upon entering, and had to seek out a waitress to ask if we could seat ourselves).  Likewise, the atmosphere was about what I expected: Fairly quiet (for a bar, at least), with a TV playing college basketball and bike themed paraphernalia.  We sat in the back dining room, which only had a few other parties at the time of our visit.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is a non-smoking establishment.Overall, CM and I were pleased with the quality and quantity of food that we received, especially with the City Dining Card and seitan wing discounts (our total check: $22 + change).  As such, I'd recommend OTB as a casual spot to grab a few drinks and some dinner or late night snacks, regardless of whether you're a cyclist or not.  Just don't forget to check out their daily specials, and take advantage of them accordingly!One thing I'm a fan of is good ol' bar food! Throwing it in the fryer, putting it on a bun -- all sounds delicious to me. OTB definitely meets to my standard of bar food and more. All of their items are carefully designed to satisfy the greasy spoon (like myself) while still allowing me to challenge my taste buds with a taste elegance.My boyfriend and I both ordered the Pittsburgh Burger. Amazing! Not only cooked to perfection, but dressed with just the right toppings and seasonings to turn bar food into a fine(r) dining experience. They both came with a side of potato fries which is always a win. The stand-out item that we both died over was the soft pretzels. I don't know how they made them or what they used to perfect such a mouthwatering menu item, but it was darn good. It reminded me of the breading of a corn dog. Light, soft and oh so yummy. Of course, the bier cheese was a great addition for dipping.The atmosphere here is really cool. It's definitely much different than the typical South Side bar. You don't encounter too much of the the usual "doucheness," and everybody is there to enjoy themselves. There is lots of interesting artwork and bike memorabilia on the wall which adds to the ambience. I'm not sure what I'd call them theme of the place, but I do know that it is working!Katie is a great bartender and will make you fabulous drinks. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a vodka drinker anymore and the drinks she made us lasted all night (I guess that's not a bad thing for my wallet). They were delicious, but homeboy is getting old! I can't do these vodka dranks anymore. Definitely will be returning soon. Decent prices (though drinks can be a little cheaper), great food and not overcrowded like some South Side bars.This place is awesome in so many ways.  I've been here during a biking session to refuel, to casually drink and to bring a friend for a burger and all 3 times have been consistent.I ate the Dirty Rag (a burger with pickle and peanut butter) from their large varieties of burgers and its the fuel you need to recover or to start going.  This place makes me want peanut butter on all my burgers.  The fries have that crispy potato dust flavor you dirt find many places that make them extra good and the drink selection is always fresh with lots of specials.The environment is very unique and friendly and the bartenders are always on top of things.  I would highly recommend visiting this place and getting bacon wrapped bananas on a burger.  Trust me, it's worth it.

I have been to three Arriba's locations. The original in Phoenix on Camelback, the one in Scottsdale near FLW and this one in Gilbert. The Phoenix location has always been GREAT in all areas, food, service, etc! I have been there so many times I couldn't even guess as to how many, in fact they should give me a life time supply of roasted chilies. When they opened the Scottsdale location I was surprised that the quality and flavor was the same, and really I have no complaints there either. However the Gilbert location is just bad, and I have given them a fair number of chances and it just seems to get worse.  General repeating themes...1.  The hostesses are not welcoming, Granted I don't expect them to wash my feet or anything, but at least act like i'm not interrupting your day.  2. I won't say all, but at least a good portion of the wait staff seem to have real issues getting orders correct. Not sure what is going on there maybe it's the kitchen, either way it is frustrating. Especially when they act like it's you...On one of my last visits the manager was actually arguing with another customer about the fact that her drink glass was soapy. Why argue? Apologize and make it right.3. The quality of the food here is definitely not on par with the other locations I have been to. Since the Chili Verde has always been one of my favorites I will pick on it...There is just something wrong with the way they make it at this location...Personally I think it is too much thickener, flour or cornstarch. The second time I encountered this I tried to fix it on my own by asking for a side of Hatch chili's instead of the default Jalapeño topper. That helped a bit, but the pasty undertone was still there. In the end what finally killed it for me going to this location was the last couple of times I was there the rice was just the worst. It was just mushy flavorless paste colored with a little tomato sauce. When I mentioned it I was told this is how it has always been??? Uh NO it has not!4. The last item is admittedly nit picky and that is they don't bring out the hot salsa by default. They just bring the bean dip and mild salsa. Well I can excuse this as long as when I ask you bring it...No sense in wasting salsa that the local folks don't want. Bottom line...If you have a successful restaurant and start opening more locations, the first thing you better accept is that food consistency between locations is a must. Even the little things like what salsa to expect with your chips makes a difference, and when you have bigger problems the little things just add fuel to the fire. I hope Arriba's head office sees these posts and cracks the whip at this location! I love the other locations and would really like to be able to visit one close to home...

Review Text :
Finally!  After watching all those damn commercials...and being deprived of this chain in NorCal, I had an opportunity to visit this fairly new restaurant in Las Vegas.  Right when I walked in, and throughout my whole dining experience, there were a few things that really stood out.  For an all day buffet...this restaurant was surprisingly clean.  From the buffet bar to the tables, I noticed that the staff was attentive and quick in creating a presentable and sanitary dining environment.  And they were so darn friendly and full of life!  I wish I had that much energy at my work!All-you-can-eat pizza was shockingly impressive!  I was fortunate to always get fresh, hot, crispy-crusted pizzas.  I enjoyed most of their specialty pizzas:  Spinach Alfredo, BBQ Buffalo Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Zesty Pepperoni (also in deep dish), Alfredo, and Mexican Style Ole (taco).  The regular one/two topping pizzas weren't bad either.  One of my favorite items was the Flip, a seasoned pocket style pizza with pepperoni and cheese.  Their tossed signature salads were okay.  I thought that the BLT Ranch was better than the Classic Italian.  I didn't have room for their soup or pasta...since I was eyeing their freshly baked brownies and cinnamon rolls.  Brownies were too moist for me, but their hot cinnamon rolls may be the reason why I'm coming back!So I've been here twice within 3 days and not because I wanted to.  I'm not a fan of buffets for my lack of self control.  LOL  Monday I brought my daughter and her friend for lunch.  Immediately you are greeted by all the employees "Welcome to Cici's!".  Pretty nice little greeting I must say. The girl at the cashier asked "how many" and I said 3.  As I started to ask about the child rate she handed me a receipt that said 3 adults.  I simply asked her what was the age for the child rate.  She in turn asked me how old the girls were.  I replied that both of them are 11 and in passing asked "oh is the age 10 and under" and she replied back "no its 11 and under".  She proceeded to look past me to help the next customer and I shook my head and decided to just dismiss that whole convo.  Challenging stupidity doesn't make for a good lunch with my girls.We quickly found our seats and the girls were up and at em.  We each grabbed a tray.  A couple of the dishes I picked up were dirty so I just set them to the side. The pasta is one of my favorite simple things however when I got up there the pasta needed refilled.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they knew their pasta needed refilled.  She replied "yes" and continued with her pizzas not even headed to the pasta to see what I was referring to.  Instead she addressed some "regular" customers behind me-hence the immediate dismissal of the question.  Kinda awkward to say the least. Finally 10 minutes later it was refilled. Sigh.They serve pasta salad, salad, soup, corkscrew pasta with red and white sauce, breadsticks & garlic knots, a plethora of pizza and a few dessert options.  Their  food is what it is....a really cheap family buffet.  With that said the pizzas leave a lot to be desired, don't have much cheese or meat, have a lot of dough but is all good for the carb-evore in you!  This place really should be named CiCi's CARB Buffet! Its a bread lovers dream! You seriously need to put in some cardio time after eating here.The place is pretty beat up.  The walls, floors and tables are scuffed up and chipped.  Its definitely a place to bring all the children and your neighbors children.  You can tell they all have been here! LOL  There are TVs mounted up high that had children shows on them.  You cant hear the sound so I'm always not sure why restaurants even bother.  There is a small arcade in the back that the kids love.  There's a community board that has a few things posted but looks all greasy from little hands touching it.  Another dirty detail.Now while the girls were spending their couple dollars on the arcade I was checking in on my handy dandy YELP app on my phone.  While I sit there and observe the chaos around me, my eyes found there way up the wall in slow motion....  Eeek! The Health Department grade!  Like an elephant in the room-how did I miss it when it was right in front of me the whole time I was eating!  I can say I'm not surprised however at the same time I'm not even sure if I had ever seen a C Grade in person.  Hm. That's right Graded a C!  Thank goodness it was after we ate because that is a sure turn off to me regardless of the details.  I do watch Restaurant Impossible! LOLOn a side note, at the end of our meal the manager came over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction.  I decided not to bother to inform him of the awkward and lazy service from his employees.  I think the place is run with super young people with lack of guidance possibly.  He was just a baby himself-or I'm just old.  I beg to differ.  LOL  Needless to say, I will not be back anytime soon.  This is only a "when I have to" place to eat - category of Chuck E Cheese. LOL.  I will for sure be checking the grade next time though with curiosity of an upgrade! ;)

The best thing about this place was the bathrooms! They were great, I would pee in them any day of the week. The food (lobster, fillet mignon) was nothing special and for the price I would have expected a little more food then what I got, that's for sure. The food came almost too fast which gave me the impression that the food was pre-made and just microwaved, and most of it was almost cold - so if I was them I would invest in a better microwave. They did have good shrimp but you only get 3. I have definitely had better and paid less for it.My husband came home and announced we were going to a chocolate and wine class at Avalon in a few weeks.  I don't know that I need to take a class to eat chocolate and drink wine, but I was amazed he actually set something like this up!  I later learned it was his buddy's idea, so thank you Derek for bromancing my husband!I decided we should check out Avalon beforehand as a possibility for dinner the same night.  Situated across the street from a strip mall on McDowell, I wasn't expecting much.  But the gorgeous fountain out front gave me hope.  When we walked in, I was in love with my surroundings.  This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been in lately.  Dark wood, glass tiles in shades of blue, beautiful lighting...this is exactly how I want to design my home...not that anyone should really care about that.  I ordered a breakfast quesadilla which included cheddar and smoked gouda cheeses and was topped with an avocado pico de gallo.  It was far too much for one person, even when said person is me.  I also ordered a side of rosemary herb potatoes which were really flavorful, but a little on the salty side.  My husband had the farmer's market frittata which included artichoke, grilled asparagus, and havarti.  He really enjoyed it as well.  The best deal of brunch was the mimosa.  A split  of champagne and a small carafe of fresh orange juice for $9 yielded nearly 3 drinks!Since I'm not a huge fan of breakfast/brunch, I will definitely return for dinner soon.  As it stands, I completely agree with Andrew F in that it must be the location that has kept Avalon under the radar.  Although this may not have been the best brunch I have had, it was certainly better than many places that seem to be much busier.I can't believe I never reviewed Avalon! I'm very glad it's my 500th review though, so let's begin:I happened upon Avalon during CRAVE Arizona's week of festivities October 21 - 24. My shop was the retail partner for the wine events and I was required to attend one of the luncheons on Friday, Oct 23. What a tough life I lead. Avalon is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but they excel at what they are doing so it's a destination worth finding. My lunch was exquisitely paired with two WA wineries, Milbrant and Gordon Brothers. It's actually pretty hard to make a perfect pairing with very specific wines so kudos to Executive Chef Travis Watson for his masterful menu. I'm going to ruin your whole day right now and tell you what I ate:First Course Smoked mussel soup with crispy leeks and crusty garlic bread - I love mussels but the idea of mussels out of the shell kind of creeps me out. This soup was so smoky and spicy everyone at our luncheon asked for more. It was served in a demitasse which was tragic, but a great way to start an amazing meal.Second Course Organic petite green salad with Granny Smith apples and walnut streusel - Chef Travis came out to talk to us about how his goal with Avalon is to source local, biodynamic and organic produce and meats across the board. This salad was fresh with just that hint of sweetness from the streusel. It wasn't overwhelming at all and I thought the Riesling we had with it was an inspired match.Third Course Grilled rib eye steak with black truffle risotto, foie butter and baby heirloom beets - I'm not a vegetarian anymore. I'm not even going to pretend. I chowed on this steak and it was delightful, very pink in the middle and deliciously moist. The risotto was a little dry and not very hot; my only critique of the day. The heirloom beets were orange and tiny and I actually ate them (not a beet fan). Fourth Course Milk chocolate and salted caramel torte with espresso essence and tangerine pearls - aaaaaa! This was ridiculously good, and waaaay too big after all we'd eaten. I'm a dark chocolate fan myself, but this worked in every way imaginable. The milk chocolate and the salty caramel? puhleese it was amazing. I saw three of my clients heading out after their own lunch in another half of the restaurant and they told me this is their go to place for high quality eats. They sang me the praises of the lobster bisque, though they told me the wine selection was seriously lacking. Aww they are so loyal! I met two couples at the lunch who were also voracious fans of Avalon and hysterically shouted across the table that we all need to support this place and tell our friends. I'm with them; do yourself a favor and dine at Avalon.

Review Text :
OK, I would like to first start off by saying if a business is going to put fake reviews up for themselves, at least say something different each time. I do not think a GM has been mentioned this much, ever, within the same day by people with stock Microsoft photo gallery images. Secondly, I gave Brookside II a chance and it made me miss Brookside I- big time. My beer was still cold (a plus) but the menu is severely limited (compared to the novel and diverse menu of the first Brookside) to whatever they can purchase in bulk and deep fry. I could understand this choice if our food was served quickly and it tasted decent, but they failed in both of those areas. For fried mushrooms, chips and salsa, and chicken tenders the members in my party waited probably about 30 minutes. The advertise fresh made tortillas chips but serve it with pace picante. Their nachos were cheese sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and jalapenos, served almost 30 minutes after ordered) for $6.99. My friend ordered the fried cod (see the fried theme) and took two bites and decided to be done. I am not saying that the food at a sports bar should be top notch, but at least good enough to satisfy the need/craving for bar food. Also I think if your menu is going to be largely deep fried based then the food should at least be prompt. Our waitress was the only one on the floor and she was spread too thin and it was obvious. I might go back to grab a beer if I had to meet someone, but as for making an appearance on my own initiative, probably not.

I opted to come into Fernando's on a Thursday, when they have a lunch special of a 12" wrap or sandwich, fountain drink, and bag of chips for $7.50.  I opted for the lasagna wrap, which was mostly just intriguing.  The wrap contained meatballs, pepperoni, spices, and ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese on the outside.  The actual wrap was really dried out and kind of eh, but the ingredients inside were pretty good.  They have standard fountain drinks and iced tea, and there were lots of different chips to choose from.  The food was nothing special, but it fills a void.Fernando's is basically a local version of Subway, with some slightly different sandwich options.  The set up is the same, and the cleanliness is about the same as a Subway.  So if you are looking to help local business instead of the chains, check this place out.

3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience. I love you Carolina, will you marry me?Compared to the similarly set up Caramba's, this place almost rocked my world. The price, the vibe, the food-all of the above.I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average. This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town.

I have a bad feeling about the longevity of this one. I went in wanting to be impressed.It looks super cute and just my style from the outside ..how can you go wrong with the word Bakery in the title? But  after eating there I can say the food was just meh... my kids both commented it was just okay  and they even  had some of the baked goods. The decor is  part bistro/ part old time feel .. looks cute with baked goods in covered glass tiers on the counter.  The service is just like Paradise or Wildflower Bread ..but the food is not as good or creative in my book. My chopped salad was chopped so small that I couldn't quite eat  it and wished I had a spoon.  Flavor in the salad was uninspired and got old quick . As my oldest said " I can't quite see us going back".Panera?  Paradise?  Wildflower?  Corner Bakery?  I would rank them:1. Wildflower2. ?3. ?4. Panera5. Corner Bakery6. Paradise BakeryThis is of course only a ranking of these upscale concept sort of places where you can order things like soup or salad & half a sandwich and a muffin or cookie.And you can pull out your laptop and use free wifi (often what brings me in).I am backlogged on review writing so many will be out of order. I have been to Phoenix 3x's this year already and will be going another 2 times before years end. This past April, when I was in town I met my mom and an old co-worker of hers that I hadn't seen since my baby shower almost 17 years ago now. I had never been to a CB before and since Wildflower hadn't opened yet and Paradise (aka-more options Panera) had already been tried, I was excited to see what this place was about.Like Panera, it is an order at the counter and they bring you your food. They have tons of options for breakfast, lunches and dinners from sandwiches, baked goods and salads. Since I arrived late my mom and her friend Bev were already mid-way through their lunches (this wasn't a planned meeting). I ordered the smaller portion of the Asian Edamame salad adding avocado and water. The young man taking my order was seriously one of the sweetest "kids" I have encountered in a very long time. He explained menu options, we talked about how hard it was working so close to Sun City dealing with all the personality types and so on. They do not have tip jars but he was so sweet that I inquired if they were allowed to take tips. He looked at me as if I was speaking a foreign language. I tipped him and he came from around the corner and gave me a hug. I joined my mom and Bev at the table and the "kid" brought me a piece of cake (not ordered) along with my salad. So sweet. My salad was pretty tasty-the dressing was a bit spicy but tolerable and I liked the food options much better than expected. When we were all done, I gave Bev a hug, and told my mom I was going to get more water to go. The "kid" was on his break having lunch with his GF who then introduced me to her and gave me yet another hug to say thank you. I have never been thanked so much for a $5.00 tip-and it just went to show me how much a little niceness and appreciation can mean to another person. Since this time a I noticed a CB opened locally (review to come) and definitely would go to this location again when in town (after I fulfill my Wildflower Bread Company craving).

The chips. Oh the chips. Crispy, crunchy, perfectly cooked but with a flavour I hadn't tasted since I was a wee lass getting a poke o' chips with my grandparents in their wee Scottish village. I forgot chips could have a flavour like this at all.And that's because everything here, including the batter, is fried in animal fat.I was aware of this before we came, so purposely ordered the grilled fish rather than battered as I knew I'd pay for my sins after. And I had planned on only eating one or two chips. But with the massive bowl in front of me I did pick away and the flavour was just...dreamy.However, for the vegetarian members of our large party of 13 it wasn't as enjoyable. It was only when I tried the first chip that I remembered they were cooked in fat, the moment I could taste it, and it was just at that  moment that Catriona C's fried dish arrived. Being a pesci but absolute no-no meat eater otherwise she couldn't have anything that had been fried. So had to forgo the chips and reorder a grilled piece of meat. The fact they cook things in animal fat isn't explicitly stated anywhere obvious. I think it's a reason a lot of people rave about their food, and the chips were sooooo good. But for veggies it really would be good to have a notice at least. And I do agree with Catriona that the grilled fish offerings were nice but not quite the same as a fried fish supper. I went with cod, and whilst it was a very ample serving and was completely cooked, it came a little cold and not quite grilled as high as I'd like. The red pepper sauce to go with it was really nice (a side order). The salad was quite measly though. So my idea of eating grilled fish and salad as a healthy meal left me still hungry, hence picking on the chips.It is a traditional Scottish fish and chip shop, and a good quality and higher standard one. If you're visiting Scotland and want to experience 'real Scottish food' and want fish and chips, I'd highly recommend The Tailend over the many, many, many others you'll stumble across on the main streets where they deep-fry burgers, pizzas and mars bars.But for a dine in meal I have to say it wasn't what I would normally choose and I was a little bit underwhelmed. The great company of other yelpers, chat, and the chips did leave me feeling satisfied but my fish was quite forgettable and I thought it would taste more...just more.If I wanted fish n' chips, which is very rare, but If I did I would probably come here. But if I wanted dine-in fish restaurant I wouldn't.Also, veggies be warned!

Restaurant name  Las Pupusas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Las Pupusas offers one of the best values in food: $1.75 per pupusa, with filling options that include chicken, cheese & herb, bean and cheese, and mixed.  Order two of these, which get served with a shredded lettuce salad and red sauce, and you have a really, really good meal for less than $5!  I haven't tried anything else on the menu (the pupusas are such a good deal it's hard to pass them up!), but I'm sure they will be just as delicious.  The kitchen has a big window that allows you to see all the prep and cooking taking place.  Food is made to order, so be patient as it's worth the wait.  For value and quality, I can't recommend this place enough if you're in North Las Vegas.I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.I ordered some food to go and wasn't impressed at all. Inside is kind of chaotic they need to set things up better so customers know where to go if they want to eat inside or get food to go. The lady who took the order was pushy which made so sense they weren't busy and it's just rude. I ended up getting a burrito with cheese and sour cream to go. the tortilla tasted funky and the meat was not only flavorless but it was so fatty. The burrito looked good in size when I first opened it and then after I started eating it there was an obscene amount of sour cream inside. I mean way more sour cream than the meat. I also noticed there wasn't much cheese but in one spot. I had a bean and cheese pupusas and if this is the way they are supposed to be then why so people like them? I figured there would be more filling but maybe that's how these are made. The fried banana things were the only thing that tasted good.

Arrr, ravioli! The Pasta Pirate is a cozy dark restaurant in the California Hotel, in Downtown Vegas.  It serves pasta (duh!), steak, salads, and a bunch of other stuff.  The service was friendly and it's cool watching the chefs in glass booth make the food for you.  The best part of the meal was the calamari--it was not oily at all and came with a tasty sauce.  Or was it the free wine that comes with every meal? Oh no wait, the BEST part of the meal was that it was FREE! Yay for comped meals! :)*See pics*

Fills me up!If you're hungry this place will definitely fill you up with the large burritos and my pick the naked bowl. I like choosing my own toppings and the food is fresh. The lines seem to go by quickly as well. I gave it a 3 because the food isn't always consistent and a chain like this should be. Sometimes the chicken is on the dry side or the rice has been overcooked. I hope these things can be worked out because the fresh concept is a great one.This is a convenient location with decent service, but there were a few glitches during my visit. The first girl who helped me was very nice and I put my order in with her but then another girl stepped in. She seemed to be attempting to expedite the orders but all she succeeded in doing is confusing everyone and making it take longer. Since I had already made my requests with the first girl it was a little annoying that she required me to reiterate my order with her. She misheard me and ended up putting the wrong proteins in my order. When I told her about the mistake she seemed annoyed and then the whole line got discombobulated as they had to redo my order and couldn't figure out how to expedite that while handling all the orders behind me. Once they got everything back on track things went smoothly but I was a little perturbed about her attitude. Food was decent once I got it home and everyone but that one particular employ was fine.This place just opened up in the Bermuda Triangle that is Sahara Pavilion(sahara/decatur)Grand Opening is May 8th in the old Spirit of Cuba location. Today they had a fundraiser to benefit Caring 4 Kids Foundation from 5-8 pm. $5 donation you can get ANY & Everything you want off the menu & a drink!My son & I each got a burrito & chips/salsa-we got a barbacoa & chicken. They were huge with rice & choice of beans plus pico,guac & more. The meats were fantastic-real spicy.The service was outstanding , the place was clean & inviting with music pumped in.There are about 10 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables. Probably under 40 people seating indoors, but they have outdoor patio seating too.The only missing is a salsa bar.I'd rather go here anytime over Roberto's & Baja Fresh in this neighborhood.

I was driving the other day to get on the I-17 and noticed the closed cafe was reopening as a Rainbow Donuts. Cool except I really could care less about the donuts. I drove by today to see that they have opened and they have lunch. That is a good sign. I pop in and see the guy who ran the last deli and his co-worker, ?maybe he reinvented himself? No He was brought in with the new owners. That is cool! I ask for a suggestion and he tells me the Italian Job is good. It has ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, lettuce, tomato, olives, and peppercini's with an Italian dressing on a sourdough. Served with a side of chips, potato salad, pickle or donut. lol I opt for the 1/2 sand and chili with the donut as the side. lol The sand was great and I don't like olives, the chili was homemade and meaty. The donut was superb. They have donuts, pastries, pancakes, scrambles, omelette's, combos, sandwiches, and create your own breakfasts. For lunch they have 7 cold, 5 hot, 4 wraps and a create your own. They also have salads, soups, and burgers. For kids they have PB&J or Grilled Cheese and several snack things like pretzel, quesidilla, nachos, hotdogs etc. They also have coffee and teas of course. I am looking forward to trying more of their creations. Maybe I can get them to cook a real burger.....hmmmI had a egg, and sausage sandwhich the other day. It was very good. Served with donut holes.Imagine this... grilled pastrami, on golden grilled whole grain with spicy mustard and slice of Swiss cheese. YUMMYLil donut holes for dessert....Good place, good food, killer prices, small inside, New England Coffee (Heritage of Taste, i believe?) reasonably quick, GREAT DONUTS.OK Rainbow Donuts has now become Rainbow Donuts and Ninja Bowl. They are changing the "deli style" lunches to rice bowl, wraps types. NO I AM NOT JOKING I had the Ninja bowl with Chicken Spicy. It was grilled chicken and Jalapenos over rice with teriyaki sauce. It was great. They still have the donuts, coffee and great service.Rainbow donut/Ninja Bowl/Bobbys cafe this place gets better and better. Sam the owner of Rainbow and Ninja sold to Claudia and Bobby, who in addition to keeping the donuts and rice bowls are going to do cafe style food too. I had BBQ pork on a toasted hoagie roll. The meat was smoked and tender, served with chips and a drink for $7.95 NOT BAD AT ALL.I am told they will have Broasted Chicken...never had it, but heard good things. I know some yelpers were asking about it awhile ago. She also piqued my interest with a homemade green chili.... mmmmBobby C's is gaining some clients. They were OUT of donuts today around 12:30. Good thing they are open tomorrow. LOLI forget to take pictures but I had a great Philly here 2x already. It is a large soft hoagie roll loaded with chopped ribeye and onion, red and green pepers and swiss. I top mine with sriracha. Hits the spot!I have tried to get Yelp to group all the names of this place into one but still have no response. Rainbow Donuts, Ninja Bowl, is actually Bobby C's. Also they no longer serve the Broasted chicken, there was not enough demand. :(

Review Text :
The menu only exists in order to know what the restaurant doesn't have.  I understand it's only been open a little over a month, but running out of just about everything means they are very poorly managed and have a very poor business model.I was here twice in April, "New England" month.  Unfortunately for them, I lived in Boston for 5 years.  Let's hope they don't try to do New England ever again in the future.  The chowder was terrible.  The RI style calamari was a joke.  There were literally 5 pieces of squid on the plate (and no lemon).  After those, I was too scared to order any of the other regional dishes.On my first visit, very shortly after they had opened, a friend ordered a Mai Tai right off the specialty drink menu.  It was served to her and she immediately noticed it was the wrong color.  "Where's the dark rum?"  "Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it."  Note to bartender - if someone orders a drink and you don't have the right ingredients, ask if they would mind a substitution.  My bet is that they might order something different.Later in the month on the second trip, we tried to order the crab mac and cheese.  Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.  So instead I ordered the Chop Salad.  Amazingly, it didn't have pine nuts and the smoked salmon somehow turned into grilled salmon.  By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.  Rather than attempt to fix the situation, the bartenders and servers all started to ignore us.  Finally the manager came over and I explained to him that what I had received in the Chop Salad wasn't anywhere close to what was described on the menu.  He literally asked me, "Oh, are you in the business?"  No, I just happen to be able to read, and I just happen to know what I'm eating.  He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.  Note to manager - smoked salmon, pine nuts, crab mac and cheese, and dark rum are not rare, exotic ingredients.  You run out of something, you go buy more.  Or you explain to customers that what they ordered isn't what they will get.  Apparently he didn't like hearing that there are some people that know the difference, and he started to treat us in a very condescending manner.  I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.  Clearly, YOU are the douchebag.  If you don't know how to run a restaurant, don't become a restaurant manager.  Simple.Oh, lest I forget.  We had actually ordered 2 chop salads after being told that they counted under the 2-for-1 entrees grand opening special.  When we got the check, we had to have the bartender remove one of the salads as we were charged for both.  Almost got us, Regions.  Almost got us.Since my group was in a small rush to get to the La Bocca Yelp event, the manager - Keith? Kyle? Kevin? - offered to buy us a round if we came back later.  Not ones to ever refuse free alcohol, we did return later in the night after the yelp event.  And we brought lots of friends - our group of 5 turned into 11, all ready and willing to give Regions our business.  Lo and behold, the manager didn't comp us a round of drinks, even though we made it clear that's why we had returned and we were wiling to stay there if shown some love.  All he had to do was take the 5 kamikaze shots off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night.  Guess not.  Well done.  Love the honesty.In conclusion:  food sucks, service sucks, management SUCKS.  But it benefits from a great location, so I'll probably wind up giving it another chance when in Tempe/Mill Ave.

Bomb ass lemon danish. What makes something so ordinary sounding SOOO good you ask?? The strong flavor of lemon, the fresh bursting blueberries, the flaketastic crispy buttery danish pastry. Having made puff pastry croissants a week ago, I know how hard it is to get just the right consistency on your pastry. I took one bite of this thing on a hot afternoon, intending to split it with my better half. NO SUCH LUCK for him. It was gone in 60 seconds, down the hatch...as I wore a finger lickin' good smile.My mission is now clear. Perfect that puff pastry dough and make a little army of these fruity lovelies to pepper all over my belly and thighs. Heaven.Oh yeah, they serve breakfast here too, as in egg and cheese croissants, and you can charge it to your room since the hotel owns this cute little shop. Bonus.

Absolutely lovely. The CHL (Chunky Healthy Lines) are where its at. The name (at first) threw me a bit. Chunky and Healthy? In a line? I do not understand. But with a bit of explanation I came to learn these were juicy, tender skewers of multiple varieties (I had the monkfish), accompanied by lovely sides (think sweet potato, pita with cabbage slaw, etc). Delightful, filling and...indeed, healthy! Sides: roasted kale (with a kick, whew!) and the walnut apple salad (really nice). The foggy mist created a "ghost castle" effect -- very beautiful view from the back of the restaurant's windows. The lighting and ambience are subtle, yet...perfect. Candlelit, clean rustic feel that is both contemporary and classic feeling at once. Comfortable. The din never too loud, but always cheerful. Tables turned all evening. The staff is gorgeous and competent. Dessert: a fresh plum tart with spicy ginger ice cream. Heavenly Not a missed step all evening, perhaps they could've upsold me another glass of Forge Mill rose (light and frivolous was the description -- indeed!) had they asked --- but this only allowed me to save room for an espresso martini, which propelled me through the rest of the evening, night and into the morning...as it turns out! Will surely return when in the area -- a real treat.

Walking into an empty restaurant is always disconcerting.  But I figured it was a weekday evening and the area was a bit dead beyond people at the nearby laundry mat.Immediately upon seating, our friendly waiter got our beverage orders.  He returned also with chips and salsa.  We soon devoured it all and he asked if we wanted more, which we gladly accepted.  For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Fajitas ($12.50), which is served with rice, beans, and tortillas (corn or flour).  I was quite surprised with how generous they were with the shrimp.  There was plenty and I definitely had leftovers.The Husband ordered the Steak & Enchilada (your choice of what kind), and it also came with rice, beans, and tortillas.  He was also surprised with how tasty the steak was, they used a good marination.  The real surprise winner was the refried beans.  The Husband was loving their version.  It was good too, but I guess I'm a fan of refried beans in general (especially with a little cheese swirled in there).We also caught up on music videos while we had dinner.  (You don't get to see music videos anymore!)Overall, pretty good Mexican food without breaking the budget.  And of course, it helps when there's a coupon in the Entertainment Book.  (They also have other coupons available since they mention that there will be a 20%(?) tip added to the bill before any coupon is applied.  We didn't mind actually because the waiter was very attentive.)3.5 starsSidenote: They also have a menu for their cakes by the sheet, so maybe they get a lot of business that way too.(Pics posted!)

Review Text :
Wow, reading the other reviews here, I can't understand how I had such a horrible experience at Tuvalu. It almost makes me want to give them another shot. Almost, because the place was so obviously mismanaged resulting is such abysmal value and customer service that I can't imagine ever leaving another dollar there. We were really expecting a decent lunch after reading reviews, checking out the menu online, and walking in to see such a nice, welcoming space. It was about 1:30 on a beautiful sunday afternoon. It seemed like everything was in our favor. Right until we started ordering. The first thing I tried to order they couldn't make because they'd run out of tabouleh. Okay, places run out of things, no sweat. While I was re-deciding, I heard the clerk tell another customer they were out of tuna. I settled on the Tuvalu salad, at which point the clerk yelled over her shoulder, "Hey, do we have enough greens to make a salad?" After considering a head of leaf lettuce in a grocery store bag, they decided that yes, they could make me a salad.  We also ordered iced tea, which they were out of, and told us it would be 10 minutes for them to make more. We decided that would be fine. We felt bad for them. So, we took our seats at a table, perused the gift shop area, which seemed to have nice things, and waited. And waited, and waited. There seemed to be an insane amount of activity going on in the kitchen area considering that there were about 5 people in the whole place and zero food coming out. Eventually our drinks came. About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our sandwich and salad, which were quite frankly pathetic. First, I could have prepared these things in about 90 seconds in my home kitchen. The salad wasn't even tossed! It was, for $8, a small plate of green leaf lettuce (not what I think of when I read "organic greens" on a menu), 4 giant unpeeled cucumber slices, a few slices of feta, and a pile of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. On the side was a plastic cup of some kind of creamy dressing from a bottle that was certainly not the advertised balsamic vinegarette. My husband's sandwich was basically as advertised, besides missing the tomato that was supposed to be on it. Maybe they were out of tomatoes too and didn't feel like admitting that THEY JUST WEREN'T PREPARED TO MAKE FOOD THAT DAY. It came with a pile of lettuce similar to mine with the same silly dressing. We grimly ate and got out of there as fast as we could. What a waste. Whoever runs this place clearly has no idea what they're doing. They were out of everything and it took so long to prepare our food that there can't have been any prep work done ahead of time. I hate to see  small business fail, but I just can't see clear to tell anyone to spend money here. $25 for essentially a side salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, and 2 iced teas. Ugh.Great vibe and atmosphere, locally owned/operated, uses fair trade and (in most cases) organic ingredients - all wins.However... as Julia noted, the service has dropped quite a bit as of late.  I was in this morning to purchase a single cup of coffee to go.  The person behind the counter didn't acknowledge my entry (there were 2 people in the place), and I honestly waited more than 10 minutes for her to complete everything else she was doing before she asked what she could get for me... 10 minutes may not seem like a long time, but when you swing-in while on your way to work, those ten minutes seem like an eternity.  Especially when it's for a $2 cup of to-go coffee... she could've rang-me-up and handed me a cup in a minute or less.  And, the cookies have gone downhill big time - hard and crispy rather than soft and chewy... ick.  Not sure if I'll be back - I can buy a whole pound of Just Coffee from Willy Street for $8, and if I have to wait 10 minutes for a single cup, I can spend that time brewing it at home just as easily...Sorry, Tuvalu - it's "toot-a-loo" for me.  Best wishes.

I had 8:30 PM reservations for New Years Eve and of course they required a credit card to secure the reservation. We arrived at 8:00 PM and were told that we had the next table. After 2 and 1/2 hours at 10:30 I was told that we may not get to eat. There were at least 50 other people left standing at the door that night. They acted as if they didn't care that they had ruined everyone's New Years Eve. It was pure greed that they simply over-booked so that they could be assured a full house. Never again!!!!

i had no idea this place existed! cute little place on a great patio over looking a lake. you feel like you've left AZ. their food is mediocre and it's nothing fancy. literally, their calamari is basically just fish sticks if that gives you any idea. we ordered chips and queso (decent), chicken strips w fries (delicious), quesadilla (good) and few other items. But the casual setting with the great view makes it a super nice spot to come for lunch and hang out for a bit. they also had a great bar area so even if you don't want to eat, this is a great drinking spoti would totally go back!

Review Text :
This place is both adorable AND affordable... I can't (and I won't) believe it's actually located in Scottsdale. Cookies for $0.40. Fresh salad topped with a giant salmon fillet for $7.40. Paninis galore for $7.80. I know, this all sounds far too reasonable to be true, but it's the real deal. The Gardener (aka ratatouille panini) was a major hit amongst everyone, and it's meat and dairy-free! Health and French food in the same place? This place just gets more and more unbelievable. Between the atmosphere, pricing, and food, Cafe Paris seems like it's in a location far from, "somewhere near where I take my car in for maintenance." Cheaper than France, more authentic than Scottsdale, and tastier than anything else I can get for less than eight bucks.J'adore ce petit café!I've come to Cafe Paris a multitude of times now, and I've come to the realization that it's hard to say no to this place. The space in comfy, the service is friendly, the prices are nominal, and the food is always great.My favorite thing on their menu is their French onion soup! It's delicious, and definitely some of the best I've had in the valley. You won't find a brown water recipe here...they make it from scratch! It's served with a clear broth that's loaded with soft onions. Traditionally topped with toasted bread and melted cheese, it's a winner in the flavor department.. And by the way, I've ordered it roughly a dozen times by now, and it has always been consistently scrumptious!Other great menu items (in no particular order) include any panini, the Eiffel Tower, croque-madame, and butter cookies. The paninis all come with a tasty pesto sauce that should please any pesto fan, while the Eiffel Tower is one ginormous club sandwich that will satiate the biggest of appetites. As for the croque-madame, just imagine one of the best grilled cheeses ever, stuffed with ham, and topped with an egg; it's awesome.I make it a point to go to Cafe Paris several times a month because I know I can get a good meal for fairly cheap. That said, keeping this place all to myself sounds wonderful, but it's time to let the cat out of the bag on this somewhat hidden gem. Bon Appétit!09/05/12Was hoping to make it in for breakfast, but was too late.  The only breakfast items left were almondine shells and a couple of strawberry fruit tarts.  I opted to try a cappuccino and an almond shell, while I waited for my Chef panino ($7.80 for a full order, with side salad) to arrive.  I believe the shells went for 50 or 75 cents each.  It was a very nice way to begin (or end!) a meal.  The panino was very delightful!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the pressed ciabatta, and the combination of thick-cut ham, brie, caramelized onions, and pesto made my mouth (and brain!) very happy!  Eating half of the leftovers a few hours later proved to be almost as good, even without reheating the sandwich in the toaster oven, and I polished the rest of the panino for breakfast the next day.  I recall that the salad dressing (on the side) was nothing to write home about, but I appreciated the added greens to round out the meal.I docked a star for the cafe's mediocre decor.  I didn't feel like I was in a French cafe.  I can't even recall if the music playing was French.  Additionally, the only other people there, besides the server (also owner?) and cook, was a table of elderly women playing an actual game of mahjong- a Chinese tile game (with many variations possible) played on a table with three or four people, not the computer memory game.  (I wonder- in France, do French people play mahjong in American restaurants?)  Was tickled to see that my receipt tray had the Mona Lisa on it- cute!  Another star docked for having weak coffee.  Yes, great coffee service deserves a full star in my book...  The cappuccino was the worst I'd ever shelled $4 for, and no wonder-- the drip coffee I replaced the caloric cup with tasted almost like water.  I've wanted to come back a few times since, to try breakfast here, but if I can't look forward to a great cup of cafe avec un bon petit dejeuner, then why even bother?  Perhaps it was an off-day for coffee?  I will visit again very soon and see if breakfast is just as fun!

It's definitely not our favorite, but Clockwork sure beats those nasty chains (think Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars) when we're thinking, "Yeah, it's pizza and wine night!" And for about the same price! Discovered this place when we moved to Chandler last year. Someone stuffed coupons in our door.Haven't tried delivery, but it's close enough to our house to drive down the street and pick up. Everyone we've encountered in the store has been incredibly friendly. Love the Greek Gyro Pizza. Plenty of Gyro meat and fresh vegetables for toppings.   It even comes with a side of tzatziki sauce! The Godfather Clock Pizza is also good; just your classic combination pizza. Glad to have Clockwork nearby!

Review Text :
Okay, soI am not really sure if this is the same Salsitas I am accustomed to, But it is in Mesa so that is close enough. Salsitas is unassuming enough, if you were to pass it going along your way minding your own buisness you might not even realize what a gem this tasty little place is. I sure didnt.One day at lunch break my buddy Jose and I are out on the search for a good burrito, we'd been burned previously by a competing little Taquería, Senor Taco- now La Palapa, but i digress. So wondering where to go for our measly 30 minute break, and running short on time I was getting desperate. Then Jose opines, "oh man they have a salsitas here!"So I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot.We climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint.Straight up authentico feel to the place, not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away, there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer, from Carnitas to Pastor, I was in hog heaven. We order two burritos de pastor, I get mine w/ guac, pico, and refriend pintos free of charge. As we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket, and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really, probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish, pickled carrot, shredded cabbage, lime, salsa verde, and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro.By the time we're done w/ the salsa bar, our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work. As I'm typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat, my stomach is full, and my eyelids heavy. Although the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied. For under $5 you can grab a monster of a meal, that frankly isnt nearly as greasy or fatty as say Filly B's or that shit hole taco bell.I love salsitas and will continue to make my weekly pilgrimage.

Review Text :
I had to try this place after hearing so many good things about it and it certainly did not disappoint! I'm not really an Indian foodie but here goes:The Chicken Korma with rice was absolutely amazing. The creaminess of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sauce made for a perfect combination of flavors! The garlic naan was light, fresh and equally flavorful. Warning: If you get this takeout, your car will smell like garlic for days! The curry chicken bowl lunch special (extra spicy) was tasty and full of spices. It was the perfect portion for lunch! I have only ordered take out on the 2 visits I have made. The place seems to be really slow, so I hope it picks up soon! I know I will be going back soon! I've heard that the samosas are the best!

I was in the area and craving some Mexican food since it's getting cooler outside. I will admit I went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ...........but you know what......I wasn't!!! It was very clean, friendly and attentive staff, a window opened to the kitchen area to see the cooks in action. I was served chips with a salsa trio, there was chunky pico de gallo, smooth red and the tomatillo green. (see pics) All tasted OK, none were very spicy at all but that was fine with me. My favorite was the green, although I added some salt and lemon juice to it to make more flavorful it still was a great fresh sauce, I could have eaten it with a spoon!I ordered from the lunch menu, where all items were $6.99. I chose the chicken melt it was a grilled tortilla topped with melted cheese ,grilled chicken, tomato and avocado, served with rice and beans (see pics) Wow! A perfect light lunch that I didn't feel guilty eating, it was so good! I have to give 4 stars based on my experience today, I will go back and hopefully thing will be as good next time too.3.5 stars.After we went to the movies it was dinner time so we went across the street to La Parilla Suiza.  We were greeted and seated and then about 10 mins went by before our server came to take a drink order.  Chips and salsa had been placed on the table but no water or drink orders taken.  Our server did not seem all that enthusiastic.  She seemed as though she was just going through the motions.  I told her it was our fist time there so she pointed out some house specialties and then went to get out drinks.  I saw they had chilequiles on the menu and I love them and not many places serve them.  When I placed my order our server seemed a bit suprised I didn't order one of the higher priced specialties.  Our food arrived and it was hot and the chilequiles were good.  We were never offered more chips and only checked on once during the meal.  The food was fine but the service was lacking, in my opinion.  If I was in the area again I would go back and give them another chance.  Everyone is entitled to a bad day.

Review Text :
Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.Thumbs Up:-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.Thumbs Down:-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.I am STILL kicking myself for not getting the rib eye!!  My wife and I went w/ a good friend.  My wife got the filet as usual, I opted for the bone in filet which was surprisingly different tasting than hers.  My buddy got the bone in ribeye which tasted so good despite being cooked medium which says a lot!!Appetizers:  mushroom pastry and the buffalo mozzarella w/ sundried tomatoes.  Both were excellent and very flavorful.  I can still taste those tomatoes.Sides:  We all thought the sides were pretty damn creative here.  The creamed spinach w/ a deep fried, breaded poached egg in the middle is pure genius!!  Watch out for yolk splatter when the server breaks it :P  French onion potato gratin was really good too!  I thought the mac and cheese was just ok..a little too watery for me but still good.Dessert: Can't turn down chocolate souffle and we got the peanut butter and chocolate donuts with it which were tremendous.  I didn't think the donuts at Fix could be topped but they were.  I'll bump this up to 5 stars when I go back and have the rib eye.The other reviewer said he was still kicking himself for not getting the rib eye. Well, if he's still kicking himself, then I'm punching myself in the face for not getting the filet. I got the whole fish stuffed with artichokes and onions done up with the crispy skin. It was good but it didn't blow my mind. Now that filet mignon that my other half ordered, I practically had to punch him to get another bite, it was that good. Here's what we ordered:Crudo appetizer 2 starsAhi Tartare          4 stars Lobster Ravioli   5 stars Lychee Martini   whoa nelly. It was delicious.Mojito Martini      BOO. Tasted like Sour juice.Botero is beautiful, reminds me of the Delano in South Beach. It was good but it didn't leave me wanting to return  any time soon.  I expected much more in their service department. We had reservations at 8:30 but we weren't seated till after 9. We never saw our server between taking our order and dropping the check. Also,  you think they'd get the positions right when placing the entrees. And lastly it would be nice if they'd tell you what the different appetizers or entrees are with a little explanation. Most finer restaurants do this. Botero definitely failed on this level. 4 stars even with the minor hiccups. They were able to get us done in time for our reservations at XS.The logo could use some work, but the interior is quite cool. Chairs are super comfy and the open layout allows you to survey the whole place. My steak was excellent (took a respite from my mostly veggie ways) and everyone in our group was similarly pleased with their meal. Service was great too. It's a bit hushed inside, so probably not the best if you've got a really rowdy group, but we were on good behavior ;).5 stars for service and 3 stars for food. I was here last night with about 20 other girls in our group for a promotional dinner thing that they called a Princess Party for Very Important Princesses. Lol. It was really cute because we all had tiaras waiting for us as we sat at our table. I was just there for the food because the whole princess thing is so not me, but I thought it was fun nonetheless.The promotional dinner included a whole list of appetizers and a huge fish bowl of this delicious drink for all ten of us to share. It wasn't a very potent drink but it was really good. I have to find out what they put in it and try to make my own version at home.The appetizers we tried included some sushi rolls, meatball and Kobe sliders, salad, fries and a few other things. The food was not bad, it was just okay. My favorite were the Kobe sliders, cooked perfectly with a pink center topped with cheese and caramelized onion on a sweet roll.The service was excellent, they did a great job of making us ladies feel special and we all received a rose at the end of our dinner. It was kind of like one big bachelorette party. The whole restaurant was filled with ladies all decked out in their clubbing attire. I guess they do this on Wednesday nights and they take the girls to Surrender nightclub for some after dinner drinking and dancing. I'm not sure how they make money from these things but hey, I get to enjoy it so I don't think about it too much. Maybe its because of the fact that guys will show up anywhere theres a lot of hot young women.All in all, everybody had a wonderful time. The restaurant is very beautiful and elegant with a lot of Botero's artwork throughout. To be honest with you, I didn't know anything about the namesake of the restaurant until I Yelped about it. Turns out I took a picture in front of a Botero piece once before, at the FS Hotel in Miami. I thought the sculpture in the middle of this restaurant looked familiar. Sculptures of plump, nekked women is definitely a Botero thing.This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!Lately I've been choosing Botero when I get to Vegas. However before coming to Vegas I usually have a list of places I want to conquer but somehow....I end up here and what's great about  Botero is that it does not disappoint and I don't regret not going to the other places!! Botero is located in the Wynn, in between Wynn and Encore. Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by the hosts and their bar. The bar itself is small with a traditional bar setting and a few tables with oversized chairs to sit in while sipping your favorite drink before they call to seat you. The restaurant is set to a sexy low dim light level with the help of a fountain in the middle. You can see the nightclub Surrender from almost every angle when sitting down. I am always greeted promptly and served with their selection of amazing breads. On the last few occasions that I've gone, their selection of bread were always different. It is served with a lemon infused ricotta cheese spread and it is flavorful. I don't think I ever want butter on my bread ever again. It is light with a hint of lemon taste to it. For starters, we've ordered the crudo tasting and although small, it is one of my favorite. You get to sample a little bit of everything. The fish are sliced perfectly. Delicate yet still deliver big on flavor. It is fresh and melt in your mouth. The selection of fish on the plate are easy on the palate for a starter. On one other occasion, the special of the night was a tomahawk steak. Not only was this beefy awesome to goodness amazing but it was huge. All of our mouth dropped open when we saw the size of it. Two guys gobbled down on it and there was still meat left. The tomahawk was the highlight of their meal. It was cooked to perfection. Perfectly pink in the center and tender. The flavor of the meat was marinated perfectly. No condiments were required. On my most recent trip, I ordered the brioche crusted salmon. I thought it was weird at first but after the first bite, I was sold. The buttery flavor from the brioche crust on the salmon played very well into the flavor of the salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I ate it happily and finished it without stopping. Feeling already bad....we ordered the truffle Mac and cheese to add more onto our mouth. Yes, it is creamy, cheesy, dense, and rich. You get a good taste of the cheese and then the truffle plays in the background without overwhelming anything else. I can honestly sit and eat the entire Mac and cheese. The desserts here fills me with delight!! There is something about simple desserts that satisfy the soul after having a fulfilling meal. The selections are seasonal and I always feel like it compliments the entire experience. Some desserts are very rich (dark chocolate) and some are light (seasonal sorbets). The service is pretty attentive and the waiters and waitress ensure that our fluids are topped off and clean plates are always there.There was only a single time when service lacked attention and the food took longer than their usual wait time but other than that one misfortune, service and quality of our meals have been great.

Today was Father's Day & my Mom's Birthday, so we decided to grab some lunch here.  Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.This place never disappoints!Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!¿Voy a volver? ¡Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)The Details:-Sunday Brunch 10:00am - 3:00pm-Bottomless flavored margaritas and mimosas-Mimosas use fruit puree, not syrups-AYCE brunch buffet; items seem to mostly stay the same week to week-Fresh tortillas!-Accommodates large parties-No auto gratuityThe food is decent, but you get fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole!  The margaritas may been a bit weaker than you're used to, but they're bottomless!  Service has been great, as the groups I've been with have been known to stay for three hours or longer, and the staff never gives us a hard time.  It's a fun little place to start your Sunday mornings with a little alcohol.

Review Text :
I'm always amazed at how MEAN people can be on yelp.  They took no exception to this little place that is obviously a family owned establishment and the members are very hard working:  The place is immaculately clean and with a very attentive staff.  Reviewers should take notice that you are talking about REAL PEOPLE when reviewing a small place.  It is not some huge emotionless corporation.  Have some decency.I've only been once, and had the Pad Thai.  I enjoyed it very much. It was served with a slice of lemon (YES!) which I squeezed over the dish and it brought out beautifully subtle and well balanced flavors.The bottom line is this: Is this place going to revolutionize the way you view Asian Cuisine?  No.  But is that what they are trying to do?  NOPE.  They want to provide a decent meal at a reasonable price and try to make a living along the way.  For those of you that want to support Ma and Pa restaurants in the community and have a GOOD meal,  this is the place for you.  You might even introduce yourself and possibly make friends with the owners.  Can you do that at Panda Express?I will definitely go back for as long as I live in the neighborhood.I was craving some Tom Kha (with chicken) the other day cause I wasn't feeling good and thought soup would make me feel better so I decided to give this place a try and order for delivery since its so close to my house. The lady that I talked to didn't speak any good English at all, I had to tell her my address so many times and i told her what I ordered I made it so clearly. Anyways, the delivery was really fast but when I started to check my food and was about to take a big ass sip on my soup I see a freakin shrimp umm I'm allergic to shrimp like I almost ate that thing! I called them back and this time it was a guy and I told him that they messed up my order and he wasn't really nice about it and I told him to get it right and send me the right one. After 45 minutes later of waiting he finally came and got the order right but I felt very skeptic to even eat my soup cause they seem very shady but I ate it anyway and now I'm sick. Thanks a lot for the bad service,workers there cant even speak english, your food sucks and won't be ordering at this shady place ever again!***Highlights***: CHEAP EATS UNDER $10, DELIVERY, Clean, Leave the makeup at home: your never going to run into anyone.Negatives: Not Authentic Chinese, Plastic Plates & Cups, Small, Not somewhere you take a date (Somewhere you take your spouse after you have lived together forever and have seen them burp at the dinner table).This is my late night: Go-to, I'm too lazy to leave the house, I'm broke, or I just need variety, go-to place. The food is obviously not authentic Chinese food, but they offer a lot of variety in a single plate and they deliver. If your sick, this a great way to get a big container of some basic won ton soup for about $6.00 delivered to your home. The minimum is $10 for delivery. So when I'm sick I just forget the money, buy 2 containers of soup. One for now, one for later, and call it a day. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this establishment. This is what you expect for hole in the wall, under $10 meal.Price/Food: Under $10. Their lunch special is around $6, dinner special is $9.50. Each comes with sweet sour chicken, one choice of entree, crab ragoon, fried rice, and choice of soup. Add a Boba drink for $3.50! There are 24 different flavors, on ice or blended as a slushy. Lots of food for the price, it takes me about 2 sittings to finish. Because there is so much variety, I don't get sick of it by the second day. I always have left overs. Enough food for a guy though. This is as healthy as Chinese food is going to get. Yes, the food is smothered in sauces like panda express, but its not as greasy. They use lean white chicken breasts for all their chicken dishes and they cook with crisp fresh vegetables. When I'm hunting for delivery yet attempting to be healthy, I order Shrimp & Snow peas off the regular menu. Not as much variety as the Lunch/Dinner Special. But its the same price, clean, simple, plain, Low-carb, Less-sodium.Service/Ambiance: Small hole in the wall eatery, about 6 tables that each seat 4, so service and food are quick. Get in- Get out. I've never had to wait in line. One of the major reasons I keep coming back is that they are so clean. There is definitely nothing fancy about this place, but you can see that the kitchen and seating area is clean. They are always wiping their counters, tables, chairs. Wet towel, dry towel. I've NEVER sat at a wet table or chair. No drips on their soy sauce ramekins. I've seen there employees wash their hands multiple times. They get a extra star from me just for that. I'm all about hole in the wall places that are clean.

oh well we had waited several months before trying this place. An early dinner yesterday at about 4:30 pm. Not busy so we were seated straight away. A booth, yuck I hate booths. This one was hot for some reason so we moved to a table with two chairs, I guess a half booth. It was much cooler. I guy I forget his name was the server and he said at least three times I am going to take care of you real good and or well. Well the first thing we order is our drink, me water Gus iced tea. Well the guy waiter took only a few moments to get this to us, but of course placed the drinks opposite to who ordered. One appetizer, that being calamari. MY meal was the Tour of Italy Being Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo. Gus ordered Pork Milanese Pan-seared pork scaloppini crusted with Italian herb breadcrumbs, served with asiago cheese-filled tortelloni pasta tossed in a garlic-butter sauce with fresh spinach. We had the salad too. So we get the salad, but the waiter wants to give a one soup and one salad. The salad was not really great. Appetizer is set down and about three minutes later the entrees. First off learn to pace the meal dude and try to remember who ordered what. Not once did he get it right even though he claimed it would be good service. I won't go in to each meal other than to say it sucked. Oh well another 53 bucks down the drain.

Review Text :
yes, it is 5 star blow your knickers off good. In fact, read Brian S.'s review because he lays it all out as to why this is such a heavenly spot. All I will add - lamb and mint pasty with a kroenenberg beer...Tuck in!After a long hike, my group of 6 was starving and I decided that we should check out the Cornish Pasty Co, in Mesa. We ordered a variety of pasties: the Royale w/ cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben.Now, you may wonder...what the HELL is a pasty? First of all, it's pronounced 'pass-tee', which is a meat pie. Not to be mistaken for 'pace-tee', used to describes a person's pale complexion or those nipplage stickers burlesques dancers use. It's the British version of a Spanish empanada. And, IT IS HUGE!! I like huge....food... ;o)I ended up ordering the Shepherd's Pie. The flaky shell crust hides the meat and potatoes, on the inside.  The meat was well seasoned, super yummy and blended well, with the mashed potatoes. I was craving for more, after my first bite. Actually, it was so good, I can still imagine the taste of the pasty, in my mouth. Hello, drool!A single pasty will cost you about $8. It's enough to fill up a single adult. We didn't get sides, this time around.  But, we will next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!The church pews are a nice touch.  The service super friendly and helpful.  I got no complaints and I will come here, again. Oh, why don't we have one like this in San Diego?!? Why? Why? WHY?!?Until the next time Cornish Pasty Company..... *le sigh*Been meaning to try Cornish Pasty Company for I don't even know how long. Just hadn't gotten to it.Today we got to the Mesa location and it was killer. Started off great just walking through the door. The decor is killer. They have done some neat things with the bar (tiling, industrial purse hooks - the Mrs. loves those so they stood out to me). The church pews for seating and the glassed over doors for tables are super cool. The melted candle bottles on the table and the black & white photos also help to give it a nice vibe.Next looked at the menu and they have a great beer selection (mix of on tap & bottles). I did get a bit overwhelmed with the number of pasty choices (which is good). They also have quite a large number of vegetarian pasties which is nice - for the rest of the family. : )Whittled it down to the chicken tikka, shepherd's pie and royale with cheese. The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that. The pasty itself was excellent. Great flavor, little bit of heat, great pastry. As the Mrs. is from Australia, we're big into pastry and things like pasties, meat pies, sausage rolls, etc. I definitely need to get her here soon!The service was great as well. Everybody was super nice and quite efficient. Food and drink came quickly. All in all, a great experience. Quite happy with the entire meal.With so many pasty choices, I think it's trouble once you break the seal. I foresee many, many visits in our future.Okay I went here on recommendation from some Yelpers and I have to admit a personal flaw...I add letters into words and flip things around when I'm reading sometimes, so this whole time I'm thinking Cornish Pasty is a Pastry (notice the 'r') joint...I know, I know, "didn't I read the reviews??" Yes, of course I read the reviews; but I'm like the ship Titanic...once I get an idea in my head it's really hard to 'turn the ship around' as it were...Once I got over the initial shock that this was, in fact not a pastry place, but a pasty place; I was pleasantly surprised! This place is great! Our server was friendly, talkative and attentive. The music was a little loud, but for the setting, I think it was at an appropriate level.I got the Philly Steak pasty and savored the flavors of the meat and man, that pasty crust was dang good too!! Yummy! Even though I had some personal problems in the beginning, it turned out to be a FABULOUS experience and I would recommend it to other Yelpers looking for some good eats.A bit of a "nip" in the air this morning...and when I think "nip", I think "pasties" and when I think "pasties", well, I just naturally think "pasty's" :-)So there you have it...that's how my mind works...I've said it before and I will say it again...linear thinking is the best thinking:)I get so lonely working away in my plush private office with nothing to keep me company but a steady stream of information and diversions from across the universe...and my chowchow, DeeDee...sometimes I need to get out of my gilded cage:)Today was one of those days, and fortunately for me, my cardiologist buddy, Jim, was in a position to prescribe a bangers and mash pasty at CPC, for my continued good heart health :-)Stat - (Latin for "with a side of broccoli and cauliflower"...he says they are chock full of "beta blocker's"...I didn't even know I needed my beta blocked!)We met for lunch with his longtime friend (and my new friend) Gary (who is, among other things, a novelist...I want to see how he works me and CPC into a book:)I was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at CPC wasted no time in getting the retox going for me...I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent!Neither Jim or Gary had ever been to CPC before, but they both handled their pasty's like pro's and the three of us all joined the CPC - "CPC" ("Clean Plate Club"...I think there's an award ceremony at the end of the year:)Jim had an Oggie and Gary tried a Greek Something Pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of Friday afternoon (Jim had some sort of "human heart thingy" he had to do, and I had to come back to my office and type on my computer...who has the more stressful job...really? :-).Finally, the people at CPC all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant...I so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there (and probably do) that it's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their  faces and in their voices.It's probably from eating all those pasty's...they're approved by all of my cardiologist buddies, so you know they must be good for you:)hmmmm. idk. is it a gourmet hot pocket? i had the bangers and mash. i probably would have liked it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style. the gravy was great. there wasn't a lot of sausage and i love the grilled onionswe also split the pb&j and that was alright. i liked the rasberry jam. but idk, the whole wrapping everything in a dough sorta turned me off. not sure if i will go back.A big ole' double handful of bangers and mash with red wine gravy!  That's what was in my pasty!  First time here and I can't wait to go back!  Man was that good!I am looking forward to working my way through the menu at this place.  I met fellow Yelper Donald S here for lunch and we sat at the bar where we could watch the kitchen.  As I watched the busy bees busily going about making pasties and other delicious looking things I noticed the ingredients sitting around on shelves...nothing prefab.  No bags from Sysco or some other purveyor of pre-made restaurant ingredients.  Nope, just fresh veggies, fresh meats, lots of big cans and bottles of spices and seasonings.  I am getting hungry right now thinking about the food.  Yum.Update (I've been there again since I started my review):Now that I have gone a second time and tried a salmon pasty, the royale pasty (sort of like a bacon cheeseburger) and shared a dessert I can unequivocally state that Cornish Pasty is one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix.Service has been great and my last visit I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the folks as they were cooking.  Nice people here!I love this place! I've been to the other location, but not to this one since it opened.  I finally came for dinner, and am glad that I did.  Serice was great, friendly as always.  I had the Shepards Pie Pasty and it was delicious!  Very filling, and its a nice sized portion, so you walk away full.I will be back, and always enjoy eating here!And now for my 300th review...........What is a pasty?  It's a lovely piece of pastry filled with yummy stuff.  You can fill a pasty with almost everything.  Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, meat and cheese or something akin to a Chicken Pot Pie.  It's all delicious!  Sounds like a Hot Pocket you say?  Oh no, no, no, this is much more and infinetly better than an item you find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.  A pasty is fresh, not frozen, and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket.  This location is bigger than the Tempe location.  There are several longer tables in the front, several tables on a patio outside, as well as tables along the corridor and, if you choose, there is the bar where you can watch them prepare your food.  The servers are friendly and knowledgable.  It is a causual atmosphere.  I have been here many times and always had great service.  The have many beers on tap but sadly, nothing local.  I would bump it up one more star if they added a couple of local brews.  And they know how to pour a pint of Guiness!  It's a great spot to hang out and have a pint or two and when you get hungry take a look at the 3 page menu.  You will have a hard time choosing so you'll have to come back again and again.....If you like the English Pub feel, this is the place for you.  This would be my "local" if I lived closer but it is close enough to lure me here frequently. And if you've had a long day and would like some take out, you can do that too.  They will do a half bake on a pasty for you then you take it home and bake it for about 20 minutes and viola! dinner!   And even though I was just there yesterday, I am craving another!  Maybe it's because I'm part Welch and Irish.  Thank you Cornish Pasty Company!!From the bar, I watched my food being prepared by dudes who look like they're from Seattle. And then served by chicks who look like they're from Seattle. And now I'm enjoying my Cottage Pie Pasty amongst other diners who all look like they're from Seattle. Except the guy over there with no neck wearing the Affliction shirt which is two sizes too small, rocking the Bluetooth earpiece; he's clearly from the Jersey Shore. Or North Scottsdale.I've been to both Cornish Pasty locations, and I gotta say that they do a great job with the space(s) they occupy. This haunt in Mesa - like the one in Tempe - occupies a strip mall (as do 98.5% of the restaurants in the East Valley), but it sure doesn't feel like it once you're inside. And I dig that.As for the dough these things come in ... It's, like, equal parts flour, Jesus, and butter! From this point forward, I'm dedicating my life to reverse engineering these mofos and then opening a Cornish Pasty. In Seattle.Let's just say I'm a fan.Woke up on Saturday and decided I needed to try something new that I have never had before. So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had "British" food. I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best "chips" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!Cornish Pasty food & service:  5/5  The Romper Room Effect 0/5We had a late lunch around 1:30 on Easter Sunday and our server was great!  The receipt said his name was Johnny Cakes.  Somehow I doubt that's totally accurate, but hey....if it is, you go Johnny!  He was friendly and laid-back and took great care of us.  The pasties were great, as usual, and we also tried a side of their curry potatoes which were delicious!  If you like curry, these are cubed, perfectly roasted potatoes with a few roasted tomato bits as well.  They complimented the pasties and beer perfectly and I would definitely order them again.I know it was a Sunday.  I know it was Easter Sunday, but the amount of kids screaming and running around was appalling.   Take them to the park.  Take them home.  One inconsiderate mommy was wandering around carrying her beer, half-heartedly trying to corral Screamy and Sticky and if I heard her say one of the kid's names once, I heard her say it 400 times.  (Names changed to protect the inconsiderate).  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Ad nauseam.  He's obviously not listening, but hey, get your buzz on.  Who cares.  Several children were crying loudly and the ones that were running around were frequently in the way of the entrance and patrons coming and going.  Ridiculous.When I'm managing my own restaurant I will politely pack their food up to go and give them clearly printed directions to the two or three nearest parks.   Letting your kids run around like wild animals is rude and inconsiderate and it's dangerous.  These are the same asshats who will sue you when their sweaty, foaming at the mouth kid falls and hurts themselves.  Send them to the park.Who has been hiding this place from me. Right in my old old neighborhood. Down the street from my high school. Obviously this place wasn't here when I lived in this area way back in the day. Otherwise I would really have kicked myself.My girlfriend introduced me to this place and she is the best for bring me here. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere is great. A little dark but it works. The whole place is lit with real candles. They actually come around and replace them when they get low. Very cool.Great beer selection too. Some I have never even heard of but want to try. I didn't know what to get so the waitress got me a sample of a Scottish ale it was good so I got a pint. I want to come back and try the rest.We also got the oven baked chips with garlic and jalapeno. Chips = fries people come on get with it. They were awesome. Some of the best fries I have ever had. Although I will say the jalapenos didn't quite make sense. I like jalapenos don't get me wrong but they were just chopped up on top. When you picked up a fry they fell off. If you managed to get a few to stick they would come off when you dipped it in the sauce. You can bypass the sauce and just eat one but they didn't really add anything. If they were baked into to the chips that might be better. Still very good regardless.Now on to the Pasties. The reason you came here and the name of the place. I have never had a pasty before but from looking at the menu you can put pretty much anything you want inside of one. They have an Italian one, cheesesteak one, Greek one, a few Mexican flavored ones and so on and so on. You name it it was in a pasty. I finally decided on the spicy chicken asagio one with some advice from my girlfriend who has been here before. Sure it takes awhile for the food to come out but they are making it when you order it. By the time you sip on your drinks and munch on those fantastic chips your food comes out so it works out. So good. Flavor was perfect. Everything all crammed in there but all working together. The dipping sauces they give you with it work perfectly. They vary depending on which pasty you order. Don't be shy pick it up with your hand and munch away. No shame in it. That is really how you are supposed to eat them anyway.I can't wait to come back and try the other great pasties. I have to say I might be addicted. So good and such a great place.Oh my Gaaawwwd. Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner! This is a Mesa (or Tempe) "Must-Try"! My Dude and I have been here twice now. Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here. There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing. We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles. Another great touch to the great ambiance. The first time we went, we got a table up front. Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients. Also, be prepared to wait a while. Good food takes time! Just grab a beer and enjoy your company. Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties. Both were absolutely delicious! Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets. Which my Mexican thought was hilarious. Damn you, Dude. Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes. We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic. Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked. Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)! Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made. We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time. Again, both great. Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check. Downside to the Bar? You can come across groups of people telling you to "move over" so they can fit their group together. Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order. Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!For those who are not familiar with this british speciality, a cornish pasty is a sandwich baked into a pie-like crust.  It's a lot of like a hot pocket, except it's good.  And this restaurant serves up an amazing cornish pasty.  It also doesn't hurt that Cornish Pasty Company has an authentic british pub ambiance.I had the Oggie, which is a pretty traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes and onion.  Give it a minute before taking your first bite.  Trust me when I say it comes to the table piping hot.  For just $8.50, it's a pretty good little meal.  Need more?  There are some good sides and salads for about $2 to $5.  The beer selection (tap and draft) is awesome.  I did not partake in dessert, but what I saw at other tables looked amazing.When my son and his boyfriend caught wind that I went to Cornish Pasty without them, they insisted we go stat! So off we went!I wasn't really hungry, but at this point I was in the mood for dessert and had already been tipped off that Cornish Pasty had some great tasting desserts.Somehow I was persuaded into getting some garlic roasted fries, and I have to say, those fries were delsih! Glad the boys were there to share though, they made a perfect side to any pasty!I was thrilled to see they had Banoffee Pie, so I knew I had to order it! It had a crisp graham cracker crust, nice creamy caramel, whipped cream topped with fresh banana slices, this right here is comfort dessert! Keep it simple and sweet! LOVED IT, want more!So after my review from Easter Sunday over 2 years ago, we've gotten food from Cornish Pasty, but have not dined in.  For some reason, this place attracts an inordinate amount of jagoff parents and their out-of-control offspring.  I just don't want to deal with it, so we'd get the food to go.  In a way, it had two benefits.  It helped to preserve my sanity, and it saved us money because we'd bring the pasties home and drink our own booze.  But, then I got the idea one night after we both had taken a nap after work, to go out and hit this place at 8:00 p.m.  I thought, well, maybe all the sticky-fingered crumbsnatchers and their oblivious parents might be home by now.  That strategy has worked out very well.  In the past month we've been back a few times, all around 8:00 p.m. and the crowd has really thinned out and we haven't had to tolerate any maniac kids.  The only aftereffect to the dinner hour we've felt was one evening we had to wait for a booth to be cleaned because a large family with a bunch of kids had made a huge mess.  It looked like a couple of pasties exploded.  Who does that?  Seriously!  Animals.I've started trying their soups and I love the cream of leek soup with the fresh-baked bread.  I'm pretty sure they should call that bread "crackdough", it's just that good.We sit at the bar frequently, and Megan takes great care of us.  A pint of Rogue Hazelnut Brown and the Royale with cheese pasty and I am one happy girl.

This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their "Hawaiian" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. But the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon "the best pork" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.So we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.They have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.So yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all.

I adore this place. I've had  variety of sandwiches from them and they are always huge, delicious and reasonably priced. Their hot pepper cheese balls and Mac and cheese are also amazing. It is an outside place on the side of route 51 which I suppose is a small downfall but it doesn't keep me from giving it 5 stars. They have a few picnic tables you can sit at but otherwise it's more of a take out type place. You can also have them cater larger events which I've only experienced once but it was just as good as it is when I get a single sandwich. The food only takes them about 10 min to have ready for you as well or you can always call ahead and order too!I've had their chicken bacon ranch and buffalo chicken sandwiches and both are sooo good. I've also had their regular Philly cheesesteak and their chicken Philly cheesesteak and neither of those have disappointed either. Their pulled pork is equally amazing. The big pig sandwich is one of my absolute go to items on their menu, being that they are obviously a BBQ place as you can see from the name, you know their BBQ sandwiches have to be amazing. Go here asap! You're welcome in advance. :)

I went to Moe's in Market Square in Pittsburgh PA on Friday 2-21-2014 as part of a promotional dinner event called The Winter Warm Up. I understand that each place has a set menu for this, but I feel the way I was treated by the manager Robert, was just plain shitty. We paid $50 for tickets and there were 9 restaurants, so I assumed $5.50 worth of food at each. They had rice, bean, and chicken bowls for us. That were a little small. I asked if I could have one without chicken, as I am a vegetarian and have been for 15 years. I thought with Moe's "make it your way" attitude, that this would be no problem. I was given a flat "No" as an answer. So, then I ask if I can take the chicken out myself and then they can put the other toppings on. "No" I explain that I paid to come here and I do not eat meat and they ignore me, explaining that the bowls are "pre-made." So, I just take one anyways, and throw away the chicken and proceed out of the line. At this point, one of the younger staff comes over and asks if I am a vegetarian. When I say yes, he apologizes, and makes me one without chicken, Great!, right???? No, Asshole manager Robert comes over and reams the kid for making mine Veg saying that "We ain't got time for this shit!" Well, excuse me?!? First of all, is it really appropriate to 1. talk like this in front of customers, children, and elderly??? 2. talk like this to employees??? 3. be this much of a jerk in general??? Also, there was no one else in line, and everyone in the restaurant had already been served... So what exactly did they not have time for??? NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING ANYTHING!?! What a jerk. Seriously!

CASHIER: How was everything?COREY: Delicious.CASHIER: Looks like you're new to the area?COREY: (internally...) Really? CASHIER: I mean that's the Chicago skyline on your credit card.COREY: Oh right. Yeah, I'm from Chicago originally and I've been living in Tucson the past 6 years. I just made the move to Madison and I'm looking for an apartment. CASHIER: Oh yeah? Which area... this one is great.COREY: I've noticed, I'm actually looking around here. CASHIER: If you lived close you'd never be far away from Ha Long Bay.Truth. And I won't be. The spring roll sare enough to get me back, as are the mega lunch specials, all of them reasonably priced and served until 3. The staff is super friendly and they rhyme. Common.I'll happily wait (nearly) an indefinite amount of time for a table at a great restaurant. I'll tolerate poor service, to an extent. I realize people get busy, get distracted, and generally have bad days. I understand all of that, within reason. But let's paint the scene for Ha Long Bay tonight (and quite honestly, most other nights, albeit with slight variances)...8pm, slammed busy. Zero waiting space. Loud. Cramped. Hectic. People bumping into one another; servers bumping into people. Names are given with the hope of getting a table. Hostess could care less. Grumbles something about a wait. No drinks offered while waiting, although it's not like they have a vast selection or offer any room to imbibe while suffering through the wait.Table becomes ready, but don't get your hopes up... It'll be another 10+ minutes before a "server" shows up. Our server on this particular night was a bearded gentleman with a chip on his shoulder that was bigger and more full than his Duck Dynasty wannabe scraggly beard could ever hope to be. He literally slammed waters on the table and asked if we wanted anything else. I ordered a single hopalicious, while extending a smile and a sincere thank you. Nothing. Just a quick turn and departure.That would be ok if he were on a mission to fill the requested beer. But it was another 10 minutes before he returned. He had the beer, and then asked what we wanted for food. We ordered two appetizers, which he struggled with - the notion of getting the "pork AND shrimp spring roll" apparently too much to handle... He wrapped up the order with a, "so, just appetizers?" and an eye roll upon our confirmation.20 minutes later, we had our appetizers and more attitude when we requested a refill on the beer. We never saw said server again, save for a fling of the check at us. So... Crappy service, cramped interior, slow kitchen, and mediocre food... I will order takeout, but I'll be hard pressed to dine in again. It's just not worth the frustration.The squash curry at Ha Long Bay is delightful. Once you've had a taste of this red curry sauce, there's no turning back. It's been known to convert non-curry fans into true curry addicts. This is truly a feel-good dish that's packed with flavors that will warm the soul. The gentle medley of spices will have you hooked at first bite and will leave you craving that flavor like no other. Within the curry is a great blend of zucchini, Thai eggplant, bamboo, basil and, of course, squash. Ha Long Bay incorporates both acorn and butternut squash into this dish, and these components are the star of the show. They retain their lovely flavor while also absorbing a good amount of the spices from the curry, which makes for a hearty yet healthy meal. Addicts beware.Yup, this place does it for me.I was in Madison for just a day visiting the infamous Corey D, and we were absolutely starving for lunch. We stopped in with only about 45 minutes to spare, and Ha Long Bay ended up being a really excellent choice! Thai heaven happening here (as well as Vietnamese and Laotian.)First of all, the menu is huge. You're going to need a good few minutes to decide what you're going to order. For the sake of time (and because it's my absolute favorite), I quickly decided on the yellow curry lunch special with a cucumber salad on the side. While we were waiting, there was a pair next to us that got their food extra spicy... we were coughing all the way from our table! That's really the only negative thing I have to say here... it was so, so smoky in there and my hair even smelled like curry for a while after I left. They definitely need to do something to improve ventilation! Regardless, our lunch happily went on.My lunch was everything I wanted it to be -- the cucumber salad was excellent, and my yellow curry with chicken was perfectly spicy and full of flavor. I seriously didn't want to stop eating.We paid our bill (which was so cheap - $16 and change for two lunch specials) and were on our way. This place is so good, and I'll be stopping in during my next visit to Madison!

I have been to Kaya three times within the past month.  And I can give them a solid 4.5 stars each and every time.First visit:* Steamed Pork Belly (Marinated and steamed Pork Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with leaves, thinly sliced radish, sliced jalapenos, sliced garlic, kimchee, etc.  Place it altogether with a slice of pork belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people!* Korean Seafood Pancake - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.* Spicy Sashimi - Generous portion, but perhaps a bit too much. * Something Wrong Roll - Whatever was in there, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.Our waitress was super helpful and we didn't know what else to order beyond the seafood pancake.  She made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with her suggestions.    Second visit: New addition to the menu is AYCE sushi for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri, rolls, and appetizers, we also had:* Bulgogi (steamed beef) - Generous for one, so go with one order first to see if it's something you like.* Skewers: bacon & shrimp, gingko, garlic, chicken gizzard, shrimp, beefCame for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a special dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks.  Our waiter, Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good time.Third visit: AYCE sushi again!* Steamed black mussel* Ahi poki* Fried jabchae* Spicy Korean ramen* Skewers: bacon & scallop, mushroomService was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free beer.  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our meal more. Their nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of fish and not a whole lot of rice.  That's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE menu is also what we enjoyed - especially the chicken gizzards, the garlic, bacon & scallop, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their steamed black mussels came with a creamy sauce that was good.  Soft shell crab appetizers are also available, including tempura.  Noodle dishes included are udon and ramen.  Rice dishes include fried rice, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls.Dessert is limited to vanilla, strawberry or green tea ice cream, limit one.For a relatively new restaurant, they are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two times we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  AYCE sushi with some Korean thrown in there?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave.They also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!(Pics posted!)HAIR IN MY SUSHI!So disgusting and my bf and I didn't even finish our AYCE. We still had so much food on the table, but we were so disgusted. In addition to that, I got baked green mussels, and there was shell cracks IN THE MUSSELS! None of the shells were even broken so I don't even know where they came from, but it definitely hurt my teeth when I ate them.I used to go here all the time, but not any more. Even though the servers recognized me, they still didn't discount my meal. $45 for two lunch AYCE (more like 2.5 rolls that we were able to order) and they couldn't even comp my drink. I paid it though + $0 tip.DON'T GO HERE! Believe me, I like supporting small restaurants and not corporate chains, but this place does not deserve your patronage!Pardon me, but I did come and eat here twice in a week :P Yes I enjoyed it that much to have an AYCE again and eat like a queen, king, the whole kingdom of Suki Land. I have to say this is my favorite AYCE restaurant from all the others in Las Vegas. It's simple, fresh quality nigiri, rice perfectly formed ( not overly packed ), and everything I ate was GOOD, not mediocre... Tasty and satisfying good!!! Parking could be a hassle on weekends and holidays. Be forewarned.. parking was full in this complex, so I parked in the Chinatown complex nearby Seafood Palace restaurant and minding my own business.. then slap right on my driver side window.. a warning note that my car will be towed next time I park in this area. Damn serious?! This lot is empty late at night, I'm doing this lonely lot a favor by parking here kiddin' me?!!??!! I guess the security guard saw me skipping happily away to Sushi Kaya and he got jelly.. I don't blame him.. I would be so jelly too, knowing I'll be chowing down some real good eats in a few minutes. Sushi Kaya is tucked in the corner right next to Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbecue restaurant. If you're not the type that reads signs and banners.. you might as well missed this place and gone to Anime Ramen. I lived here all my life and never even knew about this place until a few of my lovely coworkers decided to eat here after a crazy night at work. Fell in love that night with Kaya.. Sushi Kaya that is. Then came here again a few days after with my Family for my Brother's going away get together. The owner is extremely kind and welcoming. Took our names and in matter of minutes, we were seated and our server, Juno, that's another story was attentive, patient, and sound in service. Almost like he had sixth sense of when we wanted to order more, to taking finished plates, drinks refilled, to just anything we needed he came around every time to see how we were doing and if we would like to order more. Couldn't have asked for a better server, yet alone a very handsome one :D We didn't order any rolls, but only nigiri... Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Scallop, Uni, and Sweet Shrimp. All were fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Salmon... never had it like this before.. melts just melts so smoothly in my mouth. We ordered ten orders of Salmon and Tuna. The cuts from the Salmon was the best quality I ever tasted.. Both my parents mentioned about it too. Unfortunately, it was so good that I forgot to take pic of it. Once I saw the dish, I devoured it.. I mean my Family and I killed the nigiri. We were like synchronized machines.. one by one.. nonstop. Finishing everything... Clean. Raw oysters were fresh & ended with a reviving bite. I insisted that my brother's gf and my mother to eat it all, since I'm single.. know what I mean :P Eh anyways so much more food to enjoy, I just wanted everybody to eat a lot & be happy. Bacon/asparagus and bacon/scallop... do I need to say more.. flavor madness.. must try!!Shrimp and calamari tempura had such a light, crisp crunch. Not too oily or salty. The batter they make this in had to be fresh every time. I seriously enjoyed every bite! Cucumber, Seaweed, and Salmon Skin salad.. sum it up with one word.. Refreshing!!!My two favorites... Ginkgo nuts and sweet potato diced skewers. I'm not shy to order 20 each and cheerfully finished every single piece. I'm the killa of these two and don't tempt me to strike again, because I will! *chomp chomp chompWe ordered desserts consisting of: five orders of mini cheesecakes, mocha almond/green tea/red bean ice cream, and green tea/red bean mochi. In waiting.. I completely forgot I ordered  three orders of baked green mussels and the food runner goes.. ooooh are you done with dinner?!!? We all said Yeeeees. Then she goes oooh, but I have your last order of these mussels? Then my whole family looked at me haha I go... it's okay... no problem.. I'll still take it :P Done. It had a caramel finish in taste and cheese topping. Very yummy for my tummy. No problem...Desserts all came and I ended up finishing all the mini cheesecakes, since my family warned me they couldn't hang anymore.. what I say... No problem.. I'll eat them for you. My Brother keeps saying out loud.. Damn my sister can eat!! Damn right. Weak sauces... nah just kidding. We all did a great job in finishing all our dishes. From start to finish.. it was a great experience in dining here. Food and service were on point and never at any given moment was it a disappointment. Food came out promptly and never once were we just sitting there without anything to munch on. Always busy eating away!!! Ha! :P The price is so reasonable and exceptionally affordable compared to other AYCE places. Don't forget to ask for a punch card to redeem after 10 visits :) And best of all.. it's open late hours.. last call I believe is 2:30 in the mooorning, seven days a week. Even the interior design of this place is cozy, love the bird cage looking lamp!Visiting LV from LA, gf since HS and fellow Yelper took me to this quaint little establishment off the strip. It's not much from the outside, situated in a strip mall, as you walk in it's as if you walk into a little Japan. Inside is contemporary design, with cozy booths and tables. Friend and I had the AYCE sushi, of course. Service was spot on, the food just kept coming and coming for a good part of 2 1/2 hours. And was all so wonderful on the palette. I think we ate just about everything on the menu. I have been to several other AYCE sushi establishments and have accepted that "it is what it is"...limited menu items, limited time to eat, and green tea ice cream for dessert. UGH!!!! There was none of that at Sushi Kaya. The AYCE includes a plethora of menu choices; appetizers, soups, noodles, sashimi, of course a wide range of sushi, AND desserts. When I say desserts, I don't mean just green tea ice cream, I mean you've got options. That was really surprising to me and I was very happy to be able to order several different desserts. Thinking back, we weren't rushed out like so many restaurants typically do for the purposes of turnover. Sitting relaxing catching up over AYCE sushi, now that's a day well spent.When traveling I prefer to go where the locals go, and this is definitely a local place and I will definitely return the next time I'm in LV.Soo, this sushi place has been my go to for the last 7 years and have been here maybe 40 times. But after last night's visit I probably won't be coming as much anymore and mainly sticking to Goyemon. First, their parking has always been a pain but I would still come because it was worth it. Also service is a hit or miss, sometimes the server you get is awesome, and sometimes extremely slow.The last few times I've come their cuts and grade of sushi have been getting worse especially this last time. Super chunky weird cuts especially the super white tuna. Gross. The sauce they still put on it is still the same and still really good though. Now the special rolls. My absolute favorites have been the Cinderella, French Kiss, Mango Style, and Dancing Eel so when I ordered them again last night, all of them except the French Kiss was wrong. All of them were skimpy looking to start, looked like they shrunk half in size from last year. Dancing Eel had one baby piece of eel on ONE piece, the rest were covered with spicy tuna! No Eel on dancing eel roll really? Mango style had no avocado on top like it says on the menu and the inside was also wrong, all I saw was imitation crab. That's all. Cinderella had no kiwi sauce or the other sauce that it's supposed to have and mainly imitation crab as well. The baked green mussels have saved them a few more chances and are still my ultimate favorite from any sushi place. Warm and gooey and flavorful, thank you for not changing. But seriously, what happened to you Kaya??  You were sooo good up until 1 year ago when I first started reaaally noticing a change. Thank goodness my stamp card was filled out so I got one person free last night because it was definitely not worth it. I will give you 3 more chances since we've had a long marriage. But just warning you, we might have to get a divorce :(Worst customer service i have ever got in my life ,I ordered sushi baked roll , I eat kosher fish  only , they brought me sushi with crab meat , when I asked to replaced it the manager asked me not to come to the restaurant any more !!!! Cuz they are tired of making a custom order for Jewish people .The staff don't know how to talk with customers , They insulted me and made me feel very bad .I will never get back to that restaurant .What a racist attitude ...Shame on you guys .I really was looking forward to trying this place and although the food was decent the experience made me never want to come back.A group of us from work have a soccer league that we play in every Sunday night and after our game this Sunday we decided we wanted to grab some food and like I  said before I was really wanting to try this place so we went.Now I understand that some of the guys I was with were in shorts and t-shirts because we had just come from a game but I have never felt more judged in my 23 years of life. I feel like they took one look at the guys because of the way they looked and didn't want to help them.We probably went through five different servers, and I understand that these guys can be jokers but you should never judge a group of people by the way they're dressed. They wear suits and ties everyday make 6 figure salaries and because of they way were dressed we had some of the worst customer service. I'm still in shock.The manager came around to every table while we were there, except ours. Our servers were very rude, our food took forever to get to us and the manager completely snubbed our group. We didn't even get a chance to let him know what was going on.The food may have been decent but we would much rather go somewhere who treated us with respect no matter what were wearing then bring our business back here.I love sushi, but my body doesn't really like all of the rice- so I try to find AYCE spots that offer riceless rolls. Unfortunately, Kaya is not one of them. However, they balance this out by offering one (5 piece) order of sashimi per person, and a grill/skewer portion of their menu, in addition to the usual apps, nigiri, and rolls. For those who love carbs, there's also a soup/noodle section available. Pricing is a bit higher, but you have quite a bit to pick from.APPS: The sashimi plate and sashimi poke were both pretty solid, with generous portions of fish. The "lettuce wraps" app isn't the typical version with ground chicken and vegetables, but features crab, avocado, cucumber, and tempura veggies in lettuce cups, which is at least kind of close to a riceless roll. GRILL/SKEWERS: We tried all of the items marked as "one per person" (garlic, bacon/scallop, bacon/asparagus, beef tongue, etc). We didn't really care for these items but liked having them available for something different.NIGIRI: Fresh with surprisingly thick cuts. Rice wasn't too heavy but also didn't seem to have much flavor. The salmon, halibut, and uni quality all surpassed my expectations (better than average for AYCE) but the amebi (BF's favorite) was super tiny and bland.ROLLS: We tried the White Vegas and the XXX2 rolls, the former a bit spicier than the latter, neither one especially packed with rice as we've experienced elsewhere. I'd consider coming back to try more.I was surprised by how nice this spot was on the inside- high ceilings, cute kitschy decor, and a bar area with TV showing an NBA game. Pricing is a little higher than usual: $58 before tax/tip for dinner for two.I've been coming to Sushi Kaya for a little over 2 years now and it seems like every time we come here the service gets a little worse. It's really sad because this used to be my absolute favorite spot but between the service and the cockroach that was crawling by my head I will be looking for another AYCE Sushi place. The food quality has gone down a little over the years as well. It's not terrible by any means but it's just not as good as the first few times coming here. Management really needs to step it up before they start loosing more and more regulars.

Getting lunch downtown is not always enjoyable. With the same few mediocre chain restaurants glutting the market (Au Bon Pain, Subway, etc.) it's easy to fall in to a rut. Enter Istanbul Grille:The portions are generous. The prices are fair. The staff is friendly and personable. The food is excellent.I, too, tried to pay with a card my first time there and also was told I could pay next time. When I offered the cash I did have (a $5 bill) the guy behind the counter refused to take it so I just tossed it in the tip jar. That's how you build a loyal customer base.Note to first-timers: The ordering process is a little confusing so either go with someone who's been before (if you're the type who doesn't like seeming like a newbie around the regulars) or be prepared to ask a few questions. And try everything because it's all terrific.I can't get enough! I'm hooked...Obviously, because I keep dreaming about the flavorful food here! The first time I walked in I was pretty confused. I've never claimed to be an ethnic food expert, so looking at most of the food, I really had no clue what it was. But, the thing that helps me out is that I'll taste anything. It doesn't matter what it looks like, if it's food, I'm probably going to taste it. True fact.So the guy, who I'm assuming is an owner or manager of some sort is nice enough to help me out. That was pretty much the only option I had, to trust him, considering there's literally no menu. None. So he hooks me up with every single thing they have in their food bins. Seriously, Everything. I ate for days! But every single thing was incredible. I wish I could tell you what it all was... so to best sum it up... I believe I sampled bubba ganache, hummus, chickpea salad and cucumbers in some sort of marinade. What I'm certain I had was salad, rice, chicken, beets and grape leaves. Even the grape leaves were excellent. i feel like I hadn't found some solid leaves until I tasted these. i loved that I could taste the lemon. Just bursting with flavor!So he hooked me up for dinner, lunch and dinner again for $10 with a free drink! He said first time I get one free. i stopped in again today and had a solid meal, no surprise, and watched him give another first timer a free drink. I love great customer service!I'm hooked, for realz.

If it were not for the gift certifcate we had from a JDRF fundraiser I don't think I would have stepped foot into Basil.  I always drive past it and from the outside..it just looks like another Thai place that might be mistaken for a Chinese/Japanese restaurant. However, as soon as we walked in we were very surprized and impressed with the decor and that they were packed..on a Wed. night!  Our gift certificate had expired 2 weeks ago (I can't understand why a gift certifcate would expire).  The hostess at the desk didn't look like we were going to wiggle our way out of this one.  She called over the manager, Dillon, and he looked at the gift certifcate and said they would honor it and then thanked us for our donation to the JDRF.  Dillon seated us and took our drink order.  Hendrick Gin & Tonics - yes they had Hendricks AND they had cucumbers and didn't look at us strangely when we asked.  A+ already.  We started off with the Basil spring rolls.  They were very good and the dipping suace was very spicy, but you only got 2 of them for $6.95.  I thought that was a little pricey and I would have rather gone for the lettuce wraps. Dillon was very attentive and we had a great discussion about how the Uptown hotel market has been full for weeks and is booked until Thanksgiving.  He also made an excellent recommendation for a Pinot Noir and it wasn't the most expensive wine on the list.  For dinner, Jennifer our waitress was very helpful.  She said she liked the red curry dishes the best and suggested the Red Curry Duck  ($24.95).  We ordered the duck and the Pad Thai ($15.95).  The Red Curry Duck was awesome.  The Pad Thai had chicken and shrimp and it was very good.  One of the best Pad Thai I have had in awhile.  It did not stick together like a big wad of starchy noodles.  It was very good with enough of a helping of chicken and large size shrimp and a good amount of vegetables.  After dinner we went to the bar and finished our wine and had a rum mojito that was also very good.  The bar tender was personable and Dillon came over to check on us.  It was a great night and the food was superb.  Will definetly go back to Basil Thai.Ok ...hmmm...I rated this one only 3 stars.  As a Thai people, this restaurant is more americanize food.  I ordered hot but it was mild to me.  The food was ok.  We ordered Basil Pork w rice and Pad see eww.  It was ok moderate.  If u love spicy food, ordered Thai hot.  To me, its still not that hot but bc I am thai and i eat spicy food.  But if u dont like spicy food thai-american taste, this place is for u......Basil Thai Cuisine was recommended by a fellow coworker to eat for dinner.  Pretty tasty... and pricey too.  Their website boasts as "Refined Thai"; which I would agree with.  If you ask me, I probably wouldn't pay that much for Asian food unless I'm on a hot date where the guy pays for it though.  Since I was traveling for business, why not?I ordered the Pad See-Eu.  Delicious but it'll cost you $16.95.

I checked out the Mad Greek today.  We were on that side of town and it popped in my head, thanks Yelp!  I dont' know if I would drive and make a special trip, but if I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again.  In the light of day, it didn't seem so clean to me.  If you are the kind of person that looks at sanitation ratings, it might not be the place for you. I didn't see what their score was and I do not care, I will eat anywhere, but I know what people like when they think of a clean restaurant.On the upside, our server was pleasant, we ordered chicken sandwiches on pita.  It was served hot and was very filling.  It would be so much better for you to eat at the Mad Greek instead of fast food anyday.

I have to give this place a split personality review.  The party side of me says this place is a heck of a good time!  The foodie side of me says this place compares to a TGIFridays, but with German food. The first time I came here was right after they opened....so I wanted to come for the food and drink.  It was the dead of winter so the outdoor area wasn't open yet and we were shoved in the corner of the large dining room.  I couldn't decide what to order because I love sauerkraut, I love cabbage and I love German Potato Salad!  It's sad I didn't even want any of the meats, all sides!  So I just stuck to those and apps.  I mean who can go wrong with those choices?? So the fried pickles were good and....fried.  Check.  The sauerkraut was like mush.  Ew.  I expect good sauerkraut from a German place!  I want it crisp and tart.  Just plain mush.  The German Potato salad, mushy as well.  Potato's, mushy....no flavor.  Yuck.  Fried Cabbage...you hear me....FRIED....was mush!  Seriously, horrible!  I would never come here to eat again.  On the other side.... Atmosphere is fantastic! The dining room is really rambunctious! They have people standing on tables and singing.  they have a HUGE shot luge where a bunch of people have to take shots at once.  And the outside...FANTASTIC!  It's this huge open area with picnic tables and a large bar.  Plus you're right smack against the river so it's really pretty out to.  Pretty for a beer garden I suppose!  The beer comes in these huge liters, which is great in theory, but if you're not slamming them back it gets warm and nasty.  I'm always a lager fan, so I had the Hofbräu Premium Lager.  It was pretty much lager like.  Nothing to write home to Germany about. So remember, food gross but drinking atmosphere GREAT!I have wanted to come to the Hofbrauhaus since my 21st birthday but just made it here a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I don't get why people love it so much.  The food is very Americanized German, and the atmosphere is so strange.I ordered the Bauren Schnitzel ($16.95), which was a Pork cutlet with Ham and American Cheese.  Think a cheap version of chicken cordon bleu.  It was the waxy American cheese.  This was the kind of thing I would expect to get from a dive bar or cheap diner.  I also had a dark beer that, while dark in color, was not dark in flavor.  It was fine just not what I expected.  My dad was super unimpressed with his Weisswurst.  So food was a bust, beer was ok.I think the low point came when at 6:00 pm on a weeknight people were plastered.  The waitresses were serving multiple drinks to people simultaneously, which is illegal.  Some creepy old man who was there with his TEN children was double-fisting liters of beer.  And he and his children spent the evening running through the tables.  The Von Trapp family with a drinking problem?  Guess that's what I get for eating fake German food.If you just want to drink, go to the Beer Garden at a time children are not allowed.  Otherwise, skip the Hofbrauhaus.Cheers!  I love coming to the Hofbrauhaus  on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Most especially when it is nice enough to enjoy the outdoor biergarten along with the views of the city and the river.  Maybe it's the German in me, or the beer in me, or the German beer in me?  Eh either way you put it, I'm down with it.Now I haven't eaten here but on a few occasions.   The food is good enough.  No particular stars or duds that I can recall.  I love German food, but their version is much more Americanized.  It's okay though, since the South Side offers so much in the way of eateries I am happy to just come and spend a couple hours in the sun downing a liter of brew.   Our last visit here was great.    Perfect weather over the Labor Day weekend led to a great afternoon trying their September style Oktoberfest that is brewed in Munich.  I loved it.  Nice seasonal balance of flavors, served in a huge been stein, you just can't go wrong there.  When I do come here I tend to try their seasonal selection first, there are many that are very good.  Sometimes this place can get crazy, and if you aren't into that kind of atmosphere I recommend coming in the afternoons.   I would probably never come here in the evening again, though I have heard they cracked down on their tolerance of bozo drunken idiots.  This is always good to hear.  Bottoms up!

One of the nicest Mexican buffet options I have ever seen.  It is great to have this location right here in Surprise.  The dining room is nice and the menu selections are amazing.  Prices are a tad on the high side for me, but in retrospect, the food was worth it.  Avoid Abuelo's at the Arrowhead Mall area, and stay right here in town for a wonderful dinner!  Service has been spot on each time we have been here.

Went here last night for dinner. The place was very clean and unfortunately - sorta sparse. I guess the South Side doesn't appreciate Hawaiian food like I do. :( I had the Bulkogi short ribs. They were braised in this wonderful tariyaki-like sauce and were very tender!! I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful! I loved it too!! i wish they had a bulkogi and katsu combo... but alas they don't! :( They have a pretty big menu and I needed a few minutes just to read through it all. and I didn't even get through it all! :( When our food came Steve is absolutely right! Our containers were BURSTING with yummy food! :) My ONLY complaint is that the Macaroni salad has onions in it. I hate onions. but that's just me. I am totally adding this place on my list of regular haunts. I know it's a fast food chain... but damnit it's GOOD! I look forward to trying the Span Masubi!! It's a giant piece of nori wrapped sushi made with SPAM!! How could that be bad?!?! I also want to try the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. :) to my yelpers, I say GO! i know there's another location Phoenix... but if you're on this side and you want to dine in a clean and you're REALLY hungry and want to be REALLY full... and you love BBQ like I love BBQ and have a few extra bucks to spend and are willing to give a fast food chain a try... then give this place a try! Where the grill is always hot and the surf's always up! :D

The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.

Review Text :
3.5 stars.  I'm typically a pretty harsh reviewer when it comes to buffets since to me buffet quality food is synonymous to takeout quality, and why would someone dine out to just have takeout?  Also, for the same cost and time spent at a buffet one can go to a much better restaurant with better tasting and quality food.  With that in mind, I have to say Hokkaido isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.So here's what I have to recommend:1.  Go for lunch.  Only go for lunch.  At $8.99, it's probably one of the cheapest if not the cheapest buffet out there.  If you're shelling out over $20 for dinner including drinks, why not just go to a Chinese restaurant w/ a nicer ambiance and better quality food like China Palace?2.  Go early.  I've been there once around 12:30 and once around 2:30 PM and there's a giant difference in the quality of the food.  Get there either before or during the lunch rush.  They have adequate seating and it's not like you'll be waiting... it IS a buffet.  Food will be coming out a lot faster and everything will be fresher.3.  Stick w/ salmon nigiri.  If you're here for the sushi, their rolls just don't cut it, and their salmon nigiri is probably the only thing worth eating.  Their other options aren't really passable.4.  Get their dim sum.  If you're going when they're busy, fresh handmade dim sum is being made all the time.  And where in Pittsburgh can you get non-frozen sui mei?  I also like their pork buns (only if they're freshly made of course).5.  Avoid the usual suspects.  You know what fried rice tastes like.  You know what lo mein tastes like.  You know what chicken teriyaki and General Tso's tastes like.  You know it's all loaded with excessive MSG and you'll have cotton mouth while feeling like crap later.6.  Do try their Mongolian BBQ / Teppanyaki.  The chef actually knows what he's doing and cooks kinda okay.  If you're new to Mongolian BBQ, it might be daunting, but after a while you should be able to figure out what sauce combinations taste good.  The chef can make a sauce for you, but I don't like my dishes as salty as your average patron.I find myself eating their salmon nigiri, their dim sum, their beef brisket soup, and their "szechuan-style" pork.  I also get some veggies, be it baby bok choi, green beans, or broccoli for the sole reason of pretending to be healthy.  I stay clear of all their other sushi, their, pizza, sausage, pork loin, and random Americanized Chinese.A quick nigiri fix with some handmade dim sum in Pittsburgh for 11 bucks seems pretty good for me.When you get right down to it, it's a chinese buffet, and as we all know, Pittsburgh and the yinzers with their stretch jeans and sweat pants mentalities, loves them some Chinese buffet.On Jan 1st I took charge of my life and health and went vegan, it wasnt long after that Lesbian friend of Joe who eats meat with every meal and snack decided that for her birthday she wanted to come here for her celebration. we hit the place and she took off for the crab legs, shrimp, and anything she could find that used to be an animal that was sitting under heat lamps and oozing of juices that used to be blood.I went to the sushi station and asked one of the sushi chefs if he could make me a california roll and anything else without fish. He smiled and said that he could put his creative mind to work. I was floored with what he came up with. He took many different vegetables and made me a sushi platter that was both beautiful and filling. Using brown rice and white rice, cucumber, carrot, and scallion, he created a wonderful meal.

Review Text :
"I was so disappointed with this place, that I was compelled to write this almost as soon as I finished eating." says Kellie A. in a review over a year ago.  Well lets start by saying that not a whole lot has changed in a year and that was my first thought on my drive back to work.First off I already had read some of the reviews and it was a consistent "customer service is crap" here.  I didn't pick the place as I was meeting my friend for a lunch date.When I walk in my friend is at the front of the line and there is a lady behind her.  No staff around.  We wait.  And wait.  And finally Mr. Ignacio shows up.  No greeting just asked my friend what she wanted to order.  When he finally got to me I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a diet coke.  He then asks me if I want a 12 oz or a 24 oz and without hesitation I order the 12 oz thinking the smaller is better....not fully realizing its a kids cup.  I pay for my meal (by the way he never told me how much it was) and he walks away.  No receipt.  No drink cup.  No "I will have your order right out".  So I move to the side to see if someone can help me.  Immediately he is annoyed and "thought" he gave me a cup (my kids cup).  I ask if THAT is 12 oz and he said yes.  Ok I guess?  Would have been nice to mention that little detail. The receipt without any conversation was awkward not knowing if he was going to give it to me or not.  Again he hands it to me and walks away in silence.  What a ball of joy this guy is.So my name is called and I kindly thank the guy (another employee) for my lunch.  My girlfriend ordered the same salad and as I am a quarter through I look at her salad and realize mine doesn't have chicken.  I quickly look at my receipt and make sure I ordered it with chicken. Sure enough they forgot the chicken.  So once more I'm headed to the front with no one around waiting for assistance.  Mr. Ignacio's slow ass comes up and as nice as can be I state that my Chicken Caesar Salad is missing chicken-praying and hoping they don't spit on it.  No apologies just an argument of him wanting my salad back and me not wanting them to do bad things to it.  I informed him that he can bring out the chicken separately which he did and added extra to be nice I guess. Thanks but no thanks.  The chicken looked gross and was clearly nuked (a little cold in the middle).  Maybe that's why they drench the salad in dressing "over" the whole salad so you don't see the chicken-which is how my friend's looked when it came out.  Anyways, I counted like 4 employees in the back.  Don't know what the heck they were doing because no one was up front unless forced to when a line piled up.  Not to mention not one of them paying attention to customers up front. This is exactly what I'm talking about how special it is to have a young person giving great customer service.  Because it is not often that you see that.  In this case with Ignacio, I cant believe they have him servicing people.  No personality and not one skill of customer service.  Very sad.  Lets just hope someone mentors the poor guy to grow up with a positive and friendly attitude. Like other reviews there isn't much to say positive. What a disappointment on all levels.  Maybe management should check out the reviews to realize after a year they aren't getting better...sigh.  Definitely will not be returning to this location.Came here around 950pm on a Sunday night. We were the only ones in drive thru. I would've chose to go inside but dt is only available. So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying "Hello?" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying "hello" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying "ooookay..." Like, why was he so confused? So, we pull up to the window and he goes, "So what was your order?"I repeat everything again."So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?"Yes we want all the food we ordered."Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that"Like, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, "sorry hold on you want what?" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. I also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. We get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had. That Miroslav guy was so rude!

Review Text :
The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!After reading Connie C.'s review and seeing "mojito lamb chops" on the menu, I was fully intrigued and sucked in. Yes, you read that right...MOJITO. LAMB. CHOPS.Quite the new swanky scene in Vegas. Dim lights, upbeat tunes, gorgeous view of the strip...I was saddened to have had to leave early to meet a friend who landed a bit earlier than expected. However, we were able to stay long enough to enjoy my 1.5 glass of Cotton Candy Kiss. It was amusing watching the waiter pour the drink into my martini glass filled with a fluff of pink cotton candy as it melted away into red liquid courage. With an abundant amount of crushed Lifesaver candy coated around the rim, each sip was full of fruity sweetness. Perfectly portioned Grey Goose and juices, the drink delivered an awesome kick without the jolting taste of alcohol. Loved it!Our waiter understood our situation and packed everything to go without any hesitation. Literally running back to our room so the food wouldn't get cold, we unpacked everything with a fork in hand and chowed down with the quickness.The mojito lamb chops lived up to their reputation! Blanketed with a minty lime glaze, each bite was packed with intense flavor. I found the meat to be a tad tough, but I enjoyed the non-gamy taste of the lamb. With 3 fairly large cuts, this could be served more as an entree than an appetizer. Highly recommended to anyone who swings by First Food & Bar.Accompanied with a side order of truffle mac and cheese, this was a delicious first meal in Vegas. Prices are very reasonable considering LV is known for raping everyone's wallet in every possible way. I hope to come back next time and stay long enough to enjoy the ambiance and full experience.My friends and I have developed a new system for our trips to Vegas. Instead of making a list of all the places where we can get drunk, we have lists of where we plan to grub.First Food & Bar was definitely a place we wanted to try, especially since a friend of ours went ahead and tried the place and not only gave it a good review, sent tantalizing pictures.First Food is located inside between the Palazo and the Venetian along the gondala canal. Right next to the Barney's New York store on the second level of the Palazo.Our party of 4 got seated in a booth along the window facing the strip and the big Palazo marquee. The view was great and definitely added to the ambiance of restaurant. Since it was a Sunday night, we didn't indulge in any cocktails. Our friend (the junky one that went here before the rest of us) did mention the cotton candy cocktail, which is backed up by many yelpers here.My friend and I were ready to have a realy grub moment so we each got an appetizer. I went with the yelpers choice of "Mojito Lamb Chops" and my friend went with the huge bacon wrapped shrimp.The lamp chops are flambeed table side when they serve it, so there definitely is a "wow" factor. I did a pieced of the lamb chop back into the sauce after it was served and wow...it most definitely has 151 in it!The bacon wrapped shrimp was perfect and if I do say so myself, LA can use some bacon wrapped shrimp carts next to the hot dog ones outside of clubs and sporting events!For the main course I got the Shrimp Diablo, and my friends got Cubano sandwich, and the Trout respectively. The shrimp diablo was served with eggplant which make my mouth absolutely happy! The heat from the sauce was a perfect blend of spice but not too hot that you would need a pitcher of water to calm our burnt taste buds.My friends were pretty happy with their choices..but I think it was dessert that pushed us over the edge. I decided to do a throw back to my childhood and ordered the push pop (yes just like the ones with the flintstone characters on it), while my friends went with the molten chocolate cake, and the s'mores,The push pop was, well a push pop. It was a very tangy sorbet that really cleansed my palate after eating very savory food. The molten cake was pure chocolate goodness. The s'mores on the other hand...just fucking amazing. The graham crackers on the bottom could have been a little more moist, but ugh..the whole thing was just too amazing. The toasted marshmallows on top..just made my mouth happy!Overall I would give this place a 3.5 but with a photobooth located inside it's bumped up to a 4. We had two different servers help us and they were absolutely great. One of them didn't really know all the components of a dish and rather than bullshit us he went and asked - awesome! Definitely stop by if you are in Vegas and looking for some good eats before doing whatever it is you do in Vegas :)We came here for a coworker's birthday lunch. I do think the strip could use more places like this - moderately priced, fun atmosphere, open for lunch, etc. It seems we have too many things on the uber-high end (and only open for dinner) or uber-low end (food courts, fast food, cafes). The space was great and the views of the strip are killer! I loved our booth right by the window overlooking the pirate disaster at TI. Service was just OK (he forgot to bring our soup and was slow in general), but unfortunately I've found mediocre service is becoming the norm on the strip..I was disappointed by how tiny the lunch menu was. Maybe 10 choices or so? Pretty slim pickings. The drink menu had 50 things, the food menu had just a few - what's up with that? Annoying when you're at a work lunch and not drinking! Prices were high-ish ($15-$20 on average) for the type of food it is, but it's on the strip in a swanky hotel so whatever, that's just part of it. 2 of us shared the pulled pork quesadillas and turkey club sandwich, and 2 others got the fish and chips. The turkey club sandwich DID taste just like the ones I ate at the country club growing up - but for $15 with no sides, I would have liked some primo ingredients (avocado or even cheese!). The pulled pork quesadilla was pretty awesome. It looked like a sushi roll with beautiful avocado layered on top, but it had that nice grilled crunch of a quesadilla. Unique, flavorful, and delicious. My coworkers seemed to really enjoy their fish and chips. For dessert we had chocolate creme brulee with toasted marshmallow on top. This was freaking awesome. Something different, well executed, and fun. Overall a nice change of pace from the high end stuff on the strip and the food court crap. It's pricier than what you'd expect to pay at this sort of place, but for the most part the quality and portion size is there and the atmosphere and strip views can't be beat.Jim G. and I have only ever eaten here during the late night hours, so factor that in to your own decision making process.  happy Hour is from 4-6 and midnight-2am!The vibe here is cool, with loud, often good music, and a nice view of the front of Palazzo and Venetian.  Keeps the energy up! The only downside is that this place is far away from most of the other stuff in the hotels, but it's worth the trek (as long as you have comfy shoes. Trust me on that...).Things we've tried:-Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings: Very tasty, served with a sriracha ketchup to add a little heat =)-Lollipop Buffalo Wings: Tasty, but a much larger order than I anticipated. Be ready to share!!-Lobster Chowder: Not too impressed with this dish.  It's super big (which helps justify the price), but not as flavorful as I expected. I'd pass on this.-Tater tots with cheese (can't remember the type, but very flavorful) and truffle oil!: This dish was big on flavor and on fun! Crisp tots, nice gourmet cheese, and the punch of truffles. Yes, please.-For me, the reason to return: Macaroni and Cheese topped with Doritos!! If this isn't late night food, I don't know what it. The mac and cheese is good, the Doritos are awesome. Together, it's a cheesy, crunchy heaven. Order it. Just do it!I'll be ordering that Mac n Cheese again really soon. Hope to see you there! =)I hate speaking in the third person but this place had Craig R. written all over it! Just look at these tasty dishes;Nacho Cheese Doritos Mac & Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=826LcTQfc4Yc0zdF0mZbDQMain Line Philly Cheesesteak W/ Foie Gras & Tartuffo Whizhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=duW7vzBywJFRDU8dD3kKrw or http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=HuYApeozWa7c71Mm-ZFRiQPhilly Cheesesteak Dumplingshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?start=200BBQ Pulled Pork Eggrolls W/ Slaw & Dr. Pepper BBQ Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=BsVPIS7yPlrPyRUk-WMi0Q Warm Pretzel Bread & Spicy Mustard (Free Appetizer) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=DmIHIg4jkp_x1HbiuIqU7gLike I said, Craig R. written all over it!Located in The Palazzo Hotel, First Food & Bar is large, dimly lit joint with a cool, relaxing vibe. As you can tell from what I ordered above, this place is all about tricked out comfort foods. Everything we ate was amazing. EVERYTHING!My favorite two items were the Doritos Mac (obviously) and the Main Line Philly. The Mac was super cheesy and flavorful and the Doritos gave it an extra cheesy, crispy element.  The Philly was HUGE and delicious. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and the Foie gave it an extra, fatty, buttery taste. It was also covered in Foie mayo, sweet onions, balsamic glaze and Tartuffo Whiz, all of which made this one of the best tasting Philly's I've ever had, even though I had to eat it with a knife and fork. And I got to give a quick shout out to the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=01F_4bCqJ9_EtE1fO9QSAw. It was fantastic.     My only beef with First Food is the pricing. I'm NEVER one to complain about the price of food, especially when it's amazing, but for five small (but super tasty) Philly Dumplings it was almost twenty bucks. The Main Line Philly was over thirty. Our entire bill was almost a hundred bucks (with tip and no beverages), which seemed a bit too much. The service is great though, so that's a plus. Overall, I really, really enjoyed my experience at First Food & Bar. The food was outstanding, as was the service. I can't wait to go back and try some of their delicious sounding desserts.

Quite a few Irish Pubs have sprung up in the West Valley; one by the Peoria Spots Complex, The Auld Dubliner, and most recently one at West Gate. I have been to each spot and I have frequented TAD many more times. I like the atmos at TAD however I question the rusty farm tools and nets hanging on the walls. After coming here for a few happy hours over the last few months, and taking advantage of the special pricing, happy hour is a good time to come. Some of the happy hour specials are $1 off draft beers, half priced appetizers, and extended lunch menu definitely makes this time of day a better value. TAD has a selection of about 12 draft brews including one of my favorites Smithwick's. On one visit I tried the Fish N Chips which are pretty standard and tasty. **Bargain hunter alert ** Tied into the happy hour, TAD offers lunch portions until 6 pm -- smaller portion and more cost effective.The Auld Dubliner is a solid spot for happy hour.

2.5  but definitely not good enough to bump to 3 stars.Just to get to the restaurant you must navigate through the dreary casino that is Fort McDowell (see my review on Fort McDowell).  And this restaurant is CLEARLY an extension of said casino. Let's get to the point, the only reason your even considering coming here,*Drumroll*...ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS. Yes, its true, for $9.99 you can sit for hours and eat crab legs until you can't can move. IMO, that is the only reason to come to this restaurant or even the casino for that matter. The crab legs were plentiful and were pretty good, these are snow and not king crab legs so they require a bit of work for the amount of meat you get. I ate my weight in crab and did not dare to touch anything else offered in the buffet. The rest of the food (enchiladas, green beans, macaroni, etc.) looked deplorable. I get, Crab is expensive, and if they must give you something else to eat in addition to the crab its going to be the cheapest side dishes they can call "food". No thank you.  The real question: Is all you can eat crab legs worth the visit? *sigh*, Kinda, not really. I don't regret making my 1st visit, but at the moment I'm not compelled to return. After I was stuffed to the gills with crab, and had to make the journey back to civilization, reality set in. The reality of having to drive 30 miles, 10 miles of that through surface streets, burn 1/8th  of a tank in gas, and walk thru a casino that is more like a smoky time portal to the Reagan era.. probably not worth it. I could save myself $15 in 91 octane premium petro and just eat at the local red lobster for far better food and a better experience.

Despite the construction on Indian School, this place was doing some major business during the lunch hour on Monday...I was starving and I wanted to something somewhat healthy but quick... I remembered reading Donald's review and thought about calling for delivery, but I decided I'd go check the place out myself instead.And I'm so glad that I did!The place is super clean, the employees are really friendly, the prices are right, and the food hit the spot too - it was exactly what I needed to fuel the rest of my busy day.I went with a medium "Caribou" on a tortilla wrap.  What's a "Caribou," you ask? It's Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Sprouts, Mayo.  I know what you're thinking... "Isn't she on a wedding diet?"  Well - yes, I am.  I ordered it with only single cheese and no mayo.  The wrap is low carb and was supposedly whole wheat but I'd question the whole wheat part.  It was really good though!  I also ordered a side salad and a pickle... both delicious!  (If you like a sweet tangy honey mustard dressing like I do - they've got that too!)I'm so glad to know about Silver Mine - I'd go the extra 1/2 mile for Silver Mine over Subway any day... or I'll just have them deliver.  Either way, I'm sold!

Looking for a quick lunch spot in the area, we ended up walking in around 12:30.We found a seat and they brought a menu out to us for us to decide what we wanted to eat. I ordered the honey walnut shrimp from the lunch menu. I don't usually order that dish, but it sounded good on that day. The food arrived relatively quickly and the it was standard fast food fare. Portions were generous and service was standard.

What's up with me? 2 Indian buffets in 4 days. That must be a first for me. I don't think I've been to one for six months prior to this. My craving for the Indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to Mint and so I was determined to have a good experience today. After extensive research on Yelp I decided to try Mt. Everest. A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being "billowy." We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office. This buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic. My co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys). And yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty. My only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.It's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while. Mt. Everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the Indian buffet genre in Las Vegas. Thanks to all the Yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place. You guys were spot on!The very best Indian lunch buffet in town!!  I literally enjoy every hot dish they offer and I'm glad they're still doing brisk business.  Stand outs for me include the korma, saag paneer, chicken tandoori and the chana masala.  How do people operate after stuffing their faces here for lunch?  I only go on my days off since I'm in a coma for at least a couple of hours after.My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.They give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).Mango Lasi:Creamy mango shake. 5/5Veggie Samosa:You get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5Aloo Tikki:You get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5Palak Paneer:I was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5Garlic Naan:I love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5Chicken Tikka Masala:My favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5Kulfi:A mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5Gulab Jamun:My favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5I honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!This place is just okay. There are many rave reviews, and I feel like I may be missing something. I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons.

Holy hummus batman!!I mean, it's like a hummus party and everyone's invited.  Seriously, if you're a true friend you would invite everyone to this hummus party because it's so good!  Apparently with over 20 kinds of hummus, you can please them all.I tried a plethora of different ones but loved the buffalo, garlic and horseradish one the best.  I went home with the horseradish and have been happily eating it every day since.  Man does that horsey sauce give you a kick in the butt, but it's goooood!I also had a gyro with all the fixin's.  The pita bread, soft and chewy.  The lamb, loads of it and nice and moist, no dry meat here!  The sauce (maybe to me one of the most important parts) was awesome!  Love me some cucumber yogurt greek sauce... load me up with it and I'm good to go!  Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap, with gyro's at around $5 and the hummus being around $3.  You won't break the bank with this lunch/dinner/snack!It's a family run business and the owner is SUPER friendly and easy to talk to.  it's so awesome to see an owner that's so passionate about the business and happy to be there.  I know I'll be back for my stock of hummus, I'm hooked and I can't turn back now!!I stopped by today around 12:30 to grab a gyro for a quick on-the-go lunch.  I asked if they had chicken gyros, to which the guy behind the counter said, "Yeah, I can make you one."  Nonplussed, I said okay, and he rung me up for $5.After standing around for a couple of minutes, I saw the guy who waited on me get a hunk of meat out, unwrap it, and put it on the broiler.  Noticing that the bus that I needed to catch would be there in 3 min., I asked him if my chicken gyro would be ready soon.  He assured me that it would, and then proceeded to assemble it and put it on a panini press.  When he gave me the finished product, I rushed out the door and managed to catch the bus just in time.Once on the bus, I unwrapped the gyro and proceeded to eat it.  Upon inspection, it was large in size and bulky, and contained some surprising ingredients.  Instead of iceberg or romaine lettuce leaves, it was topped with spring mix, and I didn't detect any tomatoes in it at all--or fries.  The biggest surprise was the meat, however, which consisted of breaded chicken strips, most likely of the previously frozen variety.  This is the first time I've ever bitten into a gyro with crunchy (crispy?) meat.  The gyro also contained a generous helping of tzatziki sauce, which was applied between the meat and the spring mix.  Unfortunately, it lacked the zip that's the hallmark of a well-made tzatziki, and its plentifulness made for messy eating, esp. without napkins, which I forgot to grab when beating a hasty exit to catch the bus.  Overall, the flavor wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I'm accustomed to in a gyro.I'd be willing to give this place another try for the hummus, since that's what everyone seems to rave about here, or perhaps a pastry, since their selection looked good.  For gyros, however, I'd recommend checking to see if the broiler is in use before ordering--at least, for the chicken variety, if you don't want to risk getting a gyro made with crispy chicken strips.  For a solid chicken gyro containing standard ingredients and meat sliced from the spit, I recommend Lesvos in the South Side.  Based on the positive reviews, I must confess that I expected better.I have been looking forward to trying the Greek Gourmet for over a year and half, but I just made it in a few weeks ago.  The prices are crazy reasonable, and the employees are super friendly.  My experience:Lamb Gyro ($5)- The lamb meat and pita were spot on.  Diced tomatoes were great.  The tzatziki sauce was unique.  I was not a fan.  It was a very heavy and creamy sauce, almost like ranch dressing.  It also seemed to have a salty feta taste almost.  It was very unique.  Similar to Laura M, I found the spring mix off-putting and very messy.  I would have much preferred romaine.  A 2.5 star gyro.I want to go back and try the gyro again with a slight variation.  The girl behind me ordered hers without sauce but with hummus.  I think this is the way to go.  So I would recommend trying a lamb gyro with tomatoes and hummus.  They also have a frequent gyro card, and if you buy 10, you get one free!Small Red Pepper Hummus ($3.50)- Spectacular.  I will be coming back here to buy more hummus.  They had about ten flavors.  I also tried the plain hummus, and it was super delicious.  Some of the best hummus I have ever eaten.The employees were exceptionally friendly and upbeat and really seemed to like working there.  This is a take out only place and more of a market than a restaurant.  They also accept credit cards!

Review Text :
---Brace yourselves, as this is a VERY long review----Hanging out with other foodies in San Diego I was constantly dragged along on hunts for perfect pho. It was definitely a trend among the foodies to compare pho notes, finding the most bizarre and hidden vietnamese restaurants and bragging about it among other gourmands. The fact is, I never really liked pho, my friends would ooh and ahh and suck down giant bowls of it. I'd do the same, thinking to myself, well this is good right? I just must not get it. Pho never really seemed all that special to me.Having moved to the mountains of WNC, my cravings for vietnamese food have grown exponentially, not pho of course, but delicious spring rolls wrapped with lettuce and the like, maybe a bahn mi sandwich. The fact was, there are no vietnamese restaurants in Asheville, and you always want what you can't have. On a recent trip to Charlotte I sought out the most accessible and highest rated viet restaurant, which just happened to be Vietnam Grille. I couldn't have been happier.Open till 10, it fit right in with my schedule. Well lit, and open seating, I was pleased immediately upon entering. Wasting no time I asked for an order of crispy spring rolls. Delivered quickly PIPING hot, and amazingly crunchy, the spring rolls were like biting into little nuggets of heaven. A perfect blend of pork and shrimp.When my server returned to take my order, I was torn between three items. The house special bun, the deluxe broken rice, and the pho. I didn't really want the pho though, it's just... that's what people get. I asked my server for his recommendation. He informed me that the pho was amazing. I winced, and flipped a coin for guidance.Heads: Get the phoTails: Get something awesome!The coin launched into the air, and landed in my palm... heads. Fate had decided for me. It was time for the pho. Once again I was amazed at the speed in which my order was brought to the table. The pho came out steaming, beautiful. From the aroma it was instantly apparent that this was no standard bowl of pho. This was something special.I got to the process I'd seen time and time again, tearing up the basil leaves, putting the meat under the noodles, adding the sprouts and lime juice. Just as I went to reach for the Sriracha a man came to our table, he looked at my bowl and said, "Before you use that, try it first" "People always ruin the broth before tasting what the chef has prepared"I was taken aback, how could I be so rude? I instantly complied and brought a spoonful of the golden, transparent soup to my lips. To call it an explosion of flavor would be an overstatement, it was much more subtle than that. Tiny waves of flavor, layered together to form a perfect tapestry of delight rolled over my tongue. I had never tasted something so light, but full of character. Exceptional, something truly intelligent and delicious. Suddenly it became apparent to me what pho was supposed to taste like, it's supposed to be like this. 3000 miles away from my friends in desperate search of the perfect bowl of pho, I was sitting right in front of it, and relishing every morsel of it. And to think that if I were to have added even a drop of Hoisin or Sriracha I could have tainted this perfect creation.The man introduced himself as the chef and co-owner Ricky Lai. The rest of my meal was spent having a fantastic conversation with Mr. Lai about food, thought, practice, and the fact that Asheville is in DESPERATE need of a vietnamese eatery. It was truly a pleasure to find and eat at the Vietnam Grille. It will surely become a source of pilgrimage when the cravings for vietnamese food become overwhelming.My go-to place in Charlotte if I don't know where else to go!The first appetizer on the menu, which is the rice paper meatball wraps, are pretty much a staple now whenever I go. Pho is also very good, but recently I have been ordering a lot of the grilled pork chops over rice. They even put two runny eggs over it. OMG HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The bun, which is vermicelli noodles with a light sauce is also very good. **TIP: if you are greedy like me and can't live without the taste of pho soup without leaving a Vietnamese place, I order a side of the soup whenever I get a non-Pho entree, haha. Smoothies are very badass as well, try the strawberry or the soursop.I go there a lot though, so I've noticed the music variety doesn't seem to change. One can only listen to Kenny G-like and candle in the wind instrumentals for so long. Other than that, solid place to goI haven't had Vietnamese food in quite some time...we're talking years here so I was really excited when a friend wanted to meet up at Vietnam Grille. He mentioned that he (quite literally) eats here four or five times per week...I can see why!Inside, Vietnam Grille is pretty basic and super clean. The owner and the waitresses were all very nice and made sure that our drinks were constantly filled and we were enjoying our meal. I ordered the spring rolls and the chicken pho. The spring rolls were very good and refreshing - wrapped in rice paper and filled with fresh shrimp, herbs and rice noodles - and came with a tasty dipping sauce. I could have easily (and happily) eaten five more for my lunch. The chicken pho was the star of the meal though. The broth was light and nicely seasoned and it was the most generous helping of pho I've ever been served. Seriously, there was enough for three lunches. The chicken was tender and there were a ton, and I mean a ton, of noodles. If you want to get a delicious lunch that will last for days, this is the way to go.The Pho train continues. Know this place to be one of the most highly revered in town when it comes to authentic Vietnamese, and I'm happy to jump on the bandwagon of believers. It's quaint, very simple inside and located off of South Blvd. Headed north on South Blvd, it's easy to turn in really quick. Located in the parking lot of Sports & Fitness. The rice paper rolls - best I've had in Charlotte. Very thin vermicelli, mint leaves were spectacularly fresh, crispy tofu and the peanut sauce was just wonderfully flavorful. Had to sample the pho, per usual at any vietnamese eatery, and I was thrilled. Simply put, it's just perfect. Savory and smooth broth, spiced well, filled with crunchy scallions, bean sprouts, fresh jalapenos, vermicelli, and a nice helping of thinly shaved beef. Two entrees and rice paper rolls for only $22. We'll be back really freaking soon. So good.

Review Text :
My family and I went here for my Mother's 70th birthday celebration dinner.  I actually wanted to take her to a very reputable Steakhouse but she insisted on dining here since it's been her favorite place for special occassions. They have two locations... the one near the strip has been around since the 1980's I believe and has been a local and non-local favorite spot for many. I would suggest to make a reservation since this location is a local spot,  you may have to wait if you don't... Better safe than sorry.There is a bar separate from two main dining rooms. One for Teppanyaki ( the decor is simple yet pleasant to look at, the lighting is dim... just the way I like it! ) and the other a more hip trendy lit area that gives off a L.A. joint vibe. I never been to a Teppanyaki place here in Vegas that played some really good beats... hip hop Hooray for me =) It really put me in a happy, want to sing along mood to every song. Hey DJ you ARE playing all my songs!!! Even my family was jammin to the beats.Our Chef was entertaining and got us to interact with him from catching food in our mouth wow never knew my family is soo talented, to scare the living Sh** out of me from putting sauce on my face BUT it was fake... He even talked to us and carried a decent conversation while cookin up a storm for us... skills... MAD skills I tell ya.We all ordered the Geisha Special which is Lobster, Chicken, Filet Mignon, Shrimp with fried rice and tempura. Also comes with salad that was refreshingly crisp and tasty. The soup broth with bits of mushroom slices had a burst of flavor even though it looked oh so simple. The tempura was lightly deep fried to perfection and enjoyed each crisp bite of hotness.The fried rice was colorful and delicious... I admired the texture of the rice which made it very enjoyable. The Lobster meat was juicy and plumped... Filet was chunky and tender... Chicken was plentiful and all the meats were cooked in no sauce but only seasoning that made it absolutely delicious and satisfying. They have their own house special dipping sauce on the side for the meats but in reference to cooking with Teriyaki Sauce?!?! LOL You gotta be kiddin me... I know what that tastes like and there's no Teriyaki Bowl Teppanyaki here. Overall my Mother had a great birthday dinner... happy with Sake, food and service was memorable, alcohol beverages were made strong * Good Job!! not watered down like some places, had tons of leftovers, which I was sooo excited to wake up for the next day, and now understand why my Mother loves this place so much. Go there BUT come hungry!!!Shabu shabu, aka hot pot, aka Asian fondue, has returned to S. Fort Apache Road!The Geisha Corporation has opened up their fourth restaurant with the name of "Little Geisha Shabu Shabu."  Taking over this huge space once owned by Nina's, Little Geisha offers hot pot, sukiyaki, and something called Genghis Khan shabu shabu.For $13.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, which also comes with a platter of veggies including udon noodles.  Two dipping sauces accompany this dinner, the first being a ponzu and the other possibly being of a sesame variety.  After cooking your meat and veggies in the hot broth, dip your food into both sauces before consuming.  Its all the flavor you'll ever want!  For $14.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Sukiyaki dinner, which also comes with a platter of veggies, udon noodles, and a raw egg.  Their sukiyaki sauce has quite a bit of flavor and the BF was impressed with their concoction.  They pour this stuff into a hot pan and start cooking your food in this sauce.  All dinners come with a bowl of rice and a couple of side dishes of kim chee and pickled goodies.  Be sure to add the garlic, radish, and green onions to your shabu shabu or sukiyaki, it adds a lot more flavor overall.Feel free to ask for more rice, kim chee, and pickled stuff since there's no additional charge for it.  (Double check though!)  The BF and I left pretty full, and it appears they offer a bit more veggies than Swish does.Business is still slow at this location since there's not too much traffic yet around here.  We were the only ones there at 7 pm, but by the time we left, three other parties had joined us.  Employees were helpful in cooking practically all our food for us, and I wasn't sure if this was standard practice or because they were so slow.  (I can't imagine how they could cook everyone's stuff for them if they were packed.)  It can feel a bit rushed when they do all the cooking for you, so feel free to tell them you can take over at any time.  It can get messy with them picking out all your food for you, but depending on your chopsticks skill, maybe you do want them to do it for you.They also offer plenty of tables for those not interested in cooking up their own food.  It's a pretty small and straightforward menu at Little Geisha.  Let's see if they can last longer than Nina's did!Reflecting back on my visit here a few months ago, with a unbiased neutral mind, my experience here was been THE worst of my life. Went in on a Friday night with a group of 5 after seeing an advertised special of 14.99 all you can eat sushi. When we got there, it was fairly empty but we weren't seated for about 15 minutes, for no given reason at all. After being seated, we sat for another 10 minutes after our waitress disappeared, without any notice or even leaving of any menus at all. When she came back to fianlly take our drink orders, she told us that the tiny piece of paper in the plastic display was the menu. It was then we foud out that the special 14.99 menu was limited to about 6-7 different items from the very basic nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp) to a few plain, unoriginal rolls (California, phill, spicy tuna). No appetizers, no included drinks, just those. Dissatisfied and irritated already, I asked to see a regular menu becuase I wasn't feeeling for any of those, she snarled and said "no a.y.c.e. on the full menu, you have to pay full price." I didn't ask for the prices, I asked for the menu. Her farfetched assumption that we were cheap was very insulting. We shouldve left then, but we didn't. There was a selection of happy hour cocktails and mixed drinks that we ordered some of which never arrived at all. Some chose to order off the regular menu, some chose the AYCE and one, so turned off by the way things were going simply didn't want to eat anything. The food came out extremely slowly for the AYCE, often all on one big plate, left for us to divide them across the table in confusion. The sushi was very very mediocre, need I say I've had some better prepackaged supermarket brands. Nigiri had too much rice, sushi rice being too cold and lacking vinegar and the fish being hardly fresh. The rolls were not bad nor great, just.. Boring. During the entire time our party was dining, we didn't recieve one polite gesture from the waitress, or even the bussers.The tipping point of the whole night was at the end. After asking for the bill, which was a difficult task simply because we could barely get a hold of our server, she delivered it and vanished once more. Ahh, the problems arose. We were grossly overcharged. She charged us for 6 AYCE's and all the cocktails we ordered were full price. When we asked her about it, she claimed that the non-ayce patrons ate fron the ayce's plate. That was not the case, trust me, I hardly doubt they were dying to sneak a bite of a California roll. She insisted that was the case and even started to argue. Also when asked about the drinks, she said that we ordered them after the happy hour time, when in reality the fact that we got our drinks 30 minutes after we ordered them due to the entire staffs negligence was probably why she thought we ordered them late. Also and the kicker? There was a crazy, "$5 service charge" added to every single AYCE dinner patron, which brought the actual price of it to 19.99 per person. Never in my life had I heard of hidden fees at a restaraunt. Cars and homes? I understand. Dinner? are you kidding me?Our entire party furious, we spoke with the manager explaining the entire situation, and the most he did was take off all the mistakes, even still that was only done because of us claiming we wouldn't pay if it was corrected. To further rate this place, I'll do it on a rubric based out of 100 points. Food Speed: 30/100Food Quality: 50/100Service: 0/100Decor: 65/100Price: 40/100Avoid, avoid, avoid. Service here is what kills it, and I know it wasn't just a bad day or just that particular waitress because I work at the starbucks in the same plaza ad see them regularly. Most of the staff is extremely rude and snobby.

Wingsday, how can you go wrong!  $.44 wings on Wednesday, so we had to stop by craving some good wings.  Tacos are $2.50 for those that don't like wings.  BT is a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and real good crispy wings.  A nice selection of beers on tap and about 20 wing flavors that are rated 1 to 5 on the menus heat index.  We had the BT Original and the Dingo.  Both were very good.  Neither are real hot or spicy but with a nice flavor and just a little kick.  If you like spicy you may want to go to the 3 or 4 on the heat index.I'm sure we will be back for Wingsday.

This review pertains to the summer tasting menu.The Skinny: surprisingly weak in the flavour department, poor execution, and lack of a clear thought process make this place a no-go (2.5) service is quite good in the restaurant (4) value: given the quality, $42 per person is pretty ridiculous (1).We were originally going to hit up American Fish for their happy hour but unfortunately they were closed. We stopped by Sirio due to their appealing summer menu offerings.My husband and I both ordered the summer menu which consisted of beef carpaccio, mixed green salad with goat cheese, apple and candied hazelnuts, mushroom ravioli and the roasted chicken with asparagus, artichoke and mushrooms.The beef carpaccio (aka "where's the beef" carpaccio) was overwhelmed with arugula, capers and cheese - not much beef on the plate. The beef lacked adequate seasoning and was surprisingly dry. The dish really needed more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour.The mixed green salad was astoundingly bland given the number of ingredients. The apple in the dish was tasteless as if dunked in water for too long. The champagne vinaigrette was indiscernible. Goat cheese had no goatiness (in a good kind of way) or even saltiness.The only thing in that dish that imparted some sort of taste were the lovely scattering of candied hazelnuts.Ravioli, in my mind, was more than al dente - it was definitely undercooked. The filling which was supposed to have mushrooms in it was overwhelmed by the thyme inside and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever.Albeit, the skin of the chicken was nice and crispy, the breast was dry and overly salty. The lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduction used in the sauce. The sauce was unpleasantly odd and overwhelmed the vegetables. You couldn't taste the mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes. It was a very unsuccessful dish.Finally dessert. I looked for redemption on the last course of panna cotta and gelato/sorbetto selection. What I found was the complete lack of thought in these dishes.The panna cotta was okay - perhaps a little too much on the gelatinous side but fine. When served over the berry soup, the sweetness of the panna cotta made the berry soup overly sour. The same thing happened with the gelato and sorbetto. They served vanilla bean gelato with two sorbets - passionfruit and peach. When you took a bite of gelato then taste the sorbet, your mouth puckered like you emptied a bag of Sour Kids in there. Individually, each ice cream was okay...it's just the combination made no sense. There was obviously very little consideration put into composing this dish - a recurring theme at the restaurant.Given the poor quality and exorbitant pricing, this place rates a 2.

Sometimes I wonder about Yelp reviewers.I say that because the reviews for this restaurant are almost unanimously excellent. But that's just not the reality.It's not that the food is bad. It's not bad at all. It's just not outstanding. There's nothing amazing about this place. It's small and cramped and the menu is miniscule,In fact, everything about Parma Pastavino is small, except the prices. My linguine frutti de mare was fine; with fresh clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp...but for $28? Hello?(By the way: if you check the online menu, the prices are about 35% higher when you get to the actual restaurant:...nice bait and switch Chef Marc!)Those kind of prices are comparable to Ferraro's...but there it's actually worth it, being a more beautiful and informed restaurant.And another of my pet peeves: how can any self-respecting restaurant not invest in a reverse osmosis water filtration system for their tap  water. Everyone knows that vegas water is some of the worst in the nation! And I'm not just talking about the water in your glass...don't forget that they use the same water to cook the pasta, rice and anything else that's boiled.My family loves Chef Marc.  He had a restaurant on Tenaya & W Lake Mead Blvd that closed a couple of years ago.  We didn't realize he opened a place on Buffalo & Washington....as soon as I heard that he did, I took the Better Half to dinner here.We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Chef Marc himself at the door.  The place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurant.....we politely declined as we prefer a regular table.  We told him we'd prefer to have a glass of wine while we waited for our table.....we're patient.  My Wife told him that we came here to have his Portobello Mushroom & Organic Spinach appetizer (one of our favorites from the old joint)....he said he'd check to see if he could make it.While we waited, we had a glass of Sangiovese wine....it was pretty good....don't remember any other piece of info as it was suggested by Chef Marc and we ordered based on his recommendation.After a 10 minute wait, we were seated....not too bad for not having reservations.  While I perused the menu, I noticed that the Portobello Mushroom appetizer wasn't on there....I wondered if we would get it.  I ordered a Bufalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad to start with Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce for an entree.....the Better Half ordered the Escargot Appetizer for her meal counting on the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer to show up.We were pleasantly surprised to see the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer show up.....it was one of our favorite dishes from his old joint and here it was!  It was just as good as we remembered!  The sauce was rich and creamy and the Organic Spinach was fresh and went well with the entire dish.  A few minutes later the Bufalo Caprese Salad arrived....it was a large portion that could have easily been split between 2 people.  The Mozzarella & Tomatoes were fresh and it was A-1 Grade Goodness!For a second glass of wine we ordered a glass of Zinfandel...don't remember the vintage or vineyard.The entrees showed up and I was eager to try the Gnocchi.....it didn't disappoint!  The sweet flavor of the Sweet Potato went perfectly with the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce....I was in Heaven!  Wifey enjoyed her Escargot.....we couldn't believe it was only $9!Overall, we had an awesome time.Will I return?  Hells Ya!I am by no means a "fine dining" type of person. I don't appreciate small plates of food that cost about 30 dollars a plate and you don't leave full. Chef Marc's is definitely not one of those places where you leave hungry, BUT the quality of the food is top notch as well as the service. I left Chef Marc's full, but maybe we should start back at the beginning. It was a busy Saturday night and they had large parties in so they were unable to accommodate us until 8pm, which was fine since we had a late lunch. Walking inside you realize that its a small, but cozy place. There's an area with couches that you can hang out with your friends and drink wine and eat good food. We were seated right away and Chef Marc came up and introduced himself. He told us about the menu and the specials of the evening. The one that caught my attention was the "boooofalo mozzarella", mussels and the uni fettuccine. They were out of uni so that was a no go. We decided to start with the Buffalo Mozzarella. It was delicious! The mozzarella was unlike any other mozzarella (creamy as Chef Marc had described it). The tomatoes were paired perfectly with the cheese. I'm not a tomato person usually, but these tomatoes were pretty dang awesome. The table next to us had ordered the Antipasto salad, so that sold me too. It was a huge heaping portion of awesomeness. I was already a bit stuffed after all that, but I couldn't resist trying the Veal Loin Strip and the Papperdelle Bolognese. The veal caught my eye, but I should remember from now on that I've never had veal that blew me out of this world. The veal was good and paired with kale, but it definitely was not my favorite. I guess not everything can be my favorite. The Papperdelle Bolognese was my favorite though. YUMMY freshly made pasta with yummy meaty tuscan style sauce. I could eat those noodles over and over again. Yum! Chef Marc came by after our meal and asked us how everything was. Our server (sorry he was overpowered by Chef Marc) was very attentive also. With a meal like this we had to have dessert.....one cannoli please. My fiancé had asked about the rum cake and the server was kind enough to give us a complimentary slice. Cannoli filling was delicious! The shell they don't make in house, I thought it was still delicious, but the fiancé thought it should be a tad bit crispier. Rum cake, maybe not my cup of tea but it was still good. Do I love Chef Marcs? Yes....service was awesome, food was great and I left full. For everything that we ordered plus tip, it was a 100 dollars well spent.  I can't wait to be back and ready to try other things. BTW they can "course" out the pasta and "protein" dish if you decide to go the way we did, so that each person can have their own individual plate.Been here several times now for lunch and once for dinner. Found this place while driving in the area. Doesn't look like much from outside but believe me, this place still got me grinning from ear to ear!..Recommendations:Italian Bread with butter (included) - Always fresh and a nice starter every time..Spaghetti Bolognese Pork: Fresh Pasta (made in house), little chunks of sausage, little chopped cubes of carrots and their red sauce.. The pasta was Incredible, sauce was like butter with some aromatic and delicious olive oil  and an excellent balance of tomato sweetness and tart that was sure to more than satisfy!.. Spaghetti Zucchini Pomodoro: Fresh Pasta, thick slices of zucchini, herbs, red sauce.... 99% of the time, I order pasta with some type of meat (meatballs, sausage, beef, chicken..), this time I decided to go meatless.. WOW!!!!! Seriously, this was Beyond Anything I expected.. One of The Best Pasta Anything I've Ever Ate!  Meat Lasagna: Fresh slices of pasta in between layers of meat, sauce, ricotta.. Rich in flavor, got that creaminess to it and definitely filling. Should fill up 2 hungry people and have leftovers.. Rum Cake: Definitely had that rum liqour  fragrance, moistness and taste that will send you off to dessert bliss! Nothing too Fancy, Just Rumtastic!The first time I dined here, I was so impressed that I almost stayed to have dinner right after a late lunch.. Like Back to Back Meals!! Every night, the chef comes in and decides what will be on the menu for that particular night. So next time, So and so dish might not show up again or at least for a while.. The service was great every visit, lunch prices awesome, dinner prices average and the ambiance very comforting and a tad elegant the same time. Aside from the typical bench, table/chair dining, they also got couches/coffee table seating as well. *Most importantly*, Both Spaghetti entrees mentioned above deserve Much More than a 5 Star Praise!!!!! They Really Set A New Standard In My Book: On How Pasta Should Taste Like!!!!!By far one of the best places to grace Las Vegas in a long time. I know that many people talk about the chefs on the Strip, but I purposely avoided that route for my friends bachelor party. At first, people were complaining about how we had to detour from the row of lights to go to dinner, but they quickly shut up after we began our gastronomical journey. Any special occasion can only be made better with a visit to Chef Marc's Parma. I was lucky enough to tag along with some Yelpers and have been hooked on this restaurant ever since. Call in advance and specify that you want to participate in a chef's table. For $50, a five course meal is a steal. An additional $20 more, there is an option for wine pairing. With a week notice, chef will be able to set up a marvelous spread. Long gone are the days where a chef tries to fill you up on bread and cheap ingredients. Chef even got upset that someone had given us bread. I had specified that one friend was allergic to pine nuts and melon. Another to pineapple, almonds, and does not eat pork. Chef said no problem and I was relieved. This was my second chance to experience a meal from this creative genius. He started us off with some sliced prosciutto before our first course. We were in for a real treat when we found out that chef brought out the pizza oven on a Sunday night. Not only did we get a classic margherita but a walnut pesto pizza as well. This was a creative way around our friend's allergy. Then the second course came at us with no warning. A sampler platter of perfectly grilled octopus, shrimp, sausage, and red snapper surrounding a bed of apple salad tossed in a citrus dressing. Already, some were ready to admit that the drive was worth it. Now slowing down, Chef came out again to explain what he had in store for us. Two words: LOBSTER RAVIOLIS! That was our pasta course. The al dente stuffed goodness was filled with the crustacean and came with a marscapone cream sauce. For many, it could have ended here and we would have received a meal worthy of $50. An Italian meal without a protein? Unheard of. Stepping outside of the box to provide us with a truly unique experience, we were presented with Veal Cheek served on polenta with German red cabbage. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was similar to an Osso Bucco sauce. Each component complimented each other so well. By this time we were all stuffed. Yet it did not end there. For dessert, chef sent out a french toast served with fresh bananas and berries topped with a Marsala wine sauce. Ambrosial! Still not enough? The groom to be and I had opted for the wine pairing. I had attended a wine tasting some time ago and came across a beautiful dessert wine that I had nearly forgot about until I took a sip here. Although our waiter prefaced that the wine didn't go with the dessert, I was happy to taste the Donald Ziraldo dessert wine again. At this point, I could not hold it in any longer and had to gloat. BOOYAH! All of the skeptics could eat it, because this meal was sensational.At last I visited Parma with Diane to order off the menu for my first non-group dining experience here.  Parma Salad with arugula, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, black and green olives, walnuts, Parmesan Cheese, tomatoes, and a delicious Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing was very good.  A saucy Neapolitan Margarita Pizza from the outside mobile oven on Pizza Night Wednesday was a nice appetizer, with just a little char on the bottom.  It was tasty but my favorite Margarita Pizza is still the one served at Postrio.  Pasta Fagiola Soup took a long time to reach me from the kitchen, but it was well worth the wait. The homemade broth and long-simmering beans, little tubes of pasta, basil, and tomato with a little bite to it, made this a simple but really classic bean soup!  The beans melted in the mouth, and the soup was even better accompanied by excellent crackling Italian bread and butter.   Nicely pounded veal with a sweet Marsala Sauce and delectable mushrooms had a little kick to it but was delicious, accompanied by a side of handmade bent Penne with Chef Marc's wonderful Sunday Sauce and good baby green beans that were a bit crunchier than I prefer.  Diane's side of Gnocchi made from scratch was also filling and delicious.Service from a very capable and efficient staff was personable and hopping!  I was glad that I had made a dinner reservation, because the restaurant was filled to near capacity when we were there, yet we were seated immediately.  Chef Marc came by and engaged with many of his customers, and near the beginning of our meal brought us complimentary Fried Squash Blossoms that were pleasing dipped in a tasty mild Marinara Sauce also provided.The ambiance of this place is rustic and clearly informal southern Italian.  But when we were present on this night we also seemed to share a special bond with our fellow diners, all of whom were strangers to us.  It seemed like all were repeat customers who looked forward to another memorable meal produced under the direction of the charismatic and talented Chef Marc.  So, an aura of excitement and fellowship was in the air, which added to the overall enjoyment of our dining experience.This will not be our last visit here, for sure!If Chef Marc's were any better it would be on the front lines entertaining the troops, kicking taliban ass, while rebuilding local infrastructure and giving local children education. But wait it doesnt stop there. It would also come home a glorified war hero and help rebuild the American Economy and finally just FINALLY get rid of all today's shitty ass music and possibly resurrect Tupac...Anyway i never been here before but often hear the raves of Chef Marc and how totally awesome is it. Lately i've been hankering for some good Italian food. So i set up a UYE http://www.yelp.com/biz/tien-hosted-a-uye-uye-at-parma-by-chef-marc-las-vegas10 people all going for tasting menus with some opting for wine paring. I'm not exactly a wine kinda guy so just food for me. Tho their italian beers were quite nice.Cant exactly remember what we all ate but it was good. Damn good. If i wore panties they'd be dropped by the 3rd course. Oh and holy crap the bread is NICE!!! with the garlic butter on top and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil...sooooo niceSo going off of memory lets see what we had1 - Conch Salad - Very good texture, soft and not rubbery and oh so tender. Flavor was a little off for me but it opted a good opportunity to use the "real" salt they offered. Balanced quite nicely after that2 - Escargot (our special diet friends who opted not to have escargot got some kind of ravioli) - Two per person served on a slice of bread drenched in garlic butter with some herbs. Not exactly the freshest snails available but they did their best with what they had and it was no less then absolutely delicious 3 - Fried Brussels sprouts with some kind of spicy prawn - I've only eaten brussel sprouts on a handful of occasions. These were halfed then fried to give them a nice flavor. The spicy prawns...wow just wow these were nice and plump and had a mild rising heat to them. Again quite nice4 - Pasta with wild mushrooms in some kinda sauce with ham in it - Pappardelle Wild Mushroom- LoL at my naming of items. This was the highlight of my dinner. The absolute best thing in my opinion. Pretty sure it was fresh pasta seeing as i've never seen noodle that big only on TV. The sauce they whipped up to bind the pork and mushrooms together with the noodles...genius...Ask Christie O i kept trying to steal her togo box the entire night.5 - Some kind of fish... - Wild Snapper Livornese- Some kind of fish and a portion of a barley like grain served with a tomato based sauce and a few strips of broccolini. 6 - Dessert - Turamisu and Chocolate Mousse Cake - Holy crap the little square of Tiramisu was orgasmic. The other chocolate cake thingie was good but holy hell the tiramisu...I have finally discovered Chef Marc's...Now they will have to discover a way to keep me away.Parma is delicious!  We stopped in for dinner and had no idea what to expect. There was seating on either side of the restaurant and then some couches and tables in the middle. We chose to sit at a half booth/table. The meal started off with complimentary garlic bread. I could have been fine with just eating the bread! It was hot, soft and some of the best I have ever had. I let the server know that and I was given a loaf to go at the end of the meal!They have a lunch and dinner menu. The dinner menu is basically salads, soups and pasta. The dishes range in price and the average pasta price was between $12-$18. There were some items on the menu that cost more. I was craving a sandwich and asked if they could make on even though it was the dinner menu.  The server checked and said I could order any of the cold sandwiched but not hot. That was perfect because I wanted a cold anyway. I ordered "The Parma". It had assorted imported Italian meats and cheeses. They have 2 sizes and I chose the smaller one and that was only $6.50! There was no masking the flavor this sandwich offered. The meat and cheeses had such wonderful taste. I will for sure order this again!The inside was very clean and the service was excellent. We would only take a couple drinks of our soda and it was being refilled.On Wednesday nights the server said they have pizza and only on that night. I'm going back to try that next!Parma is one of those places where the food is so good that if it fell on the floor, I'd still eat it. No 10 second rule.No shame.I would legit, scrape everything off of the floor and eat it.Because it would still be better than 90% of the food being slopped around in Las Vegas restaurants, some of which has fallen on the floor without your knowledge.Parma looks like it might be a chain restaurant-the sign is generic and it's in this tiny strip mall, sharing space with a Trader Joe's and a K-Mart, but outside of that, there is nothing generic or conventional about it. Step inside and the setting is kind of romantic with low lighting, intimate seating and a cozy lounge. You'll forget that someone rushing to get toilet paper at K-Mart almost just mowed you down in the parking lot.The food here is something to be celebrated. The menu here is a combination of main staples and specials of the day which keeps things fresh and interesting. More importantly, everything here just tastes like love! Who says that? I just said it! I brought my mom here, the pickiest eater I've ever met besides the 9 year old I nannied for in college, and she had not one complaint. Only the second time this has happened....in my life. On our visit, we had the beet salad which was enough to split between two people. The beets were fresh and we got a variety of colors which made for a pretty presentation. The dressing that came with it was simple but really brought all of the flavors of the salad together. My mom got some kind of cod and I got the pork chop "el chico" which was basically an enormous, quality pork chop with a sweet/hot pepper sauce. Like I said, my mom is the worst dining companion ever because she hates everything, but she  liked her fish so much that she was making audible noises of satisfaction when eating, which was embarrassing and satisfying at the same time. (I love to say "I told you so" when it comes to picking restaurants.)I know some would consider it blasphemy to go to a place like this and not order pasta, but I didn't on my first visit. So when I came back with some friends, I dipped into their pasta selection with chicken riggies, ravioli and wild mushroom papardelle. It was hard to pick a favorite, but because I am partial to meat in my pasta, I was really surprised by how flavorful and complex the papardelle was-so amazing! I've had freshly made pasta before, but Parma has the best execution, cooking the pasta to perfection and not over or under-saucing it.  The staff is friendly and eager to share recommendations. They have a decent wine list and if you have a favorite you'd rather bring instead the corkage fee is only $10! What I like so much about this place is that their non-pasta dishes shine just as much as their pasta dishes- so hard to find when it comes to Italian food.  I'm so excited to have found a place that just loves to make incredible food as much as I love to eat it and can't wait to go back!Having just returned from Italy, I was excited to try Parma; very high yelp ratings, a video explaining how they are so authentic, a passionate chef.  Grab a couple of hungry poker buds, order a ton of food and...Papardelle Bolognese - sheets of perfectly cooked hand made pasta drowned in a thick, meaty, sweet and acidic Bolognese drizzled with olive oil.Me:  "What a waste of really good pasta. It's drowned in sauce".Them:  "This is great.  Lots of meat".Shrimp Fra Diavolo - Large, sweet, properly cooked shrimp with a spicy aribata sauce on pasta with broccolini.Me:  "Why are these on the same plate?  Primi, secondi, and contorno served together?"Them:  "Everything taste so good together"Fiori di zucca (Tuscan classic, batter coated, deep fried zucchini flowers) with marinara sauce?  Me:  "What the?  Marinara sauce?  It's supposed to be served plain so you can taste the sweet, vegetal flower and enjoy the richness of the oil and crunch of the coating".Them:  "Man, these are so good.  The more sauce the better".Authentic Italian? No way!  What's wrong with calling it Italian STYLE cuisine?  Don't misunderstand, I think the food is excellent. Market driven menu that constantly evolves.  Outstanding Italian inspired sandwiches.  The Bologna with a great imported mortadella, provolone and drizzle of red wine vinaigrette that brings out the sweetness of the mortadella and milkiness of the cheese; Excellent.  The Campania  with fresh mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, fresh tomato, and a balsamic vinaigrette; a vegetarian's delight.Good, friendly service.  Trattoria wine list, well chosen simple wines at reasonable prices.Them:  "Are you enjoying yourself?"Me:  "Heck yeah!"  Living life, having a loud, jovial argument about food, kickin it with good company.  Maybe this place is more Italian than I thought.I gave this place five stars originally, as our first visit was tremendous. The food, no matter what, is amazing. The service, however, depends entirely upon one person (Diane).We have been five times. As I say, the first time was amazing... outstanding food, a very inviting atmosphere, and impeccable service from our waitress, Diane.The last four times have convinced us never to enter the restaurant unless Diane is there. The "gentleman" who seems to manage the place during the day time is so aloof and downright rude that you leave the restaurant upset that you gave anyone there any money.On our last dining experience two groups--one on each side of us--both expressed the same sentiments. The staff during the day is horrible, and it affects the entire experience of dining.It is a shame, Chef Marc, that you do not have better people representing your restaurant. Let me say this to you and to everyone considering dining here: if Diane is there, you will love this place. If she is not, you will despise it... despite the incredible efforts of the kitchen staff.I won't be going back for a considerable time, and never during the daytime.I was at Parma once before to enjoy one of Nelson Q.'s UYE with Chef Marc.  This time my wife and I came after a dance program for an early dinner.  In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.By the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorfulFor desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!Tracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group.This is a lunch review, so please bear in mind that they have a lunch menu that is different than the dinner menu!I was having a lunch meeting today on the West side and as my office is on the East side, original plan was to go middle to PF Chang... Hmmm I said, let me see what I can cook up as a  unique dining experience vs. high end Panda Express....Thankfully, a bunch of yelpers have recommended Parma and after reading Rod U's review and everyone's review, I was ready to rock and roll!First thing of course I discovered is that the menu for dinner which most reviewers discussed is not same as dinner.  Here are my thoughts.a.  Location - 4 star - Not bad considering I don't venture in this area.  Easy to get to right off the Summerlin Pkwy Buffalo Drive exit.  Plenty of parking in a nondescript strip mall.b.  Ambiance - 4 star - When I first walked in, it felt more like a deli compared to a restaurant like Nora's or something, but it was both funky and cool at same time. Reminded me of a coffee shop, a deli, a cafe, and a small restaurant all in one.c.  Service - I will say this is 5+ star.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable and very accommodating. They know their stuff and what the kitchen can do, so it makes it very cool to talk about the menu. d.  Menu - 4 star - their lunch menu features a few salads, antipasta, home made pasta, sandwiches both hot and cold, some soups.  I was so eager to try some of the yelping good ideas that I asked our waiter about what specials.  He quickly said that they can whip up some Linguine with Clams and / or Shrimp far diavolo.  We ordered this and some side salads.e.  Food - 5 star - The best thing started when I said, hey since both the pastas are not on the lunch menu, we will try it and can we split it.  Quickly the waiter said that since one was a red sauce and one was white, that it would not mix well and so when we said how about the spaghetti bolognese, he said PERFECT.  I have to say, the waiter, Mark I think handled this just right! Both dishes were fantastic.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and a bit smaller diameter compared to normal spaghetti pasta. I liked the texture and the feel when you were stuffing it all in your mouth.  It had the COMFY feeling!!!  The side salads were recommended and they were the right size and had just a bit of spiciness and it was perfect.f. Je ne sais quoi - 5 star +++ - This place has that "je ne sais quoi" , that "I don't know what" factor. It is the confidence in the kitchen, the knowledge of the staff, the coolness of funky ambiance of the restaurant, the home made pasta.  I am not sure but all of this combined makes for a most awesome experience!I will be coming back for lunch as it is so cool and relaxing.  I am also excited to come fo dinner with my wife as she loves Italian inspired food and so I cannot wait to try the dinner menu.GK says, if you are around for lunch, check this place out!What's good enough for Nic Cage is good enough for me.Have been here twice now, both for lunch.   First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.Well that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  To go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+Refills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.I promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)Called Marc (doesn't deserve the title Chef IMO anymore) tonight to talk about the dinner the other night! He was rude right off the bat and said that other help wouldn't serve us and that he comped he meal! BS!! he gave us the chicken Parma to take home! Didn't come to the table when his under trained staff screwed up a few times!! Wrong food brought tl the table. Etc. I've been there maybe 7-8 times since moving here and only one other time there was an issue with the chicken Parma. But the food wasn't the problem it was that blad so called server screwed up and forgot to put the order in!!! Diana and the Asian server has always been A+!!! The blad guy can go work at mc Donald's!!! But to Marc! I've been raised in family Resturants and know the business much better than you!!! Why did you raise the prices at the pizza joint and start making the pizzas smaller? POOR MANAGEMENT!! Period. YOU NEED TO TSKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR SHORT COMINGS!!! You are a poor business man and just remember Karma boy!!! Now we will go find another place to spend our money at! Bottom line you disrespected me on the phone and will NEVER GO BACK TO YOUR OVER PRICED STRIP MALL PLACE!! Plus I make a better chicken parm also!! And to think I wanted to work at the new place? Now I also see why your turnover at the pizza joint is like it is!!! A POOR BUSINESS MAN IS NOT WHAT ANYONE WANTS TO WORK FOR!!!Believe the hype. I stopped here for lunch with my husband before we continued on with our errands for the day. It is a cozy place with a neighborhood vibe. There is a deli and cheese counter in the front, along with a rack of specialty Italian ingredients and sauces for sale in the back of the restaurant. We actually picked up some stuff there because my sister in law and her husband were coming to visit from Italy and had promised us a home cooked Italian meal.We chose to split the Antipasti salad that was prepared with a generous assortment of meat and cheese from the deli case. The salad was fresh and plentiful for the price of $12.00. We also split the very hearty Italian meat sandwich which only  comes in large (most of the sandwiches you have the option between regular and large). This was a monster of a sandwich with juicy beef, melted provolone and mozzarella cheese topped with pepperocinis. As delicious as it was, I could only handle about quarter of the sandwich. The husband happily annihilated the rest of it. The service was friendly and this made for a perfect break in our busy day.Parma has been one of our favorites for a long time... but now I'm not sure if we'll ever return. This review covers two visits, one in March and again tonight.In March, our food took an hour to arrive and only then because we had started asking what the hold up was. The food was okay, nothing memorable, but the 60+ minute wait was. Because of that, we didn't hurry back.Tonight was 45+ minutes and our order wasn't lost. Our server, Kay, almost totally ignored us the entire time. We had to ask another server for soda refills after she ignored them and us for too long. Kay did ask Hubby if his steak was cooked correctly, which it was, then didn't return until we finally got her attention. My food, a Jidori chicken dish, was inedible. The sauce was good but the chicken was dry and boring. She took it off the bill after I refused to wait another 45 minutes for something else. Hubby's peppercorn steak was abysmal, he said, but we paid for it and got out.One bad experience could be a fluke. Two? Marc must not care about this restaurant any longer.I was browsing the pictures on Yelp before I arrived and all of the pasta dishes looked amazing. I came in on a Tuesday morning, right before noon. When the waitress dropped off the menu, I was incredibly disappointed that the menu was drastically different from what was pictured. Turns out that all the dishes I had my eye on were only served at dinner. To top it off, the dinner menu items are not offered at all during lunch. I ordered the chicken parmesan, which came with a side of spaghetti. The chicken had a tang to it. I wasn't sure if it was a lemony marinade or if the chicken was bad. But I ate it.  The side spaghetti was just ok. I wouldn't order it by itself.I had a taste of my husband's eggplant parmesan and that was a lot better. A little salty for my taste, but better than that funky chicken.I was so excited to try this place for dinner. With reviews like Anthony M's, I had some pretty high expectations. And it started off pretty good... Chef Marc has a fantastic presence and warm welcoming personality. I do really appreciate the personal attention. He comes by all the tables to talk personally to the diners, making recommendations and talk about the food. I loved that! But ultimately I came here to eat. And the food, while it sounded amazing, was just not THAT great. Was the chicken parm good? Yes, it was. And the portion was very generous. All good things, but it was definitely not the best chicken parm I've had in LV. And the side pasta, sad to say, was like chef-boyardee. Chef Marc also initially told us about the black linguini he had that he could make with Linguini and Clams. However, there was no black linguini :( The linguini and clams dish itself was overly salty. Overall, no one was particularly impressed with their dishes. Decor was homey.Service was aaaiiiiight.

I think the fact that...A) my boobs are realB) my style is very untrashy/un-stripperishC) I don't have nappy hair extensionsD) my IQ is higher than my cup size...equates to why I did not care for American Junkie. My friend and I got there around 10:30 on Saturday night and the line was pretty long. Luckily because we were just two girls (the rest of our group was already inside), we got to go to special "girls only" line. Ooooo, how VIP. Luckily one of our friends inside didn't want to stay, so I got my friend and I each a mixed drink to wash down quickly. Mixed drinks are $7 which is typical of OTS.All told, I was at American Junkie for about 20 minutes, but in those 20 minutes...wow, did I do some amazing people watching. The people watching is the only reason I could see to come to this place. I do have three suggestions as a result of said fantastic people watching:1) Guys - put the hair gel down! Seriously most girls think spiked hair is...well...douchey.2) Girls - if you have fake boobs, please don't concave your back to stick your fake boobs out more. We all know they are fake just by looking at them. Sticking them out and then looking at them all night does not make them appear more real.3) Girls - if you are wearing short shorts or a barely there jean skirt, wear a more modest top. We don't need to see boobs and butt; just one is more than enough thanks.I'm only giving this place three stars but I actually like it. I've been many times now so I feel like I can give a pretty good assessment of how it works... Here's the deal: it's trying to be Studio 54 in the 1970s under the guise of table reservations. There are two lines. The lines for the nobodies and groups of dudes (sheepishly raises hand) and the line for the douchy frat brothers of the bouncers and the ladies who blow them or steal blow from them. In fairness, the door guy for the nobody line is pretty cool as he remembered me when I left and came back out of a sea of douchebauchery he'd seen that night and I always have plenty of time to talk to him as I wait, like an asshole. As an aside, I don't have a very high opinion of the typical Scottsdale bimbo/DB. Someday, I'll write about my crazy night with G-girl who has gained a certain amount of dirtoriety on the Dirty.com. To sum it up, I spend the better part of a night with her, save her from a skeazy rickshaw driver and she never asked my name. They are typically very attractive, which is what they focus all of their energy on so it makes sense. But goddamn are they vapid. I find it hard to believe... In fact, I don't believe they're even half as stupid as they try to appear to be but the personal glory they achieve in the Fembot department is completely mind blowing. All body, no soul.Anyway, the line situation they have is made for the cool kids to be cool and the people like me to remember that my place, my home, is in Phoenix, 85003. Represent! Inside, nothing is notable except for the wheel. Girls dance on the bar and spin the wheel. And it's fun to watch because: 1) they have on short skirts 2) if they're wearing pants the chances of them at least being pulled down is high. I'm a cheap thrills guy. And that's a wrap!At least American Junkie is honest. By including the word "junkie" in their title, they let you know up front that they are a manifestation of the word. Also spelled as "junky" this adjective can be defined as - "having the quality (or being like) junk, cheap or of low quality" - and it perfectly describes everything about this place.The laughably long line of people waiting to get in on a Fri/Sat night? Junky.The bouncers? Unbelievably Junky.The patrons you meet once you finally get inside the bar? Junky.The food? Junky.The too crowded bar area? Junky.The wait to get one measly drink? Junky.The service? Junky.The wait staff that is more concerned about their looks than their tables? Junky.The dance floor filled with d-bags and wannabes? Junky.Unfortunately, I've been here more than once (not voluntarily as once was more than enough) and I always have a junky time. I don't like to waste my time doing junky things as Scottsdale has so much more to offer, and I also don't like buying junky things. Basically, it comes down to the fact that I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars at a place that continually promotes a junky atmosphere and junky customer service.Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's, but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business. Like almost everyone else who showed up early, I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate. What I found instead, was that the management lied, (they even admitted it to our faces), and guys were now $20 to get in. (girls would be $10 after 10)Half our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs, coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long. Am I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer? Maybe. I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons. They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway. WHY?? Why was I even there and why did I give them my business? Never again.Oh, and the inside was packed like sardines. They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right, getting a drink was hopeless, and bathroom lines were a half hour long. People were hopping the fence to get in, sick and tired of the line outside. But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anyway.We stayed till midnight, thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website, and pass out flutes of champagne. Nope.This would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix. I know it's just a bar, but honestly people, we need to hold places accountable for deception. My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined... and half our party left, fed up with the situation.Don't go to American Junkie... it is just that, junk.

I love Teppanyaki. It is always good fun and usually good food. I have been to several different places and I some how always end up back at the "B" because other places just don't compare. The cook that we had was just okay. He rushed cooking our meal and was mumbling the whole time. It sounded like he was trying to be entertaining but his voice was so low that you could barely hear him because the fan for the grill was so loud. Before we knew it the food was all cooked and he was on his way.  I overheard him tell another table he works there 6 days a week. It was probably his Friday so he was ready to go home. As for the food...I must say that the miso soup and salad they serve prior to you main meal was excellent. The dressing in the salad was super good (I mean pick up the bowl and drink the dressing good).  The filet and shrimp for my main course was just right. He was right on with how I like my steak, juicy. They also serve veggies which is a mixture of mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, broccoli, onions and zucchini. I don't like how the serve it all together, I would prefer them separate so I can tell them what I don't like otherwise it's wasted food. The fried rice that I paid an extra 2.50 for was horrible. It was mushy and devoured with soy sauce. I don't like that I pay extra money for something that turns out to be botched. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. She gets a gold star. Overall, this place has potential. Maybe I'll try another cook next time.

Review Text :
Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, I wanted to find a different place to eat sushi for evening other than my usual sushi bar.  Since this place is somewhat near our house, we stopped in for an early dinner.The bar area is quite nice, overall decor very comforting and natural.  I loved the fact that the place was basically all ours for the hour we were there.  The menu is great--simple and with some great options done differently.  Their amaebi, for example, includes the deep fried fish heads along with the two pieces of sushi.  I personally love sucking on a few shrimp heads, because that's where all the flavor is.  It was great.We ordered all the yakitori skewers, 4 types, and it came with 2 skewers each.  Thinking they were the small yakitori, we didn't think it would be a lot to order for dinner. Oh my.  These skewers are pretty big, so majority of our dinner were the appetizers.  It was great!  The sauce was yummy and the meats were cooked well.  As for the shrimp ones, I didn't eat the shrimp.  I feel that shrimp should ALWAYS be cleaned because that black line is poop, and I don't eat poop.  That was a no-no for me, and therefore a deduction of 1 star on my review.As for the rest, we tried their sushi, all perfectly portioned and the fish was great.  Their sauces are very good at this restaurant, everything from their cucumber salad, tempura dip, to the sauce they put on their yellowtail.  Oh and their tempura is crispy and light, too.  We loved it.I think this place, despite its location being right next to the 215 on W. Cheyenne, is a really good sushi bar.  We plan to go back this week to try the rest of the menu.  If you want a road trip within city limits, try this place.  I know that they serve the same special rolls as any other sushi bar, but their sauces and talent make for a great night.  Plus their website says that it's 20% off after 9pm to midnight.  Great sushi, excellent service, and I'll definitely be back for more.Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything. Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions. Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message! Im still trying to get the hang of eating sushi! Thanks Sushi Bomb for being gentle!I came back to edit my post. I had an extremely negative comment about how they had a waiter that was mean to the customers and that I wouldn't be returning because of his service. However, since then they have fired that waiter and the restaurant has done a complete 180.They have always had good food, no one every doubted that, but their service was rude. Now the service is great and you can actually enjoy the food! Sometimes the rolls can be a little too big and hard to eat, but my boyfriend asked if they could make them a little smaller so they were easier to eat and they happily did, it came out with more pieces that were smaller so it was the same amount of food. I'm sure we'll be back a lot because they are extremely close by and we do love their sushi, and now that they have fixed the service issue nothing gets in the way of enjoying that food. Highlight: lunch special all you can eat is only $20. :D

Review Text :
Want to visit Africa in Phoenix? Head to 7th Ave. and Campbell for authentic West African food in a small and warm setting.Located in what could have been any one of countless styles of restaurant before becoming Bantu Bistro, this intimate eatery offers African fare that is accessible to even the most timid eaters.For starters, Bantu offers hot wings, tomato fried chicken and one other chicken dish that I cannot recall. The remainder of the menu is comprised of a variety of African stews and meat dishes that can be made with goat, chicken or beef. I had the groundnut stew (basically spicy peanut soup) with goat (per our lovely waitress's recommendation) and was not disappointed. With my stew, I chose a side of fufu (basically a mix of potatoes and cornmeal that tasted something like instant mashed potatoes without enough milk). When i put some of the soup on top of the fufu for flavoring, it became more enticing (nevertheless I might order the potatoes, rice or plantains for a side if I were to return). The goat, if you have never enjoyed this meat, was something like a tougher version of lamb. The Bistro does not list any desserts on its menu, but I did not inquire about it either. I have difficulty remembering anything on the menu that was more than $9. My friend and I had two stews with goat, a starter of tomato fried chicken and two imported beers. Our total, with tax, came to $33.Service was attentive and friendly. Upon leaving, the chef/owner (who has lived in the Valley for a number of years after moving from Africa) greeted my entire party, shook our hands and promised to provide us with a special treat (some sort of beans, he said) upon return. I'll be looking forward to it!I was really excited to try Bantu Cafe's West African food in the location of the former Melrose Cafe. It is a charming little place, outdoor seating, brightly decorated with traditional African art and sculptures decorating the walls and shelves. A stereo places African pop and Reggae. The menu consists of meats, chicken, goat, lamb, oxtail, available in curry or a tomato like sauce with mixed vegetables. You get your choice of sides like garlic potatoes, fufu, plantains or rice. The meat in the dishes can be substituted if one is so inclined. There are vegetarian options as well, being a traditional African cuisine, since meat is not always available and something we Westerners take for granted.They serve traditional soups, appetizers and sides as well as the entrees.The staff (one waitress) and owner were both warm and friendly.All in all, it was a good experience and good food. I wouldn't say great, but good. It is definitely worth trying and experiencing. I will be back again.I'm almost always game for an adventure in my mouth, so it was with much anticipation that I attended a UYE at Bantu Bistro. Fifteen of us ended up showing, which is a) a great turn-out and b) potentially disastrous, both for those of us eating and those preparing/serving the food. BB is my Little Engine That Could, because faced with that challenge our servers remained calm and courteous. Upon reading the menu, I immediately knew I was going to get the goat because I've not had goat before. And since I've also never eaten West African food I threw caution into the wind. While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, the first wave of us ordered drinks, as we are prone to do. We ended up finishing off some of the choices (beers, mostly, that weren't stocked to accommodate a large drinking crowd*) . By the time our full crew had arrived, I think that 2 or 3 beer choices were off the list. So, on the the eats. Now, keep in mind there were 15 people there, and we pretty much ordered something different off the menu, all of which include the "African spices." Each entree comes with one meat (chicken, goat, ox tail, shrimp...) and two sides (fufu, rice, potatoes and plantains). We were served complementary fried plantains with a lovely dipping sauce. Our entrees came fairly close to one another, however my goat was prepared as curried instead of plain. But that's okay, because it was good. While nothing in the flavor jumped out and smacked me in the throat, I have to admit that I over season and heavily salt everything and a lifetime of this has desensitized my taste buds. Authentic ethnic foods don't always have an explosion of flavors but rather rely on letting more subtle flavors mingle in the palatte. Sounds like a lot of moaning for achieving four stars, one might say. To which I would call as my justification: == I was rather full by the time I was half through my entree == free hot beans were brought to use during our meal. While I cannot recall the name of these, they had a peculiar and interesting flavor. I wanted more salt on them but I want more salt on everything--I have to trim that back in my diet == Graciousness is never overrated. The staff and the owner all were appreciative of our business and thanked us several times throughout the evening. == We pretty much took over the dining area and I didn't feel like the staff were concerned about that. == They broke down our bill without adding a gratuity fee, as is customary at most places for large parties. I'm looking forward to returning in a while and hopefully the stocking issue will be resolved and I will have educated myself more on the intricacies of truly authentic African food and flavors. Until then, I wish BB the best of luck and keep up the good work. ____________________________________________ * I personally feel that while the libations of an eating establishment are important--sometimes equally to that of the food--it's also understandable that a newer establishment would chose to emphasise its entree delivery. For this, I can look past the alcohol stocking issue.i will not even pretend to know what west african food tastes like. i read a blurb about what countries west africa encompasses and how southern cooking has heritage from west african cooking.  next i'm not from the south so i will not pretend to know what good southern food is either. lastly from looking at what countries west africa is i can say on a positive note the chef/owner still has all his limbs and was more then likely NOT from Sierra Leon. that's only my speculation really..he might have been a lucky guy.so again not knowing what good west african Cuisine i will not go into some sort of diatribe about how authentic it was or how it was shit because "i lived in west africa for a period". what i had i felt was a good meal. i left full and happy. i was part of a large party of yelpers who in a way sprung ourselves upon the helpless gazelle that is Bantu Bistro like that hungry Lion which is Yelp. the party was about 15 people give or take a few and people started showing up around the designated 6:30 agreed upon meeting time. drinks orders were taken..albeit a bit shaky to start with, the gentlemen who served us seem way out of his comfort zone and was not aware of what beer or wine was available..and since there was no drink menu we all felt that we kinda just had to wing it on beverage requests.after a while of getting all the drinks requested and everyone finally showing up. we all browsed the menu, asked whatever questions we could come up with and settled on our meals. the server took our orders and again..made the best of the situation.about 30 minutes later everyone was chatting each other up and food started to come out. here and there of "who ordered the (insert dinner)" or "which meal did you have" "who had (insert side dish)" finally it seamed as everyone had food in front of them and people started to eat. i ordered the curried Goat with a side of FuFu and Plantains..now i'm not really sure what the hell FuFu is, but all i could think of was Cream of Wheat from a box i had as a child. it was good with my meal, but absolutely tasteless on its own. which i'm not sure how your supposed to eat it anyways. i liked the curried goat. it was basically a stew of goat meat and some vegetables in a curry sauce. not exactly a pantheon of flavors and it certainly was not spicy. but i found it to be comforting and made me feel good inside. plus it's not often i get to eat goat. so the new experience put a smile on my face.i cannot in fairness rate my experience on the service. they were clearly overwhelmed with the size of our group and the business seems like they are still on training wheels. as the only people in the restaurant for the majority of our stay we did have full attention of the staff which was attentive. thank you. thank you Dottsy for the UYEit was nice to meetBaconRobert MHeather CTerry TMaggie (husband Eric)Scott WJason WDavid SBit was nice to see againJulie PMatthewAyeshaKevin (after dinner)and of course Dottsyi honestly hope this place does well. this building has seen way too many tenants fail. i would like to see one success.  good luck Bantu. Sincearly, Arik.PS. the average meal price was $11. so really not that unreasonable. thumbs up.To say our group from Yelp overpowered this small place would be an understatement.  It is not designed for large groups and I think we would have better served ourselves to have ordered in small groups as we arrived and had the food come out in that fashion than try and get all the orders on the table at once.  Part of a UYE is the camaraderie so I am pretty sure staggered serving would not have been a big deal and the food would have been hotter when it arrived.  As it was none of us had a clue what it was supposed to taste like so judgmental we were not.  I had curry goat stew, fufu and rice.  I got the impression this was common folk food, you make a base and toss in what vegetables and meat you have that week.  Sort of like the West African version of comfort food.Our experience from the owner and staff was very positive in my opinion.  Dottsy had made reservations and they had apparently brought in an extra server for the evening.  At one point early it appeared somebody had ordered a drink they were short on ingredients for or maybe the kitchen ran out of something and one of the servers dashed off to the store.  The owner/cook and his staff were bending over backwards to fill every reasonable request.  When the owner was out on the floor you could just feel his enthusiasm for what he was doing.I got out of there feeling full and well taken care of and with a beer, tax and tip I only spent $20.  While I do not think this will be a food often eaten by anybody I know, it and the service should bring enough people in to keep the place open.  One word of caution; if you drive a full sized pick up you can get boxed in if you don't pay attention in advance as to how you are going to get out.You've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? Here's the deal, it would be very easy to come to a place like this and be totally underwhelmed. The flavors and cooking style of West Africa are not very well known to 99.9% of us. The little things like an unhelpful menu and a mediocre wait staff could guarantee a 1 star review for most reviewers. On the other hand they get points for being unique, owner operated, and it was pretty fun to try some food completely different. I mean goat and ox tail, now really, how often do you see that on a menu? The plantain starters were pretty basic, but a nice start. I had the ndole, which I guess was something like an odd version of creamed spinach with chunks of goat in it. ---It tasted better than I described, trust me. The fufu was a let down, that was a close to eating just flower and water. I mean zero flavor. So if you let your guard down, chill out, and want to try some wild and crazy food then I say do it. Other wise stay home and save your scathing one star reviews for Olive Garden.I was a little nervous about what to expect.   I couldn't tell you where west Africa is on a map unless you pointed out east Africa first, much less hazard a guess about the cuisine.  But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.I was with the large group of Yelpers last night.  And let's face it, we can be a difficult bunch to please sometimes.  We can also be a difficult bunch to serve, especially in a small shop such as Bantu that is probably not used to  a crowd such as ours.  Drink orders were a little tricky.  They ran out of several of the beer options.  I believe they only had once choice for red wine.  I had that, and I was disappointed that it had been refrigerated.     However, it was clear that their focus is on the food, not on the libations, and I appreciated that they were able to offer alcoholic beverages.Although one of the servers was unfamiliar with the menu, I was impressed that Bantu actually brought in an additional server to accommodate us.  The staff was so welcoming, and the owner not only cooked his heart out for us, he paid us a visit as well.  I never once felt we were an inconvenience as I have at other events.  The complimentary fried plantains were served with a spicy chili sauce that nicely balanced the sweet, tender plantain.  I opted for the traditional groundnut stew with chicken.  It was a tomato-based stew with mixed vegetables in a rich and nutty sauce, very satisfying.  I was not a fan of the  fufu which I believe was mashed yams and corn.  It reminded me of grits.  I did try a few other bites of my neighbors' dishes and enjoyed them as well.Upon leaving, we were able to just tell the server what we ordered and pay separately.  I thanked her for taking the time to allow us to do this and for coping with the crowd.  She remarked "we love this, it's like a big family."  That is reason enough for me to say, "yay, I'm a fan."

I cannot believe there is only 1 other review of this place. Chicken & Waffles people come on.I was looking for something different last Sunday morning and I remembered seeing this place on MLK.I would agree with the other reviewer about the parking, small awkward and hard to get in & out.It's a small diner with a booth along the entire front wall and several tables. A sign reading "seat yourself" greets you the moment you walk in.The place is small but cozy with a TV in the center so every seat in the house can see it,There is was only 2 servers and a large table there when I arrived so it took a few minutes to get drinks&menus.The menus said stright up "Just Chicken & Waffles"-and thats exactly what it was 2pc-3pc-dark,white,wheat,buttermilk,wha do you want.In small print across the bottom it read "Friday-Sunday BBQ Ribs $10"I asked and she said"nope,chicken & waffles"Well I got 2 breast,2 waffles and my son got the special 3 wings & a waffle.The food came out real fast with hot syrup on the side and we doused our chicken in some hot sauce & tore it up.Why have I never had this before, I bet I never even took a breath.Some of the best chicken I have had. Not all deep fried & greasy or steroided out just sweet crispy & very savory.And the waffles were good too. what a mix.This is a true dive spot DIAMOND!

Located inside the airport in Las Vegas.This place was okay... people just sitting and having drinks, Dave's mom and dad got some beer and wine and we chatted.The place wasn't super busy, and I didn't notice any servers. Considering this is inside the airport it is a tad pricey.For the love of God would they please close this disaster of a restaurant and open up something like a Chick fil -A or even a McDonalds. A Waffle House would be an upgrade! Yeah, it's that bad. Most airport food options suck, but this place is at the top of my airport suck list!Service that is as slow as a tree sloth. Really, don't bother unless you have at least an hour to kill before boarding time. The other week when I was waiting for my flight and had 45 minutes it still was not enough time to eat here, and I had taken a seat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Um, nope! Even at the bar the service was slow, and I had to end up getting the bbq chicken salad I ordered to go so I could catch my flight. Good thing I looked in the bag because they gave me the wrong meal on top of that. I had to wave someone down to quickly give me the right meal and I ran to my gate barely making the plane. Ate on the plane and the salad was barely passable.As far as a California Pizza Kitchen goes there is not that much healthy here to eat, and a salad is the closet thing on the menu. Seems pricey too. Along with the super slow service this is one to avoid!Had 60 min to kill in terminal D, so to CPK it was! The place has a bunch of bar seats and has a gigantic window facing the runway, so no windowless, lonely, eating in the dark for you, Champ! The menu isn't a full CPK menu and everything feels a bit lazy (I'm not sure if they have a full kitchen), but it's better than eating Johnny Rockets before you pack yourself on a 500MPH flying tube. Picked up a pesto chicken 'wich which was passable and a Stella that wasn't from a skunk tap. Can you really ask for more in an airport? Oh, yea, I guess you can, but this isn't so bad either.

Restaurant name  Fat Boy

Review Text :
Finally gave this place a try after driving by it numerous times and joked about eating there.  And then it happened. Fat Boy is a tiny little restaurant that is hidden in East Las Vegas. The place seats about 15 people - it definitely has this homey, only-for-locals kind of feel to it. I had a guacamole cheeseburger with fat fries, and the boyfriend had a chicken burrito with chencho fries.  I was half expecting the food to be overrated, but I was amazed at how fresh my burger was!  And how much I love my fries!!! I ADORE FAT FRIES!!!  The fries have these seasonings on them that just make them super yummy!  And they were FAT and huge!  The Chencho fries were covered with a green salsa and onions and cheese; it was yummy enough - a bit fattening though. I have suggested to return to this place numerous times after the first encounter, and that is pretty rare for me.  Enjoy!My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!WHAT WE HAD:-Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick!-Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger!-Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUMWHY: You will not be disappointed!!*NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!After reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a photo of a dripping Cheese Boyger, I was eager to try the food at this little eatery.  I took along Diane, another male friend who is always game to try a new top burger, and his burger-loving wife.  Even though the establishment wouldn't make any burgers medium rare, all of us were very satisfied with our burgers.  My Cheese Boyger with everything featured a quarter-pound beef patty prepared medium well, cool pickles, lettuce, a large slice of fresh tomato, relish, mustard, chipotle mayonnaise, and melted American Cheese on a soft bun, and I added some available Heinz Tomato Ketchup.  There was little American Cheese inside but the burger was still quite tasty.  I also enjoyed Chencho Fat Fries that contained chopped chicken, Green Sauce, and melted Mozzarella Cheese spread over the fries.  I noted that the soft fries themselves absorbed some liquid from the other ingredients.But I was really most impressed with my Wet Boyrrito with Beef, Red Sauce & Beans on the inside, and Mozzarella Cheese and Green Sauce on the outside.  This was one of the best burritos I have had outside of Southern California.  The Green Sauce was real good and zesty but not too spicy, small cubes of steak inside had a grilled flavor, the beans were small and tasty, and some of the Mozzarella Cheese melted nicely on top of the fairly large burrito.  I will likely come back for this.So, while the Cheese Boyger and Chencho Fries did not blow me away, the Wet Boyrrito was a nice surprise.  And, I liked that the friendly cooks were willing to prepare a Boyrrito just as a diner would like it (e.g., with or without rice, beans, beef, or chicken, and with Red Sauce, Green Sauce, or no sauce).The place is a small and unassuming storefront situated in the middle of a strip mall.  But it is comfortable enough, and free refills are allowed for fountain soft drinks.  Above all, the freshly prepared food is excellent, which should count the most.  I, too, am now a fan!  4-1/2 Stars!All these other burger spots getting love and I realized I've never reviewed Fat Boy. Four juicy solid stars. The only reason to drive to this side of town is for this damn burger and fries. Chencho Fries that is.Location: Shit location in a shit part of town. I don't care. I think I'm tough even though I am a short white girl who cries at Kodak commercials. Get real. Any neighborhood could be bad at any given time of day. This place is JUST FINE. The burgers taste like a backyard burger straight off the grill done RIGHT. Perfectly seasoned and the patty is not smashed or too thick. Both my biggest complaints about a burger. They don't even call it a burger because it's so cool. They call it a Boyger. Yeah boyeee! It's really nothing fancy, but it's exactly and I mean exactly how I like my burger. Please don't come here if you are expecting fancy. This sure ain't no supper club.The fries. I swear the Chencho fries deserve MAD love. Like Quentin Tarantino movie love. Uma could order them and be eating them and then BOOM a huge ass ninja fight! Or cowboy zombie fight! I don't care, but some fight with the fries and the green chile sauce and melted cheese flying through the air in slow motion. I wouldn't wait for Redbox for that shit. Do it proper if you order these. You have a choice: Thin or thick fries. I went with thin and asked for exra crispy to hold up with the toppings cuz that's how I roll. PROPER FUCKING FRIES, SON.Okay, I'm done. Just make the drive because it's cheap, it's real and even though I only went once I have thought about going about 100 more times....Dont you just love the bookmark feature?It's lunch time so I check my bookmarks and what do you know? Fat Boy is right down the street. So off I go!As I come in I hear Mexican music playing in the background. While looking at the menu on the wall, the lady behind the counter greets me in Spanish. I dont blame her cuz I kind of look like im Mexican. For a second there I almost ordered Al Pastor tacos. LOL.So I ask the nice lady what was good since it was my first time. She said to go with the combo of the single Boyger, Chencho Fries and Small Drink. CHEN WHAT? She smiles at me and says, "Chencho Fries: Your choice of fat or skinny fries topped with cheese, chicken bits, and a green sauce." Ok! Combo it is!I take a bite of the Boyger. I had to do a double take. Am I at Fatburger or Fat Boy? It tastes just like theirs but I paid 6 bucks and some change instead of 10 bucks or more. Now that I can get with. As for their Chencho fries, its basically an enchilada but with potato sticks instead. What I found out was that you should eat it right away because it tends to get soggy over time and it doesnt matter if you get it with fat or skinny fries. So if you are into green sauce, this will sure hit the spot!Besides burgers, these guys have wings, chicken fingers and pizza. Not to mention sandwiches, boyrritos, and combination plates. Their pizzas must be good because when I was eating my food, this lady comes in and picks up 5 pizzas to go. The minus 1 star is for their location. They are situated in one of many suites of one big building. The part of town they are in is kind of suspect. I can only assume what characters may come out at night. Some random info: They take cards and from what I noticed, there is no minimum. They have a decent soda fountain so you should be able to get your refills' worth. They got I would say about 6 small tables so if its packed, dont let it discourage you. You can always take it to go. There is a bathroom but you have to ask and then walk through the kitchen towards the back. Kind of awkward if you ask me but if you gotta go, you gotta go!So whenever I have a Fatburger craving, im yelling out "Fat Boy!" because nobody  wants to eat at "Skinny Boy".Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.This is my new favorite place to eat. If you like pastrami then get your butt over here now and get some. The Pastrami Boyger is great but the pastrami sandwich on its own is just brilliant. It isn't "The Hat" but it will damn do! The owners are super cool and make everything when you order it. The guy is pretty nice about customizing orders too. You can call your order in for pick up or eat inside. They have a pizza special that costs just over $5 and it tastes great. My wife ordered some of their Chencho Fries and we ended up sharing it because I liked it. It is simple but the green sauce and cheese taste great on them. You can't beat the cheap prices for the quality you get here. What are you waiting for? Get over here and try something... just save some pastrami for me!Fat Boy is AWESOME!  Yep, that about sums it up in a nutshell!  Haven't been there yet?  Well, pack you bags and take a trip to the East side of Vegas for some tasty grub.  Here's why I am a big fan of Fat Boy:1. The vastness of the menu! This joint has something for everyone.  They have burgers, pizza, chicken, and Mexican food all on their menu.  If you an't find something you like on the menu, you are definitely missing out!2. The burgers (boygers) are yum-tastic! I  They are all super tasty and some of the best I have had in town.  They are also a great deal for the price point.  $3-5 for a freshly made burger is a-ok in my book!3. The fries are great!  They have the thick, steakhouse stye fries.  A regular order comes with a fun season salt mix on them that tastes great.  You can also try their chencho fries that are covered in a green chili sauce and cheese.  They are a fun dish to chow down on for sure.4. The prices are fantastic.  Your money definitely goes a long way here.  You can get a yummy lunch and be full all day for under $10 out the door.  They also have family deals like 4 burgers, 4 fries, and a 2 liter of soda for $18.  Not to shabby.  I always love great food for cheap.Bottom line, I really enjoy Fat Boy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty lunch.  If you are on that side of town, go check them out to make your belly happy!FYI, it is in a small strip mall and you may drive right past it.  You have to be on the look out for it.  It's on the NE corner of Stewart and Lamb.Another hidden treasure on the east side! #yes (I know, hashtags are pointless on here). Anyway, my boyfriend and I shared chencho fries, 8 wings (1/2 bbq 1/2 hot), and a pastrami boyger. Between 2 people this can really fill you up! Pastrami boyger: soooo so good. What I love most is you can taste the quality (no copyright infringement intended, in-n-out) because they use fresh foods & are made to order. Chencho fries: pretty yummy. I would recommend an add on or two. Their options are bacon, ham, or egg. Pastrami would probably be bomb on there. I'm still pretty satisfied with it though. Wings: I'm not crazy about their wings but I like that the hot sauce is actually hot & their bbq is pretty flavorful. At least you know there's no steroids in the chicken so that's always good.Overall verdict: definitely worth the price & then some. One of the very few good food spots on east side Vegas :) Also! Bernie provided us the greatest customer service. So you're fortunate if he's working when you check this place out.

Review Text :
So, we went to ride up to a near by resto to pick up a friend after work, (3 doors down), and decided to stay in the area for some food and a few drinks for it was a beautiful Sunday in the summer of montreal.  And that does not last long so one has to take advantage of such situations.  Just one humble man's opinion, and for the record, i randomly met this man, and found out that he was not that humble.  Anyways, it has a proper setup, and an aesthetically pleasing feel.  And having been involved in rest's that is such an important tool for your business.  Inside was on point along with the the terraces, and yes, they have two, one smoking, well, i should not have to name the other..  Best dish that was brought to the table was a lamb burger with goat cheese and of course normal burger garnishing and was "fantastic", NOT SURE IT WAS WORTH $18, but was very good.  The server was really nice and accommodating, for example, upon the delivery of the desert, some ice cream, the runner presented a bowl with one tiny scoop in it which was $3.  When she quickly appeared to check on satisfaction 'i guess', more likely what is about to happen-happens every time this is ordered from the menu, i said, "well, i ordered a $3 bowl of ice cream and they brought me a bowl with a small scoop of butter in it", BUT WITH A SMILE, i do recognize she is not in charge of portions and serving sizes.  But she got a huge laugh, and took it and brought it back with a two more scoops.  So a $1 a scoop, A WIN-WIN, for all parties involved.  Two more scoops for a good laugh.  All in all, had a great time, and will definitely go back.  The only drawback was they kept bringing us menu's literally one after another, with no acceptable cadence to menu delivery.  With all the menus in front of me i thought i was a student at the library writing a research paper when most of them did not apply for the time of the visit.  BUT, i must say, if you are in the area on a wonderful day, definitely, "make it happen"!!!!!!...side note, they have the best looking iced coffee i have ever seen, and i don't even drink coffee!!!!!!

I stopped by Chicago Gyros for a late lunch today... I ordered a large Greek Salad to go.  And then while I was at it, I added on an order of hummus and an order of baba ghanoush.  I figured those would come in as handy appetizers since we had company tonight, and I was right!The salad was fresh and tasty.  It was a decent sized portion of lettuce topped with tomatoes, onions, red pepper, cucumber, feta, pepperoncini, and kalamata olives.  Note that I said pepperoncini not pepperoncinis - sadly, there was only one!  I ate my entire salad along with some of the fresh pita they sent me home with...And later tonight, I put out the hummus and baba and it worked out well too.  I was more a fan of the baba than the hummus, however.I noticed that their menu is pretty large - you can order everything from salads and vegetarian wraps, to gyros, Mediterranean pitas, burgers, fish and chips, and pizza puffs.  They also do affordable catering.While this place didn't wow me, it didn't turn me off either... I'm sure I'll be back - especially for the price, selection, and location.

To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought "strip mall Mexican, need to check this out".  The place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.The food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.This is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos.

If it weren't for the rude owner of this place I would have given it four stars based on the bartender and ambiance. We were greeted by the owner with hostility, not seated when a table opened up because "we asked too many times if the table was ready" and she actually told us to leave because she couldn't care less either way. To top it off, every time she walked by us when we were standing at the bar she made a snide comment about us sticking around. The bartender apologized to us a thousand times for her behavior (he said he finds himself doing this a lot) but I will never go back to this establishment. Simply awful.

First of all I will say the place itself is nice, and our server was very pleasant. That being said, nothing edible was worth the price. This place is insanely overpriced for the quality of food you get. If you want to spend the money go anywhere else but don't go here for the food.There are bugs in the restaurant.. Windows are disgusting! Floor looks like it is falling apart. Employees gossip about other employees in front of customers! Burgers are never cooked how they are ordered! Horrible restaurant!!!! Also just received a B rating from health department.Owner Wael, comments on every bad review saying that it is a fake review! Yes I was employed with him, I QUIT, he refuses to pay me for time worked and is now blackmailing me by saying he will release my personal information. But everything in my review is 100% true! And all of his other bad reviews were posted by others, not myself.

This bakery has been here a while now. I did not stop in until a couple of days ago. I can not speak on the deli aspect of it, I did not get any meats. I did however ask for one item that in on the menu. I was told this is a special order item. Well then state it as such. So I got a poppy seed something or other. It was dough with poppy seed shaped in to a roll. One personal sized lemon cake and an eclair. The poppy seed doohickey had no flavour, I mean nothing. The eclair was pretty bland and tasted as less than stellar ingredients were used. The lemon cake was so bad it was trash canned after one bite. So I can honestly say I have had better. Arizona has a hard time with good bakeries. The bakery it self felt bordering on depressing. I could not stay there for long.

Quite possibly the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. Not only was it gross, but they charge extra for bacon and cheese. So for $15, you get a greasy tortilla filled with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese product. Oh, and a gracious helping of sour cream on top. Bleh!Service was fine - my waiter was perfectly pleasant. But the prices and quality were pretty offensive.Maybe I'd come back for a margarita or chips and salsa? Def not for breakfast!Typical bar & grill type fare, but here you will be entertained/mystified by a never-ending rotating slideshow of images of the great Sammy Hagar, from his solo days to Van Halen to his slow melt into obscurity, lending his name to generic restaurants around the globe Guy Fieri-style.  Burgers, wings, sandwiches, quesadillas.  The sole salad choice is of the Southwestern chicken variety.  Vegas hangover food while you wait for your flight, and nothing more.  The service is decent and they have a full bar.My traveling mate had a Bloody Mary and I enjoyed a mimosa; I did not enjoy dropping $30 for those two items.Save your money and hit the Wendy's next door. I certainly wish I did.This place is awful!  I rarely say that but it really was!  Our flight was delayed so we decided to hit up Sammy's for a quick meal.  There wasn't any signs so we seated ourselves.  Immediately we were approached saying that kids cannot sit in the bar area (I felt very far from the bar btw) and we had to sit upstairs.  Upstairs???  A foot away and up a 6 inch step up.  Um I beg to differ on the stairs comment.  But whatever we will go with it.  We get seated and order a couple drinks.  We weren't super hungry so we shared the Chips with Guacamole and a Burger with fries.First off, the chips were straight up obvious out of a bag...and cold and stale.  The salsa and guac had to have been from a jar because I couldn't imagine them making anything homemade here. Both totally bland but we ate about half of it.  Definitely a disappointment.  The burger was a "build your own" and we ordered it with carmelized onions $1.50 and jack cheese $1.50.  There was like two strings of onion (for that price?) but the burger was ok overall.  The fries were cold.  The best part was this coleslaw on the side that looked like they got it out of the gutter.  It was yellow-brownish and literally the serving was the size of a tablespoon.  We laughed at how small the serving size was...maybe they didn't want us to get us sick?!!  So gross.The wine and the "Can't Drive 55" drink both $13+ were a bit overpriced.  Ya think?  I know I know-its airport mark ups.  What do you expect?  I wasn't picky - I was going on a mini vacay!I think the whole time we were there we only heard one Sammy song.  I definitely will choose somewhere else the next time.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten from the airport until now.  Sammmay!  This place is a hot mess.  A definite need for some tender loving care and some pride in your food.BTW I have been to his Cabo Wabo on the strip and have always been happy with everything I've ordered there.

The whole trend of cupcakeries seems really bourgeois.  It's about as awesome as buying a $4.50 cup of coffee.Anyway, the cupcakes are NOT that special. They seem dry, and the buttercream has that taste of being made with shortening, rather than butter.  At $2.50 each, I'd honestly rather spend my money on a duncan hines mix and make 2 dozen at home.Brought my Aunt and Uncle here from out of town. The restaurant is a fun place and very kid friendly. My two nieces were with as well. We were seated by a small children's play area that they have. It was so nice to have something to keep them occupied with and busy so they didn't get anxious about food not coming right away.There are SO many choices on the menu! almost too many. I found myself finding something that sounded tasty and not looking at the rest of the menu *sigh* choices are just so hard.I was very happy with my choice. I got the Daisy Cod. It was a panko crusted cod sandwich with a very tasty aioli and slaw, it was FANTASTIC! Everyone else in our party got something different and everyone LOVED the food.  A very kid friendly place with tasty local foods.

Review Text :
I hate saying this about any venue that opens in CenPho but this experience was just HORRIBLE!Now granted this was the first day of their soft open but the food prepared by the self professed "Celebrity Chef" was not good ... not even a little.We had two tapas ... the first was the potatoes where were mini and most of them were undercooked and hard. They were not good.We also had Lobster Cakes were were had an extremely intense taste (that I didn't like) and that taste completely drowned out the Lobster. One of the cakes was even cold in the middle.I also had a steak that was under cooked and in no way a great piece of meat (chewy and a strong line of tough fat running through the entire piece).The place is EXTREMELY small and because of that the tables are WAY to close together ... and nearly impossible to navigate without bumping into the people next to you.I'm just sooooo sad that this place was a fail for us.Fine, because I'm tired of this place having such a high rating from fake reviews, I'm going to review my attempt to eat there.We went by last week, walked over there, and the owner was outside.  He told us that they had a soft opening the night before and that they would be open Monday at 4pm for dinner.  Ok pops, we'll be back at 4 on Monday.So Monday rolls around and we are starving by the time we get home from work at 4.  We walk over and there are two "chefs" standing around in the doorway chatting it up while smoking.  We walk up and are like...WTF?  And the guy tells me that the owner is out buying ingredients and that they might open at 5.  So I ask to see a menu and he says "we don't have menus"  Excuse me?"We type them up the day of..."Well that seems horribly inefficient and like a waste of paper.  So how am I supposed to know what you have to eat and if I want to come here?Ya...that's what I thought.  So even though your horribly tacky sign with a car on it (that conveniently doesn't say your name) says you'll be open at 4, you're not open.  And even though you guys are the cooks, you don't know what's on the menu for the night.  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.  I'm on a budget so I'm not just going to walk into your place and eat.  I want to see a menu before I walk in.  Get your act (and your website) together and maybe I will be back.  Until then, I will just walk by and grab a sub at Calabria.I also hate giving a bad review to anything downtown, because it's such an underated and underused community that's developing around my hood, and I want every new business to succeed.  However, I feel the disappointment still within me a day after my so called "celebrity chef" meal.  This is in the top 5 worst meals I've ever paid for.  To start, the hummus was served with store bought lavash, and it wasn't finished by 3 people, and that was not because of the size or lack of hunger, and all three of us love hummus.  The albacore on skewers was overcooked, dry, and served w a "homemade" aoli, that to me tasted like Helman's with a bit of red pepper.  If the majority of the ingredients in a sauce are pre-made, it's not homemade.  That's like buying ceaser salad dressing at the store and adding some parmesan to it and calling it your homemade dressing.  weak.  Lastly the sirloin with chimichurri sauce was also overcooked to about medium well and flavorless other than a seemingly similarly made chimichurri sauce.  This place is just half ass in general.  I put quite a bit more effort and thought into making a sack lunch.  Man, this is my first review on yelp, and i feel like an asshole cuz it's scathing, but I was that disapointed with this place that is trying to be something it is absolutely not.  On a final note, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, though the "celebrity chef" had not educated her on much more than maybe 2 items on the menu.  I hope that somehow, someway they can turn this place around, but as of now, the only thing worth going for is the free, crappy sangria.After much consideration, I decided my previous rating unfairly portrayed Vinery. That 3-star rating was heavily influenced by ambiance and vision, two very important aspects of a restaurant. When applied to the food, not just the space in which the food is served. I'm not giving up on Vinery, but rather challenging them to rise above the mediocrity that was apparent in our meal. Trust me, I will be back. And when Vinery has developed its standing in the downtown foodie destination guide I'll be proud of how far it's come along. Until then...====================================================Such a difficult place to review, because I see so much potential. It's a great location, tucked into an awesome neighborhood. The interior is intimate and has some great cosmetic touches. I like the idea of having the kitchen behind the counter, so you are right there in the action. Service is good, without the annoying hovering, and isn't rushed so this lends itself nicely to a slow meal to enjoy as much as possible. The complimentary sangria is pretty good (however, Dottsy's Slap me Silly Sangria has lifted the bar rather high). And offering a four-course Monday night meal for $10 is brilliant in any economic situation. Plus, they have a tapas menu. And now, the ubiquitous "but." But: Egg rolls shouldn't collapse on themselves from over frying. The slaw was good, but the egg roll could have been removed from the fryer several minutes earlier. But: English cucumbers are one of my favorites, however they don't have such a long shelf live. Mixed with vine-ripened tomatoes is a great idea; however, bringing some zing with feta cheese and a light sprinkling fresh dill and a splash of balsamic would really bring this salad to life. Perhaps I'm partial to the hummus I make and Crazy Jim's pita bread, so I'll leave it at that... But: Skirt steak should never be used for anything other than fajitas, cooked fast and hard. This is not a good cut of meat to have wrapped around a starch. Possibly fresh asparagus...but, leave it in the fajita mix. The rice was entirely too over-seasoned, even for a saltaholic like me. But: Merchant Services can be just as much your friend as your enemy. Americans use credit cards for $1 purchases, so certainly we would use them for dining out. Not having a working CC machine puts your customers in a very awkward situation. Granted, there is relatively close access to ATMs and even the Circle K. But, if you have to send your customers away to pay for their meal, are you really accomplishing much? There's a reason I front loaded this review with everything but the actual food--this is the part of the puzzle that keeps Vinery 214 Bistro from launching into space and being a stellar dining attraction. Ideally, this is a two-star restaurant, with the emphasis being on potential ability. For now, I've decided 2.5 stars is generous, and rounded that up to three. I'll be back, trust me. But I'm hoping that the menu is reevaluated, tweaked, reinvested and solidly delivered in this beautifully packaged restaurant.Possibly the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant. I was expecting much more considering the quaint interior and white linen draped table tops but I was deceived; royally!First Course: A veggie egg roll that was over fried a few minutes too long. The only veggie I could identify was a piece of broccoli, the rest, unsure.  I had the feeling (by taste) that the egg roll was taken directly out of the freezer and thrown into an extremely high temp deep fryer. The bed of cole slaw that the egg roll sat upon lacked any acidity or taste. Even worse, the egg roll and slaw were served on a damaged serving plate. The plate was cracked! Second Course: Cucumber and tomato salad, hummus and pita bread. The salad was missing any trace of vinaigrette or fragrant herbs. Just a bowl of cut up tomatoes and sliced cucumbers; no seasoning. The texture on the cucumbers was slightly slimy, possibly starting to turn. The hummus had a gritty texture (I like it creamy) as though the olive oil was omitted. Main Course: A total disaster! Risotto or rice pilaf wrapped in a skirt steak, pan fried, and served on  a bed of Spanish rice. My steak was impossible to cut with a steak knife and the middle was blood red. I had one bite and could not get another piece as the steak was to tough The Spanish rice tasted like it was cooked without any seasoning then was over seasoned before being served. I did notice the unfinished plates of other customers who were having the same meal. I could tell this was not a fan favorite. Unfortunate. Dessert: We had the server box it up to go. Never ate it.  I would like to note that the co-owner did approach us about our untouched meals and asked us if we would share some feedback. I  expressed my disappointment with the dinner providing detail of what was wrong with every item.  He seemed surprised with my candidness. I then asked him if he had ever tried the meal to which he responded, "No, I'm a very picky person."  He was very apologetic and gave us 10% off the bill and asked us to come back. He mentioned there were some changes being made to the menu and that he would discuss our feedback with the cook. We then had to drive to the ATM up the block to get cash to pay for our meal because their credit card machine was out of service. One catastrophe after another.

We ate at this particular restaurant located in the Stratosphere Hotel because we had a coupon for a free pitcher of beer with the purchase of a pizza. Our pizza was delicious. This small restaurant only serves pizza and beer. All the pizzas are large or you can order a slice. I would definetely return to this little restaurant, especially if we find another coupon  ((:

Been here a couple of times, and every time it's been a satisfying experience. The tapsilog (one of the "silogs" they serve for breakfast - refer to the pics) is good, as are most of the entrees I've had for lunch or dinner. The storefront says "Filipino American Food", but that doesn't mean it's a fusion restaurant; rather, in addition to Filipino food they also serve some American fast food items such as burgers and corn dogs. Boba tea is available, too, and that goes well with pretty much anything you order there.I usually don't like Filipino food unless it's breakfast and this place hits the spot with their TapSiLog. That's marinated beef, fried rice (even better when it's garlic fried rice!) and egg.I also like that their "boba" isn't really boba but more of it's Filipino counterpart: sago. I'd definitely be back if I'm ever in the area :)This restaurant was everything I had hoped for..and more! I tried filipino food for the first time in August (what, there aren't a lot of filipino options in Minnesota..) and I absofrickenlutely loved everything I had. I was so excited to see an authentic filipino option in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant has an ala carte menu and a regular menu with a ton of options. I opted for a "three option" meal and got the lechon, coconut chicken, and this fried shrimp pancake thing..I'm sorry, I have no idea what it was called. On top of that, I also got the special Halo-Halo, lumpia shanghai, and the sisig fries. I can honestly say everything I had was amazing and if I could, I would eat there every day. You can tell the food is made with fresh ingredients and not any of that frozen or prepackaged nonsense. The girl at the counter was very sweet and patient in explaining the different food options to us. Here is my review of the food I had:-Lechon: the best part, tender pork, crispy skin, awesome sauce. -Coconut chicken: creamy, mild, coconutty without being dessert like,  and full of dark meat. -Shrimp thing: wish it would have been crispier but great flavor-Special halo-halo: a dessert on steroids, it was like a "kitchen sink" type of dessert where there were a bunch of deliciousness thrown into a cup...from what I can remember there was aloe, coconut jelly, taro ice cream, corn flakes, coconut milk, shaved ice, flan, red beans, pinto beans, grass jelly...and probably a lot more I am missing. -lumpia shanghai: crispy, flavorful, light, and great with the sweet chili sauce-sisig fries: amazingness smothered in more amazingness...this was coated shoestring fries double fried to a crisp with sisig, sour cream, onions, and chopped up pork on top. THE BEST. The owner of the restaurant stopped in to decorate and check on things and I have to note that she was actually the highlight of Halo Halo Kitchen. There was a fly in the restaurant and she spent a good 10 minutes chasing it around with a swatter and made sure it didn't go near our table. She complimented me on my phone case and we ended up talking about ebay and online shopping for a while. The restaurant has a bar like set up but there was a Filipino drama playing on the flat screens LOL. I honestly felt like I was at a fun relatives house chowing down on awesome food and catching up on soaps. It was so great.Disclaimer: I knew nothing about Filipino food outside of adobo and lumpia before coming here. I'm a total noob. But I know what I like, and I like Halo-Halo Kitchen. There are really several types of foods here: The stews: Some, like pork adobo or menudo are more familiar. I had the chicken pastel, with potatoes and carrots simmered in a savory coconut milk mixture. It was alright. Just be sure to watch out for bones! Getting a little sharp piece out of nowhere was a surprise, but it's all good. Then there's my favorite--beef kare kare. Beef in a peanut butter sauce, with a very strong little side of salted shrimp paste to top it off with. I like both flavors individually, but can't say I agree with them going together! All this with two generous mounds of rice for $7.00 is INSANELY good. Oh, and there was the dinuguan as well, or pork roasted in garlic and blood. Yes, it sounds weird! But it's not that bad. don't be a wuss ;-)There are breakfast plates (read: silog menu), that have various grilled meats with rice and egg. Served all day! :-DThere's the deep-fried Filipino junk food like lumpia, which were alright. I'll for sure come back for the sisig fries!Then there's the American menu if you wanna be basic AFSave room for desert. The Halo-Halo is intimidating and probably has a billion grams of sugar, but I'm down. Service is very friendly, but it's got the super local, laid back vibe to it in which employees are talking among themselves, on their phones, or watching TV while they serve you. Some people are irked by it, but I feel like I'm eating at someone's house. Groovy. Other oddities include the really cool bar that appears absolutely STOCKED. My pal tells me it's so that customers can party hard on karaoke nights. This place has just about everything you could ask for!11/18/15Returned this morning to use the second Groupon I purchased, which was to expire today.  This is Mom's and my second visit (our first was in July, when sister and her two kids were visiting, so they accompanied us then).  Mom and I weren't impressed with the meal we had then, which included dinuguan, lechon paksiw, longsilog (longganisa, which is similar to chorizo, and "itlog," which translates to "egg," and fried rice dish), lechon kawali, and porksilog (pork chop, eggs, and rice).  I believe we even ordered a BBQ item, and asked for a side of rice (two scoops for $1), which were then rung up together as one two-item dish that cost an extra $2 over what we initially ordered as a la carte!  I decided to give the woman (the owner?) the benefit of the doubt and didn't complain.  Everything was greasy and bland.  Sister liked her longganisa dish very much, though, since it had been a long time since she last had it.Fast-forward to today's breakfast of longsilog for me, with a side of tocino, and a tapsilog (tapas, eggs, and fried rice), with a side of bangus (fried milkfish) for Mom, and a Halo-Halo special ($1 more than the regular order of Halo-Halo), and again everything was greasy (Mom actually did what I suggested and patted down the meats with tissue paper to soak up some of the grease!) and bland.  Sad to say, but the only thing we both enjoyed was the "Halo-halo Especial." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/halo-halo-kitchen-phoenix?select=WWzdttOk7G2J3qbOLQk5QA  We thought the tiny scoop (between a quarter of a scoop to a third of a scoop'ish) of ube ice cream looked pitiful, but I didn't really feel like speaking to the woman/owner up front anymore, since this was going to be our last visit here.While we were waiting for our food to arrive, Mom was asking whether we should order some crispy pata, or lechon kawali to go, but by the end of our meal, she'd changed her mind.  Two very disappointing experiences, with each roundtrip costing us forty-eight miles of travel!   Very sad to say that we will not be supporting this Filipino-owned "turo-turo" business in the future.  :(

Are you going to throw tomatoes at me for not having crepes at Crepe Cellar?  I couldn't help it, I wasn't in the mood and there were plenty of other options on the menu.We started off with a French press of coffee.  Gotta love the French press, and they give you handy dandy timers so you can steep your coffee for light, medium or bold.  Great coffee, but it comes with a price tag of $5.  Man, I could of had a V8 (with vodka, of course.)We  ordered an endive salad with goat cheese, candid walnuts and apples.  It was yummalicious.  It had a tangy citrus vinaigrette, it look like there wasn't enough on the salad, but it tasted perfect.   We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts, mussels and  fries.If you think you don't like brussel sprouts or haven't had them since you were a kid, you HAVE to try them, they are swimming in olive oil and flash fried, they are like little bites of heaven.  Now if you don't like them at Crepe Cellar, let it go, cause you don't like them.The mussels were ok, shellfish weirds me out in restaurants, you never know how fresh they are.  The fries came out hot, YIPPEE!!! Our bill was $40 with no booze.  So, it isn't cheap.They have sweet and savory crepes on the menu, the sweet crepes that caught my eye were butter & sugar and nutella & bananas, there were a couple more, but Tasty Yo next door was calling my name and you know what they were saying......Tasty Yo Ho!!Crepe Cellar is a great casual neighborhood restaurant, it reminded me of a restaurant in Primrose Park in London.  well worth the trek to NODA!One of the best additions to the NoDa neighborhood over the last year or so.If you are going the crepe route for dining, hit up the Queen City.  If you are going for dessert, you cannot go wrong with the brownie concoction.The menu is also delicious well beyond the crepe realm.  The steak and Guiness stew with the insanely good mac and cheese will hit the spot.  For lighter fare, I recommend the pesto chicken french bread pizza.The beer selection (especially on tap) is always evolving and refreshing no matter what your taste.The wait staff and bartenders are friendly and fun.

I've been eating here or getting pizza delivered since they opened this joint. It was really good at first and has slowly gone down hill. Maybe they are owned by somebody different than the tasty Scottdale location?Going keep this short and simple. The quality of the food and service at this location is always CONSISTENTLY HIT OR MISS.Sometime it is great and other times it is awful. The last few pizzas that were delivered to the house had black (burnt) cornmeal covering the entire bottom of the crust. This is simply an oven that is not being maintained properly and most unfortunate.Since this is not about trying to graduate with a 2.0 or better and I'm not going out of my way to apply the Bell Shape Curve to my past dining experiences ... BIG MEH!2.25 STARSI was starving and stopped by this shopping center looking for Slim's Sub Shop.  I was disappointed to see that Slim's closed.  I was on a time crunch and saw Rosati's.I ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza, and wanted a bottle of Water....the girl working the register told me they were out of bottled Water, Strike 1.  The pizza came out after a few minutes.  The slices were huge!  It was almost the size of a small Pizza!  I thought that the Pizza was awful, the sauce tasted like canned sauce, the Cheese was flavorless, and I thought the crust was undercooked and rubbery, Strikes 2, 3, 4.  Since I was starving I ate it anyway, except I didn't eat the crust....which is rare for me, I always eat the crust....it was that bad.I know this place is a chain so I'm not sure I will ever try it again....not my type of place.  I prefer better quality pizza.Will I return?  No way!

The food was really good actually. It might have been better if they got the order right, and it hadn't arrived cold. So here are the cons:- It took 2 hours for them to deliver the food- They couldn't deliver to my hotel room because they were too lazy to park their car and walk it up- They forgot to give me the "complimentary" 2 liter drink they promised online- The pizza arrived cold- The caesar salad was sent to me with italian dressing for some reason- The caesar salad used iceberg lettuce even though the menu says Romaine- They forgot to give me the garlic bread they say comes with the salad- After I called to complain, the guy on the phone told me he would send me the things I am missing (caesar dressing, garlic bread, soda). It's been 5 hours...In conclusion, if you are looking for delivery, go somewhere else. They fail.

Came here after my friends all raved about it. We arrived and there was a brief wait. I figured, hmmm...there are people here...that's a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Here's what I got:-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)-burnt ends (DELISH)The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned. Overall, the food and service left much more to be desired...

I absolutely LOVE indian food. Majority of the food was spicy - but SOO good. Butter chicken is always a good one though. Plating size is very worth it - I can never finish all the food. Somosa's - yum! I believe I paid $11 - very good price for what I had. This is more of a place for quick eating. It's decor is not fantastic and the organization of tables is a little messy. But I'm here for food - so I don't really mind.

This was a nice little spot for lunch. The decor is actually cute and the restaurant is very spacious on the inside -- much different than most of the very compact restaurants on Spring Mountain. Our server was a bit rigid at first, but with time became a lot more relaxed and very friendly and attentive. The lunch deal was great.. $5.99 for soup of the day which was delicious Tom Kha on that particular day and one of many entree options. I of course opted for Drunken Noodles with chicken. They were great! The chicken was cooked perfectly and not too dry which is my main contention with most Thai places when it comes to their chicken dishes. I opted for heat level 6 on a scale 1-10. It had the perfect amount of heat..and I like spicy. So be cautious..if you don't do spicy regularly go for a 4-5 tops. Otherwise, 6-7 are ideal. This was a perfect lunch and you really can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food.Pretty good Pad Thai. Lunch special was $6.99***********PLEASE READ************:: Their spicy level is NO JOKE. They have a 1-10 scale with 10 being the most spicy. Now, I love spicy foods and can handle spiciness. When I go to Thai places and order my pad thai spicy, I usually request my spiciness in the B grading scale range. Soooo....I ordered my chicken pad thai with a level 8. HOLY SHIT.....this was wayyyyy tooo spicy for me. I couldn't even eat my dish because my entire mouth was burning. Even with a small bite, I had to gulp down water. I got full off water. So if you plan on making any of the dishes spicy, take it down a notch or two.....or three.We came on a Monday evening after a long day and ordered 1. Tom Yum (pot) Seafood - Spicy 5: 16.992. Pad Thai chicken: 9.993. Seafood Delight - Spicy 3: 14.994. 3 Steamed rice: 4.50 5. Garlic Pepper chicken: 9.996. Red Curry Beef: 10.99for $85.05 (automatic 18% tip charge AFTER tax)  - Easy to spot, but hard to get to! Coming from the strip, off of Spring Mtn, and to this place, does everyone have to make an illegal u-turn off Valley View?! haha- Great looking bar and dine for a Thai restaurant, but bathrooms don't match!- Ambiance doesn't match service. - Lame and lazy service. On a slow evening, we have to hunt down Takky to tell her we're ready to order, get drink refills, remove empty plates, organize our own table. No ass kissers here. Fail.- Tom yum had great flavor, strong sour and spicy taste. hot! Loved it, but a bit expensive for tom yum. Too much cilantro.- Pad Thai chicken was delicious! Just how I want my Pad Thai to taste. - Seafood Delight was a dry and spicy. I couldn't imagine how it would taste if it were a 5! Yikes! Mussels are tiny but packed with flavor. Too much onions. - Garlic Pepper chicken packed a punch of garlic! A Vampire's nightmare. Good with the broccoli. - Red Curry beef was pretty good, but I should have just gotten the Panang. Ugh..- Automatic gratuity = 6 or more in party.- SNEAKS! Charging tip after tax.This is one of my favorite Thai lunch locations. Parking is never an issue since they share private parking lot with other businesses.  My order was the boat noodle soup and a Thai ice tea. The soup arrived quickly and contained hot and spicy rice noodle soup with rare steak, beef stew, beef balls, liver and tendon. The broth was so yummy and tasty! I thought I was back in Phuket Thailand. This place is underrated compared to some other popular Thai restaurants in L.V. They offer live entertainment in the evenings. They also accept credit cards and the service here is exceptional!Best pad Thai with the very best tofu nuggets ever!This place is great & located on the way to the strip. There are 4 things I order here and I stick to them each time. Chicken pad Thai, cream cheese rangoons, chicken panang and Thai ice tea. Usually I experiment and try new things from regularly visited restaurants but not this one. I don't think I come here often enough to want to try new things. The decor is nothing special and it's a little stuck in the 90's with a small stage for some live random performances. One night an older Asian man was on stage singing everything from Frank Sinatra to Bruno Mars. It was awesome! The pad Thai is on the sweet side so prepare to ask for some lime and peanuts but it's really delicious without those items as well. The tofu is a winner and stands out on its own. Sometimes I pick it out a few pieces and leave them on my plate so it's the very last thing in my mouth :)

Review Text :
Got the wings here...plain and simple...they're awful. Barely any meat, very dry, no flavor. Won't be back...**UPDATE**The (I assume) owner of this "fine" establishment decided to email me about my review on their wings...the following is the correspondence between myself and "Meridith". If this is how they treat their customers, I seriously don't understand how they've managed to stay open for a so called "40 years"...Message from Meridith:"Wings were sauced like they always are. If you read the menu you could have gotten the wings sloppy. Our wings are the same size as every where else in the valley. Try our pizza next time. We've been in business for 40+ years. We must be doing something right. You can try Papa Johns."Response message from me:"Don't be angry cause you have horrible wings...not everyone can get them right so don't feel bad. I can't say anything about your pizza cause I've never had it but even so I doubt I'd go back just to try it...Sure...your wings are the same size as everyone else's in the valley...as far as the bone goes. But it's the AMOUNT of meat on the bone which counts. And that right there is where your wings are TRUELY inferior.Your wings were purchased to feed a party of people during a boxing match on PPV and every single person at the party who ate the wings all said they were horrible...so for your sake I hope that we just got a bad batch or something cause none of those people there said they would ever go to your restaurant for wings.It was very immature and unprofessional to message me and talk to me in such a way about the issue when instead you should be more focused on trying to find out what the issue was and fixing it. I will be doing a follow up to my review to show everyone how you treat your customers over a matter of simply having their own opinion about your food if it just so happens to be a negative opinion."Sounds like a serious lack of customer service skills on their part. Looks like I'll be getting my wings from Papa Johns from now on...*sigh* what a serious tragedy....lol!

Mr. K has covered most of the bases in his FTR, but there were a couple of things I thought I would add... The green chile beef is every bit as good as the red. We sampled both, as well as the beans (we choose Pima style which is the smashed version of beans rather than whole). All were very ample portions and exhibited crisp flavors. We all agreed that each could use a little salt, but after some discussion and a few sprinkles we came to the conclusion that actually it was preferable to season your own to your liking. Too often, we had all been served items which were over seasoned and quite frankly, there isn't much you can do once that has happened. This way, we each were able to make adjustments as desired. The bread itself seems a little more tender than TFBH. It also seemed a bit larger. That being said, we did each have the "full" version of the tacos, so the "half" may be more along the lines of what you might get elsewhere. Prices also seemed to be approximately $1.00 - 1.50 higher than TFBH, for the full portion. Some other items on the menu were both surprising and intriguing. I'm definitely going back for the Blue Corn Mush (I would have ordered it today, but I had already ordered my taco and was sure I couldn't handle both). I've never actually seen this on a menu off the reservation, so that in itself is enough to make me a repeat visitor. They have a few mutton and lamb selections that are obviously more on the authentic side. The mutton rib plate is served with sauteed squash and diced green chiles along with a navajo fry bread and drink ($11.99). The people at the next table had one of these and it was a large plate of food which they clearly enjoyed. There is a grilled lamb stir fry and also a lamb sandwich to round out the native selections. The sandwiches and burgers are a definite twist on the common offering. Sandwiches are served either a tortilla or fry bread and come with such toppings as eggs/bacon/onions/fire roasted green chiles, eggs/grilled spam, or two burger choices. Lastly there are the stews... yummo! They have the standard red and green, but also offer up a monthly special (this month was a very tasty vegetable style). Stews are served in two sizes, which is particularly nice if you are sharing items. The decor is certainly nothing that stands out; the chairs and tables are a mosh of options, but it is clean, and the staff is very friendly and patiently answered questions. They have one high chair for those of you with little ones. It is a small place, so if you go during peak hours expect to wait for a seat or take your food elsewhere to eat it, as it fills up quickly. The final distinction is that the SH is open on Sundays from 11:00 to 5:00. So if you are dying for some of that unbelievable fried dough on the morning after a long night out and had to previously wait until Monday, this could definitely be a saving grace. It's great to have another option and I truly hope that they will build a following in the Central Phoenix area.Having driven by this area weekly, I only noticed Damelos Bakery & Pizzeria; maybe it's their bright signage? On my way home I saw the sign, Sacred Hogan, and immediately flipped a bitch. Frybread and I have a deep connection, it used to be the only reason why I would even go to the State Fair, well that and a foot long corn dog, but that's another story.I was greeted by a very woofy guy, thick goatee, nice calves and belly... Ah yes, frybread. After looking over the menu I ordered the B.R.G., which is a bean, red chile and green chile Navajo taco ($8.79).Now I didn't see my taco until I got it home since I got it to go... When I opened the box I swear there was a white light emanating from its center, their tacos are HUGE, ENORMOUS, PORTLY, and well, LARGE! I could sense its mightiness when I was handed the box, but I had no idea until I had it fully exposed. My mouth began to water as I opened to take in the hot and thick goodness, my saliva acting as a lubricant to get the whole thing in. Its girth was only trumped by its heft; it took 2 hands just too barely manage it to my face. At the last second I chickened out, what was I doing? What would the Mr. think of me if he saw me like this, face to face with a potential love affair? Cutting it into more manageable pieces was the right thing to do. The meat in the red and green chile was so tender and well seasoned it just melted with each bite.At the halfway point I figured I would save half for later since it was so large but I couldn't resist its chewy texture and savory allure. Yes *sniff* *sniff*, I ate the whole thing, every last bite including the tender beans that fell out of the sides!!! With no shame and no guilt, I waddled into the bedroom fell onto the bed and took a 2 hour nap. Sometimes life just doesn't get much better than this. I feel like I need a cigarette.Amazing! As a tourist in these parts--I encourage fellow tourists to make this place an eating priority when visiting Phoenix. When looking for a food gem out of town, Sacred Hogan rates off the charts. The place isn't much to look at. It's a tired looking spot in a rugged srip-center, but what it dishes out as far as food is spectacular. I was lured here by Alexander C's description of the frybread taco. The description seemed unreal, fictional--beyond the scope of human comprehension. I was floored to actually see it on the menu. I went with the red chile taco and a frybread all on its lonesome with honey as desert. The taco is just as luminous as Alexander C. describes it. Furthermore, the Navajo Taco tastes just as amazing as it looks. I'm going to have to make this place a personal pilgrimage. The frybread on it's own is an equal delight. What was the icing on the cake? Shasta soda in the cooler. Nostalgia and deliciousness--it doesn't get any better than this!After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread*ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness. My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad! To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!I can't vouch for the sacredness of anything here but the frybread was very good.  My daughter got one with powdered sugar.  It had a lighter and more airy quality than other frybread I have tried thus far. Given, I've only had frybread 3-4 times in my life, but compared to the other ones Sacred Hogan's was lighter.  For frybread.  Is that sort of a foodie oxymoron?  Light frybread?  Hmm.The atmosphere is pretty basic.  I will give them another try for a meal sometime.  I'm sure even though their frybread is lighter a meal on frybread is not something to toy with.  Seriously.  I've had a meal on frybread before it has been large enough to share or hold you through several meals.

Review Text :
Unbelievably disappointing.  My dad and I drove from the city out here because he used to love DeBlasio's.  This meal was awful, and the service was worse.The bread that started the meal was good.  We both got wedding soup, which was acceptable as well.  We ordered fried zucchini to start, which was huge and not bad but nothing special.  I ordered the manicotti, and my dad ordered stuffed shrimp with a side of pasta.  However, I hate half of a tube of manicotti and threw the rest away when I got home.  The sauce was DISGUSTING.  Too much pepper and no real taste.  My dad ate a bit of the pasta and threw it away as well.  He said the shrimp was rubbery and there was no crab in the stuffing.  At close to $20 a plate, this place sucked.On top of all of this, our waitress was rude and nasty.  She was unpleasant through the entire meal, refused to refill our waters, and didn't ask when both meals went untouched.  She boxed the meals without asking if we wanted them, and made passive aggressive comments throughout the meal.This place is awful.  If you are going to insist on coming, order a fried zucchini and go somewhere else for dinner.  This is a step below an Olive Garden.  The only people in here are senior citizens that have been coming for years.  Avoid.

My Milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... Mmmmm yes they do make a great shake, the glass is rimmed with the most sweetest and thick caramel one could imagine. Really adds a nice taste blend with a vanilla shake when you scrape the sides of the glass with your spoon! Can you say "Mouth Orgasm"?I used to dine here a lot with my boyfriend Chris as he lived around the corner from Snaps. We ate here several times a month for close to a year and a half so we have tried many meals here! We still talk about our old Snaps days, lolol. Yes, seriously the restaurant is called "Snaps".Service is hit and miss, sometimes we are ignored and sometimes they are up my ass with servicing me. The food quality is good and so are the portions. I really like having breakfast here, I think that is really their specialty.Can't go wrong with denver omelet, pancakes, french toast and their signature skillets. Make sure you are HUNGRY! I have also tried from the Chinese menu and they make a great sweet and sour shrimp. Huge shrimps, mmmmm. They have a great sourdough burger in which I believe they now call the "Frisco" burger. Mmmmm try it, you will see what I am excited about. I have to cut this burger down with a knife every time just to fit it all in my mouth to eat. Thick buttery fried sourdough bread, bacon, guacamole, double cheese, 1/4 Angus patty, lettuce, tomato, purple onion and fried onion strings. Mmmmmm is soooooo good! Prices are reasonable however are slowly increasing lately and the restaurant is very comfortable with booths and tables. Snaps is located inside of the Eastside Cannery.Try it!

Wanting some spice in our life, we headed in the direction of food from the Hunan province.  Our usual go to spot would be Yun Nan Garden, but we decided to change it up a bit and give its neighbor "Dong Ting Spring" a chance.  It's conveniently located right next door to Yun Nan and taking a peek inside, you can see which one has more customers.  That's okay though, we're an adventurous bunch and we'll give any place a go!  (It doesn't hurt that all their reviews are between a four and five star.)Walking in, we were warmly greeted by the waitress and shown to a table.  She asked in Mandarin if we wanted tea or water (or at least I think that's what she asked.)  We confirmed tea and it arrived quickly, along with a menu.Utilizing Tony T.'s posted pics, it helped with our dinner choice.  We figure it was a bit of gamble, but was confident we'd be satisfied.  After putting in our order, the waitress asked us how we wanted our spice level and we chose medium.* Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot ($11.95) - The first dish to arrive and it comes sizzling with a flame below it.  It's a combination of mushrooms, some sort of meat, peppers, and packed with flavor.  Great choice!   * Shredded Potatoes with Vinegar Sauce ($6.95) - We discovered this shredded potato dish at Yun Nan and really enjoy it.  But when it comes with vinegar sauce, woah - what a tangy contrast!  One bite and I knew the Husband would be loving this dish.  Something so simple and basic, but yet has so much flavor.  We're down with the potatoes!Steamed rice is 50 cents per person.Service - although English is limited here, the friendly face and patient look on the waitress's face makes ordering and eating here a much better and pleasant experience than other Hunan restaurants in town.Although it's not quite as busy as their neighbor, we did notice families eating in the back and a group of regulars arrive shortly after us.  So they do have a steady following.Overall, you can't go wrong with Hunan food.  It's just so full of flavor, spice, and kick.  Their food is far from bland.Our only downfall was not making this a group thing.  The more the merrier, and in this case that means more dishes to try and share!  Next time you want to add some spice in your life, do it with a group - it's always better that way!

Review Text :
Ok. I was so excited to ride my bike to a new old town breakfast joint. We walked in and I was sooooo excited to try the food. Decor is precious and it is a perfect location for a breakfast spot with plenty of parking for bikes and cars. I just don't think they are going to need much parking in the future....unless they get their act together, this place is going to get a VERY bad reputation.Just like the 1st reviewer said, you don't get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression. We sat down and it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. I ordered orange juice and it came in a clear plastic cup with a lid, as if I was not planning on staying for a meal or something. My friends got coffee and had to ask several times for re-fills, as our watiress could not possibly have been less attentive.We placed our food order and were chatting and having fun, but 1 hour goes by-----YES, 1 HOUR-----and we realize we had been forgotten. We were all starving and if 5 more minutes had gone by, I would have walked right out! When we flagged down our waitress, who hadn't checked in with us for 1 hour, she said there are 2-3 tables ahead of us in the kitchen. We start looking around and noticed that people who came in at the same exact time had already eaten and left. Most of my group was willing to wait, since we had already waited an hour. We waited 15 minutes more and our meals come out. I order the "3 eggs". It is supposed to be served with toast and jam, meat, fruit and potatoes. I got 3 runny scrambled eggs, which I didn't eat, no fruit and no jam....The manager Sally came over to apologize, once she had heard about our experience and comped our 6 person table's meals. It was probably the best thing they could have done because I'm pretty sure other patrons were noticing what was happening with our table. It was the right thing to do. Today was apparently the 1st day of table service, which was the excuse for why our meals took so long. I guess they were trying to do the 'pay at the register 1st, then bring your food to the table' thing, but they said that wasn't working. I think this place needs to sit down with some successful restaurant owners and learn that service is just as important as the food. If our waitress had checked in at the 15 or 30 minute mark, we might all have been a little more enthusiastic about this place. Hopefully, the owner of this restaurant knows about yelp and is seeing all these bad reviews roll in. They need to turn things around quickly, if they are going to survive.I'm with Karri - I think that perhaps the proprietors have seen the reviews because I had an A-OK experience at Bacon this morning... or perhaps it's just that they had a very slow beginning?!Either way, I was so impressed!I left the gym and checked my phone to see a missed call and a text from Jared.  Here's what the text said (typos and all):"Headed to the bacon joint for quik brekfast its 10:20 right now..."So I called him and put in my order - something healthy please!I arrived ten minutes later to see Jared sitting at the bar of this pretty nice looking place.  Maryanna, the bartender/server took my order for iced tea and iced water and literally a few minutes later, I had my drinks and a beautiful egg white omelet with broccoli and mushrooms alongside a cottage cheese salsa and fresh fruit.  (FYI - this dish is called "the yogi" on the menu).  Although Jared had previously ordered me toast to go with it, I saw that they had whole wheat wraps and Maryanna promptly changed my order.  It was the perfect breakfast after a workout!Jared had the whole wheat pancakes with blueberry sauce and whipped cream and while I didn't taste them, they smelled amazing.  He must've enjoyed them because he 'almost' cleaned his plate!I was pleased to see that Bacon also makes a fruit, granola, and yogurt parfait and protein shakes with real fruit and protein.  They have a pretty huge coffee and tea menu as well as booze including "the bacon mary," mimosas, sunrise martinis, and more... In addition, they are green friendly!  That's right - they use biodegradable cups for to-go drink orders!Oh - and in addition, they serve some pretty yummy sounding lunch offerings from 11am - 3pm as well.Maryanna told me they did have a slow start with service, etc... but I think they are back on track now.  If you haven't been, go check it out.  And if you have been, give 'em another shot.  Tell Maryanna I say hi!  Maybe I'll even see you there as I plan on returning again real soon too!Sadly, I had to put my handsome son Zachary and his lovely wife Sarah on a plane back to San Jose...the visit was done...they needed to get back to their real life and quit hanging out with the old man.But, before they boarded the Greyhound Bus of the skies, they needed a hearty breakfast to tide them over for their arduous journey!Bacon lay right in the flight path:)It wasn't exactly on a direct line between the Valley Ho and Sky Harbor, but I didn't let that deter me from getting my kids a decent meal before their flight!And it was a decent meal...more than decent...it was pretty good:)I know Bacon opened recently and that they had some early "teething" problems (why do we call it teething problems?...the restaurant is not a "baby" and will not actually grow anything with enamel on it...it just doesn't make sense to me:)Zach and Sarah each got versions of bacon and eggs (I guess the breakfast meat nomenclature was too much for them to overcome:)I had sausage and eggs with the home fries...did you know that they toss their home fries in brown gravy before they serve them? I did not know that until the plate arrived, but the gravy earns them a "kudos"  (and an extra star:) from me...Gravy makes everything better, including breakfast:)The service was very good...I know, I know...it was 10:00 am on Wednesday morning and the place only had 6-7 customers, but Blake (our server) was friendly and attentive and helped Sarah get her order exactly correct.The portions are very large (not "Claim Jumper" huge, but more than I could eat for breakfast). Three big eggs, three large sausages, four thick pieces of wheat toast, a big pile of gravied home fries and a fruit cup...for under $9.00:)A good value, a good time and a good meal...maybe Bacon's teeth have grown in:)If you want to get someplace on time and you want me to find it you need to allow for some getting lost time.  GPS was invented for guys like me and I don't happen to own one.  In addition to finding this place I had been asked to find another place as well for future reference.  So after 3 trips around Scottsdale Mall (which really needs one of those map thingies) I found the first place and off I went on foot for Bacon.  Using Google I had picked out exactly where the building should be and walked right past it and by the time I crossed the bridge I was getting worried.  So I went a ways down 5th and still didn't see it so I headed back the way I came knowing I had a couple of other options for breakfast.  The sign over the door is much easier to spot heading south.Bacon shares an address with Devils Martini and in fact may be dual usage of the same space.  I know there were Devils Martini placards on the tables.  If they do share the same space it would explain why it looks more like a bar/lounge inside than a coffee shop.  In any event I walked past it the first time without looking close because the building and parking signs I saw first said Devils Martini.  I didn't think to ask the question so maybe somebody will fill this West Valley person in with the answer.  In any event the easiest way to find it is to look for Vidal Sasoon and Bacon is across the street.I was greeted quickly walking in the door and I took a high top with a view out the window.  The person who seated me got my orange juice and soon Tori, my server, came to take my order.  I ordered the first thing I saw that included gravy and potatos.  I think it was called the Big Pig ($9.50, I could be wrong on the name) and when it came that is sure what I felt like (see picture).  3 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages, ham, potatoes with gravy, baked beans with more bacon, fruit cup and a large English muffin.  More like a breakfast for 2 and if I had had a phone number for somebody I saw shortly afterward I would have offered.  In total volume I managed to finish off about 3/4 of it.Food.  I had no problems with the quality of any of it.  Overall it was very good.  The orange juice was about 1/2 ice cubes which was fine at the start but very watered down tasting by the end of the meal.  Subjective to my taste buds the German style sausages did not deliver, I thought they were too fatty/liquidy and lacked any real flavor.Service.  Tori waited on me hand and foot without being intrusive.  I did not have my camera with me and she showed me how to make the one in my phone work.  Looking around all the customers seemed pleased to be there.  One of the nice things about eating in the first wave before the crowds arrive is nobody has had a chance to ruin the servers day so everybody is pleasant.Waitress warned us when we got here that two tables had already bailed after waiting an hour + for food... ...So an hour + later we got our food, and the check comped by the manager... seems they have some issues in the kitchen and with communication. First they claim they lost our order, and then brought the wrong food - 3rd time was a charm though.The food is good and the menu is refreshing for a breakfast place. For Scottsdale's sake I hope they get it together.Poutine...a single word that can convey so much meaning!If you are a Canadian, the words and melody from "O Canada" begin to ring in your ears, as your chest swells with pride and you think, of all the Canadian exports...Gretzky, Oil...Pamela Anderson...this is the best:)If you are cardiac surgeon, you smile as contemplate your next Porsche, purchased with the fees received for the double, triple and quadruple bypass operations you will be able to perform on Poutine lovers:)If you are the folks at Bacon, you apparently think "what can we add to this to make it even "healthier":-)The Beautiful Carin and I took our lovely daughter, Whitney, to Bacon for breakfast this morning.Neither had been there and this was good chance for them to give it a try:)They had the "Yogi"...not named for the bear and the Yogi does not include a "pic-a-nic basket":)The Yogi is an incredibly healthy vegi and egg white omelet, that they both professed to really love:)Carin says this place stays in the rotation, so I know she was happy:)And when Carin is happy, I am happy:)I was almost transformed into a semi-vegetarian just by my proximity to their breakfast entrees!Fortunately, I saw "The Hangover" on the menu and I was saved:)The Hangover has a base of Poutine (french fries and popcorn cheese, covered in gravy:)...so bad, yet sooooo good:)What they do then is magical...they throw ham and bacon on top of the poutine and then slide 3 over easy eggs on top of that:-)I don't know who the genius was, that invented this little breakfast miracle, but I want to shake his or her hand before I have my coronary:)Sunday morning...no wait...great service today and everything was tasty and fresh!Tell me again why there's line at Breakfast Club?Bacon makes everything better. I know vegetarians who long for thick, salty slab of bacon. Crumbled on salads. Nestled between smoked turkey and baby Swiss. In potato salad. Reveered pastry chef Tracy Dempsey is famous for her bacon brittle. Yep. Even in candy. Bacon! Rejoice! So, needless to say I was excited to eat at Bacon. When we arrived I was loving the open, airy room with a bar straight ahead and lots of table options from booths to high tops. The doors were open and a lovely breeze entertained the room. But I got that vibe. Like we just arrived after some crazy ass rush. And I was correct. We waited a bit for our server to arrive, busied ourselves with a New York Times (for me) and a March issue of W Magazine (for Rickie...go figure!). We overheard a couple at the bar mention they'd been waiting 45 minutes for their food. UGH! I was ready to gnaw on the table I was so hungry. Well, we placed our order and received it within 15 minutes. And. It. Was delicious! Eggs Benedict (for me) and the Mr. Big (for Rickie...go figure!) did not disappoint. In lieu of Canadian bacon, I had a thick slab of ham...a little too much for the dish...but no major complaint. Everyone from the hostess, the GM and the bartenders and servers were very friendly. Though I felt for them, as brunch is THE hardest shift in the business. I always equated brunch (at least when I lived in West Hollywood) as hungover guests being served by hungover waiters. Dicey vibe baby. Can't wait to return to Bacon. Hoping, however, they up the OJ from a Sunny D like product to freshly squeezed.I've given this place 3 trys. Bacon struck out 3 times. You know what they say...its 3 strikes and yoouuuurrree out!!! Every time the kitchen is SUPER slow and every time, something was wrong with the order. One late Sunday, we (2 ppl) waited 45 minutes for our food. The restaurant was NOT even busy at this hour. I was starving!! Wait! On top of that, the servers suck!!! Two out of my three experiences included sucky service! They don't know the menu, they forget stuff, get the order wrong, neglect you....etc....To make it worse, the food simply isn't all that great and definitely not creative. You know those places where the food is so damn good (IE Breakfast Club) that the long wait is worth it? Or an overwhelmed server is forgiven? Yeah! But not the case here. They really need to step up their game. Especially in this economy! OMG! I almost forgot to mention their incredibly overpriced alcoholic beverages!! The location is great. Has a ton of potential ONLY if they revamp the service and the food.

I finally made it over to Jr's. I had 3 piece cod with frys, the kids had a burger and the fish and shrimp combo. Everything was made correctly and tasted excellent. The fish was not greasy, the frys did not taste fishy, the burger was perfect for the kid. The tarter sauce was good too. I will be back to try some more things. Only downfall was they were out of lemons and had one bottle of malt vinegar to share in the whole place. Oh and they charge for credit or debit purchases.

This was a classic experience where Less Is More could have been employed to make it better.  After passing by this joint many times, my Mom and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday.I ordered the Triple Cheese Burger (Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone) with a side of Thai Slaw.  Mom ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (Cajun Chicken blackened in an iron skillet, topped with onions, peppers and melted jack cheese with a cajun mayo on a ciabatta roll) with a side of Thai Slaw.Here's the breakdown....the Burger has a lot of potential.  I like to put Cole Slaw on my Burger, so I put some of the Thai Slaw on it.  It was juicy, but there was simply too much Cheese on it.  I couldn't taste the Burger and the Cheese flavors were indistinguishable.  The Thai Slaw has some serious potential too, but it was way too runny.  After the first few bites of the Slaw, the bowl was full of liquid so the rest of the Slaw was 'soupy'.....too much sauce and very, very sweet.  Also, there was a ton of Peanuts in the Slaw.  I don't know if they meant to do that, but it overwhelmed the flavor....also, I expect a Thai Slaw to have some heat in it...their version doesn't.I had 1/2 of Mom's Blackened Chicken Sandwich....again, they should employ the Less Is More Rule here.  The Sandwich was topped with a bunch of Grilled Onions, then fresh Onions....it was Onion overload!  The Chicken had a good, char-smoked flavor, but was lacking a Spicy Kick that I would expect from a Cajun flavored Chicken.Overall, it was a good experience....not great, but good.Will I return?  I probably will to try other items on the menu.

Wow, last review was from 2009.  I guess I would update.  They have changed owners  from the original set when they first started.  I ordered take out.  Again it is Friday and my laziness kicks in.  I got:Chicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok "breathe" or air when you open the containerCreamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion, but the soup seemed bland..  But the crispy wontons I ordered extra and a little salt fix that up.Chicken with Cashew Nuts - Yummy!!  Perfect!I need to stop by for a sit down meal soon!!!

Review Text :
We should've known to take our business elsewhere by the previous Yelp reviews and the fact that McFadden's was not so crowded.  But I think my group of five was giddy over getting last minute amazing seats to the Bon Jovi concert, that we just wanted to get a quick bite and a beer and head into the show.The service was ok until the food arrived and it took a good five minutes to get napkins, forks, and water... The food was decent but nothing special at all.  I had the salmon entree (served with mashed potatoes and spinach) and the others went with chicken wings and chicken fingers (both served with french fries).Needless to say, our time at McFadden's was the lowlight of the evening.  (And yes, I just made up the word lowlight!) The concert was incredible!  I will not be returning to McFadden's since there are plenty of other options to grab a bite before heading in to Jobing.com Arena.I came here a few weeks ago for a birthday, and that calamity was bad enough.  I held off on the bad review until I gave them another shot.  Well I did and they failed even harder.1st trip -- we had reserved a table for a birthday, and as reservations were made it was made clear to us that if we weren't there by 9:00 they would give our table away.  So we arrive at 8:45 and they make it out to be a big inconvenience to them that we arrived......15 minutes early.  Nothing was setup, and they scrambled to get a "party" table put together (which I don't think ever reached the size we had reserved).  All decorations became "we could put ________ on the table but........we'd need for you all to get up".  So after all this I thought it could be a fluke, so we gave them another shot last night......2nd trip -- Had a friend come in from England and he wanted to go to the bars at Westgate.  God forbid he wore shorts on his trip to.........Arizona, so we weren't allowed in.It's Thursday night. And no matter how hard you try, you are not a Scottsdale bar.Choke on your impending failure.We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.  I should have known better to dine without checking Yelp first.  We got seated and the hostess notified us that she is also our server.  She took our drink orders.  And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.IRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.CHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.  The fries were  good!Service was actually good.  The food is not so good.30 mins sitting at a table, waitress never showed. Walked out with nothing. Why does this place exist?Ummmmmmm not the best thing that has ever happened to me, but fun for a girls night out.  I would not recommend this place for a date-- it seems to be better for groups and hoes.Yeah, definitely groups and hoes.I have never tried the food here.Ever.This last time there was no cover since a buddy did the happy hour route-- which is: if you have like 8 people total, give them your name and guarantee those people will be there, they will give you a "host bracelet" and free drink coupons, and the rest of your group will get bracelets which gives them $2 well drinks and $2 beer (nothing fancy, so you've got to like Bud Light)It is right across from this country themed bar with a mechanical bull, so that's a fun distraction for a while... but it's not like either of these places are Vegas-class or anything.additionally...Do NOT drink and drive.Like ever.But ESPECIALLY from this place-- there are cops EVERYWHERE.Cops standing right outside the doors looking for the drunkies... cop cars parked all over the parking lot.Don't be afraid to get into the passenger seat of your car, toss those keys into the backseat and take a niiice looonnng nap until you're sober, or someone comes to pick you up.ENJOY!You know how the guy on ESPN uses the catchphrase "Useful....useful shot"?Well, this review is Useful....if you want a shot. Go here, it suits you well.~Fud/Drink~I smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  "Why did I come here.....?"~Atmosphere/ServiceJust when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway.... ~Extras/Rating~You might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks. There are so many better options in this center. I mean, seriously.Am I getting too old for this?Me thinks not!  Granted I'm not the youngest cat in the crowd, but I think I deserve some love don't I?  Well I guess not at McFadden's. I might not be that young lad that buys drinks for everyone and continue to pound down shots of liquor in the attempt to get myself drunk anymore.  However, I'm the guy that can actually afford it without burning a hole in my wallet - wink!  Maybe you should be looking my way next time instead of continue to serve the drunk dude down the bar who probably shouldn't be drinking anymore unless tent city is the next destination for him.  Loud obnoxious drunks and college frat party like atmosphere only goes so far.  Let's just keep it where it belongs because I really don't know if it should be public thing unless it's a place called Vegas.  Westgate is no Vegas!  I can party with the best, but even I felt uncomfortable here.  Let's just say if a fight broke out I wouldn't be surprised.  Patio is nice, but without a smoke vent is sucks -- yes I know the "patio" needs a smoke vent!  Unfortunately a bad experience this time; we'll see if I ever return to do a follow-up. - Enjoy!The food was ok, the service was mediocre... I would probably give this place three starts but...I checked my credit card statement a few days after going to this place and found that I had been charged and extra $20! I called to try to get that taken care of. I was told that the manager was unavailable and would give me a call back. I did not receive a call back, so I called again two days later. Still no call back. I called again today and nobody answered, so I chose the option to leave a message for the general manager. His voicemail is full!Sooo now I guess I'm left with the option of filing a police report and contacting my credit card company.McFadden's, that's STEALING and it's wrong! I will not be going back here, and I recommend anyone who goes here pays cash!!This place SUCKSSSSSSSS. Drinks are expensive and they charge a cover sometimes. A cover!?!? Idk if they still but last time I was there they did and I was like wtf. Only paid it cuz a few friends were inside already but never again. Service is horrible and then they allow people to dance on the bars which was gross and almost knocked over my drink. Skip this place.Depressing. Not a good sign. Completely dead on a Saturday night in the middle of Westgate. I get that there are a couple of other choices in westgate but we decided to pop in here. BIG mistake. Their menu is the typical Irish bar fare,  greasy and should've been perfect after a day of drinking. Unfortunately, this was not the case. All we wanted were pretzels. Seeing they had it on their HH menu we assumed we could just order the more expensive plate not at the discounted HH rate. Ummm, no. They won't serve anything that's on their HH menu unless it's HH. The service was poor-my friend preferred to compare them to a smelly bottom body part. We asked them what beer they had on tap and were told "we have a lot, do you want them to name them ALL?" Huh? I'm sorry that we came into your life and inconvenienced you seeing that your only purpose to be in front of us is to serve us and make sure we have a positive experience in your establishment. Clearly, that was too much to ask for at McFaddens. I've never had such a poor experience in my life. The food was mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting.Maybe, this space is cursed. The Other place that was here shut down too. Seeing all the reviews on here and being at a 1.5 stars should be a sign. Shut your doors and close up all ready.This one is pretty simple. Only good to grab a drink, maaaaaaaaybe two, before a game and move onNot even nice for a sports bar. The bathrooms could use a lot of work. The stainless steel stalls of the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this.The bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased.We had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now. It seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display. I don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future.If I could I would give the place negative stars. The staff was EXTREMELY rude not just one but all 5+ that we encountered. It was not for a lack of trying on our part... We were friendly tried to make conversation and tipped well but still couldn't even get a smile out of the staff. The later you are at this place the more questionable the crowd becomes. Felt VERY unsafe. I will never return and have told all my friends to do the same. Sucks to have to post such a negative review.It the worst bar ever.  I'm With the band Los Lobos. And security let us in and after 35 minutes a little security guy came and ripped the sun glasses off Cesar Rosas and got there manager Armando Tavares in a choke Hold for no reason.  They refused to give him his credit card back till he called the police. And all of a sudden they found it. We will never go back to this bar Or town no matter how much they pay us!!!We are Seahawk fans and wanted to come to this so-called Seahawks bar to watch the Superbowl to be with other Hawks fans. Here was our experience:1) We paid $105 per person for standing space since the place was fully booked. It said the price included a buffet of food. They had a couple trays of nachos and wings for hundreds of people. 2) Waiting in line was so confusing. We were supposed to have access to it from 4pm-end of the game. Waited for an hour; fought through the line to ask the host, he had no clue of what was going on and said we were in the right line. Found out later that we were in the walk-in line, not the line with people who had reserved a spot (this was a blob of people, not a line). We finally fought our way into the bar.3) Whenever the Patriots scored, someone blew a horn.. Seahawks bar?? Not to mention some Pats fan (a guy) pushed me when I fought my way to the bathroom.4) When we lost the game, they played the song "We are the Champions".. WTF. I would rather they just slap me in the face directly.The whole experience was awful. At some point some punk Patz fan threw (Yes, he really threw it!) a tray of unfinished food on a large table of Seahawk fans and then wanted to fight. Sauces and food went flying everywhere and got on people's shirt.After the game, not only they trash talked, they also took off their shirts (the guys) and flung it around and wanted to fight. The whole reason we picked a Hawks bar was because we want to be with other real Hawks fans. This is a flip-flopping bar. Whoever wins, they support. Overpriced, overcrowded, rude staff. Never again...Yep No shock here why the owner of Calico also owns McFaddens and guess what? They both suck! The staff is run by bimbo teens who couldn't tell you there ass from there head ...when you say you can have your burger cooked to how you like (medium) and then when I bite into it it's cooked fully through...that's not cooked to order (waitress was also some teen bimbo) between McFaddens and Calico Jacks they are the eye sore of Westgate ...avoid going to either at all costs.....and when it's night time and it turns into a "bar" watch out for the asshole security ppl at the front door and throughout the place they take there jobs way too seriousThis review is LONG OVERDUE. When you read reviews saying this is quite possibly the worst restaurant/bar, they are not exaggerating. I have been here MANY times.. Mainly because it's convenient for my friends who live on the west side, and also because it's easy to go to after the coyotes game. Don't get me wrong, this place used to be mediocre a few years ago, and it wasn't dreadful. Now I am seriously SHOCKED when I hear it is still open.Let me give you a little run down of the experience here... They are DESPERATE to get people in. If you are on their "VIP" email list they will legit email you every weekend and say you have won, and you can get free drinks from 9-11. And when you get there... They don't have the AC on and they will have all the doors open so it's 115 inside. You will be sweating and crying and wondering where your life went wrong that you had to come to mcfaddens.The music is usually good.. That's the ONLY plus.. And I mean ONLY. They give free shots to girls every Friday and Saturday and usually it's fireball. They will make them get on the bar and dance.. It's usually pretty entertaining to watch. The drinks are WEAK. They have this Asian male bartender who will ALWAYS get on the bar and take his shirt off and do some sort of weird breakdancing. He thinks he is God's gift to earth. this is also very entertaining. They like to throw hundreds of napkins in the air and scatter the entire dance floor. Not only is this extremely annoying, it's also disrespectful and wasteful. It's makes me cringe. And they get stuck to your shoe and you look like a teenager from a bad 90's movie who is coming out of the bathroom with toilet paper on her shoe.If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, go in and order a beer, stand in the corner and watch the shit show commence. You're welcome.I could go into detail as many have about the multiple terrible experiences encountered here, but to keep it as accurate and short.. EVERY ASPECT OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS TRASH. If yelp had a negative rating this place would not be 1.5 rated, but more like -4 star rated.

Review Text :
As much as I still love Yola's for its ambiance and great-tasting coffee, unfortunately my last experience there was quite disappointing and felt I needed to update my review. A friend and I were there on Dec. 30, around noon. We approached the counter to order and were told we'd have to wait a few minutes. No big deal, although they do seem to be consistently understaffed at busier times. We ordered two coffees in mugs and were told they were out of mugs. Again, not a huge deal but couldn't understand how this could be when they always default to paper unless a mug is specified, which isn't often. Sensing my disappointment, my friend found a used mug and handed it to the barista. We sat down next to a table containing items that previous guests had left behind (two coffee cups and used napkins), despite a nearby trash receptacle and dirty dish station. Why some people can't clean up after themselves is beyond me. However, as another reviewer pointed out and because this is a considerable issue, Yola's needs to have signs reminding people to return used dishes and dispose their trash. And so we waited. And waited. And waited some more. It was a good 30 minutes before our coffees arrived. I took a sip and it was obvious my latte was not made correctly, requiring a return trip to the service counter. Similar errors have occurred on past visits, making me question their order-fulfillment system. My companion and I lingered for a couple hours, talking and drinking. We were approached at 2pm with an announcement that they would be closing at 2:30. What?? I asked why and was told "Oh, just because of the holiday and everything." Ummm.... what holiday? Mind you, there was no sign on the door or counter area indicating the early closing time, and there were several confused customers still in the shop. Thankfully, we had finished our coffee, but we left baffled and unhappy.Although Yola's is still a nice, cozy place for coffee/breakfast/lunch, I think they need to work on a few things to improve service and the overall enjoyment of their guests. If the owners are reading, I would also suggest installing blinds or shades on the large expanse of south-facing windows. It's almost impossible to sit near the window on a sunny day, unless you like being blinded. It also gets very hot. Lastly, 4:30 is kind of an odd closing time. Staying open until at least 5 or 6pm seems more reasonable and customers wouldn't feel so rushed.I'm impressed what a great lil café. Black coffee and baked oatmeal and yogurt. The oatmeal is to die for. Its your typical coffee house/café. Its comfortable and wasn't to packed so I was able to just eat and chill. Kinda wishing I would've order a few pastries to go. I'll probably head back for lunch after shopping the menu looks really good

Review Text :
Stopped by after lunch at Thai Taste (awesome food, btw!) two doors down.  It was CnF's grand opening week.  I immediately posed my food allergy questions to the manager/owner Hitesh, who went into the kitchen and quickly emerged with the pastry chef, who informed me that their chocolate croissants ($1.75) are corn-free (no baking powder in the batter, and neither corn syrup nor powdered sugar were used in the chocolate ganache filling and frosting).  Out of the individually-sliced French cakes, I could only try the "chocolate-chocolate" cake (I swear this is what Hitesh called it), $2.50 plus tax.  Again, no baking powder used in the cake, and only semi-sweet chocolate chips and heavy cream in the ganache filling/frosting!  How did they taste?  I loved the croissant's ganache filling.  The pastry, however, didn't fare so well.  With the exception of a very few flaky nibbles, most of the bites instantly felt gummy, like I was chewing on leather.  (Have you ever chewed on a moist piece of dried mango?  Yeah, something like that.)  No exquisite bites of buttery flaky crust that descend onto the tongue... I decided to just throw the bread away, but not without eating all the chocolate first!  But, oh, the chocolate-chocolate cake!!  Do yourselves a GRAND favor and buy a slice today!  One of the best chocolate cakes I've had in a long, long time!  (I've had to pass on so many recipes...)  So moist, and so devilishly good!  If I were the pastry chef, I'd give it the unoriginal, but spot-on name of "Devil's Food" cake!  The chocolate coin on top, however, was a big letdown.  Almost no flavor at all.  A waste of cocoa, that one.  I just tossed it away.I had asked if my nephew could sample their chocolate-chip cookie and was handed a shortbread cookie.  My sister, our Mom, and my nephew all gave the cookie the thumb's down.  (I couldn't try it due to a food allergen used.)  I hope this isn't a sign of the quality of their cookies, but no worries.  As long as Cakes N Flakes offer their chocolate-chocolate cake, people will come!p.s.  I finally received a reply to an email I sent inquiring about location address and website URL.  Looking over their online menu, I'm surprised to find out that Indian food is also being served here, alongside the pastries!  I did not spot any menu listings on the walls that advertised savory foods.  Now my sister and I willl have more reasons (as if we needed more than one reason, the cake!) to come by!

Review Text :
After our recent visit to the Sammy's L.A. Pastrami on Decatur, we were told that we need to visit the one on Tropicana.  Of course, this didn't take any persuading for the Husband who had his dinner planned out before he saw me.This location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.Sticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger "A 1/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone." ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!I was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!We also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.After we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.Of course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky! They also have gift certificates available at restaurant.com for this location.I have been going to Sammy's for a little less than a year after finding it on restaurant.com.  I liked it enough to purchase additional coupons for it, but I would only go once a month or once every 2 - 3 months.  I live on the West side of town and this is on the East side of town so it wasn't all that convenient..I had gone the other day after picking up a friend from the airport and when I presented my coupon I was told that as of November 1st, he, the owner was no longer going to accept the coupons.  I said I had more coupons at home.  He said I should bring in what I had and start using them before Nov 1st.   I had 5 more coupons.  The next day I called him to verify the use of the coupons.  I also asked him, since he wasn't going to be accepting them anymore can I use more than 1 since there was going to be 4 of us going there the next day.  He said, "one coupon per email per day".  I said fine.  Next day rolls around and I bring in 3 friends, he said I wasn't going to be allowed to use them.   He said the rules state 1 coupon per month.  I said but you told me the other day, PLUS I called yesterday.  All he could do was repeat the rules of restaurant.com of one a month.  He said he loses money every time the coupons is used.  After he and I both were repeating each other in frustration, I finally got him to admit, "well, I changed my mind".At that point, my friends who I had also just picked up from the airport started to chime in to tell the owner off.  I was quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of my out of town guests.  (After I had told them what a great place this was for pastrami).At that point, we decided not to give him our patronage.  I will never be going back there again so his statement can hold true...he will lose money.I would have been perfectly all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupons in or to tell me when I called that I wouldn't be able to use them.  NOT for him to tell me AFTER i get there.  How inconsiderate!While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!PLEASE READMy husband saw the review for this place on the Travel Channel and we made it a point to stop in Las Vegas specifically to give this place a try on our way home to So. Cal. from Lake Powell.  HUGE mistake! My husband had the Pastrami Melt and before even finishing his last bite he had intense stomach cramps (approx. 4:30).  We spent the next two hours waiting for my poor husband who got serious food poisoning. He had not eaten anything since breakfast so we know with 100% certainty it was from the Pastrami Melt. I am not a fan of pastrami so thank goodness I didn't touch the pastrami. Aside from the hubby getting sick he didn't feel the Pastrami Melt was any better than others he had eaten elsewhere. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was extremely thin, not even a full chicken breast half. The chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-a is ten times better and less expensive. They won't give you a glass of water (we don't drink soda) but will gladly sell you bottled water. Only good thing was the Garlic Romano Fries. Overall the place was quite dirty (floors needed sweeping, tablecloths dirty and torn), very small and extremely hot inside. It's 113 degrees outside and they are too cheap to turn on the A/C??  Oh and no bathroom for customers. Makes me really wonder about how or why restaurants are selected to be featured on shows such as The Travel Channel.  Extremely disappointing.This place. Goodness. As far as food it was ok. I mean what's not to like. I ordered the Italian Beef (with no onions) and it tasted great. The fries could have been better, but I didn't really expect much considering. Why such a low review? Well, we went through the drive thru and even though there was only 1 other person in front of us it took over an hour. Honestly, I probably could say closer to 1.5 hours, but I fear no one would believe me because that is just insanity. If it wasn't for getting several people on board and figuring out their order prior to going there - as in if this was just for me- I would have surely left and gone ANYPLACE else. I just kept thinking, well, surely it will be soon. I can not imagine what the heck was taking so long? It's just outrageous. Honestly, no matter how good the food is, I will never be back. I don't have the time to wait 1-2 hours for a sandwich. It should also be noted that I only ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 order of fries. Although all of that is regardless because the majority of the wait was before he even got to me. Also, when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I was crazy and handed me a scratch piece of paper with nonsense written on it. The reason I asked for a receipt was because I thought he had over charged me slightly, but wanted to double check before saying anything. But clearly these people have no idea what's going on... so instead of saying anything I just decided that who cares, because I'm not returning. I had to give 2 stars, because the food is actually pretty decent. If anyone else braves the wait, good luck to you, I say! Seriously what a headache!

Review Text :
Great food! Great value good service! Need I say more?As others noted, I too noticed a considerable lack of good, creative brunch spots in Vegas.  Most places are the same ol', same ol'.  Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns.  The Cracked Egg doesn't deviate too much from this standard. It mostly offers typical breakfast fare - an assortment of omelets, pancakes, scrambles, etc.  If you're in the mood for something relatively unique they do have plenty of options for interesting omelet combinations, a delicious benedict ole (heart attack on a plate), and their "coffee cakes" - a standard side with many of the menu items - are divine (and flavors vary daily, it's not your typical coffee cake, they must use smooth as silk cake flower and maybe add in sour cream or something to give it creaminess and tang).  My favorite standard is the huevos rancheros.  A simple tasty sauce covers refried beans, eggs how you like them, sitting on a flour tortilla and topped with melted cheese and jalapenos.  It's simple, but they do it well.  Not too much cheese (I really don't need to eat 12 oz of cheese in a given meal like some places believe), medium spicy peppers, and plenty of beans, just how I like it!It's not the most unique food you can find (although it's as unique as any I've found in this city) nor is it on the top of the healthy list, but it's satisfying and consistent, reasonably priced, and has become my weekend go-to place!Management soured my experience. Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles.First of all I would like to start off by saying how much I used to love the Cracked Egg. My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug "don't care" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is "the food industry and that bugs happen". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, "well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared." !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for "politely" complaining, she said, "ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too." That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed."Breakfast (at) Epiphanies"I come here for breakfast on Saturdays. Just once in a while, though.I'm the brooding one at counter's end, staring at the wall like a poster boy for autism, solving complicated problems, arriving at life-changing realizations. I'm aware that I should instead be gazing slack-jawed at a cell phone like most others but I'm capable of occupying my mind without mini-screens. Besides, my cell phone is just a phone, and I only turn it on when I need to make a call.Anyway, the coffee is good here, and the food tastes like it should.Last time I got corned beef hash; it came with bell peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast, although you can substitute hash browns with seasoned potatoes if you want, and the toast with coffee cake for something sweet. Everything was good. I liked it.The time before I went with the cakes and eggs combo which arrived witheggs scrambled(my favorite way), two huge pancakes and sausage links, although you can order patties instead of links and bacon instead of sausage. I didn't care for the links so next time I'll get patties. But the cakes were good. Hot and fluffy like a freshly served souflee, which, I suppose, is kind of what pancakes are in a way.This location does get crowded so plan to wait unless you're an early bird like me. They are open for lunch as well and the link below will show you their fare.http://www.thecrackedegglv.com/cracked-egg-menu-0611.pdfIf you make it here some Saturday and see me at the counter, feel free to ask what I'm thinking about. But don't get mad if you don't like the answer. ;(The Cracked Egg is not the business. I found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.   I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh.

Review Text :
This gem is pretty close to work so i was able to check it out for lunch with a couple of my work mates. There were 6 people in my party and they were able to seat us immediately ...it was also 1230pm.   The place is small and intimate. Cute decor and very homey.  They have a simple no fuss italian menu.  Appetizers, sandwiches and bigger meals. Its BYOB. They had one vegetarian salad, one vegetarian wrap and entree. Our waiter was a bit dull and even maybe hangover?? very blah demeanor.  He also wasn't familiar with some of the items on the menu. i.e the salad of the day. However this was quickly redeemed by their white bean/olive oil vinaigrette dip that comes with the basket of bread. OMG delish i probably ate too much. It had the perfect kick and a great way to get the tummy ready for the entree.  I ordered the  lemon goat cheese ravioli with asparagus and it was delicious. A bit more cheesier than i expected but still extremely flavourful the asparagus was probably my favourite item on the plate. Fresh and not too raw or over cooked. The serving was big and i got to have some leftovers for dinner.One of  My meat eating friends got the chicken sandwich that shes still talking about. My glass of water was refilled frequently and so was my friends' ice teas. We also got our checks pretty quickly.  A+ for the fast service. Other than the lack of enthusiasm for life from our waiter, I thought this place was great. The lunch prices are also very reasonable. $11 for my ravioli and about 9/10 for sandwiches. At the end of the meal the chef came out to see how we liked our meals and he was cute and friendly thus adding one more star to this review. If you work in Bloomfield or shadyside this is a great place to check out for lunch. We were there for about 45 minutes and with the fast service you will be able to enjoy an amazing meal without getting on the boss's shit list.Sausalido, I'm into you!What a cute little place! Again, I ponder why it took me so long to come here. Maybe it's a hidden gem?? Whatever it is, I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu appealed to me, which is always a good sign. Oh yeah, also a good sign, deliciuos bread and hummus on the table!I was with a party of six and as soon as our food came out, I was struck by what a beautiful presentation it was. I mean, everything looked fresh and delicious, with a lovely looking plating to boot! I was in the mood for veggies, so I choose the roasted veggie wrap. It came LOADED with portabella mushrooms, red pepper, yellow squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrot, mixed greens, parmesan and white bean spread in a spinach tortilla. I also loved the balsamic dressing inside. It was just a nice refreshing meal for lunch. Not too heavy and definitely on the healthy side.I was VERY intrigued by the dinner menu though. I must come back soon to get some of the seasonal items (yum pumpkin!).Sausalido is truly a hidden gem in Bloomfield! Inventive, creative dishes, stellar service and BYOB. One can't ask much more. Reservations are recommended because it's not huge. I really like the upstairs space best because there's a bit more elbow room than downstairs, especially if you have a larger group. You're greeted with a chalkboard of the evening's specials - typically a fish of the day and other seasonal specialties. It's easy to order off that menu. Love the bread and bean dip they bring to the table and the smoked Gouda appetizer is not to be missed. We've ordered it every time. You can choose a dinner salad portion of any of their options or their soup to begin your meal. I'm hooked on their Beets & Bleu Salad and it's perfectly sized as a starter. Even though the menu changes regularly, the crab cakes are always there and they're delightful with a different flavor profile than a typical crab cake. My friend can't keep herself away from their pork chop which comes with a stellar presentation, as does their lamb. The fish special preparation changes regularly, too. We've also really enjoyed steak and pasta dishes. On our last visit we actually saved room for dessert and shared their chocolate, caramel, cashew bread pudding. Wow, it was amazing!Service during every visit has been perfect and our wine glasses never seem to be empty. Great restaurant!

Restaurant name  Lebowski's Neighborhood Grill

Review Text :
Meeting a couple of people here for a Yelp gathering, I was impressed. (Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!) Comfortable neighborhood style restaurant with great pub grub style food and an extensive selection of beers, local and faraway. I don't know if our service was typical - our Yelp status was common knowledge - but it was good. The waitress took great care of the table and was very helpful with beer selections.I had the hummus appetizer and really enjoyed it. Lots of garlic in there and good amount of pita pieces and tortilla chips for scooping it up. The beer was cold! Other selections at the table looked good too and the jerk teriyaki chicken wings smelled great!Plenty of parking with such an urban location. Out front and out back. Prices were pretty good, especially if you stick with the specials!Would I return? Absitively! I am considering volunteering the place for our Tuesday night guy's outing.UYE @Lebowski's 10/18/2009;     If you look at the name Lebowski's " Grill and Pub " its very deceiving....   I bet within a 1 mile radius  there is( Dave help me out) 30 or more places that  A)Serve Food B) Serve drinks and or combination of both so I guess it comes down to this.       If your going out to have a meal why settle for food that is not cooked  basically reheated ?  Diners want quality not something that was driven or flown half way across the county  just so it can make it to your plate! If you haven't been to Lebowski's for a meal or appetizers the last time you " Go" to where ever you "Go" just ask as I did and the taste tells " what is actually cooked?" .Then they will be glad to have you as a " regular" at Lebowsk'is!        If it's Spirits that your out for when was the last time you visited your " Favorite Place" and did not have something to eat? So we are back at square one.Why lower your expectations of the food just because, your having Drinks?You should not have too!!        When you go to Lebowski's you will learn very  very quickly as did our group of YELPERS  that this is a place that we will return to...Determined to shake up our Saturday lunch routine, hubs and I stopped by Lebowski's to try their famous wings and take in a bit of college football in the mean time. The first impression is a bit nondescript - Lebowski's looks like many other sports bars in Charlotte and has a nice little patio facing East Blvd. Because Mother Nature gave us a break from the 90s, we chose to sit outside and enjoy a relaxing lunch (hubs was especially happy as there are TVs outside, too!). Both the hostess and our server weren't the cheeriest of individuals...it seemed like they both had a long night out. Regardless, hubs went with the Carolina Gold wings and the Beef on Weck, I choose a side salad and the small version of the Chili & Mac 'n Cheese. Upon ordering our server informs us that the wings take about 15-20 minutes to cook. Um...ok...that's a little odd, but we would still like them. This was noon on a Saturday in a not-so-busy restaurants. Now, I'm not a wing eater but even hubs said that that's a long time to wait for six wings. So, basically the entire time we were joking with each other that the cook had to go fetch the chickens and take care of them so he could have his wings in less than 20 minutes. And yes, it did take 20 minutes for these wings to reach our table. I'll let hubs review his own food. As for mine...the salad was fresh but not too much to report. Their side salad included bits of iceberg and romaine, a flat crostini and a few other veggies. As for my Chili Mac 'n Cheese, it was pretty tasty albeit the chili was a bit sweet. I had a different expectation...when I saw a cup of chili mac 'n cheese I expected a cup of chili with a bit of mac 'n cheese at the bottom. I was a bit suprised when I saw a flat dish of mac 'n cheese with a small scoop of chili on top. No worries, though, I ate it up - it was a nice little serving. Will I be back to Lebowski's? Sure...for a few beers and maybe a snack, but I don't think it's going to make it into my trusty lunch spot list.Not sure why I had never reviewed this place yet.  I've been going here for years.  It seems to be the place Dilworth area bartenders go to eat after their bars close for the night.  Even though I had lived in Upstate NY for a year I actually heard about Beef on Weck from here, not Buffalo.  Now I make sure to get it when I go back up there, but I like Lebowski's Beef on Weck and Lebowski Burger.  The place caters to the northern transplant crowd and is packed when the buffalo football and hockey teams are playing.  There is a full menu of white russian type drinks.  The daily specials are usually a good deal too.My biggest issue is the parking lot is almost always a cluster.

Review Text :
Kareys Kitchen...a new takeout fusion restaurant near me in PHX..yay~! I attended the soft opening and got to sample all of the filipino/mexican fusion tasties! The family is so friendly that you leave Kareys feeling all warm inside.., whether from the food or the family, and your wallet not too hit! Cassava cake is the bomb..even though Im not to into sweets.. A bit hard to see from the street ..next to Blockbuster on 40th.. look for it..its worth it:-)Went Friday to take advantage of the special lechon (roasted pig).    I found the cafe cozy- nice, dark wood furniture and dark wood blinds.  Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler!  I found the high counter a little daunting- I, being only 5 feet tall, had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down, or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter, and have a look through the sneeze-guard.  Their labeling system needs improvement: I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line.  I'm sorry, but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order, food laid out in huge trays and placed in "turo-turo" style ISN'T food cooked-to-order!Here is a list of the food I tried that day:1. Lechon, large order $6.99- includes corn tortilla (I subbed flour) and  choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice.  (I chose Filipino, of course!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg#SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg2. 3-entree combo of Dinuguan ("chocolate stew"), Beef Mechado, and Pork Adobo $- includes garlic rice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ#Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ3. Lumpia shanghai (fried Filipino pork eggrolls)- small order includes 8 pcs. of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ#HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ4. Halo-halo $4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans, coconut strings, coco jellies, ube (taro-based pudding), coconut milk, choice of ice cream, and shaved ice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA#cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA5. Pan of cassava $8- Cassava is a root, much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream, butter, eggyolks, and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish.  Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie... A little help here, Joel?  6.  To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan, each $3I found all the entrees and eggrolls, save the mechado (meat was a little tough), very tender and very tasty (loved the dinuguan!).  However, they're ALL very greasy, unfortunately!  I'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again... Everytime I ate them, they came back to haunt me, and all due to the high grease and salt content.  A coworker came for her first visit (with her husband and stepdaughter. as well) after I had left, and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty, as well as the other dishes she tried there, but couldn't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet.  Karen, Rey, and Purine, as well as Michael, were all very friendly and accomodating, this is true.I would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again, but I won't eat any of it until I'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat, reheat, and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time.  Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes.  They are very tasty, but I have to be careful...  Or I could enjoy them fresh, but without much of the sauce.What my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again!  This dessert, similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau, tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients, instead of from a bottled mix of beans, coco strings and jello.  I liked the ice cream they used, too.  You have your choice of either ube, vanilla, or mango.  I'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors...  As a special, Karen had prepared ginataan, a warm dessert consisting of plantains, jackfruit, coco strings, taro, and something akin to yams, cooked in coconut milk and sugar.  This looked and smelled so very good, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies.  I wonder if Joel had a sample?  I know he enjoyed the cassava... I did, likewise.As for the lechon, I'm sad to report that the skin wasn't crispy at all, and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin.  It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like.  A faint hint, but still there, nonetheless.  The pork meat didn't wow me, either.  A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce, which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler (or at Mekong in Mesa).  Awesome sauce, just ask Joel!  I'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce (I stayed away from it bec. I wasn't sure of the ingredients at the time).I will definitely be back to try their daily specials.  I do hope that Karen and the others strive to lessen the grease content of their dishes...Lunched here Monday.  Had read all of the reviews, so expectations were high.  And they lived up to them..About the place.  Family run, mother/daughter combo.  The son handles the web site and Twitter posts (check Twitter for daily specials).  They were very nice.  The mom kept bringing me food I didn't even order, just because I told her I would eventually try it.The food:  I ordered a 3 item combo.  I was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so I could taste one more dish.  The chicken adabo was very simple and good.  Won't overwhelm you with flavor.  It is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  The spicy orange beef was very good.  Daily special I believe.  Very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  Also tried the beef mechado, which I am told is one of their better burritos.  The potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  I expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.They also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!Go try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..I'd like to thank the good Lord above for bringing another filipino restaurant to the valley! (And for yelp for letting me know about it)I visited Karey's tonight because I had that hankerin' for filipino and since it was close to work and was getting great reviews I decided, hell yes!After finding the tucked away business, I was warmly greeted by Karen and her brother. She told me of the already prepared food that she had and if there were something else I had in mind, she would happily prepare it for me. I decided on tha chicken adobo burrito with garlic rice and lumpia. I asked her about some other filipino dishes, she said she still had some pinakbet (a meat and vegetable stew) so I ordered that as well.Now, I ordered this to go but I live in Gilbert so I was a little wary if the lumpia was still going to have it's crispyness to it after my commute home. The delicious little guys made it home and still had their delightful crunch to them. Next was a bite of the burrito. The chicken was very tender and not dried out like sometimes adobo can get. It also didn't have the sometimes overpowering bite of vinegar that is common in adobo. It had a nice balanced taste that lended it well for making burritos with. The pinakbet was a bit of a dissappointment, it was little on the bland and dry side, but I am judging this on how my mother used to make it.I asked about any specials coming up, like lechon, and she said that in a couple of weeks they're going to have another lechon roast. She also said that if there was anything that isn't on the menu and if she knows of the recipe, she would be glad to prepare it, all you need to do is call. Karey's is going into my full rotation even if it's a good half hour away!Considering the Spanish influence on both Mexican and Filipino cooking, it is a wonder that no one had thought of bringing the two cuisines together in one dining establishment sooner. Well, Karey's Kitchen did, and they did it so well! (Again, thanks to yelp for allowing me to find yet another great place!) The Filipino dishes made me homesick for The Old Country, especially when I tasted the the pochero and the mechado. But I was so delighted to discover that making Filipino adobo or mechado into burritos would result in a kick-ass fantastic fusion, especially when paired with their zesty mango salsa. Unlike other places that also serve burritos, they serve the rice and the salsa on the side, so you have the option of adding it to your burrito if you want to cut the richness a tad. Great food, low prices, very warm and friendly staff ... Karey's Kitchen, you know I'll be coming back soon, and often!This latest hybrid might sound different but after trying the Filipino-Mexican fusion at Karey's Kitchen, you'll ask yourself why no one had done it sooner?Situated at the southeast corner behind Blockbuster at 40th Street and Thomas Road, Karey's is in one of those blink-and-miss-it locations. From the good luck kitty at the register to the rich looking hardwood floors and dark wood furniture, it's actually charming. There are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in, and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more.Karen, once an accountant, has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture, which includes her mom, Puring, husband, Ray, and brother, Michael.It brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent. The warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming. Karen and Puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook.For the unfamiliar, many Filipino foods consist of stews, braises and roasts of beef, pork and chicken, which work perfectly for this concept. For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items, or you can go for something more unconventional, yet accessible, like many of its tasty hybrid burritos, chimichangas and flautas.I must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone. If there is something on the menu you find yourself craving, maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day. Sourcing top quality has been tough, and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another.Daily specials play a large part of Karey's menu, and there are always three to five specials per day. If you'd like to know about those dishes, you can choose to follow Karey's Kitchen on Twitter.On one visit I created my own three-item combo ($5.99), which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs. The barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor.I also chose the chicken curry, which was fall-off, the bone tender and not heavy like most I've tried.To round off the combo, I chose the pancit, which is the Filipino version of Chinese lo mein. Though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles, it has a lighter sauce. Of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp.The pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures.Adobo is to the Philippines as Pho is to Vietnam. Essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the Philipines by the Spanish in the 1500s, it has become the national dish.Karey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats. You can have this in a combo or rice bowl, but do yourself a favor and get the Pork Adobo Burrito ($5.99). A huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in Parmesan cheese. With the outside rolled in cheese, it adds a depth to the burrito that I've never quite experienced.With the burrito you also have your choice of Spanish rice, white rice, garlic rice or beans. The Spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful, but my favorite were the creamy beans. Karey's doesn't have a traditional Mexican salsa but instead chooses to use Asian chili paste. The spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish I tried.I love eggrolls in about any shape and form, including Karey's outstanding Filipino version called Lumpia ($2.95/$4.95). These are smaller than what you'd normally expect at an Asian restaurant, but the crunch factor is far bigger. Simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce, these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light.Keeping with the hybrid fusion theme, desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories. The Halo Halo ($4.95) is made of shaved ice, beans, purple yams, sweetened condensed milk and ice cream.Okay, I know, it sounds a little crazy, and when it is served, the first thing that comes up is, "What have I gotten myself into?"This dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers. Once you brave the first bite, it won't be your last. Creamy, icy, tender and smooth, it's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once. I have a feeling I'll be having another one on my next visit.Ask about Puring's Cassava Cake ($1.29). It's served warm and is made from shredded cassava, coconut milk and sugar.From the crispy lumpia to the tender, melt-in-your-mouth adobo, Karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated, like family.lumpia! lumpia! lumpia!I feel as though I have died and gone to LUMPIA heaven.  They are tricky to make-- just really time consuming and it leaves yuor kitchen messy so eating them when you didn't make them yourself is such a treat! We started off with lumpia and then had the pancit.  Panict was not 5 star--- I like mine more dry, so the one I make at home is better in my opinion.  But it was still really good.HALO HALO-- oh my!  I have not had halo halo since 1993 so the minute it hit my mouth, an entire flash of memories came back to me!  It's very interesting and has a lot going on in it, some stuff I love, other stuff, I pick around.  I can't wait to go back and try the adobo, and some of the more mexican type foods.The people working-- owner and family are sooo nice and really friendly, that makes for an excellent experience!I am looking at my schedule seeing when I can get back there again---Karey's Kitchen was my very first Yelp bookmark. Isn't that sweet? There was a big lull in my afternoon yesterday, a lull in which I had not eaten lunch, and yet, it was still much too early for dinner. I decided that this was the perfect time to head over to 40th St. and Thomas, and knock one more bookmark off of my ever-expaning panoply. Karey's Kitchen is located on the southeast corner of 40th St. and Thomas, somewhat hidden behind a rogue Blockuster. There are many other businesses occupying its strip mall, but when I rolled up at about 3:30 in the afternoon, the entire parking lot was empty. Like, the whole thing. Mine was the single, solitary vehicle present. I'm sure it's a hub of activity at other times of the day, but apparently the middle of the afternoon renders the street corner a veritable ghost town. The restaurant is small, and cute inside. It's clean and cheery, without being bright and antiseptic. I was greeted by a friendly lady who offered me several delicious samples, because it was my first time visiting! Is there any better introduction? Another very friendly gentleman joined her, and asked me how I came to hear about Karey's Kitchen. I told him that I read about it on the internet, and he said, "OH! On Yelp?!" I like it when Yelp comes up in my daily life. It's fun. They were both very kind to me, and very interested in explaining the dishes to me. Ultimately, I ordered a three item combo with garlic fried rice. Chicken Adobo, Beef Calidereta, and the Chicken Coconut Curry. I also snagged a square of Cassava cake. A brief disclaimer: I do not have a sophisticated palate. I like my meals to have flavor. A LOT of flavor. Subtleties are generally wasted on me.Delicious. Everything was absolutely delicious. The Chicken Adobo was definitely my favorite, but the other two were very, very good...things I would certainly order again. Every item was totally bursting with flavor, and I was in a food coma before I even finished eating. Scrumptious and savory. The Cassava cake was a perfect ending to the meal - it has an enjoyable, thick texture, and is not too sweet. I loved everything that I ate, and can't wait to scurry back next week and try something new. Maybe the Lumpia...but definitely with a Chicken Adobo burrito and garlic rice. Yes. Sir.Ps: The guy working there told me they will soon be offering Adobo sandwiches...apparently, people ask for them a lot. You heard it here first!Alexander does right again! Please do not hate for the 4 star not 5, as they are worthy but missed it by a little fraction. I had the 2 items with rice. I enjoyed the Chicken Adobo, a favorite of mine, and the Chicken afritada, which was suggested by the owners. Both were really good, I had hope the meat was a little bit more tender, but the flavor was there. The fried (garlic) rice was really good. I asked a bunch of questions and they were more then happy to answer them. One thing to ask about is the Pancit instead of rice, we can get rice anywhere, but not the pancit. I was also a little bummed they only serve the lumpia is a group, you cannot order one with a meal. (unless you want the veggie lumpia. As previous mentioned the place is on the South East corner and on the south west of the complex. Enjoy.... I did.Based on the Yelp reviews it had received, we all went to visit Karey's Kitchen yesterday for lunch. This is the second new Filipino place we have tried in as many weeks. The place is very small, but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais). We went after traditional lunch-rush hours, so it was not too cramped. I'm actually glad they opted for a small location. Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead, so it's good they are keeping their expenses low. We had our toddler with us, so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well.We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great. I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta--both were excellent, as was the garlic rice I had on the side. My wife and niece, who are both Filipinas, also were impressed with the food--especially the cassava cake, which they raved about. Karey's also offers Mexican-Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time, but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review. The service was also outstanding--super-friendly and fast. My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch. Living in a Fil-Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food. My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express), so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook--and as for me, well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there. So, we order take-out food frequently. Along with Wholly Grill, we now have two new staples. I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT!I'm giving Karey's five stars based on the fact that the food was good, the service was fast, and the owners were super-friendly. That goes a long way in my book.To paraphrase Carl Sagan..."In order to create fillipino/mexican fusion cusine, you must first invent the universe"   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbcYou will want to give that vid a look and a listen...preferably while enjoying some roasted piggy prepared by the utterly adorable Karey and friends:)I had lunch with friends today at Karey's:)A little lunch, a little solving of the worlds problems (without benefit of alcohol, this time:) even a discussion of the the galactic issues that confront us all (did you know that there is an excellent chance that the Milky Way Galaxy...our home...will collide with another galaxy (Andromeda), soon?!?!?Less than 3.5 billion years...things could get very dicey!Until then, whistle over to the SE corner of of 40th St. and Thomas Rd. and drop by and visit Karey.She gave us samples (since who among us understands what fillipino/mexican fusion really is?I will tell you what it is...it is really good!I enjoyed samples of chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, the aformentioned piggy, beef mechado (no I didn't do that from memory...I took a menu:)I was sorely tempted to to have the "all the above" platter, but I controlled myself:)Pork adobo, Beef mechado and garlic rice, along with a shared order of lumpia egg rolls...just delightful:-)I am happy to report that Karey's was busy during the entire lunch hour...I am also happy to report that Karey brought us a delightful little dessert cake to try...I did enjoy my lunch today:)In the universe I've invented, single malt scotch flows like water, I have no need for tax attorneys and fillipino/mexican fusion cooking at Karey's Kitchen is here to stay:)When you invent your own universe, be sure to include Karey's Kitchen...I might want to visit with you at lunch someday:)I've never heard of Filipino-Mexican fusion.  (Filican?  Mexipino?  FiliMex?)  I joined friends Donald and Mark (Donark?  Monald?) here for a nice Friday lunch.The folks here were friendly and hospitable (Fraspitable? Hofriendly?) when we came in and offered sample tastes of several dishes.  We tried chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, beef mechado and the special, roasted pork.  As in roasted pig.  A whole pig, roasted on site.  In my head I heard Christopher Walken blurt his patented "Wow."Everything was tasty.  I went with a platter of two meats and garlic rice.  I chose the chicken coconut curry and the pork adobo.  The meats were tender and well sauced.   Savory and aromatic.  Savormatic?  Aromavory?As we were finishing they brought over a slice of cassava cake, sliced for three.  Very sweet.  (The gesture and the cake.)  When we ordered I had asked if the cassava cake was similar to flan because it looked a bit like flan.  It's not.  It has more depth and texture and substantial vegetable flavor to it.  Good stuff.I think Karey's gets 4 stars.  This is a place that could take their food to the 5 star level.  All of the dishes were really good but tasted like they were going for a milder, more mainstream version of the full bright flavor potential.  My advice is to keep doing what they are doing, only more.A few weeks back.. waking from a migraine fog and haze of migraine meds.. I seriously was jones'n for Kareys rice! I had a friend drive me.. Intro'd my friend to Karen... who gave samples and  her friendly beyond friendly personality.. that speaks volumes in a society whos forgotten the value of customer service! Im always trying new things when in Kareys.. this time roasted pork, curry to go, and of course, my craving for the fried rice....and wow! I think my migraine got better... because a 5 is the best thing for that:-)I am on a roll when it comes to trying new (well to me anyway) cuisine across the Valley. Today at work, my coworker and wonderful friend Vicky mentioned how she wanted to try Kareys Kitchen. I went on Yelp, read the reviews (especially from people that I really trusted) and I couldn't wait to go. Walking in there (remind me please to always check the website and menu before I go into the unknown!) I was highly confused on what to order. The words Chicken, Beef, and Pork rang a bell to me, but not the words Caldereta, Tinola, and Asado. One of the owners, the ever helpful and super sweet Rey (the wife's name is Karen - hence the name Kareys Kitchen) let me try three sample tastes. The Chicken Adobo and the Beef Caldereta were amazing, but I ended up getting the Chicken Coconut Curry with steamed rice. The curry wasn't overbearing at all...in fact it was made just right. Vicky order the 2 combination plate of Dinuguan and Pinakbet with steamed rice. (And let me tell you that you will never go hungry with the amount of rice that they serve!) I tried the Dinuguan...it was alright to me...but I am not a big pork fan. She loved it, though she was used to more of a spicier taste (Though the Pinakbet had bitter melon in it - ewww not a good after taste) I also ordered a piece of their Cassava cake...but I was so full I only at a couple of bites. I took the rest home with me...what I had it was really good. I am scared about when the word of mouth becomes so widespread that this place will get so crowded that it will start to become annoying to go there. Basically, the cafe is very small...cozy for now...Spectacular service, meet Above-average Food. Although I don't know what that equals, its unique for sure.  You don't get this kind of friendly, overly-anxious to please ('officious' for you vocab buffs) service in too many PHX restaurants unless you are willing to pay for it.I took my family to Karey's Kitchen a couple of weeks back because it was on Yelp's HOT list forever and because lumpia are like a siren to me (The Odyssey sirens, not the police car kind). We walk in and it was as if someone threw us into some foreign third-world country for lunch. The outside tables looked like an injury waiting to happen, and the inside (though VERY clean) had a feel of 'frugal budget' to it. Nonetheless, we walk up to the counter to see what goodies were bubbling for our pleasure.  The young girl was extremely nice, and was feeding us samples of everything from BBQ pork to strips of steak and chicken.  Everything tasted pretty good so we decided to order.You order in a kind of Panda Express style with a bowl of rice and one-three choices of meat.  I got the chicken adobo (i think) and the BBQ pork (my favorite)... we also ordered a small batch of lumpia (it comes with like 10 of them!)The only thing I was disappointed in (taste-wise) was the lumpia.  It had a plain hamburger taste to it.  I was hoping for something with a little more flavor.Karey was a delight! She chatted with us as we ate and suggested some sauces (The Banana Sauce rox!)... She also said she roasts a pig every other Friday. I have GOT to try that!!!All-in-all, it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely try it again!I've only been here once, but due to the fact that the food was excellent and the experience was wonderful, I have to give up the 5th star.  To say I am a picky eater would certainly be an understatement, so I really have no idea what was going on in my head when I decided to try Karey's Kitchen.  I pretty much hate Mexican food and have no idea what Filipino food is, so this was pretty daring for me.When we came in it was empty, thankfully, so we got to sample lots of food and ask all of our stupid questions to the super sweet girl behind the counter.  She wasn't shy about offering her recommendations when I asked, and I really appreciated that.  After tasting a bunch of dishes I decided on the Chicken Adobo Burrito.  It came with a side of garlic rice and chips and salsa.  The salsa I didn't eat because that's just too far out of my comfort zone.  The rice was good, but I honestly wouldn't mind if there was more garlic in it.  The burrito was absolutely heavenly!  I'm the kind of girl who likes stuff pretty plain.  Just the meat and cheese thank you very much.  To my surprise, that is exactly the way my burrito came... stuffed with chicken and loaded with ooey gooey cheese!  It was even covered in something that tasted like paremesan crumbs.  Yum!I really cannot wait to go back here and try something new and maybe overcome a few more of my culinary fears.

Review Text :
I like reading about food and restaurants...no question about it.Some of my friends write the best stuff about carne asada, amuse bouche, foie gras and other gastro-porn delights (if there can be gastro-pubs, then there can be gastro-porn).When my buddy, Hotdish, wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada, I knew that I needed to try it out myself!Really, it's not like I'm just following Joel around, eating lunch where he eats lunch, having drinks where he has drinks, going to the movies where he goes to the movies...well you get my drift...it's a complete coincidence that I just happen to show up at the same places at the same times!I follow lots of you around...via Yelp (so you don't need to be too worried that I'll show up at your respective houses).But you could frankly do worse than to stalk Joel and eat at the places he recommends...the man finds some gems and he really knows his victuals!So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had (and I've had some good stuff, believe you me).I've been back 3 or 4 times since I first dropped by and it's so damn cute...Selena, the owner, greets me like a long lost son every time...and she never remembers that I've been in before!That cracks me up!Selena is like my wise Latina mom (well, except for the fact she's younger than I am...and I'm not really as Latin as I look in my profile picture)...she is so sweet!And...she makes everything from the carne asada and barbacoa to the charro beans, salsa and guacamole, herself...fresh...from scratch...every day (BTW, the folks at the Mission need to drop by and get a Guacamole making and pricing lesson from Selena...$1.50 for the same size side of guac that costs $15.00 at Mission...and isn't as good...maybe you're paying to watch it made at Mission).It's hard for me to recommend any one thing...the taco's are sublime, the quesa's are wonderful, the charro beans and rice are among the best in town...the carne asada is (as Joel testified) some of the best around...in short...Sonora Mesquite is a wonderful little find...and heavily in the current lunchtime, retox rotation.Drop by, say "hola!" to Selena and have a taco or a quesadilla...tell her I sent you...she won't remember who the hell I am, but that's OK...she'll treat you like family anyway!if you haven't eaten lunch yet, i suggest you get your cute little butt over to sonora right now. i had the carne asada taco combo on flour tortillas. It comes with two tacos and rice and beans. I also got fresh guac. aaannnnd i was coaxed into the mexican version of bingsoo (the mexican version is better in my opinion) I had to get it to-go and head back to work... and since my hands were full of that delicious little fruity icee treat, the lovely lady working carried my lunch to my car. how stinking sweet is that? she didn't want it to spill, however, spills were the theme of the day.as soon as i got in my car i forgot about that fruity concotion and stuck my elbow in it. and it tipped over and fell.then i took a sip of my drink and that went down the front of my shirt. did i mention i was wearing white? the tacos were amazing, and the beans were amazing, and the rice too. I could have used a little more heat and I am sure if I used the salsas it would have been perfect, but i didn't want to spill that all over the place so they stayed closed. the fruity dessert thing that i got was so delicious. she made me a special concotion. it was shaved ice with coconut, mango and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. if she could have just blended that with a little rum it would have been the perfect mid-work cocktail. they should seriously start blending that little treat. amazing. next time i will go back when i have time to sit and enjoy, i will also bring a bib with me since i can't seem to avoid making a huge mess all over myself.love this place. delcious.So is it awkward that I may have fallen in love with a 50 year old hispanic lady named Selena?You wouldn't think so if you met her and tasted her food at Mesquite Grill. I went there for lunch today after seeing it on Yelp's hottest restaurants and was very impressed. When I arrived it was empty so that is never a good sign. But Selena put my worries behind me. She recommended the combo platter which consisted of a carne asada taco, chicken taco, beans and rice. The tacos were out of this world. They weren't your typical street style tacos; they are so big they are almost like mini burritos. The rice and beans were good but nothing out of this world. Selena makes all the food fresh in the back and you can tell. If you are deciding between the Chipotle just across the parking lot or Sonora Mesquite...there is no question go say hi to Selena.All right guys, I'm getting a little concerned. I see the reviews and that's all well and good, but every time I go into Sonora, it's empty! After the loss of Karey's Kitchen, I feel I have to take a more proactive approach. I went to Karey's Kitchen when I was hungover all the time, but apparently a restaurant cannot live on Georgeann G.'s hangovers alone (I know, it shocked me too).Next time you think about going to Chipotle, come here instead! They can share the massive line Chipotle has from open to close every day! Don't get me wrong, I love me some Chipotle, but I don't want to lose Sonora, so I want to share the wealth a bit.That's enough of my plea. Still 5 stars. If you look at the picture of the to-go order that I just inhaled while watching a Hills marathon in my living room, you'll see why. Delicious!The owner/chef of this place sold her soul to the devil...that's the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good. So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and we've only been here once...so after a couple more visits, more than likely I'll be tacking on that coveted 5th star. We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned, a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food they're serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoa's (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food. Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:-Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.-Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm. -Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.-Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner. God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great. Overall, we were just very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily, and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks, it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to. 4.5/5.Dear every other Carne Asada spot in the 602,It's not you- it's me, not liking you anymore.Sonora Mesquite Grill is SO flavorful and delicious, it makes me grateful I wasn't chosen to go to heaven for the rapture.As others have mentioned, the carne asada is the star here. Well, that and the service. To say this place is sweet and the people are charming, is the understatement of the year. This place is owned by a Mother and her son, and both times I have been there, they have been just outstanding.Today I phoned in a takeout order, and the Mom would answer with 'Yes dear' in the sweetest, non-condescending way ever. She literally exudes warmth, and it is not only in her customer service, but also her food. The carne asada burro is tremendous. It comes with beans and rice in the burro, but I am a purist, and I ask for those items on the side, as I just want to taste carne goodness in the burro. If you order chips and salsa you get a few different salsas, a verde, rojo, and thicker rojo. The salsas are so delicious and tasty- you can taste the freshness and care that goes into it. In fact, the salsas are so amazing, if I ran out of chips- I would dip lucky charms cereal into the salsa, because anything that good you cannot waste!The restaurant is small, but impeccably clean, and care is taken throughout the establishment to keep guests comfortable. The food is very, very good, and it is so cool to have business owners so proud of their product, and at Sonora Mesquite Grill- they have much to proud of.Also not to be missed is their fresh made lemonade. I read here on Yelp that it was tasty- and my fellow Yelpers did not let me down. It is very fresh and tasty- without being too sweet.The only thing I am curious about is that they serve bagged tortilla chips, as opposed to making them fresh. Not the end of the world, just kind of curious. I would recommend if they can't make their own, to consider using the 'My Nanas' chips, or another type which is more consistent with Mexican restaurants. This is just minutia, and doesn't change anything, the place is just that good. Try for yourself, you will not be disappointed. Ciao!Taco tuesdays never looked so good!or tasted so good for that matter.The rumors are true, the hype is justified and the myth is in the making.SMG is what everyone says, and couldnt be more deserving of all the praises fellow yelpers have heaped onto them; they are ab-fab.From the second I walked in I was greeted with smiles and warmth, in fact throughout my meal I felt an extreme sense of deja vu, it wasnt until the ride home that I realized that the owner and my grandmother might in fact be long lost twins separated at birth! All kidding aside, the owner is one sweet little lady, talk about customer service oy vay!The Carne Asada? game over. Hands down the best in the valley.When I ordered my taco platter I didnt even specify what delicious type of meat I'd wanted, she looked at me, smiled, and knowingly suggested the carne asada, to which I heartily agreed. The calibre of the food here is just incredible. So good that it could probably cure rascism. NO.JOKE.If sheriff joe ate here, he'd probably repent hole-heartedly, doubling down on his knees prostrating himself on the floor and weeping the sorry tears of a man whose seen his folly and begs forgiveness. I would challenge any white supremacist to eat here and say one bad thing about Mexico afterward. Sonora Mesquite Grill is the solution to Arizona's bad rap, sure we can produce ignorant rascist laws like SB-1070, but hey, we also have places like Sonora Mesquite Grill! Sonora Mesquite Grill is The Jesus, and nobody fucks with the Jesus.Aye Dios Mios!  I think I have died and gone to carne asada heaven. The reviews were right, Sonora Grill is astounding! I was so impressed with everything I ordered. The carne asada, hands down is the best in the valley. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole... Oh the guacamole... Mas deliciosa! While the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the 3 salsas I devoured. I was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most Mexican meals. At Sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu. Qué bueno! The girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff. If I owned a restaurant I would try and steal her away! This is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation.

Please, someone tell me what I am missing here? My family loves Italian food. LOVES LOVES LOVES IT. Being super carb sensitive (I think about carbs and I gain 5 lbs. Eating Italian is the bane of my existence for this very reason.The premise is nice. A family run, Italian deli. I can dig that. We entered, were instantly greeted, I checked in on Yelp (the Elite thang to do), and perused the menu. I was shocked at the prices. A simple pasta dish was $14.99. For PASTA?  None of their dishes came with soup or salad to justify the high cost. Anyway, my family ordered, freshly baked bread arrived. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. I had once slice and savored it. This was the best part of the meal. We each had ordered a cup of soup (70 degree weather in late May justifies as cool enough for soup in my book) They were all  homemade and they were all awful, My pasta e fagoli was nothing but a weird broth, white beans, and pasta. The minestrone was vegetable soup with pasta. The chicken soup was hopeful, but it didn't have any real flavor. Each cup of soup was an additional $5. Decent sized cups, but when the flavor is lackluster...Next come our entrees. The stuffed pepper was the only tasty thing ordered, a bit salty, but had a rich complexity in flavor profile and texture. I ordered the four cheese risotto. It was far too salty and thankfully my mama put some of her yummy stuffed pepper sauce into my dish and it perked it up a bit. The risotto was cooked a little too short, it was not to the point of al dente (which to my knowledge is how all noodles in Italian restaurants are served). The other dished ordered was the baked rigatoni. Pasta, greasy meat sauce, and a layer of cheese. Ekk!  I tried a bit of it and I swear this AM after brushing my teeth last night and again this AM, I still feel a thin layer of grease on the roof on my mouth (okay, I'm being dramatic). These dishes all ranged from $14.99 to $18.99. I don't understand. Pasta, tomatoes, and buying bulk cheese isn't that expensive. All of the food was wrapped up and taken to go. Again, portions are HUGE, but when the food doesn't taste good, it's just even more of a waste.Service was great. Attentive. Informative. So kudos there. However, $90 for 3 people to eat at an Italian Deli is ludicrous in my mind. Especially when I would rather eat at Olive Garden and it would have been far more satisfying and lighter on the wallet. The restaurant was also very loud. The high ceilings and the absence of a wall in the dining area amplified noise level. I feel like I was robbed eating here. I ate carbs for you, Roma! Carbs! And I gained about 20 lbs while writing this review because of all the thinking and writing about carbs!

Maximum Flavor Pizza is slightly falsely named.  Nothing here really has maximum flavor, but it is maximum cheap for the area.  I frequent Craig St when I am starving between classes, and Sophia H. and I tested this place out.I ordered a slice of pizza and jalapeno poppers, which came to a grand total of $5.58 with tax.  The slice of pizza was ok and super reasonably priced.  The poppers were not so good, and I would not order them again.  My recommendation is to stick to the slices of cheese pizza for a cheap and filling meal!Service was a touch gruff on our visit.

I met clients here for bfast since they open early. There were four in our party and the waitress was attentive and friendly.Being a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.I won't let this negative experience keep me away from Egg Works - hopefully the next experience will be better.This isn't really directed at Egg Works, but instead it is more me pondering the mystique of breakfast spots. I mean, there are many things I will never understand and among those is the draw these type of places seem to have. There is nothing on the menu that one could not whip up themselves. So, I just don't understand people willing to wait 30+ minutes to eat an omelet or another equally rudimentary breakfast food.So, on a handful of occasions when the wait time was not ridiculous I've had a chance to try this place. They have a large menu and their service is solid. I am also a fan of the endless coffee refills.  I have had their basic eggs breakfast, sampled several of the omelets, and most recently highly enjoyed their carnitas rancheros menu item. Everything is fine, and that is pretty much the most you can expect out of these joints...hence why I don't understand the hype or the wait times.  The food is fine, the prices are fine, the service is fine...is it worth waiting 30+ minutes for? Heck no.We have officially lived in Las Vegas for a year.How have we never been to Egg Works before now??We literally live right down the street and we drive by this location almost every single day. I'm honestly ashamed of myself.Now I have seen this place on a weekend and it is crazy packed! But, being a Tuesday mid morning we were seated right away and it had a decent flow of customers.Maya (our wonderful server) came and greeted us right away. One of the things that stood out to me the most about our entire experience is that everyone working there seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Everyone was bubbly and all smiles and it definitely made for a great dining experience!The hubby ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet and I had what I would describe as being their personal take on Biscuits and Gravy.Everything was delicious! We especially loved their potatoes, they had a wonderful seasoning with a light kick!Another major bonus is when you check in on yelp you get a free Banana Nut Muffin! So moist and tasty!!This place is Eggcellent! After reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.Apparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.This location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place. When we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!Upon scanning the menu, I decided to get the "Sundance Special", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........One of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.With my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!Overall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.The menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM.I went to Egg Works for the first time a few months ago and I just didn't care for the flavor at all, plus our food was cold but since this place has so many amazing reviews, I decided to wait for a review till I tried them one more time. It took me a few months but I just recently went back and now I totally understand the hype! Great prices, good flavor and portions and many locations. I decided to go with the Chicken Fried Steak since I'm not an omelet fan and my boyfriend went with the Waffle Works. So I'm a little weird with scrambled eggs, I like them slightly undercooked if that makes sense. I always thought places made them so rubbery and dry but this place makes them perfectly the way I like them! Soft and fluffy but not watery or rubbery. Their seasoned potatoes were also pretty addictive and the gravy on the Chicken Fried Steak was seasoned perfectly and had the perfect texture. One thing that made me really happy, the breading didn't slide off the steak! Whoo! My boyfriend's waffle was also nice and sweet with soft chewiness and I liked that they offered sausage patties. We also both checked in on Yelp to get 1 free Banana Nut Muffin each!!! Awesome! So warm and flavorful! Our server was also great and had a good sense of humor, she made us laugh a few times. Overall, Egg Works doesn't offer any crazy menu items but simple can definitely be better if executed right. Also, there are soo many different options to choose from! Benedicts, Omelets, Pancakes, Waffles, Scrambles, Skillets, Sandwiches, Crepes, Salads, Soups, Burgers, even Enchiladas, Burritos, and Spaghetti! Basically, if you're looking to have breakfast with even the pickiest of eaters, they'll find something they like here!

I never tasted "Paradise" until a recent visit to Arizona. They have some slogan about being known for their cookies. I felt like the gauntlet was thrown, so I took up the challenge. I decided to get two chocolate chip cookies. The clerk working here was nice and gave me two for the price of one since it was near the end of the day. The cookies didn't look incredible, but looks can be deceiving. In this case, they weren't.Mr. L and I waited until our Greyhound Bus ride to Tucson to try them. They were too sugary and did not taste good. We weren't interested in finishing them - not worth the calories nor the effort of chewing. Mr. L said Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chip Cookies were better, not that Pepperidge Farm cookies are the pinnacle of greatness or bad either, but I expected better from a bakery that brags about their cookies. The cookies were the perfect 2 star complement to sitting by the bathroom on the back of the Greyhound Bus. Instead of finding paradise in the cookie form, it was more like "Paradise Lost."

So, I love all things Top Chef in any of its various forms, and I am trying to have a Top Chef food baby before I die.  I am slowly but surely working my way up to this goal with much planning.  So imagine my surprise -- nay, sheer delight -- when I espied in McCarran Airport Terminal D, David Burke's "Burke in the Box."  Whaaa?  Since it was 10:20 in the morning, I was nursing a hang- and gambling-over, and we had almost two hours to kill before our flight, I thought breakfast here (at a Top Chef-touched eatery in the *airport*!!) would really scratch a lot of itches.  All it did was irritate.After drooling over the breakfast menu (I couldn't *wait* to sink my teeth into a pretzel bread eggwhite sammie with tomato, 'shrooms, and feta), the server informed us breakfast was over at 10 and we were now on the lunch menu.  I'm sorry, breakfast ends at TEN did you say??  I get that this is Vegas and time doesn't really exist/count here, but on what planet -- besides high schools -- do people eat lunch at 10:05?  So I ended up ordering a *ten dollar* tuna sandwich and husband ended up ordering a Caesar salad.Wow, David Burke.  Just...wow.  Salad was romaine, cuke, tomato, Asiago (completely unconventional ingredients in a Caesar) and KEN'S DRESSING IN A BAGGIE.  So boring husband kept dozing off in the *plastic bowl* it came in and nearly poking himself in the eye with the *plastic cutlery*.  My sandwich was fine -- the tuna salad itself was actually quite good, with all white meat albacore, capers, celery, onion, and a touch of mayo -- but the rye bread was really thick and really dry so I ended up just eating the salad off of it.  The fries it came with were crispy and golden but didn't have a ton of flavor, and the *tissue thin paper napkin* couldn't keep up with my greasy fingers.  I overheard another waitress telling a different table that for $1 extra they could add Asiago and truffle oil to their fries.  Gimme a break, Burke.  Truffle oil fries and Ken's baggie dressing on the same menu?  Make up your mind.Service was actually pretty good, especially since it was our server's second day.  He was on top of the ball and we never had to wait long for anything.  He even swooped in with a drink refill before I had the chance to open my big mouth.Best part about Burke in the Box?  Watching the Bears hand the Cowboys their butts on home turf.[Top Chef: David Burke]quick lunch before a flight...sports on the screens...a bar for drinks...tables for dining...taking a soda $3.99 and reuben $12.39...steep prices for a soda, but with quick refills...sandwich quite small....pastrami quite chewy...fries decent...$21 total after tax and tip...seeing a hot dog at a neighboring table and quite impressed with the size...if you are hungry and just want something super filling, get the hot dog or sausage...that was monstrous...

I guess I should have known a new location wasn't gonna change anything.I had even been warned by my fellow co-workers that had already eaten here...BUTI had to try it myself...it's BBQ and it's in my office building..there such huge potential upside.They told me it was small,pricy and just OK.Well I stopped in after work This place is attached to the Sand Dollar Lounge a blues bar next door, so Harry's has no restrooms but for some reason it still has the smell.I still stayed and I got the Beef Brisket with 2 sides for $10.95 and 2 catfish tacos for $5.95I was the only customer but they were making it fresh so it was gonna be 15 minutes.I wandered around and checked out the small dine-in area they had a jukebox and vinyl records & autographed photos of soul legends everywhere.The waitress was real friendly when she had to break it to us they were out of cilantro & onion for the tacos so they would be dry as a bone. no tartar or lemon offered, just some sour-looking  salsa.The beef brisket was actually as little as a school lunch sandwich with a ice cream scoop of mac n cheese on the side and 5 hushpuppies.The mac n cheese looked strange from the go, but after tasting it I had to spit it out. Dry, gritty like sand and where is the cheese?? Stay away from the mac!! You have been warned.The brisket was more like pot roast smothered in super sweet and watery sauce. Not my kind of BBQ.The hushpuppies were good-crispy but soft and flavorful in the milddle.The catfish was dirty tasting and kinda rubbery. I didn't eat them all & I wouldn't try them again. I hate dirt tasting fish.I should have listened....pricy($28.95 full rack ribs),small portions and nothing special about it BBQ.Why you ask? After all I gave it 1 star last time around. As I mentioned before it is the ONLY eatery in walking distance from the business park I work in. So reluctantly I entered through their doors again. First thing I noticed upon entering was the wall sized paper menu with black magic marker drawn through half of the menu items. Looks like the nixed all the appetizers,salads,hamburgers,catfish tacos and OKRA. Raised Sweet Potato Pie to $3.95/slice. Well the only things you can get on the NEW menu for under $5 is Seasoned Fries for $3.95 or Hot Link Samich w/side of potato chips or potato salad. I went for the later-BBQ Hot Link Samich w/potato salad.$3.95-Not bad. I was completely suprised to see a poppy seed HAMBURGER bun when I opened my to-go container since I had ordered a link. They slice the link into pepperoni thin slices and smother it in super spicy but bland bbq sauce and a doughy bun. WTF!! :( I had faith that by ordering a link I was playing it safe, I mean how the F*#% can you screw up a HOT LINK Samich. Harry O's has figured it out. Slice it to shit,smother it and pretend it's bbq. Bad location, competing with super popular Polaris Street Cafe and the taco truck in the neighborhood. Food is way overpriced takes way too long -I mean Famous Dave's has a full rack rib meal for $20. Here they want $30 and I never smelled any smoke in this place. What gives?!? Definitely not worth the money or the wait. 1/2 star for giving it a go.

Review Text :
I had such high hopes for this place.  Let me start off by saying that I am a breakfast person and very particular.  Breakfast ingredients are cheap and there are not that many unique combinations so it is an absolute necessity that it be done right.  If you are thinking, "Oh! That's me!", this is not the place for you.First, the staff was friendly but not overly excited or very apologetic that it took 30 minutes to get our food.  It was also unpleasantly warm inside the restaurant.  I might be able understand if the place had been crowded, but it wasn't.  It was half empty at 11 am on a Saturday.The food was not especially cheap for the quality.  I had the ham steak breakfast which was nearly $10 for ham, eggs, toast, and potatoes.  Here are some thoughts from my meal and what else was ordered at our table:  The ham was tasty but it was sliced ham and not a ham steak.  My over easy eggs were browned* .  The toast was cold*.  The pancakes were fluffy but dry like a biscuit and not spongy.  The home fries were tasteless and undercooked*, unless you like hard potatoes.  The "cream" for the coffee wasn't cream, it was milk.  The sausage patties used were the cheap ones you can buy frozen at Walmart and hardly qualify as meat. I let out a sigh of relief when we stepped out into the open air; glad to be finally free from waiting for someone to take payment while enjoying the cool breeze rushing across the back of my legs, cooling them as it evaporated the moisture built up from an hour of sitting on a cushion in an over-warm room.  The joy of this moment left me with one final utterance, "Eff that place."On the bright side, this has motivated me to start writing reviews instead of only reading them.* denotes things about a breakfast that would make me want to punch a kitten.Had breakfast this morning at Apple Dumpling and found a hair in my biscuits and gravy.  I pulled it out but then could not eat because it made me sick, so I put it back.   Mentioned it to the server and the cook came out and told me that I put the hair in the food.  I explained to him what I had done, but he continued to blame me for the hair.  With the added burnt pancakes, cold eggs and a late kids meal, we will never visit this place again.Bad service and bad food....it's a shame that yelp does not allow no stars....

Mmm, the Vine! I'm a huge fan of the Rural and Apache location by ASU, but this one is closer to my neighborhood. Great place; chill ambiance, perfect for catching up with your friends over a beer, or even watching just about any game. Friendly service.  Speaking of which, funny that people are griping about ASU students frequenting this location and being out of control . . . Found it to be the complete opposite here. Sounds like y'all are describing the other location! Maybe this is just my experience. Delicious wings, never slimey and always have come out crispy. Best flavors are the Superhot and Spicy Garlic. Thirty two ounce beers for $5 and under and Happy Hour is seven days a week. Thanks for having Leinenkugel Summer Shandy on tap, guys! :)

Decided to run in here, because it's close, for a quick sushi dinner and afterwards, we wished we hadn't.  They were NOT nice to us, it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.So... as we are talking with the hostess, working on being seated, some snooty chick comes up, interrupts and says, "um, we need to be seated NOW".  The hostess then asks, "Is your party all here?" (which is necessary when you are doing the teppanyaki) and the girl said "No, but they will be real soon so we need to do this now."I wanted to slap that girl.  Where are these people's manners that their momma taught them!?  I don't care of you think you look like hot shit, I was here first, so don't interrupt and then proceed to be rude.So we order some of the specialty rolls.  And were told some 10 minutes later that one of the two we ordered is not available.  So I picked another.  Waited another 10 minutes.  Then was told the other one of the originals wasn't available.... Really?So I actually had to ask the server "So which ones can I order where I'll actually be able to get it?"Bad news.  I'm real easy going because I know just how hard that job is, but come on.I just love being ignored too... no acknowledgements, no "hope you enjoy your food"... no "do you need a refill"... wrong.Don't appreciate it.The only good part of the whole night was a server named Steven who came up and joked with us when delivering the last roll.  That was the highlight.I've decided I'm not going back.

09/02/10I've dined a few times at Arizona Grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (Latitude 30 and The Phantom Horse Grill).  The Lobby Grill is a smaller version of TPHG- same furnishings, different location.  I'd have eaten here earlier if I could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  Don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the "hill."  There was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; This was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  Service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and I'd already perused through the menu online-- I knew what I wanted to try!  (Oh, how I'd rejoice when the day comes where I can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when I am seated!)We ordered the Filet bleu cheese pizza and the Reinvented Waldorf salad.  This order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  Thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  As far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  It even carries Brighton jewelry!  Be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  But I'm not here to talk about silver watches...I included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high, but when my Mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza, w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese (we ate all but a small slice, which I took home and ate for dinner that evening!), or the terrific salad (the candied walnuts were addictive!), then I know I've found a winner of a dining venue!We'll be back very soon!

My friends and I were really hungry and not wanting to drive anywhere, decided to eat here since we were already at the Four Queens. Plus most of them were drunk. One of my friends asked me to read the reviews on Yelp first but my other friends were too hungry to even care and kinda herded us into the restaurant. Plus there was a special on Prime Rib and most of the guys wanted to eat that.The restaurant ambience is like the 80s and a bit tired looking. The servers were kind of slow. I couldn't figure out if our server was being sarcastic or joking when she talked to us. She came across as being brash & not friendly. Oh and btw, she added 18% on to all of our checks which I get because we had 8 people but it still would've been nice if she mentioned it. I ordered the New York and asked for it to be cooked medium. My bestie ordered the same thing. Hers came out just as requested but mine came out beyond well done. I cut it from the end and took a bite thinking that the ends would be a little well done. By the second bite I knew it was beyond over cooked. I was sawing away & getting no where. Decided to cut down the middle and as you can see from my picture it's well done. I don't like sending food back but in this case I just had to because there was no way I was going to eat it & certainly wasn't going to pay for it.I gave it to one of the servers who took it back and said they would make another one but I declined. I asked her to take it off my check. My bestie shared her meal with me. Our server came over and told me I was right it was over cooked & she didn't blame me for sending it back. She also said she never saw a steak so over cooked. I was a bit confused at her comment because she came across as being sarcastic. I couldn't tell if she was appeasing me or being rude. The New York that I shared with my bestie didn't have any flavor. I don't like adding salt to my steak after it's been cooked. I always feel that a well cooked steak doesn't need steak sauce or salt but I had to add salt & so did my bestie. My friends who ordered the prime rib enjoyed their meal. One friend ordered a taco salad. She said it was ok but had too much lettuce. It was pretty big too.Don't think I'll be eating here again. The reviews here are mixed so maybe we went on an off night. Either way, I suggest passing this place up & going somewhere else.

Surprised about some of the comments regarding the service. We thought that the service was excellent. We did arrive around 6pm though, before it got terribly busy. The food was excellent. We got one of the daily special combos for 2, which came with rabbit, paella, seafood and veggies. It was a huge portion, and cooked very well. Lots of variety. Also tried the tacos, which were good too. I liked the atmosphere.... definitely more on the casual side (not snooty or anything like that)Will definitely return if I'm in the area. It was one of our favorite meals in Montreal

Review Text :
Looking for a place open on Labor Day for lunch, my coworker and myself ended up at Sakun Thai. We were pleasantly surprised by the size and nice decor by this very unassuming restaurant. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken swiftly. That's where the quick service stopped. Our drinks took a while to arrive and it took the waitress a little longer to take our orders. I decided on the massaman with pork at medium spice level. Once our food arrived, I was happy with the presentation. The food looked very appetizing and tasted pretty good as well. My curry was perfectly spiced, but just a little sweeter than I prefer. It tasted like there was too much coconut milk in the dish. My coworker enjoyed the sweet aspect, but I was just happy that I didn't decide to order kang kua since that would most likely be way too sweet for me. They offer brown rice as well, which I think is a good touch. Overall, we had a pleasant meal here but it's definitely not the best Thai food I've had in town. I'll be back since I work in the area.Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines. And whenever possible, I try to find a good one wherever I go. I have to say, my wife found this place. She told me it had four stars and a lot of reviews, I was sold.Here's the rundown. Tom Yum Shrimp - it was a super cold day again, so a hot soup was the perfect remedy for that. Love this soup. I was  craving the sourness from the lemongrass flavored soup. The mushrooms & shrimp were very good. But what set this Tom Yum from the others I've had was the cherry tomato. Never had that in this soup before and it worked so well. The pop in your mouth was a flavor explosion, delicious. Satay Chicken - it was just okay. It was lacking in flavor IMO. Even with the satay sauce. The cucumber salad it came with was outstanding. Lemon Chicken - I never had lemon chicken at a Thai place before. Usually I find this dish at a Chinese restaurant. But I have to say, I am a fan of this dish. The lemon flavor really stands up to the deep fried battered chicken the sauce was in. Panang Pork - I usually get Panang beef. Having pork even though it was very good. I still prefer the beef. The panang curry was outstanding. Pineapple Fried Rice - it was good. Chunks of pineapple and cashew nut pieces all over the dish. As for the flavor, it was just ok for me. Pad See Ew - my wife's favorite Thai noodle dish. It's a good dish, but it didn't have the burnt wok (in a good way) taste we are accustomed to at our regular Thai spot. Still very good. I love spicy food, but on this trip we have a bunch of kids so the heat index was dialed down quite a bit. The pickled serrano chilies help a lot. You can request it and they have them in tiny cups to go. This was a solid Thai restaurant. I'm rating this a 3.5 Stars and rounding up. I'll definitely be back.

The first time I was there I wasn't hungry and was just sitting and chatting with friends, but after seeing the food that came out, I made the point that I will be back to taste the food out myself.So this place is a high-end deli joint located in the M Casino.  (for those who don't know, M casino is a fairly new establishment in Henderson area where the first thing you see coming across the mountains from LA would be the M casino)Checked out the menu and decided on the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  For $9.99, the portion was humongous!  Aside from the bread being super soft and delicious, they don't skimp on the toppings either!  Loaded with thinly sliced steaks smothered with I believe it's provolone cheese (it didn't taste like Mozzerella) and beautified with various red and green bell peppers with onions, this sandwich is a piece of art!One bite into the sandwich I couldn't stop myself from digging further.  (despite my continued effort in cutting carbs down and out of my diet, I have to have this sandwich whole and quick!)  Overall the sandwich was tasty, soft, delicious, yet not salty at all!  Very proud of Vig Deli for creating this masterpiece...My buddy got the triple decker with swirly bread!  The sandwich is actually bigger than those busses if there are any triple deckers out there.....OMG!  I'm so proud of him for finishing that up but I'm sure he was dying afterwards.... and he said it was absolutely wonderful!  The other two buddies got the pastrami sandwich and a bbq pull pork.... pastrami is pretty good and not salty and the pull pork is actually better than most of the bbq joints out there!  (Shame on your other "real" bbq joints out there for not being able to keep up with a deli joint!)  Love me some onion rings as they looked so big and delicious, but needed to pass on this before I pass out!One very small gripe though... I was looking forward to chicken livers as they had it on the menu last time I was here few months ago but they decided to take it out..... pretty sad as I was really looking forward to trying it.........Definitely a place worth visit when you come to vegas.  Better yet, before those of you who drives from CA to NV and is heading back home, you might as well stop by the Vig Deli and pick up some of these artistic creations on your way back!  I guarantee that you will have a great ride home instead of trying to hit up In N Out or McDonalds for that matter!  Just make sure you stay awake after ingesting these awesome sandwiches!When I first tasted this place it was pretty awful; however, after coming back again this place has gotten better! The variety of choice that they have is great and the size of the food is worth the price. I usually order the spaghetti & meatballs.  Thought its not something out of a five-star italian restaurant it is certainly better than the one a any Olive Garden restaurant. Past orders (out of 5 stars) Casear Salad: 3.8Fish & Chips: 4.2Patty Melt: 4.0Fries: 4.5Cheese Steak:3.8 (I think I prefer Capriottis Cheese steak over Vig deli)Tuna Sandwich: 3.0Chicago Hot Dog: 3.0Service:  The cashier I usually encounter are always very pleasant and they usually have a great attitude.This deli is adjacent to the sport book/sports bar area in the M Hotel and Casino. We stopped in for a quick bite after playing the tables for a little bit on our way out. It's a nice option for a meal. The deli meat was fresh. There was a nice option of different meats for sandwiches. There were several sides to choose from, but we skipped sides and opted for a salad. The sandwiches are made to order. The tomato and lettuce was crisp and fresh. The accompanying pickle was crunchy and yummy too. We also got a Cobb salad. All the items were fresh. It was a generous portion of ingredients. The dressing was good, but they had only a small selection of dressings.In all, it's a decent place to eat. Nothing gourmet. Prices were on the high side. There were other food options if you wanted hot dogs, fish and chips or other dishes.

Review Text :
Studio B Buffet was GREAT. First of all, just like Paolo D. mentions, the decor is awesome. Very modern and very nice. I also liked the tables - very minimalistic yet nice looking, not the usual plain boring seats you see at restaurants. One of the things that first astonished me was the free, unlimited wine and beer. I have never been to any other buffet that offers this. Heading to the food line, I was surprised to see how much food there was. The food line was very long and offered everything such as American, Italian, Greek/Mediterranean, Italian, Meats, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, etc. Most of the food I tried was excellent. Some of it was okay, but that's understandable since it would be hard to have every item out of so many to taste great. I particularly liked the several fishes I tried and also the baked salmon at the cutting station. The sashimi and salads were also great.Last but not least, I loved the dessert options. I tried the creme brulee and chocolate gelato.. yummy. If you're looking for a new buffet to try out, check out the Studio B Buffet. I definitely want to go back next time.My future trips to vegas will include a stop at Sonics for tots, A Capastrami from Capriottis, and on the way home -the Buffet at M-resort. I would have never thought to have stopped by the strange looking blue building until my friend who lives in vegas, said we have to try it. so my friends and i stopped by on the way home the last time- and it's the best way to end your vegas trip before the 6 hour drive home. At least your tummy will happy in the traffic. The best time to go is right when brunch ends and dinner begins, so you can try both! Fresh seafood, a variety of meats, and wha? a gellato bar? and a pretty decent dessert spread! They also have a bakery in the casino, but you can try most of the same desserts as minis in the buffet!SEAFOOD HEAVEN: -Snow Crab Legs-Oysters-Shrimp Cocktails-Fried Shrimp-Mussels-ClamsPrime Rib is juicy and tender! 7oz NY SteakBaked Salmon (cooked over bamboo wood)They have many varities of dishes: Salad, Pasta, Pizza, Sushi & Thai Food. Awesome Pad Thai! spicy and flavorful. Shrimp Fried Rice & for you asian lovers out there they serve steam rice.  THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS! HANDS DOWN. !My friend heard of a new buffet off the strip in the M Resort Hotel.  For $25.95, you can enjoy an all you can eat seafood buffet with all you can drink beer and wine!  And if you sign up for the iMagine Rewards program, you get $2 off the buffet price.  The buffet is pretty huge.  I went straight for the king crab legs and shrimp.  On my first round, I filled 2 plates with food.  I would have to say the best items were the crab legs and shrimp.  All the other food was just ok.  I've had better prime rib, and their sushi was just ok.  On my second round, I browsed the Asian food, and nothing really called out to me.  They tried to make a Pad Thai, but it looked dried out.  It could be that we just went late, so they weren't making any new batches.The desserts were pretty good for a buffet.  They had lots of mini versions of tarts, meringues, eclairs, creme brulée, flan and other stuff I can't remember.  There's even a whole case of ice cream for you to choose from.  I wasn't able to take advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine.  I had to run a half marathon in the morning, so I only drank half a glass of beer.  =(  I'll have to come earlier next time and give this place another shot.  Maybe with a higher turnover rate, the food will look more appealing.  $25.95 for all you can eat and drink is a steal!I have been to this buffet many times and it is our normal stop as we drive into Vegas. I can say that I enjoyed it alot better before it became popular (especially with the locals) because the line can be well over 2 hours long.Our most recent trip to the buffet was on Christmas eve. We waited in line for over an hour and it was a total clusterf#$k. The line was unbelievably disorganized. The people who had already paid and were waiting to be seated were blocking the path of the people waiting to pay. Because of this the cashiers were not calling people up to the counter to pay and the line seemingly didn't move for an hour. I was scolded by the cashier when I dared to walk up to the counter without being summoned. Our total wait time was 1 1/2 hours, but when we were led into the dining room there were many empty tables. The line could move more efficiently if they would put some sort of system in place and possibly remodel the entrance to the buffet where people queue and pay.Aside from the logistics, the buffet itself is good but not great. For the price it is a good value considering it includes all you can drink beer and wine. My favorite items at the buffet are the Tomato Basil soup and the sweet potatoes. I sat next to a man and watched him down 4 bowls of the tomato soup...it really is that good.Other than that the prime rib is good, and everything else is hit and miss. Like any other buffet some items are better than others. The desserts are good. There is a nice selection of cookies, pastries, and many different flavors of gelato. There is also an espresso bar where you can get drinks with Baileys, amaretto, Kahlua, etc.Personally I think lunch is the best value at $14.95.3.5 starsI read Pauline C.'s review about this place and I had to go to Studio B to check it out. $26 seafood dinner = awesome deal! Plus, guests may also enjoy beer and wine selections at no additional cost!! well there arent that many selections...they had 3 choices of wines and 2 choices of beers.The food was okay. A lot of the fish was over cooked. The snow crab legs were a too salty, but i'm okay w/ it..but for those who don't like salty food, you have been warned. They do have warm crab legs, so that's a plus, as well as asian style crab legs (sauteed w/ ginger).The oysters, scared me.. did not look appetizing at all. Didn't taste fresh either.The cocktail shrimps - no thanks. not crunchy and they were smaller in since. Salmon - dried..overcookedBlack Cod was goodClams were good and there were a lot of different styles of clams.Seafood selection where abundant but it can do better. However for the price that you're paying, can't complain!The prime ribs were alright. Desserts were good! I also like their coffee bar - your choice of espresso, cappucino, lattes you can even have it w/ a shot of Kahlua, bailey's, etc. Atmosphere, it was okay nothing special.. it's trendy. Oh and yes, do prepare for long waits. The only thing this place got it going for is that they offer free beer / wines. And if you sign up for their reward card, you can get $2 off of the buffet price each time you dine here. I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way and drive out here for their buffet.. i'd only come back to this buffet if i'm on my way driving into the strip or driving back home to LA..so far, Studio B is the manny pacquiao of vegas buffets.1) voted the #1 buffet in vegas - and reigning champ until knocked out2) attracts filipinos like a PPV fight night... seriously, who knew free beer, all you can eat crab legs and seafood buffet, and cheap prices would turn out so many asians.3) i heard you can kareoke it up like Pacman on friday nights too... just kidding... but that would be kinda cool tho...Ok... I'm not really quite sure what constitute a good time frame in terms of reviewing an establishment...1 day? 1 week? 1 Month? 1 Year?  Over the year I have been to so many places and finally realized that yelp is the place to be to review all these establishments... so please do excuse me as I'm trying to catch up with many of my reviews that describes all the places that I have been in the "recent" past (Reasonable amount of time)  They are great memories and I would love to share them with you.Well... here is a good memory for you!The Studio B Buffet.  Located at the top of the hill in Henderson, LV, is a fairly new local casino.  With high praises and recommendations we were told that we "NEED" to be at this buffet as it's the best in Vegas.  I'm really sorry I'm not giving it a 5 star on this but I do have to admit that it's pretty tasty therefore it needs to be on my top Vegas list.Without further delay...Let me cut to the chase and tell you WHAT IS HORRIBLE about this place!!!  Tell me... would any sane person who is starving after all day of fun in the sun / casino / Pool would wait at a buffet for 5 hours???  Well.. you are looking at one!  (Let me remind everyone that I'm never doing that again!!!  EVER!!!)  We got to the M casino early (2:30pm) because we heard that there will be a line forming and we must act fast.  By the time we got there people were already in line for dinner...at 2:30PM!!!!!  (I thought party-goers are still in bed at 2:30pm but waiting at a buffet?  Really?)  So we head to the counter thinking that we need instructions for this....To our surprise.. they asked us to take a number!  (or putting down a name of the party)Let me tell you... once we got the name we were suppose to get back in another line and wait....What the heck???  So we decided to rotate taking turns in line while some of our party members went to have a little private moment with the one armed bandits... As our life passes us... it is now 5:30pm, Dinner Time!  We are absolutely starving and was excited to see the line finally moving.  However, now comes the name part!  The host called out names of the party listed and have them get into another line to wait their turn to get into the actual buffet.  Are you kidding me?  ANOTHER LINE???  Good thing we were called but now I see myself growing older and getting all the grey hair and long grey beard like an ancient chinese kung fu master then finally, we were in......(It's is now 7:15pm PST)  Did I say we were in?  I really meant that we were in beyond the cashiers..... Once we got pass the cash registers, we were in the final line.....This is like American idol audition I tell ya!  gate after gate after gate!  Referring back to my kung fu theme.. how many big bosses do I have to encounter before I reach my food?  I'm getting sad now...Finally, the flood gate opens and we were in...  (It is now 7:45pm PST) Once in, we were treated to football stadium sized TV showing celebrity chefs cooking, but ain't nobody cares as we were so hungry we sat down for 2 seconds, then all headed to the buffet to get our food...Sad to say.. although the food is ok..Had the typical fares of prime rib, snow crab legs, chicken dishes, etc. actually nothing much else stood out for me, but they had an awesome dessert section and free wine and beer!  OH OH!  Can't forget about the GELATO!!!!!  Terrific Gelato for my tummy!  The verdict:  The food was tasty which earned it's 4 star rating (But also including the ambiance, decor, presentation, etc.  So for all foodies who is looking for a dining experience... I'm not sure if this is the place to visit unless you like to wait...It's mostly for locals......One last thing.. apparently the locals knows about this place.  When we went to this buffet they called and told us (the out of towners) to get in line.  The locals (about 8 of them) decided to conveniently show up at 7:30pm and ask how we were doing.... They had the nerves to ask how we were doing?  REALLY?  We were set up the whole time I tell ya!  P.S.  For those who wrote this reviewing stating that there was no line... They either got REALLY lucky or they are just liars!!!  I'll just call the locals next time to get in line for me instead.....(Total waiting time: 5 hrs , total eating time:  1 hr)On the way home from Vegas on a recent trip, bf and I were starving and couldn't decide on anything to eat.. but luckily we were headed past the M Resort and made it just in time for lunch!Weekday *Mon-Fri until 2:30pm* lunch prices are ridiculous.. a whopping $15 including beer and wine! FIFTEEEEEN DOLLARS! ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE! I felt that this was caps-worthy news.They boast over 200 menu items available, and it was quite clear once we quickly entered the buffet after a short wait. The buffet line snakes around and includes all sorts of ethnic dishes.Noteworthy:-pasta salads and mixed salads (huuge variety!), eggplant parmesan, mac and cheese w/ ham, tortellini!-tri-tip, rotisserie chicken (super moist), meatloaf w/ mushroom sauce, carne asada! YUM-3 types of curry: green chicken curry, beef panang, and red seafood curry. They were all so flavorful and delicious! Better than some thai restaurants I've been to.-chocolate crepe, fruit tart, cream puff, creme brulee, and cheesecake w/ raspberry sauce were all deliciousJust so-so:-chicken enchilada was salty-fried chicken was good but greasy-orange chicken and teriyaki chicken were okay-macarons-gelato.. not as good as I've had elsewhereDrinks:you have a good selection of beer, including Heineken on tap! We also had some raspberry cider, and wine choices.At the dessert station there are made-to-order cappuccinos/espressos/lattes which you can add baileys or amaretto to! :)We were also given raffle tickets for free buffets but didn't win :(and the other catch was, there was no seafood (crab legs, oysters, etc) but only a seafood buffet on Friday nights for $30, which I would come back and try sometime! I would definitely have to say for $15 we were thoroughly satisfied and happy. Although this is not considered a gourmet buffet with fancy items, rather more simplistic items, the quality is not sacrificed at all.Overall well deserved 4.5 star rating.okay so last time i went i had a horrible experience.  This time was better.my friends have never been here and wanted to try it. so on our way to vegas, we decided to stop at Studio B for dinner. This time my experience was better. The food was better too! They now have sashimi salad which was my favorite item of the place (aside from the snow crabs).they also have this Thai section, which i thought was pretty good for a buffet. the pad thai was cooked well. and server Choy is awesome. She takes away your dishes at the perfect time. And she refills your drinks without you needing to ask her.I am going to have to say that this buffet is still standing in my book as (dun dun dun) THE BEST BUFFET IN TOWN! Whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner any day of the week, I am still surprisingly satisfied and amazed by the uniqueness, quality, and deliciousness of the food being presented.  I know you all are wondering what there may be in store for you (or at least the ones that have yet to try almost everything out), but there is literally a piece of everything around the globe! From the cheesy macaroni, appeitizing sushi rolls, and enticing kalbi ribs, to the yummy-in-my-tummy Creme brulee, various flavors of gelato, and savory taste of what is found in the tiramisu cups, there is at least one thing for everyone to enjoy! Hint, for those of you who are 21 years old and up, congratulations because you get unlimited cider, wine, or beer with the presentation of your ID! If you are also wondering when the best time to go is, I suggest going either on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (if you are addicted to seafood like I am)! Depending on your luck, they serve clams, oysters, shrimps, crab legs (either warm or cold), and muscles! If you're really curious as to what type of seafood they are serving specially for that day, give them a call!As some of my fellow Yelpers have mentioned, this is one snazzy buffet.  When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.I have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  Meats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  While not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.And then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.Finally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.Overall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election.What can be said that hasn't been in over 500 reviews?!?!?Get in line before 6pm.  The line is longer than some nights at Tao.  I try to get there at seniors dinner time which is like 4pm..5 at the very latest.  Don't even bother after 7.Why not have a few beers/glasses of wine before even eating?  Hey..you waited long enough in that goddamn line.  Might as well take your time and enjoy it.  It surprises me that I've never seen anyone inebriated beyond comprehension....ASIDE from my wife's friend who downed about 18 glasses of wine and actually had to be assisted back to our booth by a server since she was lost and couldn't walk in a straight line.  We actually had to carry her out of the M.  Miiiiiildly embarrassing.  3rd best daily buffet in town.  Bellagio and Wynn are still better.THE GOD OF LVG BUFFET IN MY OPINION.must. bow. down. (specially. you. wynn. buffet).snow crab legs, wine/beer selection, grilled fish with mango sauce, bbq, kbbq, asianfusion, desserts.I feel like scoring jackpot every time I eat here :DBest buffet in Las Vegas? Please. This is the best buffet I have ever been to. Taps Fish House is close, but Studio B wins because of value (Taps is a steep $32.99 for Sunday brunch while Studio B is $29.99 on weekends and just $14.99 for weekday lunch). I realize I can get carried away with superlatives at times, but I was able to catch the $14.99 weekday lunch, and this might be the best value I have ever gotten from a buffet. Here are the things that stick out most in my head (mostly great, a few bad):Macaroni and cheese - Before you smack me in the head for getting mac and cheese at a buffet, hear me out. I normally don't. But this mac...spoke to me. On my first trip I could hear the mac call out my name, but I decided to walk past it. When I got back to the table, I asked everyone how their food was. Cindy T immediately said that the mac and cheese is RIDICULOUS. Shit. I knew right then that there was no avoiding this mac and cheese cooked with diced ham. I got a scoop of it on my next trip, and it blew my mind. BLEW MY MIND.Prime rib - For a lot of people, this is the main appeal of Vegas buffets. Unlimited prime rib. Many sins will be forgiven of a buffet if they can just do this one thing right. And not that they had to because they had so much other outstanding stuff, but Studio B does their prime rib MARVELOUSLY. I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the prime rib (I only meant to taste it), but that piece of meat was so good that the entire thing ended up in my stomach.Panang beef - I just recently discovered the creamy, spicy miracle that is panang beef (like a month ago recently), so when I saw this at the buffet it was like a sign from God. The panang beef is DELICIOUS. It lived up to every expectation that I had for it. The pad thai is good too, but the panang beef over steamed rice is what you want.Clam chowder - Another universal dish that pleases a large proportion of diners if a buffet can pull it off, and Studio B more than pulls it off. This chowder is FILLED with clams. It would've been heavenly with some tabasco sauce, but I had inhaled the bowl before a waitress could walk by.BBQ beef ribs - I told myself that I would only eat a few bites to save room for everything else. But after I picked it up...I couldn't seem to put it down again. I pounded that bad boy. These aren't quite "mind-blowing," but the meat is tender, well-sauced, and just really good.Mahi mahi with mango sauce - I was so full and dazed at this point that I was only able to eat one bite, and I barely remember how it tasted. I'm pretty sure it was delicious.Oxtail soup - Wasn't able to try this, and I'm devastated. Next time this will be first on my list.Fried chicken - Dry and bland. Don't bother.Madeleines - Sweet. Baby. Jesus. These things are amazing. They are PERFECTLY crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.Chocolate souffle - If you love chocolate, and I mean absolutely worship chocolate, you will die for these.Pistachio shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.Oreo shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.Gelato - Absolutely ridiculous.Canoli - Absolutely ridiculous.Oh and one last thing - open bar.I am not much into buffets anymore, however this is one I would repeat! I went on a Saturday which is the seafood brunch and everything else under the sun! I think this buffet is worth a try for sure, a different experience. I was not able to see the live cooking demonstration in which I was really excited about as I was there between the two times a day they have an actual foodnetwork presentation.  The service is impeccable, I swear our drink server was connected to my hip, never went more than eyes reach of me. She kept my drinks filled to the brim! However I am not sure that everyone gets that superb treatment, I think it was my sweet, adorable, loving personality that really attracted her to service me really good. I am also really pretty to boot, pleasing on the eyes, so... lol Needless to say she got a fat tip baby! Fatter than normal I am sure :) And yes, I took advantage and had some alcohol, a couple of mimosa's, wine, champagne, and a couple of brewski's!I have included the details below provided courtesy of the Studio B Buffet :)Choose from over 200 items daily  Beer and Wine Included with Lunch and DinnerStudio B brings you a buffet experience unlike anywhere else by integrating a state-of-the-art restaurant with a live-action cooking studio.

Possibly one of the best buffets in Vegas. It's located in the really nice, but also empty M Resort 10 miles off the strip.I'm always skeptical of buffets with a large variety of "ethnic foods," but everything was generally great. I especially loved the layout of this buffet! HUGE!- A large island in the middle for meat carvings: prime rib (my fav!), mahi mahi cooked on a fancy bamboo stalk, roasted chicken, and more.- The seafood stations divided by cold and hot. So the chilled crab legs were by the raw oysters and there was also hot crab legs, yay!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?userid=QMqSgBqSrlRhz2B0UiORjw- Never ending dessert station. My friend and I looked at the tiny plates provided for the desserts, and we made a detour to grab some large plates: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=LR3Fm9zcy0ayy1BF4BikkA variety! Possibly 30% of what I consumed consisted of creme brulee....- AYCE beer (on tap) and wine station. Didn't get to take advantage of this yet, but definitely will next time! They also have cider on tap- Coffee bar at the end of the dessert station, so I ended my meal and desserts with a nice cappuccino.I never have conversations with the people who prep and cook buffet foods, but the staff and cooks were so nice!Sat & Sun: Seafood Brunch & Dinner $33.99Saturday: until 2 p.m. buy one, get one free!**even struggling to type this review because of my pudgy fingers**My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bABreakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24Seafood Brunch Sat/Sun 9am-2:30pm  $34Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.BUT, there's so much stuff!

GELATO of many kinds, tarts, MEATS: Brisket, ribs, tri tip, pork loin,hamOthers: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE?!fuck the food...go for the drinks...it's a deal!Ok, but if you do care about the food, dont trip chocolate chip...the foood is bombbb. This is one of the  best buffets in vegas. It's off the strip, but the food is really good. They have the best crab legs everrrrr.What does the "B" in @Mresort Studio B buffet stand for?Hmm how about...B for bountiful! Studio B buffet has so much selection! They have all kinds of food- like Italian (pizzas, pastas), Chinese (orange chicken, fried rice, chow mein), Thai (yellow curry, red curry), American (turkey, prime rib, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes), Mexican (Spanish rice, enchiladas), breakfast entrees (eggs, bacons, corn beef hash, potatoes), all kinds of salads and a abundant amount of different desserts  (creme brulee, meringues, cheesecakes, gelato)B for beautiful! Studio B buffet's presentation of food is simply beautiful. The desserts are a perfect example of this. They have colorful meringue cookies (pink, yellow, green), cute dessert shooters, cheesecakes drizzled in sweet strawberry syrup, small awesome looking fruit tarts and scrumptious multicolored gelato!B for brilliant! Studio B buffet has a brilliant setup! The overall buffet atmosphere is a true winner! I like how they showcase different clips from the food network all around on large screens all around the buffet. In between the clips, are cute cartoons of dancing fruit! When we were there, at the dessert bar, there was a Super Mario cake that was a winner at a dessert contest. It was one cool looking cake. Visually pleasant and hip all around, one can enjoy scrumptious food in one of the coolest looking buffets in Vegas.Lastly, B for best! Yummy tasting food, good selection and nice presentation of food and cool place = Studio B buffet :).What B is it for you? ;)Like this place needs another review!!! (I THINK SO!!!!)For $30+/per person for either BLD, I think it's worth it! Vegas is all about their buffets and extravagance - Studio B is probably the epitome of both! I heard lines can form and people wait for hours just dying to eat here on the weekends. BUT!!!!! If you just come a little bit earlier (which is why the early bird gets the worm), you'd be able to not wait as long and just chow down as you intended to.I came here for my grandmother's 75th birthday. My fam bam took her out to brunch. Service was awesome and the food was grastronomical! Food that they cater to: Mediterranean/Lebanese, Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino, American, Southern, Mongolian, Italian, Chinese, Seafood (FRESHLY STEAMED KING CRAB LEGS & OYSTERS!!!), Mexican, Indian and the desserts!Memorable foods I'd love to eat HERE again:- Hawaiian Poke - Hawaiian Lau lau- Caprese Salad- Ribs- Sweet Potatoes- King crab legs- Oysters[SODIUM WARNING] I took off one star due to the HIGH salty taste of their LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP. It sounds amazing, but just tasting the darn thing reeked sodium overload! I couldn't finish the bowl I had poured for myself and hated that such great food went to waste [**insert sad face here**]DESSERTS: I enjoyed all of their mini dessert shooters! Pistachio, Tiramisu, Cookies N' Creme are just to name a few...... Not to mention their gelato, yummy cakes, cookies and other decadent delightfuls! Desserts weren't over-powering sweet! Just right to end your meal extravaganza at Studio B!Overall thought?I will definitely come back to Studio B when I'm back in the neighborhood! Great service, great food (minus the lobster bisque) and come hungry (and early) to get your moolah's worth!Next time: I'm going to tackle the "unlimited wine" I heard about!I have a hard time putting this LV buffet in the top of my pyramid of buffets in LV when I love the Wynn buffet so much.  But in in terms of value this is the best place for your buck.  Studio B offers complimentary beer and wine unlike the other buffets in LV, but the only drawback of this buffet is that you need a car or you need to pay a hefty taxi fee to get to The M Resort, the location of Studio B.  It's a hike from the strip, which is why I only see SoCal peeps, local peeps, and high rollers staying in the hotel or gambling in the casino.Studio B is phenomenal.  The quality of the food is pretty darn good for a buffet.  I like the fact they have oxtail, crawfish, and crabs (on seafood night), and other high quality dishes.  My only recommendation would be to stay clear of this buffet during the holidays.  We waited 3 hours in line to get in this past Christmas.  Unfortunately, for us, our line pass was good for January only...darn!  Other than holidays the lines aren't really that bad compared to the other buffets in The Strip.  I would rather come to Studio B than the Wynn or Bellagio buffets if I had no line pass and a mode of transportation.  The Wynn buffet is still my fave.  If the Wynn would offer me a line pass...I would choose it beyond any other in LV.For living in Southern Highlands, I can't believe how stupid I was in not coming here earlier. My stomach prolly hates me right meow!Hawaii family was in town and wanted to try something new.I've always heard about this buffet but, hearing that they had oysters on the menu sealed the deal.We arrived to an hour long wait. Which is to be expected on a Saturday night. Thankfully the bar was near by so, we had a few drinks to entertain us in line. Drinks were cheap, too =) You don't even know how shocked I was at paying $15 for 3 drinks.Once we got inside, I headed straight for the oysters. Ugh, SOOO GOOD!And next to the oysters was OXTAIL and KALUA PIG AND CABBAGE.I have never been to a buffet that has any of those. I was, literally, blown away.Their dessert menu is, by far, bigger and better than Wicked Spoon. And we alllll know how much iiiiiiiiiiiiiii love Wicked Spoon. It was levels on levels of desserts AND they, also, had dessert and coffee drinks made to order. IN-SANE.By the time, I ate my way through the buffet line was when I realized that WINE AND BEER WAS AYCE (AYCD), too. Sadly, I was too stuffed to drink anything. In the words of Arnold Swartlakjdlkjdlkja;lkjf - "I'll be back!"I've heard so much good stuff for here so we came for lunch on a Friday afternoon on our way to Vegas.  Luckily, there was no line to get in and we go seated near the windows with a view of he strip.  The bad thing was, it was so far away from the food!  :P  No prob though, we needed to get the cardio in.  We started in the salad line and made our way through the whole buffet.  I loved the way it was set up.  Lots of action stations and lots of variety.   However, I don't know, I wasn't impressed with the flavors of things.  The best thing I had was the beet salad.  That was really good.  Everything else was just average.  I'm not much of a drinker, but the unlimited beer and wine was cool.  The root beer on tap was really good too. The service we got was average, some of our dirty plates were on our tables a lil too long though.I'd like to try other places again before coming back here.  I guess the $16 price tag for lunch was a deal for the variety to keep everyone happy.This is hands-down the Best Buffet in Vegas!  On weekends--Friday Saturday and Sunday--Studio B has a Seafood Buffet, and for the same price that you're paying for The Buffet at The Wynn ($43 with tax on weekend), you get much, much more value.Why is Studio B better than The Buffet at The Wynn?  Here's a few reasons why:- Quality is much better than the Wynn buffet.  Overall, the meat & food quality is better at Studio B.- More Variety: Studio B has a much more variety of dishes for you to choose from.- Unlimited Beer & Wine: yep, one of the things I love about this place is that they serve unlimited All-You-Can-Drink beer & wine as part of your buffet meal that you've already paid for.  At the Wynn buffet, you'll have to buy beer or wine separately.The thing I love most of about this buffet is that they have raw oysters.  (see photo)  Yum...unlimited raw oysters!  I must have had over 35 raw oysters, which could have easily costed me $50 right there.  The oysters, however, weren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.  They come out somewhat fresh...but at least fresh enough to be good to eat.  But you'll have to pick them out individually from the buffet tray.  Add a nice squeeze of lemon and maybe a touch of cocktail sauce and you should be good.  It's still good, and above all a great value for what you're paying.I also had Alaskan Crab Legs, which was very good. (see photo)  The hot butter sauce here has a nice little touch of sweetness to it that complements crab legs and brings out the taste of meat pretty well.  The slightly sweeter sauce is much better than the sauce at the Wynn buffet, which is just plain butter sauce.  The Alaskan Crab Legs quality was about the same here at Studio B and The Buffet at The Wynn.We also picked up a plate of Crawfish (see photo).  I'd have to say that this was my only disappointment.  The Crawfish, unfortunately, wasn't fresh.  Instead, it was frozen.  It definitely makes a big difference in taste, but I can't really complain for the price I'm paying for this buffet and for what I'm already getting.  I guess we'll stick to The Boiling Crab in So Cal for crawfish.  So far that's the best place for it (as far as I know).The Prime Rib was good as well.  The meat quality at Studio B seems to be a little better than the meat quality at The Buffet (at The Wynn).  The meat is more moist and juicy.  The prime rib I had at The Buffet seemed a slightly dry.  It was still ok, but it was a little dryer than Studio B's prime rib.Everything else here was great!  They have such a great variety of food here, and the quality of everything is also great!  You really do get a good bang out of your buck here at Studio B, and I'd recommend this place to anyone....so far, this is the overall + seafood buffet in Vegas! :)Let me start by saying that I am not much of a buffet fan because 1 You feel like you're forced to eat your money's worth,  2 The freshness of food is rare because it sits out in warmers for who knows how long, 3 The drinks that are normally included are standard cheap drinks such as water, juice and coffee. Last but not least, 4 Desserts always seem the same. However, Studio B which is: LOCATED in the M Resort on the south side of Vegas, sheds a little light for me and here is why: My friends and I came for the seafood brunch. The selection was pretty much what I was expecting. Your standard crab legs, variety of sushi, oysters, shrimp and so forth. They also had prime rib. I give props to the crab legs which was pretty fresh and the prime rib which was satisfactory.  I wasn't impressed with the other stuff as the quality and freshness just wasn't there. Overall, the food was okay but eating your money's worth without unbuttoning your pants wasn't a problem because it's seafood.  Here is where it gets good. The DRINKS that were included were different from your normal buffets. - They had beers on tap! Can you believe that? Now of course it's not self serve but I still think that's awesome. I don't quite remember the different brands of beer but I do know they had a cider flavor  which was pretty good. They serve wine as well. It was the first time I ever left a buffet buzzing. They also had a coffee station where you can order espressos and other specialty coffee drinks. Like a mini Starbucks. I didn't try it but it sure looked cool. The desserts were pretty standard here with your variety of bite size cakes, creme brulee's, fruit tarts and so forth. But! they got a GELATO station!  I don't remember all the flavors at the time but I do know they had around 8 to 10 different flavors. I tried the pistachio and strawberry. Both were delicious. The SERVICE here was standard for a buffet. We didn't run into any problems. I must say that I was impressed with the employees manning the beer, coffee and gelato stations. They were pretty quick at handling the lines. This place is around 3.5 for me but I will round to a 4 stars for the overall experience and value.This may have been one of the best buffets a few years ago, but Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal have passed it by with their unique dishes and plating. The food at Studio B is still better than most buffets I've tried but my opinion of the place has changed since my first visit years ago when the M Resort opened.Desserts are the best option here with the apple pie, cookies, and pecan tart leading the way. Items like stewed and braised meats work well because the quality doesn't diminish as quickly when it's been sitting out a long time as opposed to other dishes where timing and freshness matter. For example, the chimichangas and pizza crusts get soggy  after a while and mussels become rubbery. You should skip the sushi altogether. The Asian section with kalbi beef, curry, and kung pao beef fared much better and were some of the more memorable dishes.There's a buffet that's been on my mind...all the timeStu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohNow I know that it's not on the Strip, but with a car you can get there in a zipStu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohTucked in the corner of the MPlenty of options, it's a gemFresh are the off'rings at this buffetI ate so much, at least five more pounds I weigh...Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohFive more pounds I weigh-ayStu-Stu-studio! oh oh ohVeggie options bountiful!

Here is what I came up with.Positive - Beer and Wine is included in the price. And it isn't horrible.                  Deserts are great, some of the better Gelato I have had outside of Italy.                  a lot of choices.                  The chef was very friendly and eager to assist at the carving station.The rest of the review - Ok this was a horrible experience from the start.  When we arrived we were sixth in line on a mid week night..  It took us over 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 30 minutes to get seated.  The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).So we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  My first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.Specific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level)When we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.The place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1/2 of in the car.)Under our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.)All in all it was a huge disappointment.  I think the majority of people who rate this place high do so because of the free alcohol.I will not be back here.Being as there are a TON of reviews already, I'll try to point some key things out.Soo this buffet (inside M casino) had a very high reputation when they first opened but they've dipped in some areas. But in my opinion, still deserve a high rating as long as you:- DON'T GO TO ANY OF THEIR SEAFOOD BUFFETS! Honestly they add only like 3 different options for seafood and they are not great at all. I remember their lobster was mainly just stuffing! Ack!- Avoid going during any major holiday! Especially Mother's Day! Was $49.99 a person and we were all disappointed especially after waiting 2 hours! -Only go to their Monday-Friday Lunch from 11am-2:30pm for $15.99. Same quality as the Dinner and Seafood Buffet in my opinion without their measley 3 extra options lol.Hours of Operation:Lunch= Mon. - Fri. 11:00am - 2:30pm $15.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $11.99Dinner= Mon. - Thur. 2:30pm-8:00pm $23.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $17.99Seafood Buffet= Sat. - Sun. 11:00am - 8:00pm $39.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99Seafood Dinner= Fri. 2:30pm - 8:00pm $39.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99During my most recent visit a few days ago for Lunch, it was exactly like I remembered! Tons of vegetarian options including about 10 different salads and I love the mushroom ravioli! But they also offer prime rib, fried chicken, green mussels, pad thai, yellow curry, all the usual chinese options, tomato bisque soup, pastas, jambalaya and a lot of the other usuals but done better than most buffets. And of course, their infamous desserts! Just try like all of them, you won't regret it. Well, maybe your pants will lol. But overall, I still love this buffet. I just won't waste my time and money for anything besides their lunch! Enjoy! :)Very decent food with good selection. And with a CA DL you get 5 dollars off!Love the crab legs and the ox tail soup. I drank a lot of the ox tail soup! Yum!The steaks are ok. But still, rest of the cuisines are great!We went there on Friday night and there was not a big line, so we got in fast. I would say it's the best in Vegas recently. Good price, good food and good service!Headed to this buffet before reaching Vegas because supposedly they had an awesome lunch deal.$20 bucks per person!! Not bad at all.Huge varieties of different foods, which were all super tasty btw, and their DESSERTS. MY GAHD. I was munchin' on them cookies, their mini pecan tarts? Friggin addicting.The staff were all so friendly as well. Definitely a favorite of mine so far.This buffet is pretty good!  It's located a little ways away from the strip at M Hotel and Casino.  If you park on the 2nd floor of the structure, it'll lead you right to the buffet.  Special discount: $5 off with a CA ID!  The crab legs and oysters were extremely fresh, and there was a good selection of different cuisines to choose from.  My only gripe is that the sushi section was very limited.  My favorite part of buffets is the sushi/sashimi area.  I guess the unlimited oysters and crab legs made up for it though!  One of the best parts of this buffet is the unlimited drinks.  They have wine and beer as well as some cocktails.  The dessert here is also really good.  It's not as big as my favorite Las Vegas buffet and the price is about the same.  But if you show them your California ID, you get $5 off!  The line here is also really short compared to the ones on the strip and moves quite fast.  If I want a good buffet without having the 2 to 3 hour lines, this is the buffet I'll go to!  Fresh food, quick lines, and unlimited oysters and crab legs...what's better than that?!So I lost 40 lbs in the past 6 months and gained at least 10 lbs in 90 minutes eating what is described below. Wednesday 11/18th I came to feast by myself and was very impressed with the Studio B buffet at M Resort. I would consider this buffet one of the best in Las Vegas, and the best buffet for locals.The carving station was in the round and this buffet is designed in a serpentine shape. Each of the food bins had their own digital thermometer showing the temperature which was comforting compared to other buffets where i've questioned to myself if it was safe to eat.Fantastic foods I devoured that added at least 10 lbs to my body weight within 90 minutes included chef salad, Greek salad, stuffed grape leaves, large cocktail shrimp w/ lemon wedges & tangy sauce, several trips to the amazingly delicious trimmed prime rib where the chef was kind enough to ask how thick of a cut I desired and if I prefer medium or medium rare, woodstone fire oven pizza, pork loin, lamb paella, curry chicken, oxtail soup w/ peanuts, kalbi beef ribs, chicken adobo, kalua pork, miso glazed salmon w/ coconut rice, rosemary garlic lamb chops, pork osso buco, BBQ pork ribs, fried chicken, fried pollock, grilled pork chops, chicken saltimbocca, fried clam strips, tempura veggies, potato au gratin, creamed spinach, steamed swai fish, grilled asparagus, steam cauliflower, waffle fries, sweet potato puree w/ marshmallows, hericot vert green beans w/ almonds, ginger carrot coins, mussels, melons, assorted sushi w/ masago, and the dessert station oh my where to start? I won't admit it! At least they have comfy chairs :-)3 wines, 4 beers on tap and 1 root beer on tap are all included with this buffet. I had ice tea.Studio B has a very modern decor and beautiful interior design. Estimate 50 flat screen TVs that form a wall 3' foot high stretching at least 100' feet in length, advertising areas of the M Resort and some of the TVs showed the Food Network. Low volume classic rock played as background music, to an upscale clientele that I judge based on manners and apparel.Friendly service by the cashier, hostess, server, each of the chefs including the head chef. A nice conversation with the head chef who shared with me the 13 Southern NV Health District Grade A Certificates were because all the cooking is done here and the SNHD requires each station to have its own.I did not take photos inside as I would never be able to focus on my Gluttony :-)See 2 outside photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #286

Restaurant name  Joey's of Chicago

Review Text :
Ha!  Joey's of Chicago is a total 5 star place to grab a fantastic Italian beef sandwich!  Despite what you may read in a few of the other reviews this place is a reliable 4 to 5 star experience.   You can count on it!  What the heck! who goes to a Chicago  style restaurant that is known for the hotdogs and Italian beef and orders a hamburger??  (Although I heard their hamburgers are burger-licious too)!This place is locally owned by some very nice folks transplanted from the burbs of Chicago.  At least I know one of them is from Schaumburg, grew up there, at least that's what I heard while eavesdropping :-)  Seriously these folks are from Chicago and they know how to cook some great Chicago style hot dogs and some DELISH hot Italian beef!   It good enough to make to folks at Portillo's proud to have some respectable competition!   Oh but this not Portillo's, for their Italian beef is a little different but in a good way!  I had their Italian roast beef sandwich with hot peppers covered with melted provolone cheese dry with a side of dip. (Don't call it ausue... Haha, that's what the peeps from Arizona called it.  In Chicago it's simply called dipping sauce :-)  Anyways, my sandwich was DELISH! The folks with me also had the same thing but they had the sandwich dipped and the other got their's wet.  I don't care for soggy bread but they seemed to like it all the same.  Hungry for a fantastic italian beef sandwich or a super chicago style hotdog Joey's is a great place! It's almost guaranteed you'll meet some other folks from the Chicago area dinning here.  I'm not from Chicago but I travel there all the time and I know you'll have a 4 to 5 star experience.  I hope to see you there!

Review Text :
My last review...Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.  But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice. I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.  Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.  Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business...This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.  The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.  Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!As you would expect from a place as ornate as Caesar's Palace, this has to be the prettiest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' "THX 1138" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. Yet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. The scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips. FOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish SERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? TOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smileI am very surprised by the number of poor reviews for Beijing Noodle. This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant and there are no P.F. Changish dishes going on here so maybe that's part of the problem. I am only knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars because the service( even for a Chinese place) is challenging and in true fashion it's hard to get away from the MSG here.  Some general notes-observations that may help:To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the "Palace" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable. If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.   Beef with Hand Pull Noodle -sensational and complex beef flavor.Not all that spicy a advertised.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQThe XO sauce works well with the velvety noodles but the MSG is a bummer for me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#7AfT3oZKnjLMKGoKCi4PowAsparagus and Scallop in XO sauce- well executed by not my favorite of the lot. The scallops were a tad sandy and that is always a no-no. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#8Owy1p3ypoKRr1UGOB8ugwThe pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand.If you are in Cesar's Palace and fancy yourself some Chinese food... Skip this place altogether. The decor is misleadingly impressive. I had a gift card that was authorized for use here, I checked with the manager on duty prior to being seated and he said yes. After eating the subpar food reminiscent of any typical hole in the wall (not in a good way) Chinese restaurant you'll normally frown at as you pass by, I presented the gift card which was denied by the manager. There are many places very nearby in which you can pay less, for higher quality food. Do yourself the favor and frown as you pass by.Visiting Beijing Noodle No. 9 was a little bit of a homecoming for me because it's at the same space where I had my first Vegas fine dining experience 15 years ago when it was known as 808, a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant.  Well, Beijing Noodle isn't exactly same restaurant but I had a decent experience here.I don't see how this place can get less than 3 stars.  It's a very clean and hip looking spot.  The decor with the fish tanks is very eye-popping for a noodle house (http://bit.ly/1FsSJd0).  How can you not want to go inside and check it out?  Plus its got an open noodle kitchen which was genius for them to put out in the front so you can see the chefs show off their noodle pulling skills which is almost like a Vegas show in itself (http://bit.ly/1MU6Sp7).  It was a total no-brainer for me to sit at the noodle bar to see them work on the noodles from start to finish (http://bit.ly/1H4K5IY).On to the food.  So obviously I came here because I woke up with a craving for noodles.  I opted for the Pork Wonton Noodle Soup with Knife-shaved noodles and ordered a Thai Iced Tea for my drink.Thai Iced Tea -- http://bit.ly/1BtOnqQIt's pretty much your basic Thai Iced Tea.  Nothing too fancy or subtle about it.  But it was a little pricey though at $7.Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Broth with Knife-Shaved Noodles -- http://bit.ly/1GxRP31Even though I was impressed with the chefs making the handpulled noodles, I settled with the Knife-shaved noodles with the Pork Wonton soup.  And just was entertaining as the handpulled noodles were, I was just was impressed seeing the chef shaving off the noodles from a huge hunk of noodle dough into the cooker.  So they were definitely fresh as well.  Overall, the Pork Wontons and Noodles were great.  My issue was that the broth really had no flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything so I had to add extra soy and chili sauce to give it a little kick.So overall Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a decent casino noodle house.  I came here to satisfy my noodle craving and it did just that with some professional noodle-pulling showmanship as a plus.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes.  It is pricey though but convenient if you have a craving for noodles on the Strip and don't want to take a bus or cab ride to Chinatown.*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown.

Review Text :
I guess you could call it our first official date PB (post-baby).  It was a last minute decision to check out Rhythm Kitchen on a Friday night, especially since we drive by it all the time and have to wonder what it's like.We walked in to an elegant foyer and for a moment, I felt a bit under dressed.  There were two hostesses manning the front, one of whom I had the impression was the owner or manager.  With no reservations, we were easily seated at a table right by the pianist.  (They just added the pianist on a regular basis.)  It was really nice inside the dining room, and rather busy.  Despite the upscale feeling, there's a very casual crowd inside which works out great.  You can have a nice dinner out without the stuffiness.  Since we were on a time limit, we ordered only entrees and waited for them to arrive.  In the meantime, a basket of hush puppies and one bread roll with sweet butter arrived at our table.  (We are a party of two, only one bread roll?)  Nonetheless, we enjoyed the piping hot hush puppies and the warm bread. There was a bit of lag time as we waited for our food and I was under the impression that it felt like it was a bit understaffed.  It looked like there were three waiters, which had me concerned with how long it would take our food to come out since the wait staff definitely took their time with each customer (getting drink orders, getting apps started, explaining items on the menu, etc.).  It gave us a chance to enjoy the lovely music though.  Our food did arrive by someone else and the Husband chose Seafeast Platter "Combination of catfish fillets, oysters, fried shrimp and cold boiled shrimp." ($17.79) It came with one side, and he chose a Baked Potato with his.  He appreciated that it was loaded with butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  The deep fried catfish and oysters were pretty good, and not overly oily or fatty.  It had a good batter on it.  His platter also came with their chow chow relish.I chose the Grilled Cajun Scallops "With andouille sausage." ($17.99)  It came with two sides, and I chose the Baked Potato and Sauteed Mushrooms.  The scallops were on a kabob stick (about 9 large scallops), along with sausage, bell peppers, and onions.  Rice and gravy sat underneath my protein.  The scallops were pretty good, not overcooked at all.  More on the rare side, which I prefer.  And the mushrooms were cooked very nicely too.  I pretty much devoured my dinner (as a customer noted from a nearby table).  This same customer also commented on how delicious her crab chowder and deep fried alligator was.  She even offered some to us!Since we were in a rush, I quickly asked our waiter for our check and let him know we had a baby waiting.  He seemed like he understood our urgency, but took the time to clear our table first.  (Yes, I know he was doing his job, but I think he missed the point that we needed to go and now!)The manager/owner took the time to talk to us and let us know about the bar/lounge connected next door and their happy hour.  She also mentioned that they have banquet facilities upstairs and there's a live band that will be coming on a regular basis as well.  (I think there's a cover charge.)  She also mentioned joining their email list so we could find out what entertainment was going on.Overall, we both were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our experience at Rhythm Kitchen.  One would have a better experience if you can enjoy a leisurely dinner instead.  Yes, it might be a bit pricey depending on what you get, so it helps that they are in the Entertainment Book.So the response I receive from Scott G of Rhythm Kitchen is;"Hi Shawn,Unfortunately it's our policy to ONLY accept one offer  at a time. It's posted with our 1/2 off wine that it CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. In addition, your Living Social deal also stated CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. We do remember when you were here - and you had a Groupon you tried to use in addition to the Living Social and 1/2 wine special. We apologize for any confusion you my have experienced - however if you use Groupons/Living Social deals often it's standard that the deals can NOT be combined with any other offer.Hope this helps!"The funny thing about this response is that I didn't have a groupon that I was trying to use and YES people I understand NOW that their policy doesn't allow the use of two or more offers.  However when one is told in the beginning of their dinner by someone that is representing such policies that you could get 1/2 price bottle of wine after they knew of living social, combo that with it being my first time there and trusting the server to guide me.  I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED THE WINE IF I WERE NOT TOLD THAT I COULD GET IT 1/2 PRICE!!!  The "lady" that came to the table even said the server was wrong and he will never make that mistake again.  Great so fix it ma'am and stop saying its my fault.  As I said to Scott G to his response if I ever received a response it would be the caliber it is..  Lame.  Also I didn't experience any confusion just embarrassment for me and my guest with being told the police were going to be called and being rudely spoken to by that "lady" manager.  Again if you are considering dining here, I highly suggest you reconsider.We came back here for happy hour.  These 2 things should/would make RK at least 3 stars:1. The service was quick and friendly.2. They were giving away free Miller Lite. But it all went to shit when the food came.  The prices for happy hour are pretty awesome.  I just wish the food was somewhere close to that too.  Our alligator bites were served cold and sent back.  KFC chicken wings are 5 stars compared to the ones they serve and the pizza was shameful.  Seriously!  Just buy frozen pizza from the same place you buy the frozen alligator nuggets and give that a shot.  I'm only coming back for alcohol if there is another visit.I was here once for a music program on the second floor and just had drinks while I listened to the band and singer.  I was always intrigued by their menu.I asked the server about the alligator because the menu had it available both blackened and breaded.  She explained how each was prepared and then said that I could get half of each.  That's what I ordered.  My wife ordered the chicken with pasta in cream sauce.  We did not have any starters.Our iced tea was brought quickly and a basket with hush puppies and two rolls was brought.  The butter for me was awful.  It was honey butter.  Maybe it's a southern thing.  I like salted butter and this was just too sweet for me.  It was also hard as a rock from being kept in a very cold refrigerator/freezer another hang up I have.Our meals came and I totally enjoyed the alligator.  If I got it again, I'd definitely get half of each.  It really is good.  There was a nice dipping sauce that came with the dish and the alligator had a spicy flavor.  My wife liked her pasta.  It was tri-color withe a Southern style Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.  I think the sauce was a bit off putting for her.We had dessert.  I had the Mississippi mud pie and my wife had the crème brûlée.  My mud pie was mostly icy chocolate ice cream--something I wouldn't get again.  My wife really enjoyed her brûlée.Service became an issue before and after dessert.  The place got busy and it didn't seem like the staff could keep their acts together.  I had a show to go to and I made the reservation for 5:15 which would give me a good cushion for dinner with time to get home and get ready to go to the show.  It took so long to get the bill and then pay it that my cushion of time disappeared.  I had to hurry to get my wife home and then get to the theatre.  Plan accordingly.Had a groupon for this place. First walked in, had a sinking feeling that I was in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The place is so big, didn't know where to go. Hostess sat us down, place was kind of empty. More of those nightmares starting to creep in.You walk in and you already smell desperation. Not from the servers. The service was fine overall. Just that the place didn't know what it wanted to be. It's trying real hard to be fancy. Waiters with the vests, white linen, wine pairings, candles on the table, music you'd hear waiting for the weather on the 8's on the weather channel plays. It just didn't feel like it connected. This is supposed to be New Orleans style cuisine. I'm expected a party, some jazz, some energy and I got...elevator music? Kitchen....nightmares....Food. The hushpuppies were fine. Bread was old, dry and flaky. The gumbo was not good. It was microwaved as the middle was molten hot and the outside was luke warm at best. Crab inside was fishy. Hardly any sausage. The Crab Cake Elaine was a travesty. Crab Cake over seasoned AND burnt, etouffe tasted strange. The red beans and rice was the worst I've ever had, over cooked and flat out gross. Brussel sprouts came out cold. The Mac and Cheese was also Microwaved AND overcooked. Hardly resembled Mac or Cheese. Kitchen...nightmares....Spoke with waiter (Rob) and told him we were not happy with what we got. Traded mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and got the shrimp kabob appetizer instead. Waiter informed us that there was a rookie chef in the kitchen and that it was obvious that the crabcake was overcooked. Kitchen...nightmares...The mashed potatoes were okay, which is saying a lot for how this meal was going. There were bits of garlic in there, which was nice. Sucked that the mashed potatoes were still really lumpy. The shrimp kabobs were strange as well. It was obviously overcooked on one side, charred to hell. My first bite was grittier than all hell. Think that the sauce got burnt on that. The rice pilaf was better than the red beans and rice, but that's like saying the Jets right now are better than the Raiders. Ain't saying much. The rice pilaf was still overcooked and watery. Brussell sprouts again and this time i just unraveled them and they were just stone cold in the middle. Kitchen...nightmares....Before I even finished eating there, my stomach hurt. It must have known that it was going to pay too much money for this type of food. I left a comment card on there and I did tell them that I could pay $2.50 for Stouffer's and be eating that while watching Breaking Bad in my underwear. It didn't make sense to have the waiters act like this place is some high dining establishment when they can't be bothered to have decent soup or even make mac and cheese. Kitchen...nightmares...The server was nice, didn't want to send food back, but it was really the worst food I've had in a long time. It was awful. I'm so glad I tried to stick to things that would get me too sick. The rookie chef thing might be true or it could just be an excuse on why mac and cheese is getting microwaved. Whatever it is, it shouldn't be happening. Kitchen....nightmares....Sometimes you need to go back to a place, again and again, before you can really change your first impression. This is definitely been true with Rhythm Kitchen.From the very beginning I have wanted to like this place, I crave great cajun cuisine quite often and it helps to have a place you can rely on. Like BBQ, Cajun / Creole restaurants in the Valley mostly fall drastically short of mediocre.I have been back several times since my first review, and I have to say, I am starting to warm to this place. Their jambalaya is not great, but it is good enough to get a 3 stars from me. The rest of the food still lingers around the 3 star range, the service is 3 star for sure these days, up form a dismal 1 star, but it is in the high 3 star range so I go with an overall 3 star review.Way to go Rhythm Kitchen - keep up the good work.The service in this place is terrible. I walked in with my girlfriend for happy hour and waited for about 20 minutes without anyone even acknowledging our existence. To make matters worse a couple walked in and were greeted right away. I think this place attempts to be classy, and upscale, but falls incredibly short with their lack of quality service and poorly arranged menu. Proving that just because you're a rich investor, it doesn't mean that you can just throw money at something and succeed. Clean your act up. You're sloppy.From the ponds, marshes, wetlands, slow-moving rivers, lakes, bayous and swamps to Sin City...the alligator has arrived! Not too many places I know around here offer reptiles on their menu. Well, they do here at Rhythm Kitchen!Yesterday, I met a friend here for Happy Hour and it was a fantastic and unique culinary experience.  The Louisiana ambience, impeccable service, delicious foods, intoxicating drinks, and great conversation was an evening I will treasure until I get Alzheimer's.The elegant dining room is beautifully decorated and has an upscale feel. The bar/lounge has it's own private entrance, or you can do like I did, and use the main entrance and have the hostess lead you through the restaurant to the lounge.The bartenders were very friendly and personable, offering the stereotypical friendly southern hospitality. I enjoyed the Hurricane, which was strong tasting and intoxicating, fruity and delicious; all adjectives combined in one very large glass! (see photo below)We shared a dinner menu entree of catfish filets w/ red beans and rice. Also catfish bites, and blackened alligator. I've never had a catfish, except when I was about 10 years old pulling one off a fishing hook and its spine sliced my hand open. Well, time to move on from being 10 and give the ugly bottom feeder another try...surprisingly, it had a wonderful fishy taste!The alligator tasted kinda like chicken. Doesn't everything that is 'not the norm' taste like chicken? The red sauce added a nice enhancing kick to dip the alligator and savor the chew.I look forward to coming here again and trying their AYCE Specials of crab legs, ribs, more! Call and inquire what night is what special, as several nights per week they offer All-You-Can-Eat Specials!Also, I'm eager to try their steaks, French creole seafood, gumbo, jambalaya, and more of the catfish and alligator, washed down with a Hurricane. To Try: Go North on Decatur from the 215 South, look for the pretty 2 story New Orleans style architecture on your left/west side of the street, just past Sunset Rd. Plenty of convenient parking!"Yay! I'm a fan."YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #236

Review Text :
I've passed by Regio's plenty of times and I wish I had tried them sooner! Tucked right next to the 51 on Indian School, Regio's is far from an optimum location, but I can agree with most of the other reviews so far and say that the food is poppin'! I got a gordita plate from them on New Year's Day, and I was way surprised! It was delicious, and it helped settle my stomach after a night of properly ringing in 2011...I want to go back as I write this to try their sopes! If their carne asada and their al pastor gorditas are any indicator, I will sure be in for a delicious treat! If you live in Central Phoenix and fancy some good, cheap Mexican food from a local joint, get your buns over to Regio's. I personally think I found my new regular spot for some Mexican chow.

Review Text :
Over the river and through the woods.. lalalala, la, la.. Cave Creek, AZ is kind of a drive but I suppose no worse than driving to Gilbert from Scottsdale. Though this journey includes cactus, multi-million dollar mansions and the occasional coyote rather than tract homes and freeway. Once you get out there the entire area is sort of like old cowboy rustic charm. So doesn't it makes sense to open a BBQ joint way out in the middle of somewhere? The owners of Bryan's sure did!Only being open just over a month, Bryan's was hopping busy and there is a reason why.. the smell. You can just about taste the pecan smoke as you pass by or pull up. Its an enticing fragrance that grips, strokes and pulls you in to see what's about that hopefully delicious smokey goodness. Once inside you'll easily tell where you need to go.. it's all about counter service here. The menu is easy to navigate as its short and sweet. Its a greatest hits of BBQ and you'll be hard pressed just to order one thing. Go ahead, order as much as you like, loosen your pants and stay a while. Ordering for us was pretty easy though we did cross section the menu, pork ribs, pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, olive cole slaw, baked potato salad and cowboy beans. Get your drinks then grab a seat in the modern, cowboy space. They do serve beer as well as Coke products though I noticed something strange, most people were drinking water. Is that how they are dealing with the economy? Spend a little on food and cut a couple of bucks on the beverages? Good idea I suppose, coke is coke is coke, right? Water cleanses the palette and pairs with anything, sure Ill go with it! Okay, they called the Mr.'s name, my mouth is watering, my sauces are ready, good to go! First bite, the brisket, smokey, juicy and perfectly tender, the white bread under the brisket soaks up the meat juices, good idea, why didn't I think of that?! Next, ribs, oh no.. I can suck the meat right off the bone? Its not like I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose (well, Ive never tried)  it's just that the ribs are that tender! Dip in a bit of the spicy sauce, hellish good (I don't think they serve BBQ in heaven right? Smoke and flame thing, eh?)! Pulled pork sandwich, is melt on your tongue tender, I can see why so many older folks were ordering these sammies, no teeth required. Oddly the sides are in need of some tweaking. The baked potato salad was on the dry side but I have yet to have a baked potato salad that I like. Something about cold baked potatoes that don't do it for me. The cowboy beans had no real character and were only one flavor, a smokey sweetness that was good on the first bite but lacked depth. The olive cole slaw was different and while the Mr loved it, I'm just not a fan. However each plate was served with a bread and butter jalapeno, not only clever but addictivly delicious. Oh the desserts, simple and satisfying. Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich and a Sarsaparilla Float. We got the ice cream sammie which was 2 huge chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Nice crunch factor on the cookie with the cold smoothness of the ice cream, talk about a happy ending. On the way out the sun was setting the moon was rising and all seemed right in the world. Perhaps for the first time in ages, a calm swept over me and all I could smell was pecan smoke begging me to come back some time soon.  Oh yeah, me and my O-face!Good bye Bobby Q , So long Joe Johnston... I have found a new love...his name is Bryan.. and I love him.A few months back Alexander told me to check this place out .. and I thought oh sure it's probably good. Boy was I wrong it's not good , it's fantastic!   First, most BBQ joints that are any good are rinky dinky dives  that you try not to touch too many surfaces in ( you know its true!) But Bryan my new amore , is different his joint is well decorated, cute even , maybe whimsical. It has clean well lit, well thought out decorating,a large screen with old time westerns showing , nice touch,the place is clean  and in a tasteful strip mall. The food is ordered at the counter , we opted for ribs, shredded pork and brisket. The brisket was well cooked / smoked with meat falling apart as you cut into it.The sauce was tasty  but not over powering. No fake smoke taste or over top sugar taste here.  The ribs had a gorgeous pink smoke ring , lovely! Husband proclaimed the   shredded pork better than the ribs but he is wrong and not writing this review.  So there.   Now here is the extra special touch .. the sides were really delish  no empty fillers here .. the beans are obviously slow cooked with care and dare I say ...love?   I even tasted a hint of beer which I  love in beans , they also had a rich taste that made them crave-able. The coleslaw was  a surprise as well , not only a great balance of taste not too sweet not too vinegary  but low and behold olives were hidden in there as well like little treasures just waiting to be uncovered.  Will I  be back ...oh yes ..Bryan and I plan to see each other at least a couple times a month . I think it's time for him to meet my folks.... I am looking forward to our kinda like a date night .   Can't wait to try him out again!  I mean try the food again .. Whatever I love Bryan.Ever since El Paso closed down I have been looking for ribs I like as well.  I found them!  I was surprised the place was as quiet as it was early on a Saturday evening.  I was informed by my date that Cave Creek businesses suffer in the summer as many folks willing to drive that far out of Phoenix will drive the extra hour to Prescott and the cooler temps.I had the ribs and my date had the brisket and we both chose beans and cole slaw.  She really liked the brisket but I thought it was a bit dry and we both needed to use sauce on it.  We really loved the ribs and beans! The cole slaw seemed a bit flat in taste but I think it would have been hard to stand up against the bold flavors of the rest of the dinner, in any case it was certainly fresh and had no off flavors.Be careful of the iced tea machine.  The 3 labels are: unsweetened black, Sweet tea and Green tea.  We both made the assumption the green tea would be unsweetened only to find out it was very sweet.The counter service was pleasant.  The place was clean.  The only restrooms were in an outside walkway and served the entire building.  I was surprised they close at 8 on the weekends.  I would like to go back in cooler weather and set out on the patio.So, my friend and I decided to spend the day hanging out together on this side of town. We both needed to get out of the house, and go for a pretty drive.While we were driving down the Carefree Hwy, we swung by and hung a left on Cave Creek road because its been a while since we had been to this side of town.  While we were driving, we parked the car in town and found this place.  I spotted it from across the street, and we ran in to get some food.Place is cute, with a nice patio and plenty of seating inside as well. Mostly tables with some booths. It's a fast casual type place, so you go, place your order, and they call your name when the orders ready.The food itself was really good. I went with the brisket sandwich with fries and a drink. My friend went with the half chicken, baked potato salad (which had sour cream) and a drink. the potatos were awesome! I wish I had ordered it as my side instead!Brisket was soft and tasty, and my friend enjoyed his chicken a lot.  It didn't come with a ton of BBQ sauce on it (which is fine by me) and you can always add more from the BBQ sauce station that they have set up in the condiment area.  I really liked the condiment area because not only was it neat and clean, but it was well stocked. I also like that they have a decent selection of food to choose from as well.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. If your in the area, or want to try excellent BBQ, please, go eat here. Place is awesome! Patio is a great size as well.  Make the trip, you'll be really happy you did!

Review Text :
This is a dive in the very best sense of the word.  Guy Fieri needs to come here!  This fine establishment is located inside the Antiques Mall.  Walk in and go to your left.  My sense of direction is not so hot and I started out thinking this was somewhere near downtown Chandler but it's closer to Warner on Arizona Ave.  I finally made it and Rand H. and Robyn N. were patiently waiting for me and my daughter.  Randy, the proprietor of this fine establishment was sitting at the table and greeted us warmly.  It just so happend that Sonoran Living had been in to do a piece on Randy and we anxiously waited to see it.  As soon as the piece was over, the phone started ringing, no joke!  All three of the adults had the "3-Legged Chile N Cheese Hot Dog" and it was very filling and very good!!  My daughter had a Lil' Willy and scarfed it down in two minutes flat with a big thumbs up!  There were a couple of tables to sit and eat and Randy took our orders and we got our drinks and sat and chatted for a few minutes.  And if you are a Pittsburg fan, this is the place for you!  Randy is so warm and welcoming.  He is an excellent host and clearly loves what he does.  This is the kind of place that you want to come back to over and over again simply because the owner puts his best foot forward and does all he can for his patrons.  And when I went to pay the bill I even got a hug!  Now that is service!  My daughter's favorite food is a hot dog so we will be frequenting Pittsburgh Willy's.  I hope Randy doesn't get sick of us. :)What a fun place!  Fortunately I knew it was IN the Antiques Marketplace because I read all the reviews last night.  As soon as you walk into the Marketplace, you can smell the hot dogs cooking!  Walk towards the left, pass by aisles of "antiques", and once you see all the Pittsburgh sports stuff and a few tables, you've found Pittsburgh Willies.Rand and I had a seat while we were waiting for Lynn and Claire and met Randy the owner.  Very friendly and a gracious host.  Being from Chicago and growing up on Chicago style hot dogs, I was a little unsure about some of the weird combinations on the menu, so I played it safe and went with the 3 Legged Chili and Cheese - almost 1/2 lb of Big Willy sliced in 3 - over a split sesame bun and covered in chili with big pieces of beef and lots of cheese!  Yum!  The hot dog was good quality and the chili was better than I expected.  Had a side of potato salad that was pretty good also.  They have a refrigerator case for your drinks, cans of soda are only $1.  They also had glass bottles of Coke and Pepsi.On Wed they have homemade potato and cheese pierogis and Randy said to call ahead if you're not coming until the evening because they almost always run out before they close at 7pm.  Take a stroll through the Antiques Marketplace after lunch.  They said it's the largest one in Arizona!

Review Text :
Finally made it here with a group of friends in an attempt to order one of everything off of the menu. While we didn't accomplish this mission we had sure had a lot of fun working on it.I have to say that someone in the back is extremely heavy handed with the salt! I mean seriously, every app we order, Seasonal Vegetable, Mozz Salad, Fritto Misto and even the mixed lettuces, salty. You know I'm a fan of good seasoning but came on. I of course told our server who actually tasted the fried broccolini and agreed 100%, salty. No offer of taking them off the bill, remaking them or anything like that.. what it did seem clear is that the staff is afraid of the chef. Our server didn't even want to mention it it him till later, if something is broke, fix it! I will say though that if the apps weren't salty they prolly would have been outstanding, the initial flavors before the extreme saltiness hit you were very good. Also I have to bring up another point, why not serve bread? Charge me for it, whatever.. those shitty prepackaged bread sticks don't cut it at all! Apparently the chef feels that bread, and dessert for that matter, shouldn't be served at the PastaBar that the focus should be pasta, if that's the case then ditch the salty apps. Ya know if logic dictates then then make it consistent, ya know?Okay, onto what was really fun and yummy, the pasta and the sides. The pasta here is out of this world delicious! We ordered the Gnocchi, Chitarra Alla Amatriciana, Orecchiette and the Chitarra alla Carbonara. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented, each and everyone! The winner at the table was the ricotta Gnocchi! Each pillow bite was better than the last! The ragu was deliciously thick but lacked one thing, bread! All the sauce on the bottom of each pasta bowl was wasted since there was no bread to sop it all up. Damn that pisses me off to no end. Why make this outstanding pastas and sauces then waste it with no way to sop it up.. *sigh* The side of Pork Shoulder was phenomenal! Tender and juicy this was almost like a confit of pork with a nice puddle of liquid fat on the bottom of the plate, was a shame to let the plate leave with all the goodness sitting there.. I swear,  it cried out when the server took my plate. Haunting.Alright, I wont mentioned the lack of bread again but come on! LOL! There, over it.. next time I'm sneaking some in under my shirt! Ill charge the other diners 5 bucks for my bread service, it'll be fun! Who knew that bread could be considered contraband!I'll start by yelling, MORE PASTA PLEASE!... and that's a good thing because the dish I had was insanely delicious. I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara with Guanciale. Man-o- man was it good. Thanks to Kevin H for my new found addiction; Guanciale! You Rule!  Now back to the review...If I were rating my entire experience on the pasta alone, you would see 5 stars. However, in order to get there I feel a few tweaks are needed to land on perfection. First, the local greens salad I had was way overly salted and a bit meager in my opinion. A little less on the salt and throw in a few shavings of Parmigiano and you got a winner. Second, I feel the pricing structure is little steep for the lunch crowd and may be the reason why my co-worker and I were the only ones in the place during the 11am lunch hour on a Tuesday. Consider a price adjustment to attract the lunch crowd and you're sure to draw them in.  My bill with tip was $24.66 for the salad, tea, and pasta. Lastly, and I second Alexander's plea. Where's the freaking bread!  I could not believe I had to give up my bowl with a pool of deliciousness still left at the bottom. The drippings alone could feed a family of three. It was criminal. I mentioned my disappointment to our server who kindly said there were no plans to serve bread with pasta dishes, the cracker sticks is all they were serving. Ditch the cracker sticks man and get with the program. I begged with him to make it happen and was a bit dramatic while conveying this request.  He must have got the message because 10 min later he came back to our table saying that the kitchen staff was working on a plan to serve bread with the pasta dishes. I promised a return visit to validate the change and I look forward to reporting back.  Wishin' and Hopin' and Thinkin' and Prayin' la,la, la, la~Let me make this clear that I am aware the owners are going to read this and they know who I am and what I do. I am in no way going to let this fact influence my review. I came in for lunch with my dad and unfortunately for the restaurant, we were the only ones in it. Almost for the better, as dad had a lot of questions about where the ingredients came from and we had the full attention of Nick and the bartender. The space is clean, and has some local art on most of the walls. One wall though, needs to be decorated... it's very empty. The restrooms are outside the restaurant, which is only a minor inconvience.I ordered the gnocchi and it was good, but I have been very much spoiled by Marcellino's gnocchi, so I didn't truly think it was phenomonal. The portions at this restaurant are also crazy small. I honestly don't think I've had such a small meal at a restaurant as long as I can remember. I understand about ingredient prices, profit margins, etc. But I'd rather the prices be a couple dollars higher and get a larger meal. The overall experience was very positive, but I'd not be yearning to go back immediately. I'll save it for a somewhat special occasion. I think everyone would be happy to at least try it once though.When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.Thanks Denny's for saving my night.What a let down this place was.2.5 stars I have visited PastaBar twice now. Both times I have been left with the "Eh.. it's ok" opinion about it. The first visit was during their opening week, I believe. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I noticed the very stark decor and the nice big mirror they had to make the room look huge. We were seated in a corner booth that is not very comfortable for two people that want to sit next to each other, not across from each other (just a note). We took the time to look over a simple menu. They had just obtained their liquor license and our waiter was stumbling on the wine selection. While I understand that the liquor license is new, your knowledge of wine should not be. For such a nice place, the servers should have a slight knowledge of wine and be able to advise on them. When it came time to ordering our meal, our waiter was nice enough to advise us to order a side to split with our pasta if we were hungry. Good to know! On my first trip, I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara. I enjoyed the dish, except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it, personal taste is one thing, but when you're chewing into black pepper...woah. I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce. The pasta was very good, I like my pastas al dente and this pasta met my expectation. My date ordered the gnocchi. It was again just ok. On the side my date and I split the meatballs. I thought they were ok. The sauce wasn't your run of the mill spaghetti sauce. It had a smoky, almost barbecued flavor to it. It was good, but again a little crazy with the black pepper. At the end of that trip I was left with a "yeah....uh...I think it was good" and vowed to come back to render my final decision. The second trip sealed the coffin for me. We were greeted and seated immediately, once again. I took the time to really check out the place. Oh! They put new artwork up....um... I will refer to the art as "Signs of the Apocalypse". Timothy McVeigh? Really? I found it tasteless, but to each his own. Knocked the restaurant down a notch for me, personally. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozz, Marinara "crudo" to start. Our waitress left us to take our time looking at the menu. I decided on Orecchiette with homemade sausage and greens. My friend and I shared the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder. We noted that our appetizer was taking forever and when I spotted the waitress to ask her about it, she was delivering our dinner.... HUGE pet peeve. I gently said "You delivered our entrees before our appetizer." She stood looking astonished and said "OH! Yes I did!" and continued to stand as if she was lost. Well after we told her we still wanted the appetizer, she came back MUCH later with the incorrect appetizer, and offered to leave it and not charge us for it. NO. Wrong. If the customer ordered an appetizer, they wanted that one for a reason. Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience, but that's not it folks! Rewind to our meals. My pasta was lukewarm at best. It was like I rewarmed leftover pasta and didn't warm it all the way and decided to eat it out of a Tupperware bowl. This was definitely not the marking of a 17 dollar bowl of pasta. By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish, it was cold. At this point, I was so irritated, I truly didn't care. I know we're not in Scottsdale, but does that mean we need to sacrifice quality and service due to a different zip code? I know we're in America, but do we need to offend patrons with artwork of mass murderers while they're trying to eat? Again, to each his/her own, but I doubt I will visit PastaBar again. I'm sure it will thrive without a few people with discerning taste. It's not a place I will crave, it's not a place that I would jump to visit again.I'd give this place 3.5 stars... after reading the other reviews I expected a half of a cup of pasta or something ridiculous but I thought the portion was adequate. And, I was REALLY hungry when I got there. We ordered the olives as a starter (they are all green and served warm) and were able to get some bread to accompany the reserve oil. Our server voluntarily explained menu items with important details like: it's ricotta gnocchi, not potato and the extra items in the puntanesca sauce (my recipe only has 7). We both had the orecchiette with sausage and greens. I found it to be a bit oily but the pasta was cooked well. He described the deserts perfectly and the chocolate bark with almonds was a nice finish with a second glass of nero d'avalo, and, by the way... I though the wine prices were very reasonable! Without tip, we spent about $36 a person and we each had two glasses of wine and left satisfied!Overhyped!!Yeah,  the Chef and manager are from Scottsdale...so what?Yeah,  the pasta are all homemade....so what?If it ain't good...it just ain't good... even if you used fresh hard to find ingredients, if the execution is not there..the dish is...so what?Harsh I know, but my one pet peeve is when non-locals come to Downtown claiming to make a change in Downtown..and this is what we get?!?After talking to the head chef (it was a sat night  and there was 1 table at 9pm)  I find his claims in changing the downtown late dining scene to be obsurd..hello have you heard of Carly's, Fate, Sens....Anyways, about the food....I ordered the gnocchi with sausage...it was ok , I have had better....the only thing is..I could not find any sausage!  The portions were a bit small for the price.The pork shoulder was the other item I ordered that night...it was tender but too salty!  Not my thing...I ordered coffee which they said they could make, only to come back to me and say that they do not have any coffee cups!  what? :)My friend and I shared those two items, with 1 drink and tip, it came out to $40 bucks...kinda high when you consider the portions and quality..I dont mind paying that kind of price if the food was good....IF it was good.....The call came at 11:30 AM..."We're here at Park Central waiting for you to go to lunch downtown"." I said, lunch is tomorrow not today, but I said, OK, bee there in 10 minutes". Friend says's he heard that Pasta Bar was good so let's try that. I said, yeah, there are 3 restaurants there, a Irish Pub (Turf) a Thai restaurant (Sens) and Pasta Bar. I said "Larry likes Thai"...Phil said, "Phil likes Italian" and that was the fateful decision.I knew I was in trouble when we entered the restaurant and first, there was not a "sense of entry" nor anyone to greet us other than the strong smell of newly painted walls. Bartender said "sit where you like". Two of us had the lunch special (about $12) and friend who suggested Pasta Bar ordered from the menu. His pasta was $15. Lunch special came with a drink. I will say, the pasta was very tasty, the salad had very good thought and fresh locally grown produce. Salad and pasta lunch special was served on the same plate which to  me was unappetizing. Lunch came with a very thin slice of bread. Bread was excellent but no butter. Server/bartender was made aware and out came a the smallest portion of butter I have ever been served and to be shared with all three of us. There was enough to cover half a Triscut wafer! Pasta was fresh, but without any meat. The atmosphere is dark and we were told that it was to be an Italian diner. What added to the dark side was the art work. Andy Warhol images of Jim Jones, Rasputin, Christopher McVey and other icons of evil. The headache lingered on all day after I paid the bill for $52 for lunch. Hope they improve the portions, the service and the look. I would be hard pressed to come back.After reading about PastaBAR on yelp- I had to go see for myself what the heck is going on here!Walked in--- liked the seating situation and the ambiance.  Had the nicest server ever, his name was Nick.  He talked about the menu and answered our questions.  Brought some really great tea and tangy lemonade.  We ordered the fried mozzarella, they make the cheese there-- it was so good.  But not as good as my entree!  I ordered pappardelle and it was possibly the best pasta I have had at a restaurant ever.  It tasted just like my Nonna's homemade pasta, the perfect texture, cooked the real Italian al dente way and I was in heaven.  It was the special and it sure was special.  The portions were good too.  After reading everyone's reviews about portions, I was scared I was going to have to pick a sandwich up afterwards, but no-sir-ee.  I was happily full and planning my next trip!!!Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after 4 visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  3. Love dwntwn Phx.So what could go wrong? Service: No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the "signature cocktails" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily "Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now." Yikes.Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.Vibe:The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)The Cocktails:They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. The Food:Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, "gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water." The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? Sadly, no.At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)I don't quite get PastaBAR.This place is 1000% right in my wheelhouse. Passionate about one thing. Focus on getting that completely right. Focus on quality ingredients. I'd heard positive recommendations by many friends and colleagues I respect. I was expecting to love it. How could I not?I don't know. Maybe my expectations were way out of whack. They had been knocked down a bit that same night by 3 or 4 friends that had been there.  I was in the area and itching to go even though I'd heard multiple comments that it was kind of meh.Well, we ended up going later in the night.First of all, I get the space. It's cool. Has character. No problems there.  Service was great as well. No issues at all.No problem with the pricing or portions. In fact I thought it was quite reasonable.I first tried the buffalo mozzarella, basil pesto, heirloom tomatoes. It was nice. I dug it. Would have happily eaten more. No fireworks though. And maybe I'm unfair for expecting them.Then I tried the two entrees I most wanted. Both had gotten rave reviews in a recent article.  I ordered the chitarra alla carbonara (guanciale/bacon, farm egg, local onion, pecorino) and I tried the orecchiette con salsiccia (home-made sausage, greens, pecorino).Now over the past couple of years I've really developed an appreciation for people doing simple or standard things really, really well. That was what I was expecting here. The food was definitely good but with all the pub that it's gotten, it definitely didn't knock me off my chair.  And the thing is that I've recently been repeatedly knocked off my chair by other spots doing standard, simple homemade pastas with killer, killer ingredients. Have been hit totally out of left field and couldn't believe how amazing a pappardelle with homemade sausage was. Or a linguine with clams.I'm guessing that maybe my expectations were out of whack but I left appreciating the meal but saddened that I felt no hurry to rush back.BORING, FLAVORLESS, OVERPRICED CRAP; exposed-filament bulbs, paper napkins, sans s/p shakers. Kale- and collard-earthy and squishy garnishes little better than pig fodder.--sealed brown concrete, minimalist 5x7 postage-stamp art in monochromatic, rhythmically-spaced repetition--exposed-filament bulbs throughout give that yellowish glow evocative of kidnap cinema;--gangsta buser keeps glaring at us, slamming our glasses down after refilling them; oh, maybe we won't get out of here alive!--going to charge me $17 for pasta? buy some GODDAM cloth napkins!--"table bread" is a plastic package of stale, pencil-thick breadsticks. what would you think if someone brought you two packs of saltines? Yeah, that's what I mean!--ambient music an unpleasant mix of rural-southern Creole woo-woo ritual chant, washboard-and-spoon percussion and harmonica (I think they recruited that woman from the GTA3 shanty town);--outside, the manager is explaining to the police amidst an army of tow trucks that these cars really are valet-professionally parked, not by their owners.--heirloom tomato side dish was the one delicious thing. At $3, the best value on the menu (+1 star)...--unfortunately the spices were so old there was no flavor left in them.--no s/p shakers; on request we received two contact-lens cups of s/p for pinching, chef style (i.e. no spoons).On our way out, some employee was being disciplined on the back steps, presumably about to quit.I've never been so glad to quit a place as this.Worst Pasta I have ever eaten. I'm not even kidding. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozzarella, Pork Shoulder & Calamari to start .. all of it aside from the Pork was blah and unimpressive, the Pork was tasty, but the flavor was REALLY strong and I couldn't eat much of it before wanting to vomit.For our entrees we got the Orecchiette alla Puttanesca($15)... which apparently has 12 random ingredients from some streetwalkers pantry and last time I checked, a streetwalker is a hooker, so, I mean, if you're cool with eating shit from a hookers pantry, order this, its not good. We also got the Fettuccini Tagliatta($19)... rib-eye was a little tough, noodles tasted funky and me and my palate were overall just very disinterested in eating more than 2 bites. Also, id like to add that both entrees were not hot, like they had been sitting there for a while. This irritates me to no end.Not only was the meal sub-par, but its was freakin' expensive! Honestly id rather bust open a package of Safeway brand angel hair and Prego from a can - it tastes better anyway.Sorry PastaBar, never again.

Review Text :
Dear Brio,After giving you such rave reviews back in 2009, you have kindly let me down in the most unexpected way. See I do understand that you do not take reservations for happy hour, and I totally respect that. However the fact that I came to give you a courtesy head's up that I was bringing around 40+ people over the three hour time spam for my birthday happy hour a week in advance and you kindly but adamantly let me know that you could not accommodate me left me speechless. Your friendly manager kindly explained that he did not want a "rowdy" group and that he wanted to keep everything orderly.  He let me know that no I could not hold two tables once I arrived and that my party would be seated separately as they came in to keep everything orderly. So no standing around and being unorderly, et al. Again the look on my face was priceless. Last I check I was almost 40 and my friends don't get "rowdy" but ok whatever. However I still had a friendly smile and thanked your manager for letting me know that in so many words he did not want my business and that I needed to find a new venue.Yea hmm wow. No worries. I found another place that welcomed me with open arms for my birthday happy hour and they don't mind if we stand around and get a little "rowdy".  Love,EbsI've driven by Brio many of times and never really had any desire to visit this place. My family talked me into it the other night. So it was game on for this place. Walking into Brio I was a little surprised. It seemed like a more upscale Macaroni Grille. They use butcher paper for their table tops but fancier than MG. They have high ceilings and somewhat reminded me of some of the Las Vegas places with high ceiling and huge lights. Very nice decor. We started off with their bread basket of hot sour dough and flat bread. Really good. Down right outstanding. So if this was good I can't wait for our meals so come. I ordered the Sausage Peperonata Pomodoro. Very nice dish. Nice amount of sausage that had a little kick with tender pasta, cherry tomatoes, and Broccoli. The cream sauce was really good. It was really tasty and I really enjoyed it. I would say the star of our dinner was my wife's Balsamic Strawberry Chicken Salad. Wow. Outstanding. My wife was raving about it and everyone tried it. Both of my kids said that next time they are going to order this salad. It was the BOMB. I don't remember what was in it but it was booming with flavor. My daughter really liked her Chicken Pomodoro Classico with the red sauce. Looked really good and she just gobbled it up. My so ordered the Raviloi Di Bello and it had mushrooms and tomatoes. I tried this and the Raviloi was so fresh with cheese in the middle. It was very good and filling. We had a really good meal and everyone enjoyed their dinner. Our server was Dane S. She was really good. She welcomed us very quickly at our table and brought us our water cups. She was always paying attention to us. She did a great job but she was all business. She didn't show no personality but that's okay. So let's see. Nice decor, high ceilings which makes the place a little loud (that's okay), very good food, and excellent service. What more can you ask for.  So I enjoyed a great meal and will definitely be back. Enjoy.

Review Text :
We had the most amazing breakfast buffet here while staying at the Camelback Inn. The restaurant is very beautiful, interesting glass fixture hanging thru out, rich dark woods, nice views of the patio. The buffet include omelets, the best hash brown potatoes in the world. Other food choices include juevos rancheros, fresh pastries, breads, bagels, muffins, bacon, sausage, cured meats, yogurts, fresh fruits, granola, cereal, etc. Service here is also amazing. I highly recommend Rita's for breakfast.2/23/10Sat at the patio to admire the colorful and lush surroundings, but at the expense of sitting on very damp cushions, which I didn't even notice until I had risen to go the restroom to wash my hands before having a bite to eat.  (Another man sitting at the next table eventually stood up to look for drier cushions, as well.)  Service was very friendly- that is, up until I paid, but more about this later.  Ordered the weekly drink special- the rose margarita.  Delicious!  Pretty, too.  For apps, I tried the Cilantro hummus ($2) and the Grilled steak skewers ($5).  Loved the hummus and pita, and the pita also paired well w/ the spicy cheese sauce that came w/ the steak skewers.  As for the skewers themselves... these were processed meat pieces, not from fresh steaks.  I did not appreciate the texture.  (I'm very interested to read about others' opinions on this dish.)  To think I received more satisfaction from a $2 dish and a cheese sauce!  At least the margarita was very good...As I've said, the service was very friendly, and patient, answering all of my allergy concerns.  I had a very hard time securing a working outlet for my laptop, though, w/ my server and the assistant manager saying that the outlet that I found was "out-of-service."  Yet, a third server/runner enthusiastically offered to get maintenance to have a look at the outlet, only to be intercepted by the asst. mgr., and suddenly, I was out of luck again.  Apparently, the asst. manager didn't want me to have use of my laptop while sitting outside.  Too bad, bec. I would've ordered another drink AND a dessert had I been able to stay much longer, but my dying battery had me packing and looking for an outlet to use elsewhere.  (Also, when it looked like I wasn't going to have access to an outlet, and after repeated visits from the server regarding dessert, I decided to ask for my receipt.  It took quite awhile to get the table ticket.  It seemed like when she knew I wasn't planning on ordering anything more, the friendly service disappeared.  Where once I had two or more reps coming over asking if I needed their assistance, I now couldn't even flag down one for a glass of water!)I'd like to come back to surround myself again in such sensuous and verdant environs; I just will be sure not to visit right after it rains.  I may even just skip R-Bar and try Rita's Kitchen or BLT Steak's happy hour menus, instead.  Perhaps it's best not to return at all?  I wouldn't want to trouble the Camelback Inn staff to wait on a troublesome customer such as myself...as the holidays fade into the calendar behind me i reflect back on the month of december and i realize i spent the entire past month attending an ocean of parties, drinking a river of christmas cocktails, and wading through a forest of friends at random gatherings in a haze of booze and mistletoe.it was festive, it was fun... and it was exhausting. as i scroll back through the rolodex of 2010 holiday memories, the R Bar most certainly stands out as one of my top 5 favorite evenings.our very big group of holiday revelers was initially seated indoors as we waited for a circle of chairs surrounding a fire pit to free up. right after we ordered our first round, the sweetheart of a hostess ran over to let us know the party sitting there had just closed their tab and we could pounce on the coveted area. once our group was seated outdoors in over sized lounge chairs beneath twinkle lights by a crackling fire, i took note of the rest of our surroundings.... stunning! a striking desert rock formation as a backdrop, waterfalls roaring, a moat trickling through, live music filled the air, laughter, conversation, clinking glasses.i don't know if it was the group i was there with, the energy of the crowd, or that everyone seems to be in an especially happy mood during the holidays, but the air had an electricity to it that night.... i settled back into the cushions, poured myself deep into a cocktail and let me date hold my hand.  we ended up staying until closing time and then finally moved onto a new venue.alas, R Bar is the kind of place you don't remember much about the service because it was so flawlessly executed... you don't remember the name of your drink, only that it tasted divine and you barely remember the conversations you had, only that you laughed the entire time.however, you DO remember you hated leaving and couldn't wait to come back.PS: ok, i lied. i did remember ordering the rose margarita a few times and yummmm.Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. Breakfast: Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. Lunch:Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.The R Bar has great specials on food and drinks during happy hour from 3:00-6:00, daily, which you can enjoy sitting up high on bar stools or sinking into a comfy low couch.Thursday, my roommate and I enjoyed fish tacos, pan seared, NOT breaded and fried.  Two regular size tacos come folded in soft corn tortillas with crisp cabbage and veggies displayed in an ingenious zig-zag shaped metal holder with a side of salsa for $7.00. (I think they are $15 normally.  I had a glass of merlot off the happy hour menu and it wasn't bad.Friday, my roommate ordered the chicken tacos and I ordered the lettuce wrap chicken fajitas.  The lettuce shell (several layers thick) was piled so high with yummy chicken and peppers that I had to eat a good bit of it before there was any hope of getting the lettuce to wrap around anything.  They should have called it the lettuce spilling out everywhere fajitas.  They arrived with sides of salsa and sour cream.Saturday, we missed happy hour by a few minutes and ended up splitting a quesadilla that was very tasty.  I ordered a Kiltlifter from local Tempe, AZ brewery Four Peaks which I enjoyed immensely.  There was live music to help me get over my sadness at missing happy hour.On Sunday, I rad the lettuce wrap fajitas again - they were just too good to keep switching, and another Kiltlifter.  My boss ordered the sliders and seemed to enjoy them.  They have live music nightly starting at 6:00 pm.

Review Text :
In this day and age of many pizza concepts around the valley sometimes it's tough to figure out which one you actually want to visit. For me it really has to be a complete package for me to sit down and spend my hard earned money. In my years of package peeking I think I've become quite the expert and can quickly sum up if it's worth exploring or not.One part of this package is coifed, bobbed, styled and blown; Salon de Venus was making women beautiful for 58 years in the same location on Camelback and 19th Street.  The star shaped bricks along Camelback are unmistakably Phoenix and remind me of being a wee package peeker growing up in the valley. The new owners Dan and son Aric Mei deserve so much credit for preserving the wall and repurposing many of the items used in the old salon space. Every time we turn around there is something being ripped and bulldozed over to make way for the new with no respect to the old, hats off to them for their thoughtful redesign. What has been done to the new space is simply amazing. The sheer volume and proportion of the main dining room while open, has a sense of coziness and interest with the use of wood and other recycled materials. You can tell that the building is special and well thought out with so many details you can discover something different on each visit. Since the space is so well designed and inspired, what about the menu? Created by two local chefs, Jared Porter and Jerry Alday, the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients. There is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance. They have many of their own herbs, vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes. I even noticed several eggplants growing which I hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit. While the menu is pizza centric, there is also a varietal of sandwiches, salads and pasta. For the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from. Aside from Mac and Cheese, this part also includes a B.L.T. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie, how cool is that?Looking at a great package I like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package, in this case the balls. Arancini ($8) which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto, deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. These are some of the tastiest balls I've had in ages and are a must when ordering. Having a similar impact is the Cauliflower Gratinata ($7) that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted. Basically a cauliflower au gratin, it's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread. For something a little bit different, the Eggplant Cannelloni ($8) uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta. The slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of Parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes. On the lighter side, salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite. On one visit Parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage, Queen Creek Olives, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette ($9.50). In a similar preparation, the on menu Parlor Insalata ($6.50) showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad. While the heat coming from the wood-burning oven couldn't be felt, you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package.  Coming in at 8" and 12" sizes, you can have it a few different ways, your way or the chef's way. Though why limit yourself to just 8" when you can have 12", right? The 12" is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin. The wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection, Parlor has some seriously great crust! Yukon Gold Potato ($10/$14) is so simply built its near perfect. Roasted potato, gorgonzola cheese, leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself. Desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying. Seasonal Fruit Skillet ($7.50) was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make. Made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right, was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Taking my time with each bite, savoring the quality and preparation, it's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable. So when you get a chance go ahead, take a peek at that package, you'll never know what you might find unless you look.I wanted to do my own thing and only give this place four stars, but I realized I have no justification for doing so.  I loved every bite of my meal, the service was fine, and the ambiance was killer.  I'd describe the space as very open and very welcoming, but in a modern/mid-century modern wrapper.  The pricing is fair, the beer selection good.  Fresh herbs growing out front is a nice touch.  I like it a lot, and expect to be back soon.Oh hell yes!Now this is what I'm talking about baby! Freshly prepared pastas, delicious inventive salads, and fancy pizza I actually like?? I must be dreaming as this simply cannot be Phoenix.In the business of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of fancy pizza. I prefer crispy, thin crust, NJ style pizza. For The Parlor however, I make an exception. The dough is just a touch fluffy but fantastic. Each pie is cooked to a perfect crisp in their wood burning oven. Their ingredients are top notch, many of which they actually grow themselves.I've been to The Parlor probably 4 or 5 times at this point, and I have yet to eat/drink anything that wasn't mouth-watering. Yes, the pizza and salads are great, but the pasta, holy crap THE PASTA!!! Being a young girl growing up in North Jersey, pasta (spaghetti bolognese in particular) has always been my comfort food. To the point that it's the only thing I ever bothered to learn how to cook, and I hate to cook.But after sub-par Italian restaurant after sub-par Italian restaurant in Phoenix, I found myself cooking far more than I like. I am thrilled to say that I am have to cook no more! Because The Parlor makes one hell of a delicious bowl of Pappardelle Bolognese. The pasta is the perfect texture, practically melts in your mouth. The bolognese sauce is thick and meaty as it should be. Literally, heaven.I always order the small size, for the reasonable price of $10, and have never once finished it. I feel like the large size may feed me for a week.Another great thing about The Parlor is their beer and wine list. Extensive and cheap!!! And by cheap I don't mean 2 buck chuck, but I mean they don't mark up their bottles nearly as much as many of the other local establishments that I frequent, and this recession-living girl appreciates that. Huge list of beers on tap, and they serve them in pitchers. Something about a nice restaurant willing to serve me my beer in a pitcher that warms my heart, can't explain it, it just does.I think it's fairly obvious that I am turning into a regular at The Parlor and am actually pleased about it, and if you're ever in the hood, you should be too."All we need is because, come and party with us "just had a belated birthday dinner party with what i consider my family. figured parlor was the spot to try, yes there are other places i want to try. but this jumped my bookmarks. rolled in bout 6:30 parking was scarce. wait was 45 mins. the waiting patio is cute. herb garden, outside fireplace *off* and the most awesome door i have seen on an eating establishment yet. wood. yup i got hard. 45 minutes later seated. party of 4 nice table sans-booth on this roll up. hostess was nice, introduced herself and asked if it was our first time. i blushed..how did she know i was virgin...bitch. why you gotta call a man out like that? oh well. waitress was nice, did a good job,..could be better..yea. but could have been way way way way worse. i aint gonna rip on someone doing their job unless they just miscarried in my food. that i cannot put up with. that thankfully didn't happen here so i got no beef. i did get some pork. yup sapriccio pizza, (sausage and yum moo!zarella) on a 8". also grubbed on the pesto on a eight inch platter, on deck was the pepperoni. all 3 pizzas was spectacular. gooey ooey and crisp, center of the bottom crust was firm and crisp, unlike bianco and metro which can have some cooking codensation. none here. just pure crisp, like a kit kat. ya know. 7 buck pitchers of PBR. the beer selection was really good. but i was bout the ribbon tonight. grabbed some bruchetta.. some coal charred bits of awesome covered in some sweet and savory toppins. pine nuts, red sweet peppers, some great spreaded cheese topping to hold in all on board. made a great start. pizza was bomb. i'm talking manhatten project bomb. i was blown away like a 1940's japanese soldier. flavors are well put together for signature pizzas. plus you can build you own.. gonna be here a lot more. price isn't bad. actually affordable. i really wanted to snatch a menu because they do not have one posted on the website. worth a trip. hell well worth the 45 minutes wait. i saw plenty of daters coming in and then walking away. come on clown. it's only time. any ways...i think it's a great addition to the cenpho area. viva non-chain revolucion ya heard!Totally MM (Marriage Material).I LOVE this place.-Easy parking and access-Separate dining and bar area-Shaded patio seating-Fresh ingredients-Approved portion sizes by yours truly-Good service-Good coffee and they offer french press (totally MM without the prenup)I hereby nominate the Parlor's basil vodka gimlet as best cocktail in the Valley!The pizza's good. The pastas are house-made - and well, I might add. Great sauces. I love the salon chairs at the bar - a nod to the building's previous incarnation.But that drink. I'm tellin' ya: Best. Of. Phoenix.I am giving 4 stars but will say it is 4.132548. I liked everything but the service. Granted they were a little busy but the server seemed to care less. He was there to answer questions, know his stuff but the actual service was a bit lacking. He actually told me "I forgot about you" LOLWe split a:Parlor saladPesto pasta with chicken (small) served with breadSmokey Pizza (Small)Everything was really good. The salad was fresh and had a great mixture of veggies. We loved the crispy chickpeas. The pasta was very good, great flavor, plenty of pesto, a little light on the chicken and portion but it was a small size. We quickly went through the one piece of bread, and used the crust of the pizza to soak the rest of the pesto up. The pizza was excellent, great combo of flavors and the crust was spot on. (on par with Pizza A Metro)As I said the only downfall was the service.I love this restaurant!  Just had dinner last night.  The pizza was outstanding.  You can pick your own ingredients and I picked Gorgonzola cheese, roasted chicken, spinach.  It was outstanding.  The staff was very efficient and had my meal in what seemed like minutes. Since I wanted dessert, I shared my pizza with my friend and will have the saved pieces for lunch. For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu which was also outstanding. Will definitely visit this place again. The atmosphere is very nice, muted colors.  Great for a date or after work.too bad, but you knew it would happenthe douche bags would find this place outand now, the hoards and the massesof DB's are roaming aboutthis groovy, mid-century modernthat tosses a pretty good piebut sadly the ol' DB factorhas ruined the place, for this guyit's no fault of the ownersthey did their very bestbut now the dicks and bonershave descended from the East and the Westside, in their True Religionsto prey on the Cougars, et alwho also have seeked out the parlorthe kitty's have started to crawlaround, looking for actionmade up, for making outand you know the rules of attractionwill keep the C's and DB's, turning out.I'll miss you, Parlor Pizzaenjoyed our little affair,but I'm off, seeking douche-free pasturesman!! ....I used to love it there.....I'm going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. I've been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options.The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.Audrey & I met Kevin & Marian at The Parlor for dinner.  Since they don't take reservations we waited about half an hour in the bar.  The bar area is nice and the service was good.  It was very crowded and noisy.  The Parlor has a nice selection on tap including a couple of my favorites, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  Between the outdoor seating area, the bar and the open yet warm restaurant I had a sense that this was a place the cool kids would hang out.  This was confirmed when I remembered that Kevin & Marian were there with us.  Further confirmation of the cool kid factor was provided when Ayesha and Amber were discovered at the bar a bit later.  We shared a couple orders of the Arancini appetizer which was excellent in flavor and textural complexity with a delicious sauce.  When our server commented that he didn't think anyone else in the valley offered these I had to think back to the last time I had them.  It was on Long Island at a family Italian place called Blue Moon in Rockville Centre.  Kudos to The Parlor.I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza.  Between the blending of sweet and savory flavors, the tender pulled chicken, the roasted serrano chili's...this is good stuff.  It doesn't hurt a bit that it is made on a wood fired crust that has a great firmness and consistency.  Sitting here writing about it...I may have to go get the leftovers for breakfast.  brb....I'm back.  Even cold that was awesome pizza.  Note to self:  hot coffee does not cool the burning much when you get several slices of serrano together....I also sampled Kevin's pizza and Audrey's burger.  Both excellent.  The parmesan fries were dare I say it...better than the fries at FEZ.  The service was top notch throughout the meal.  We finished by sharing a slice of tiramisu.  Made with mascarpone cheese as it should be, nice flavors of rum, coffee, etc coming through.  I also had a coffee.  Single serving (probably about 16oz) french press.  Again, excellent.  So there it is...5 stars.  I started out at 4 stars because...maybe I'm a little stingy with my 5 stars.  But what could I knock off a star for?  Umm...honestly I can't really think of anything that stood out wrong.  The Parlor has a fairly simple and straightforward menu which...at least on this Saturday night...they executed flawlessly.I think I just had the best roasted beet salad of my life ... and who'da thought a pizza parlor, ahem, The Parlor, would have blown me away after a so-called fabulous dinner at a fancy new American restaurant in Houston during Yelp Eats? The Parlor, beet salads across America should bow down to thee. In town for a Yelp Elite Event, the awesome Gabi K suggested this somewhat new (three months old) pizza place that's garnered such raving reviews on Yelp. Since we're both "dieting," she noted that they have a great selection of salads. I'm in!The Parlor is a beauty and architecture and design fans will admire the simple clean lines, woodwork, and natural but modern essence of this former beauty "parlor" which it still holds true to if you look closely. A lot of the wood (bar and tables) and other pieces were reused from the former beauty salon and reworked into The Parlor. Way to stay Green! This bit of info was given to us by bartender Chris, and yes, Amber W is right. What a cutie. But more importantly, attentive and friendly.When you walk in, you can choose to go left and sit at a dining table, or go right into the bar area, grab a seat there or at one of the high boys (which seats six). The bar area is where all the magic happened for us on this glorious day...No one should miss out on the cauliflower appetizer. Forgive me if I get the details wrong, but all I can remember is a steaming hot plate of the healthy vegetable covered and swimming in an Alfredo-like, creamy cheese sauce and sprinkled with more cheese (Parmesan?) and baked to a slight crunch. It's served with toasted focaccia. Yumz. And the roast beet salad ($9.50) that is *this* close to moving me over to the 602? Think large quarter cuts of orange heirloom beets (which I've never seen before), fennel, avocado chunks, onions and walnut-crusted goat cheese--a generous portion of goat cheese I must add. For $4 more, add the roasted chicken for a protein boost.And The Parlor is more than just pizza, salads, sandwiches and friggin' good apps. I was also happy to find a cheese and meat menu. With a bottle of red, this would be a perfect date! (And in cooler weather, you can sit out on the patio and snuggle up to the fire pit with your sweetie. Til then, stay inside!)Looks like the lovely Farrah A beat me to the punch and yelped about our luscious lunch today before me... I'll just add my two cents here, so make sure you read (and UFC) Farrah's review too if you haven't already!Upon picking Farrah up from the airport today, I wanted to take her to lunch.  Instead of the usual LGO stop, I decided to finally make my way to The Parlor... Chris, our server, was fantastic - helping us decide between the eggplant and cauliflower apps (cauliflower it was), helping me choose between black tea and green tea (green for me), and selling us on the roast beet salad (no onions on mine).  Upon seeing our Yelp stickers on our laptops (yes, we were those geeks with our laptops out at lunch), he commented that he'd seen Amber's comment and was flattered by that - too funny!We enjoyed every bite as well as the crisp, clean, green-friendly ambiance of the restaurant, the service, the view of the garden, and of course the company... I will for sure return for the pizza and/or other menu selections post wedding diet!  The Parlor is a welcome addition to the Camelback Corridor!I loved the pizza, the service not so much. We came here a few weeks ago, when Saturday nights were still date nights (before college football season). There was a short wait for a table in the dining room, but we found some seats at the bar and decided to sit there instead. Oops. Although there were at least 4 bartenders behind the bar and they weren't busy they were all standing around and chatting and pretty much ignored those trying to order. Finally one of them came over to take our order. Luckily there were many of them behind the bar because the girl we ordered from was almost nonexistent for most of the night. The pizza was so good. Thin and cheesy with a crispy crust. We will absolutely have to try the meat and cheese plate and the arancini next time. They both looked yummy. Cool, sleek and clean atmosphere. I love the recycled wood. I also love the herb garden near the entrance (I'm currently trying to not kill my own) and the patio looks like the perfect spot to eat and drink once the nights cool down around here. I'd love to just have a meat and cheese plate out there with a glass of wine and just relax.I like to bring red heads here. I don't know why it works out this way it just does. I think red heads really suit The Parlor. Alright, alright, alright.The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.*****LISTEN UP OWNERS*****I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!I wanted to love you Parlor. You have such great potential for so many reasons. First off, you are smoking hot. Sorry, I mean attractive. Your decor is sensational, even when I'm sitting next to the pipework.I've also fallen for your personality. It's subtle and sexy. Mysterious, yet calm. I don't know how you are able to make me feel relaxed and excited at the same time, but I like it. As if it couldn't get better, you are creative. You have found ways to make me love pasta, and I am not really a fan of Italian food. Your spaghetti with basil pesto and pine nuts was a true culinary masterpiece. You even let me order it without tomato. It was also just the right size. The apple smoked bacon soup you made me was ingenious. What a delicious starter. However, you had one flaw that I just cannot get over. You did not let me order dessert. Why was that? Do you think I'm fat? I had a perfectly sized dinner, you made it for me yourself. Why did you wait so long to come back and ask me if I wanted dessert (which I did) that I was worried it would take equally as long to get it to me and therefore passed? It made me very sad. I had to settle for Gelato Spot instead. I love you, but if you can't deal with my love of desert, it was not meant to be.Well you know if I  can't wait to take back Mom  , it's got  to be good!  The hubby and my youngest all went to dinner Saturday. We went at prime dinner time and were pleasantly surprised at no wait.We  were torn between the Funghi Pizza and Yukon Gold/ Gorgonzola. Each looked good when we saw them throughout the restaurant. We ended up with Yukon Gold  which  I loved .  Crust was super tasty. Hubby is looking forward to going back and getting Funghi  next time. My ten year old baby  had cheese pizza  and loved it . Looking forward to next time.I adore  the  Funghi Pizza and Beet Salad  , can't wait to go back !!  Tonight's Field trip to Scottsdale was completed with dinner at The Parlor and 100 % of my little group L-O-V-E-D  it...Had lunch here w/ Violeta today.  Funny- I had spotted The Parlor a few times whilst looking for other venues, but even w/ the knowledge of the address and the general area of where to look, I still missed the turn into TP's corner!  Strange, that.We really liked the ambience of TP.  Wood everywhere- much of the wood and windows were recycled from a Bahama Breeze that had shut down awhile back.  I was hoping we'd be able to dine outside, but there wasn't a spot available; No worries- indoors isn't as noisy as I feared, and it was great to see how busy this place can get!I had planned to order only an entree, which was a task, I tell you, since the menu was chock-full of delicious-sounding selections!  However, we were at a pizza joint, and what better than to order the house's specialty?  Since V. ordered a salad insalata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=rESBIwLbWWIuuBmiUrzfog ($6.50) along w/ a Margherita pizza, I decided I'd try the Farm salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=fBvN3SRC2CsX6H3ZC1DX2A ($7), as well as customizing my own 8-inch pizza ($6) w/ ricotta and pecorino cheeses ($1 each), artichokes ($1), and rosemary and sage (n/c). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=hsvoqgf-kCxmbUK-QcpKoA  We chatted for quite some time before the salads arrived, but what a beauty mine was to behold when it did!  I felt terrible for V. since her salad came w/ salami- I can relate to her misgivings for the dish, as I, too, am not a fan.  But what of my Farm salad?!  Roasted chicken, baby greens, pear slices, gorgonzola, spiced pecans, and dressed w/ a white balsamic vinaigrette.  I thought the chicken was a bit too tender in its soaked and shredded form (I would've preferred it grilled), and the dish could've used a bit more gorgonzola, or perhaps a pinch of sea salt to add a little more flavor, but the candied pecans did spruce the dish up a little.  And what of the pizza?  Well, even the server had to comment on how great it smelled!  It was a lovely sight to see, and I really liked the flavors.  I would need to speficy that I'd like the crust to be more crispy next time, but I can't complain on how fresh the cheeses were, and the artichokes seemed to be fresh and not from a can.Since V. wasn't up for splitting a dessert, I ordered the zeppole (Italian donuts) to-go.  These were described to be ricotta fritters rolled in cinnamon-sugar and garnished w/ seasonal sauces (cranberry relish and a nutella ganache).  I love ricotta, so I had to try it.  I was hoping to crack open a donut hole to see candied ricotta oozing out, but it was just fried donut batter that was moist due to the added ricotta.  I did have one at the resto, and while it was good, I wouldn't order it again.I'll definitely be back--so many items on the menu begging to be tried!Absolutely love this place!  Came here with a girlfriend of mine for lunch on Saturday, and can't rave about this place enough.  Decor is awesome, very sheik and modern.  Service was awesome, and food was tasty.  They have a great little menu here, and you get good food for a great price.   I went with a parlor burger, and they have a few nontraditonal toppings to choose from.  I cant remember what I got on top, but dang, its good!  Have I mentioned how much I love the decor here?  Service was AWESOME too.  Will return in a heartbeat.1/21/10Ordered the duck club http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=7A5VAyqfTeIMbaoicdd9GA minus the red wine tomato jam and instead had pesto on the side, along w/ the roasted garlic aioli and the side of fries that come with the entree.  Looked great- the fries were perfect (!), but, and perhaps the absence of the red wine tomato jam had something to do with it, I didn't find the sandwich to be anything to write home about.  The delicious and crispy apple-smoked bacon and roasted garlic aioli were big pluses and helped to round out this review to three stars.  The tiramisu I had for dessert was very good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=AaTAT23mL5rguQtrmDEbNw  Your usual espresso-soaked ladyfingers layered w/ sweet mascarpone and cocoa, BUT w/ the added toffee-crunch of pine nut brittle!  Oh... I could use a few bites of that pastry right now :)Service was a little lacking- I had noticed a woman busily jotting down the night's specials and had asked my server what else were being served (if anything struck my fancy, I'd have added more to my tab), but he would not and DID NOT go to any lengths to get the info.  Lo, and behold, as I was walking out the door, I looked at the board and, sure enough, there were at least three items that I would've gladly ordered for take-out had my server relayed the info.  Hey, it was his and The Parlor's loss in tips and sales!I wanted to sit at the bar area this time, to get a different perspective of the place, but I didn't care for the austere metal chairs that contrasted w/ the rest of the wooden furniture.  Found it jarring, especially since I felt that the rest of the venue to be cozy and inviting!Step into The Parlor said the hostess to the guy...and while I wouldn't say we stepped in (it was more of a skip)...we did find ourselves immediately pleased with the decor. Herb garden lining the sidewalk, bar windows wide open, fireplace straight ahead and an interior that may rattle my heavenly friend, St. Francis. Get it? Heavenly? Saint? Um...well...anyhoo...the few times I've been there was always that awkward post lunch-pre dinner time (around 2ish)...we were always greeted and seated immediately. That can be an easy time to be forgotten in a restaurant.I had dreams about the Pesto Pasta after my first visit. It was weird. Pesto Pasta and I were on a cruise where Chaz Bono was performing Send In The Clowns. She kept throwing chunks of Parmesan at us from the stage calling us Parlor Gays. Then a huge unicorn came from above and ate her. I don't know what that means. But that has to be one full unicorn. Spinach salad and calamari are big weiners here...wait, I mean, winners here. Winners. Love the tropical ice tea. Service was a solid B+. LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes. I try to eat my cheat foods in fist size portions. Ok. No fist jokes from the randy gays. Please. Welcome to the neighborhood said The Culinary Comedian to The Parlor.Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. First, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. Most importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. So, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. So, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). The waiter responded -- "well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic." He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: "would you like something different?" OK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. Really, "do we want something different?" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. And come on..."it's organic"...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. I understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. Sure, eventually there was a rather late "sorry" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. On the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. The pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.I could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. ...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have.My goal on Saturday night was to stay home and just relax.  I should have listened to that goal.I have been to the Parlor many times in the past year and always enjoy my food and service. I have to say that my one experience there that I had Saturday night will guarantee that I never step foot in this place ever again.  This isn't something about it being an off night...management proved that they just do not care about their guests.Around 6 o'clock through Twitter the specials came through for the night.  They had listed a Prime Sirloin with a pesto spread and potatoes and broccolini.  Since my friend Jill and I end up sharing almost the same brain, she texted me immediately that we should go there and try it out.  I was game.  I even called over to the Parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait.15 minutes later, at 7 o'clock, Jill and her boyfriend Tony show up and put their names on the waiting list.  About 10 minutes after I showed up we were seated. We sat down and immediately told the server that we wanted 3 specials.  Tony, the server (not be confused with BF Tony) regrettably told us that they were out of the special after I ordered an Iced Tea. Since Jill has Gluten and Dairy allergies, there wasn't anything else she could eat there.  We asked to speak with the manager before we would make up our minds to just leave.  Server Tony asked me if he should hold off on the tea and I told him yes.  (The iced tea is important to this event)The manager (who I believe her name was Monica...not 100% sure) came up and acted very defensively about running out of the special...even before we had the opportunity to explain our situation.  Jill said that I even called before to make sure about the special and there wasn't anything else she could eat.  Manager excused herself, came back, and stated that they could use a flank steak instead.  We asked what the price would be for that and she said the same price.  For a FLANK STEAK?  That isn't even close to the quality of a Prime Sirloin!  Manager Monica (?) said that she would comp us either drinks or dessert.  We decided to stay...silly people we were.Server Tony came back, with my iced tea...though I never told him that I wanted it again.  He asked if everything was taken care of.  We said yes and that the manager said that she would comp drinks...so we all ordered glasses of wine.  Tony leaves and then comes back to tell us that Manager Monica told him that she would comp us desserts and $2 off our entree.  Since Jill can't eat the dessert and that wasn't what was discussed, we asked for the manager again.Enter Eric.  I have to say that I never met a bigger jackass in my life.  He comes up to us and says "My name is Eric and the Parlor is considered my place.  As we make specials, you have to understand that it isn't an exact science.  Sometimes we run out of things."  Fine we get that.  I told him that the not having a special is now a moot point since his manager offered us something that she is now reneging on. He faces me and says "Have you ever worked in a high stressed environment before?  Sometimes we say things that we just think about then."  I told him that "Yes I have worked in a high volume stressed workplace before and as a manager I honor what comes out of my mouth."  I am sorry, but if you can't trust your manager with making decisions in a "high stressed" environment then you need to rethink your staff.  He then back pedaled and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we wanted.  We told him we weren't looking for a free meal, but ok.  Food came and he left.Well, of course, the flank steak (cooked medium rare) what not up to par and very tough. The broccolini had absolutely no flavor.  The potatoes were great though.  Of course this isn't the end of the story.  The bill came and I am not shitting you....the only thing on the bill was my iced tea.  After all of that, you couldn't comp my iced tea along with everything else? We should have left then, because a few minutes later the server came back and told us that he handed us the wrong bill.  The correct bill was drinks comped, 3 entrees for $12 and still my iced tea.  (Yes this is a big deal to me)  We couldn't believe it.  If a restaurant is not prepared for a special for Saturday night (a high volume day) then you shouldn't even offer a special.  As a friend said to me today, this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other specials just to get us in. Customer service comes a long way especially in our economy.  I will be willing to pay for good food and good service.  The Parlor proved that they have neither.Yeah, it took me this long to get to The Parlor.  I can walk to it.  All my friends have gone a gazillion times.  Whatever, I'm busy.There was a group of 8 with a crapload of kids in front of us, waiting for the rest of their party to arrive.  I let the hostess know that I'd sit anywhere...except nowhere near them.  Ha!  She put us on the patio.I love patio heaters.  They are necessary in the winters here and the patio was really cozy and warm.  Not overbearing, juuuuuuuust right.I had a pasta dish with seafood and a spicy red sauce.  I like that the meals come in two sizes, as leftovers don't work very well with shrimp.  It gets rubbery.  Blech.  It will rot in my fridge next to the broccoli.  The service was spot-on, as I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  Really nice guy.  Cute, too.The prices were great, even though I didn't have to pay.  I love valet service, too.  Didn't have to pay for that, either.I've tried to pace myself when it comes to bragging up The Parlor, but there have been some tremendous standouts over the last few months that deserve some attention and praise.Several weeks ago, on a date, I had one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten.  Wild caught Sturgeon on a bed of cippolini onions, purple fingerling potatoes, fava beans and a watercress puree with some greens on the top.  My date, who doesn't like fish, ended up eating half of the dish!  Truly great.The other standout was the Spring Farro Risotto.  I never thought that risotto could come across as light, but this dish does.  Farro rice, preserved citrus, asparagus and spring peas all come together beautifully.  I had to force myself to stop eating in order to ensure I had leftovers for later.It's pretty obvious that I'm a Parlor fanboy.  I don't feel bad about it though, they had to work pretty darn hard to make me this way.  Keep up the amazing work!The Parlor is as good as all the reviews say it is. I could end right there but I will divulge a bit more. First, I will talk about the atmosphere. It's absolutely adorable and you'd never guess just how adorable from busy Camelback Road. Hidden behind those cement walls lie an enclosed patio with a fresh herb garden and plenty of shaded seating. They also have tables in the doorway so if you are torn between eating inside or outside, there's always the option of halfway in between! Moving on to the food, the pizza literally melts in the mouth. I went to lunch here with fellow yelper Carolyn S who had been here many times before. She went for a pizza and said they were delicious, so I just had to do to the same and I am so happy I did! I got the Funghi pizza which has mushrooms and goat cheese, but I added mozzarella to it for that extra cheesy taste. The pizza crust is soft and crunchy in all the right places. The pizza was heavily topped with mushrooms and the cheeses and had the perfect amount of bite to it with a great taste. I could have finished every last piece but I got about half way there. The cool thing is that they have eight inch pizzas so everyone can order their own pizza which is nice since so many times, people like different pizza toppings. As I was leaving, I noticed a cool bar on the other side of the restaurant and think this would be a great option for some drinks on a night out. I can't wait to come back again!4/18/12Very, very good late lunch/early dinner meal for me, and it all started with a classic mojito.  Not the Garden mojito on the specialty cocktails menu that has cucumber in it (allergy).  Just a mojito made from a well rum, in this case Bacardi.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=9-cZ-SOtiX2ihwdrCs2FrQ  $6 during happy hour.  And it's a good one!  Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)I was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I'm just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I've been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today's dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You'd think after a few years' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I'm just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every "guitar" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn't hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn't charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.  The entire entree was off the hook!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=wYz23WxyjrTKUXsSUwnKSw  Now, this is where any practical and health-conscious person would say, "Ok, I've had enough.  I can't eat another bite."  But, I can't be practical.  Not when I'm half-way through my mojito!  So, I went ahead and ordered the zeppole ($6.50), and it took more than a few minutes to arrive, but I wasn't in a hurry.  When the six little Italian puffs of sugar-coated fresh-fried dough arrived, accompanied by two small pots of almond crema and Maker's Mark bourbon mascarpone, I knew I was in for a treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=0-sLOjmoMEBkWAcTZyHskQ  Even before I took a bite, I could detect the scent of cherries that were inside the fried moulds of dough, some of which you could see peeking through the sparkling sugar crystals.  And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it's pretty strong, and I didn't mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i'd enjoy the almond crema, I'd have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.  Now I know.4.25 stars.  Can't wait to go back!I toyed with this rating for a while. 4 or 5? Man 4.5 would be perfect! I settled on a 4 based on my first visit, but I can see myself upgrading on future visits. We all know the history of this building. An old beauty parlor. I love how the building was preserved. There are old photos all over the business and even have parlor chairs at the bar. Starting from the main door you pass a garden where the cooks grow their own herbs and produce. Very cool, I wish I was good enough to grow all my own herb, but i know they would just wilt up and die.lol.anyways you can see a real,nice cozy patio while you walk up to the door. You are greater by a host to great you if you want a table in the dining room, or you can go right into a small bar area.Service was good the entire. I really dug the decor.  Hard to explain,  but it was a little dark and just overal hip and romantic at the same time. What I'm trying to say I would feel just as comfortable with my buddies here as if I was on a romantic date with my wife. That is super cool. Now for the food. We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer called Fritto Misto. Wow, when that came out it was just awesome! I couldn't believe how juicy the shrimp were. The sauce was also great for dipping.  I would totally order this again!For the pizza we ordered the Proscuitto Cotto. It wasn't what I was expecting, even though the server told me. But there was no cheese on the pizza, just proscuitto and a smokey tomato sauce. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd like to try something with cheese on it next time.Also while we were dining the music track playing was surprising good! I saw a fellow Yelper that commented in how much the music rocks. He's right, every song was good!  I will be coming back to the Parlor again. This time to try a pizza that more fits me, and I would expect my rating to improve afterwards. Overall The Parlor is a great local Phoenix restaurant. I can't wait to take my out of town friends hereIf a gal can have a spectacular time while on an uncomfortable date, a place Rocks. So was my first introduction to The Parlor. (Hey, to be fair, I didn't realize a date was in the works. Turns out you can't say yes to just meeting up for drinks. Things are Assumed.)Anyhoo. My only criticism of The Parlor is how popular it is. I showed up earlier than my fella (not MY fella, the guy) and wasn't sure where to go. This place is *so* popular it's kind of hard to sort out where to stand. The bar was buzzing and the outside area was hopping. So as a single gal I kind of hovered until I could procure wine. If you're with a group of friends the fun vibe of this place provides energy. Fast forward to an unofficial Yelp event. Heck no! I wasn't going to miss Happy Hour! This time I knew the deal-O about finding the entrance. Tip: Don't drive like a race car driver. The entrance requires sharp precision turning. Miss it and you'll love (really) dealing with Camelback traffic. It's fabulous I tell ya'.HAPPY HOUR | A Blessed ThingM-Sat (3-6pm)$3 Drafts...aaaaand then I pretty much stopped listening.But no, wait! The 8" pizzas are only $7 (!)Ok, fine. More details. There are 16 beers on tap. Well drinks are five bucks.Additionally there are a handful of appetizers at $5.BARSeated like a Queen I met the most Awesome Bartenders. The worst part? I have no idea what their names are. Impeccably dressed they serviced a full bar and were happier than clams. Dressed to the nines. (If that means Hipster Plaid and a bowtie!) I *almost* ordered The Parlor. The amount of care put into producing this gin cocktail was impressive.PIZZAIf you're with a picky eater (ahem, a bad date) the staff is more than happy to modify a pizza on the menu for you. I speak highly of the Salsiccia, Spicy BBQ and the Prosciutto Cotto. The service here is on a grand scale. Front to back, hostess, bar, table service. I've enjoyed both of my visits. Can't wait to visit to scarf down some more pizza! (Oh! Please note that parties of 8 or more will be billed on one check.)The Parlor, a place I would have thought was a VFW more than a restaurant. Once you enter from the rear (that doesn't sound right) you find a contemporary spot with wood, glass, concrete and subtle light coming thru from Camelback Rd. I have been here a couple times and the food is always spot on! For some reason I always seem to write my review after a few visits. Maybe I like to grade on a curve! That always worked for me when I was a kid. Hahaha. The one thing I would change about this place is the seating at the pizza oven. One, I would lower the bar a little so you can see them make the pizzas and two, I would shut the door to the dishwashing room. Kinda nasty looking at food on the floor and dirty dishes. I see enough of that at my house! With that said, the barber like chairs are very cool. Great place for a date night or with friends! Cauliflower gratin? Seriously, that shit is good!If you're about to post lyrics in a Yelp review, ask yourself, "Is it worth it?  Let me work it.  I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it."  Oh Missy Elliot, how I love you.  I also love Meghan L. but she's leaving us...  At least The Parlor is here to stay.  Let me eat my emotions!It was a fabulous dinner tonight filled with a parade of pizza, alcohol, and dessert!  Majority of us [excluding me because I suck] arrived on time at 6:30PM and seating was prompt.  Food was ordered and suddenly the table was a blur of slices being exchanged and food was being consumed.  Noms I got to try:-The Funghi  which consists of roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  Thank you Yuko H. for exchanging a slice with me!  The goat cheese gave it a creaminess that melded well with the chunks of meaty mushrooms.  -The Market Pizza, which changes frequently so I don't know if this will be helpful but it had golden yellow beets, a beet puree sauce, walnut pesto, spiderella, feta cheese, and added bacon.  I'm not a fan of walnuts but I was seriously digging the walnut pesto.  I never had spiderella until tonight either and I gotta say that the earthiness of the greens was amazing against the sweetness of the beets.- The Summer Corn which is made of roasted summer corn, chiles, a corn puree, spicy crema, cilantro, and added goat cheese and bacon.  This one had the boldest flavor.  I had originally thought that this would be a sweeter pizza since it had corn but the spicy crema fights for dominance.  I like the added bacon which adds more saltiness to the otherwise spicy slice!- Tiramisu, we all know what's in it but they added something extra in theirs:  pine nut brittle.  This was probably the dish I'd skip.  The pine nut brittle was so overly sweet that I could do without it completely.  There was also this weird moisture at the bottom that wasn't espresso.The atmosphere was absolutely lovely and intimate and our waitress was amazing.  She took the time to go over the menu and seasonal items with us in great detail and never made us feel like a burden.  She packed our leftovers, the busboy took our photo, and the staff here is just really awesome.  Even the valet made for pleasant company!  You are what you eat and I am pizza.  I also need to live in Meghan's pocket because I'm already getting separation anxiety.  Help.So the last time I was here, I got my brows waxed. That was probably about 7 years ago.I always thought this place was cool,because, it was mid century modern.But, now it is a restaurant, and it is cooler than ever!I came here with 3 friends for lunch. It is a little hard to find if you have never been here before. So make sure to pay attention as it is on the North side of Camelback road. You pull in and park in the back. They have done such a great job bringing it back to life! The atmosphere is relaxed and 60's. Early 60's , I love it. The menu is amazing. They make all the Pasta from the start right there and it is fabulous! They even offer a Gluten Free pasta,which is amazing as well. I can tell you that was not around in the 60's. I got the seafood with linguine. It was great!! My friends got the steak salad and it too was divine. Next time we might get the pizza. Everyone says that is awesome as well. The place is decorated wonderfully. When it is cool enough outside you can sit on the Patio. They even grow their own herbs right there in their garden.I am always Happy when I see a cool Ladies Room. This is right up there. Even with a cool hair dryer chair. Look at my photos.Cool place, Wonderful Food. Worth a visit.First off, great service. Our server was very knowledgable in menu items and drinks. She made great suggestions. Her name is Rebecca and you should request her! Also, I'd suggest the St. James drink and the Pesto pasta. Delicious recommendations suggested by our server. Excellent service and and all around great experience. I'll definitely be returning. A must stop!

One day we decided to make the drive out to Maricopa to check out the Harrah's casino.  When we arrived, we were hungry and decided to give their buffet a try.  We were really disappointed.The selection of food was not very good.  The best items was the Ice Cream and desserts....which were average at best.It was one of those meals where you got mad at yourself for wasting calories on bland food.  Oh well.One good thing is that the cashier at the buffet told us we'd get a discount for signing up for a players club card.  We did and got a good discount, unfortunately the food wasn't worthwhile.Return Factor - 5%

I was lured in by the street side billboard offering a Large pepperoni pizza for $5.00-and as they say you get what you pay for.It was fast & they were real nice and the prices on everything on the menu are real reasonable but...When I first opened the box I thought they had given me a cheese pizza but quickly i realized they just put the chesse ON TOP.I have had many a pizza and this was a 1st...the pizza was cheap and nothing to write home about..actually it was another 1st in my house. 1st pizza to NOT get finished.I wouldn't bother with the pizza here again but I'd give their other stuff a try.

Restaurant name  Pollo Campero

Review Text :
Let me start off by saying, THIS WAS THE BEST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I am appalled (In a good way). So my mother is always going on and on about "Pollo Campero" and makes it her mission to take me to lunch there today. I've seen this establishment a few times while driving on Thomas Rd but never put much thought into having a meal there.We arrive at "Pollo Campero" and right away the smell makes me savagley hungry. Their menu included many sides from ceaser salads to white rice mixed with black beans. While seeming like a very much Mexican themed restaurant, i was surprised they served "yucca frita" and "platanos fritos" (fried plantanes), which are traditionally found in Central and South American dishes as well as Carribean dishes. Every side dish was nothing like a fast food restaurant, the rice and vegtables tasted just like it was home made (amazing). I must emphasize this again, THE SIDE DISHES ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY. I ordered the "5 Dollar Meal" which includes two pieces of chicken (grilled or fried) and two sides,  and a dinner roll or tortillas. I felt bad about paying so little for such a large and freshly prepared meal. The ceaser salad was half of the plate and so crisp and fresh :)Another thing, I have never been treated so well at a fast food restaurant in my life! Again, I cannot emphasize this enough! The owner even came out and gave us coupons for our next visit after asking us if there was anything they can do for us. The cashier lady walked over to our table to give us crayons and a coloring book for my little nephew. When we left, the entire staff waved goodbye. Now tell me that doesn't sound like a cheesey Pleasantville skit, only it's true!The restaurant was decorated great, with different pictures of landscapes on the wall. The music was of excellent taste as well, mixing different latin music from different regions of Latin American. The restaurant was very clean and organized. I give this restaurant a full 5 stars and recommend everyone to try it out sometime, you will be amazed as well :) I guess this made me officially a "regular".(Quick recommendation: Opt for the grilled chicken, you will never taste chicken the same ever again.. goodness! :) )

Review Text :
Sweet little gem inside the Gold Coast! We came here for lunch and cracked up at the fact that this is definitely a hotel for the MUCH older elderly crowd, lol. We stopped at the buffet though and were really impressed with all of the choices we had for food. Chinese, American, Mongolian,  seafood, Italian, tons of fruits, veggies, desserts, and much, much more. The selection of food is fantastic for lunch, and DIRT CHEAP! Only 8.99 for all of that food. The inside is very large and tables are spaced out, and the place is clean. Definitely no complaints about room. The wait staff is awesome and kept our plates cleaned up and our drinks full faithfully. I'd definitely make it a point to stop here for some cheap eats and a full belly.Let me preface this review by stating that there are plenty of fine buffetsin Vegas that are located off the Strip.Unfortunately,this is not one of them.The food lacks any kindfinesse, flavor, and love.For example, you got yourchoice of overly well prime rib,super dry fish,or pasta that was never close to being al dente.And don't forget the blah selectionof wilted greens and stuff from the salad bar.Which I guess is kinda to be expectedconsidering how little I paid for dinner.So if you're ever feeling nostalgicfor mediocre cafeteria food,this would be your place.The full price is not worth the quality and selection of food that they serve. We only go if we have a buy one get one free coupon that you can easily get on the receipt print outs at the Smith's on Decatur/flamingo, otherwise it would not be a good decision. We like the swai fish they usually have as they prepare it in a couple of different ways depending on the day. My favorite is the sweet and sour swai, mmmmm yum. Their bread pudding kicks ass in flavor!They really need to revamp this buffet as the selection is limited and dull in flavor and execution. It could be so much better if they would make some changes with the food selection and preparation. The food I noticed was not even warm or hot, a lot of items were room temperature. The staff is friendly and is good at keeping the drink refills up at least. This is not a buffet that will keep me coming back, I am pretty much three and done, is not worth going for two likeable items in my opinion.

Review Text :
I woke up incredibly, incredibly sick yesterday, with a thudding headache, achy limbs, hacking cough, and sniffling nose.After dragging myself through a long day of class, I knew--KNEW--I needed a decent bowl of soup.  When I was living in San Diego, the best cure for my tiredness and illness was always a big bowl of pho.  And I'd just heard that Xinh Xinh Cafe had opened next to the Schnucks.  Thank God.The space is a bit small, and has a whole "Chipotle-forced-industrial" look to it, softened with Vietnamese hats and other cultural items.  I made a beeline for a nice big bowl of pho and was delighted by the flavorful bowl in front of me.  However, it could have used a little more beef.That said, I enjoyed myself very much, and the menu is extensive, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  They've only been open three weeks, so you should give them a shot, especially if you're sick and need a big steaming bowl of pho to feel better.Edit: Keep in mind, they don't take credit/debit cards yet.  So, just run into schnucks and use the ATM or get cash back.

I wanted breakfast for lunch & they delivered beautifully :)The food is simple & understated, but still yummy. The atmosphere is casual & cool. I literally do mean cool, lol!  The shades are drawn & lighting is low, which is awesome when you're basically suffering from heat stroke just by walking from the your car to the restaurant door, which was only about 5 steps! Service is friendly, but during lunch they do get really busy so expect to wait your turn.They have breakfast specials from 7 am to noonish (ask them for the exact times) BUT they do serve breakfast all day :)

The wine connoisseur will not be disappointed with this place.D'Vine is a smaller, intimate cafe on the second floor of the Ballantyne Village complex. It has a full list of wines for every palate. There were many I didn't even know the names of!They were perfect for a quieter venue on a Friday night. Get a table on the balcony and listen to the music on the square below. Strings of lights over your head complete the atmosphere an give you the warm fuzzies!Prices depend, of course, on the wine. Two full glasses ran me more than $20, but I was not disappointed with my choice!The service was very friendly! They had a strange ESP which gave them the ability to always know when my water needed refilling. They did not hesitate to check on you just the right amount as well!They also have live music on Fridays!Definitely give this place a try!

Review Text :
I finally got a real meal at Carlito's (after visiting for some margaritas, chips n salsa and legumbres many months ago -- all of these things were very good).  I confirmed which items were vegan with the owner via e-mail (most stuff - beans, veg, rice, sopapillas, chile sauces).  So basically you have a great variety of vegetarian choices and a good variety of vegan options here.  And the meat looks pretty good from what I've observed but not tried.Ok, so let's keep in mind that this is NEW Mexican food.  Not Mexican.  Not tex-mex.  It's not supposed to taste exactly like Mexican food.  And it doesn't! It definitely has it's own character.I got a burrito w/ beans, rice, calabacitas, and green chile sauce.  It was gigantic! Pretty tasty too.  But the real star of the day was the sopapilla.  OMFG, how has this not been a part of my life?! Light, pillowy pockets of dough that are toothsome yet melt in your mouth as you chew.  I'm in love!!  If nothing else, do yourself a huge favor and go try a sopapilla.  If you don't like it, call me and I will come finish it for you.Carlito's is the B-O-M-B. I am such a fan of this place and then some. I have been here time and time again and not once been disappointed in the food. The prices are beyond reasonable and the service is decent.I have inhaled several items on the menu and here is how the rank on the medal stand:1. Nachos- Insane! Number 1 in town! I want them in my belly right now!2. Enchiladas- Yes, you are pretty too, Miss Enchiladas. (Get it with green sauce)3. Tamales- excellent4. Tacos- Yes, pleaseThey serve beer and margaritas and my favorite Horchata-drink of the Gods!!! I cannot say enough wonderful things about Carlitos. Only negative is the space itself is tiny and because the food is out of this world you might have to wait a few minutes and get it to go. It's worth it. One bite and you will be addicted to it, too!Holy Guacamole Batman...  This place ROCKS!!!!  I was totally tempted by Jaime W's ROTD for this place and so I had to go ASAP.  I was Sooooo NOT disappointed!!  My stud muffin had some errands to run so as luck would have it we were on the other side of the universe from where we live which just so happened to be RIGHT BY CARLITO'S!!  Serendipitous! So we walk in and the place is small but PACKED!!  That's a good sign.  You could tell that these were ALL REGULARS too.  I saunter on up to the little counter staring at the menu overhead trying desperately to remember what I had decided I wanted to try.  I couldn't remember so I just told the guy that it was our first time and asked him what was the best thing they had.  He asked us if we like spicy and WE DO so he suggested the Chili Verde Burrito.... I got it Combo which is beans and rice and Eric (aka stud muffin, studster, baby maker, hubster, etc) got it Carlito's Way which is double meat.  My son ordered the chicken Nachos. (All three lunches with drinks plus tax & tip came out to under $30.) The service was fast and friendly!When the food arrived (which was quickly despite being very busy) we were first impressed by the shear SIZE of the portions... HUGE!  More than enough to fill up my teenage son who can easily eat a large pizza by himself!!  The nachos are piled HIGH with everything you can imagine and the chicken is SO GOOD!!!  TONS OF FLAVOR!!!  Our Burritos were so big and smothered in green sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug in and both immediately started making noises you would normally hear coming from a bedroom but it was sooo good we couldn't help it!!  Just the right amount of hot without losing any of the flavor.  OH. SO. GOOD!  I still have half of mine left and will be having it for dinner tonight!!I am a definite FAN of Carlito's!! There is not one thing negative I have to say about this place.  It is exactly what it should be.   So my taste buds and  tummy send many thanks Carlito's and to Jaime W for sending me there!!Another one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:Nachos (no meat, $6.50)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=pyMpCBcJmA49t_wZ_fsfaACheese Quesadilla ($3.95)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=E5aH0xwP8-Ja4poLxosfDwThe Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQYou have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.The Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.Overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.Return Factor - 79%I've had this place bookmarked for ages, but despite driving by on many occasions I never forced myself to try Carlito's, until today.My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on green chile and sopapillas. I guess I was a little nervous that I would be disappointed by Carlito's as I have been by New Mexican restaurants in the past. I'm happy to say that Carlito's exceeded my expectations.After seeing Jaime W's taco Tuesday treats on the newsfeed, I decided it was time to finally bite the bullet and give Carlito's a try. I ordered a Navajo taco with pork verde to go. On the ride back to my office, I couldn't resist trying some of the pork. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked and really spicy. The fry bread was a little soggy, but it was probably because I took it to go. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu. I'm looking forward to bringing my mom along with me next time to get her more expert opinion on the place.They also roast Hatch chile during the season, sell pinons by the pound and offer parking lot barbecue parties from time to time when you check out their web site and facebook page.I could write a one-line review of this place--$10 for two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans, sopapilla, and a Mexican coke equals a happy belly. But I'll elaborate a bit.Yes, it is a great deal. Yes, the flavors are delicious. But the real winner here is the green chili sauce. Is this Adderall? No, it's Carlito's green chili. This sauce makes you feel good all over, like you were donating money to charity or listening to George Michael (both of which I did on the day in question, so obviously it was a super good day). What I liked second best about the place was not its sopapilla (but really, eat that thing first when it comes out when it's hot and melty--it's not as good cold) or its Mexican coke (hands up if you h8 high fructose corn syrup) but how you can pick your sides. I'm not one for refried beans, but black beans make my heart sing out with joy, so getting to be all democratic and have a choice in my Mexican side dishes is casting a vote and knowing your candidate will win and be successful in office--I rocked that vote, my friends.All of this is to say, try this place out. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (as much as something can be in Vegas can be in this sea of suburbia, amirite?) but if you seek it out, you won't be disappointed.Starvin' like Marvin, we arrived for dinner on Thursday night around 7:30pm.  I'd heard how good this place was that served cuisine of New Mexico.  What does that mean?  Something to do with hatch chiles.  All I know is that it was some good eating.  I was so ready to eat that I have no pictures of the food.I had two chicken enchiladas, a red chile pork tamale, and a side of black beans; the beans were not necessary after all that food--I had two bites.  Boyfriend had a stuffed steak sopapilla, a tamale, and a side of rice.  Not much talking, lots of scarfing.  Everything was so delicious, fresh, and cheap for what we ordered.  This is one of those places that has so many good things on the menu that it's hard to decide, so take a gander before you go.  I want to return to try some other items, like the Navajo Taco and the dessert sopapilla, and next time I'll remember to save room.Pop QuizWhy did the gurlpren and I decide to eat at Carlito's Burritos?A)  We were starving and looking for something closeB)  Because Alicia R (aka Yes) said this place was good and we had to try themC)  We haven't had Mexican food in a whileD)  Most of our Yelp friends gave them solid reviewsE)  All of the above.If you answered E, you're the 2nd smartest Yelper I know.  Carlito's is located on the southeast side of town and I have to admit, I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food out here in the valley. Coming from San Diego, I never thought anyone out here would come close. Carlito's has changed my mind really quick.  But let me get one thing out of the way first.  When you drive up to this place, you see their sign that reads "Carlito's Burritos, New Mexican Restaurant".  That doesn't mean that this is a new establishment that serves Mexican food. It means that this is a restaurant that serves Mexican food from New Mexico.  Hah...I was one of those fools that misread their sign. Read the reviews, it's all about their burritos and tacos. But for me, it's all about their sopapillas, which is fry bread stuffed with chicken, shrimp, pork, or steak. Being the meat lover I am, I chose steak.  First impression...Man, this is a lot of food. I estimate around 8 oz of well prepared, well seasoned meat, stuffed into the fluffiest fry bread that I ever had. Top it off, it was literally topped off when red sauce. My meal was huge, but so good that my belly wouldn't allow me to quit until it was all gone.  Long story semi-long, try their sopapillas.  You won't be disappointed. Price is about average for most of their items. But the tacos and enchiladas are a steal of a price.  Big plus for service here. You get it with a smile, some convo, and of course, good food. PS: I also tried their chicken tamale and thought it was just okay. But that's just me.So, after a few more visits I have to say I really love this place. Prices are so reasonable, it's ridiculous. The portions are huge, I almost always have to share to get through a whole order.After seeing their post for Super Bowl bbq and catering, we couldn't resist ordering the nacho bar. We picked the fixings up the morning of the game and there was so much food for the very small price tag we had to pay. The ingredients were fresh and we were thrilled with everything. The game was a bore but luckily our nacho bar and good company made the party a complete success.I'm from San Francisco and visit Vegas a few times a year on work and every time I go I do WHATEVER IT TAKES to make it out to Carlitio's. They have hands down, the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life. It's the size of a super burrito at most places and full of the freshest and tastiest ingredients you could ask for. The employee's are all super upbeat and friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. My only complaint... all 5 times that I've been now, I've had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. I'd love to see these guys move to a location just a tad bit bigger, it would really go a long way.LOS ALAMOS COMES TO VEGASOrdered to share a Green Verde Carlito's burrito smothered for just an extra $1.00  Added a giant burrito sized sopapilla, tossed salad and pork posole for $3.00 more which is well worth the extra coin spent.  Only item we didn't find were the blue nachos. Otherwise, one burrito plus the sides more than fulfilled our hunger. Our burrito was filled meat only... no carbs... which was perfectly executed.  Seasoning was spiced perfectly. Understand that they also offer a sopapilla burrito which explains the burrito size.  Very casual and folksy place filled with all sorts of  New Mexico artworks for purchase. Seating is tight and comfortable. Three flat screens to watch college bowl games. For sure we'll be back for more.+1 Green chile everywhere, on everything!+1 Menu has Frito Pie and Indian Fry Bread+1 Sunday special is BOGO breakfast burritos+1 they serve beer and margaritas tooThis place deserves a second location, it's that good... and that busy! The food is stick-to-your-ribs good, so definitely come on a cheat day. There's cheese on everything, and gigantic portions, so you're not getting out of here under a thousand calories.Menu has a good amount of variety but my favorite is the stuffed sopapilla (pork verde please!) topped with the green chile. The Santa Fe Slider is a fairly unique offering, consisting of a slider-size burger patty folded into a tortilla and topped with green chile relish, spicy mayo, and cheese.

Review Text :
Went here for New Years Eve.  While the evening went well, towards the end the bartenders were more sloshed than then partiers [and observed taking multiple shots] and refused to serve us water unless we paid $1-$3 OR flashed our lady parts. (such a deal! video camera not optional) I could write more, but frankly there are hundreds of places to have a drink downtown and this place should be your last last last last last last choice.I was at the same party as Carolyn and Jen E - heyyy ladies!  And yes, it was terrible.  The owners/bartenders/managers (three in one!  tripe threat alert!) lacked any discretion, acted obnoxiously rude, and were total douches - and this was on top of NOT honoring our agreement on drinks, et al.At one point they kicked out my friend for calling o/b/m a d*ckhole, which is indeed insulting and slightly out of line, except for the fact that they were, in fact, being huge d*ckholes.  Upon kicking him out, they nearly refused to let him get his jacket in the -15 degree weather - and (get this) said he was welcome back "any time."  WHAT?!!!  Please, o/b/m's of the Tiki Bar - take your meds before coming to work, because you are seriously wacked out.There are so many wonderful places in Madison to have a drink - skip this one.  Unless you like showing your hoo-has for water at the end of the night.I hope it goes out of business with all its shady practices and ludicrous douchebaggery.

Restaurant name  Toby Keiths I Love This Bar & Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I (used to) love this bar, but it's gone downhill in terms of service and clientele. We went out for a friend's birthday last night and I was surprised to find that a bar that prides itself on being a neighborhood-type, country bar now charges a cover. (For guys, at least.)I love the live band and last night was no different. They rocked. I was disappointed to find that the crowd was nearly half the size of what I remember though. The place used to fill up. Maybe it's the cover that's turning people away? Or maybe it's the bad service....At the end of the night, we had a difficult time flagging down one of the many bartenders to close our tab because they were preoccupied with cleaning up. When we finally got one's attention, she rolled her eyes, asked for our last name and then replied: 'You opened your tab wayyyy on the other side of the bar.' She rolled her eyes again and then reluctantly fetched it, because, you know, that's her job, and then slapped it down on the bar top before us without so much as a thank you.We noticed there was a charge for a Jack Daniels ($8.50 for one BTW. Forgot to mention that their prices have gone up.) we never purchased and when we brought this up to another bartender, we got the same amount of attitude and not a single apology. I've worked in the service industry and certainly understand how, at the end of the night, you're more than ready to clean up and get out of there, but that's no reason to treat your patrons so poorly, especially since the crowd appears to be thinning.I don't know that we'll be heading to Toby Keith's anytime soon. I'll take a good DJ over their fabulous live music if it means I'm tended to by a mixologist who makes me feel welcomed and appreciated. And maybe one who smiles. :)Oh no, I have apparently become a regular here!  So, I am from the middle of nowhere, where the definition of dressing up to go out entails putting on your cutest plaid shirt, jeans and boots.  I think this may be why I kinda like Toby's; it reminds me of back home.  The inside feels like a large barn with a bar in the middle, and a band playing live music on a stage.  The staff is nice to look at and generally pretty swift at getting anything you need.  The clientele has become variable.  I almost wonder if the band playing almost determines the turnout of the kind of patrons at Toby's.  Some white trash mixed with some true country folk and for some reason lately random hipsters and rockabilly guys and gals end up in here too???  In all honesty, I think I am still swooning from the first time I stepped into Toby's.  I met two of the finest cowboys I have ever met in my life, and they turned me out on the dance floor.  It is amazing how important first impressions are..Maybe I just keep going back in hopes of such a grand night out of beer, tequila and cowboys, but it usually ends up rather anticlimactic.Toby Keith's I don't Like This Bar. thankfully i'm a girl and it was free to get in or i'd be angry! the poor guys who have to pay. that's so dumb. it was basically impossible for anyone to get served here. everyone at the bar was getting irritated because no one could get drinks and when you'd place an order you'd have to wait forever again just to get the drink. same story when you're ready to close your tab. either their bartenders are horrible or they're insanely under-staffed. regardless we left because it was horrible.

Restaurant name  Penn Ave Fish Company
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This place has the freshest fish in the city.  There...I said it!It's a must for sushi lovers who claim they've had the best sushi in the city but really haven't because they haven't tasted Penn Ave's sushi! You're even able to pick up fresh fish to fry, cook or grill.  Although nothing beats visiting the location to eat it up!  I come here so much that, yes, they know me by name and know what I order.  Sometimes I'll tear myself away from the sushi to try one of their other fabulous fish creations.  The shrimp and crab pizza, spicy tuna melt and energy salmon lunch are all winners for my fishy taste.  The Strip District restaurant is pretty small so be prepared to hunt for a table at lunch time.  Be warned, I have been known to hover and pounce on a table if it looks as if they're getting ready to leave.  They offer up daily sushi specials which has actually made me branch out to try something different then my old faithfuls (spicy anything really).  There's also Taco Tuesday -  2 for $4.99, 3 for $6.99 or all you can eat for $8.99.And remember, if you're ever there it's highly likely I will be too!I've been on a quest to find really good sushi in Pittsburgh since I've been here about a year and a half and I have been pretty disappointed in the offerings in the city (after living in several coastal cities prior to this).  But now I have finally found what I was looking for in Penn Ave Fish Company!   For some reason I had the impression this was a more fancy pricey restaurant so it took me awhile to finally make it down here.  But it's more like a market style casual restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  You can also buy fish in their market to-go though their market selection is much smaller than Wholley's.  My friend and I shared a few sushi rolls and split the fish tacos. The fish tacos, which were a combo of swordfish, tuna and salmon, were amazing. The best I've every had.  And I've had some pretty damn good fish tacos when traveling in Southern Cali or Florida.  Then the sushi rolls were so fresh and amazing with generous portions of fish.  I saw a guy there working on butchering a very large tuna so I know their fish is some of the freshest you can get in Pittsburgh.  Also everything was so affordable and inexpensive!  I will definitely be going back here regularly.I've been trying to get to Penn Ave Fish Company for Taco Tuesday for months.  Since I had Christmas Eve off, I decided to try it out with a friend.  Unfortunately, on and near major holidays they aren't able to do taco Tuesday or have a full kitchen running.  They do still have sushi, though!  Plus, they do a FIERCE business with people picking up fish.  And after eating the sushi, I would eat and purchase anything here.I believe in starting with a California Roll at every establishment.  It's my baseline for comparing sushi.  I broke my own rule a little, and I went with a spicy California roll.  It was, hands down, the best one I've ever had.  The fish was SO fresh.  I mean, SO fresh.  The spicy was perfect, and I have been craving another ever since.  Plus, there are so many other awesome options (some traditional and some unique).  My friend loved his speciality roll and demolished the whole thing. I can't wait for my next Tuesday off to try taco Tuesday!I know everyone else has already said it, but this is hands down the best sushi in PIttsburgh.  It's some of the best sushi I have ever eaten.  Get here ASAP!As my loyaI readers know, I never like deducting stars from a prior rating--especially for a place that I previously rated 5 stars.  However, I feel the need to do so in this case for a major reason: false advertising.I came by this past Sat. for lunch to try the sushi, since I'd long been wanting to do so, and I've been on a sushi kick lately.  I'd heard this place had the best sushi in PGH, and the sushi I'd seen in the photos and on others' plates had looked promising.  Before going, I looked up the prices on the website, and the price for the sashimi lunch, the platter that most interested me, was listed as $9.50.  I didn't see it listed on the chalkboard menu anywhere, but figured the price listed on the website would be accurate.  Imagine my surprise when, after eating, I went to pay and was told that it was actually $14.99.  What had actually seemed like not a bad deal for the quality and quantity of sushi I received quickly turned into quite a pricey lunch.I would be remiss to mention that the sashimi itself was incredibly fresh and excellent in quality, so I was very pleased with it in that regard.  (My favorite component was the octopus--I loved the texture!)  I also found the quantity to be appropriate for a lunch portion--at least, for me (perhaps not so much if you're a large guy).  And, as an added plus, the presentation was pretty, and service was efficient.  So, I must agree that this is indeed the best sushi I've tried in PGH, and is 5 star quality in that regard.If the difference between the price on the website and the actual price had been a dollar or two, I probably would have let it slide, esp. in light of the quality.  However, a 50% difference in price is substantial, esp. to someone like me who doesn't exactly have money to burn.  I'm not sure if the difference was intentional, to lure people in, or unintentional, as in the sushi page hasn't been updated in years.  In any case, though, this is a major discrepancy that needs to be corrected.Aside from the price differential, a couple other minor things bear mentioning.  The first is that I find the order first and pay after system unintuitive and unnecessary, given that there's no real waitservice or even a bar.  The second is that the sushi menu isn't readily apparent to newcomers who approach the front counter to order.Although I'm leaning towards a 3 star rating, I'll be generous and average my previous 5 star rating with my 3 star experience this time and award a 4.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back again at some point to try a soup or classic fish sandwich, though it'll probably be awhile.  We'll see if they can redeem themselves in the meantime.

Restaurant name  Terrace Room

Review Text :
We had Xmas dinner 2009 there, (I know, sometimes we get behind on our yelp reviews, but this experience was too good to just forget about).  The Terrace Room was one of the few restaurants open for the holiday and it was open in more ways than one.  Not only were they offering dinner to paying customers, elsewhere in the Omni William Penn Hotel, meals were being served to the homeless.  It was a little difficult for us to get reservations, because they were being taken by the restaurant manager only.  We left a couple messages, missed a couple call backs, but finally connected.  He was kind enough to email a menu so we knew what to expect.The Terrace Room is huge and located right off the lobby of the hotel.  The holiday decorations were beautiful.  We got a nice table with a window bench seat.  Our server was very warm and friendly.  BJ ordered the Frisee & Smoked Salmon Salad with dill vinaigrette for his starter.  I got a wild mushroom & brie tart with Sherry onion confit.  Both were very good.  Next came the soup, BJ got the roasted cauliflower and I got the pumpkin bisque.  Mine was SO amazing.  I expected it to be a little sweet, but it was not.  The favor was very pure.  For our main course, BJ had a grilled pork tenderloin with sweet potato gnocchi and sauteed brussel sprouts.  I had a filet of beef with leek & apricot bread pudding, hen of the woods ragout and sherry demi-glace.  The steak rather large and perfectly cooked.  I couldn't even eat half of it!  Plus, I wanted to be sure to save room for dessert.  They served a Christmas Triology, a ginger bread cupcake, chocolate yule log and panforte.  Everything was first rate.  I would love to have Xmas dinner here, again!

Restaurant name  Jean Georges Steakhouse

Review Text :
For a high end name like Jean Georges, this restaurant is ridiculously amateur and low-class.  The substandard food and questionable dimly-lit dining room do nothing to improve the eating experience.  First, my girlfriend and I were poorly greeted by the two hostesses.  When we approached them, one immediately asked, "Do you have reservations cause we aren't taking walk-ins you know" in a Paris Hilton-wannabe tone.  I replied politely that I did with a smile.  She rolled her eyes.  The other hostess gave me a wimpy death stare that looked more like the face of indigestion than one of menace.  The first hostess asked us to follow her into the dining room after confirming the name.  She did not properly sit us down, e.g. failed to hand us our menus or pull out chairs, etc.  If she knew anything about proper dining etiquette, she would not have stacked the menus on the plates like some ogre playing Jenga (tm).  She abruptly walked away without saying a word.  Nevertheless, I was determined to salvage this experience.    Unfortunately as the evening marched on, I learned that it was not going to happen.  Our food was sub-par.  The foie gras was okay.  The bread was heavily buttered.  My plate was very greasy the moment I laid the bread piece down.  Unfortunately, this made the already rich course even denser.  The lobster caesar (a special request) was plain, but decent.  My girlfriend and I ordered the New York and filet mignon respectively as our main courses.  They were perfectly cooked, but UNBEARABLY SALTY to the point that they were inedible.  When I complained about the entree to the waiter (slightly over-weight, 30-ish, and bald), he said, "I am sorry you feel that way" and walked away.  I could have raised a storm and complained even further, but I decided it was not kosher to cause a scene. After drinks and dessert, my tab was ~$330 for 2 people.  Now ask yourself this... would you pay that much for a watered-down version of a Jean Georges restaurant with poor food and service?  If you crave for a Vongerichten restaurant, treat yourself to a flight to NY and eat there.==== UPDATE ====I received a message from a dummy account -- which might have been from an employee or someone related to the restaurant -- attempting to shoot down my review.  Here's what he/she wrote:"The consistency of this review is totally inacurate. JG had never had a lobster caesar, and hostes don't present dinner menus either, the server does." -- Ramon L.I responded..."Before you claim a review is inaccurate, note that your experiences and opinions may be different from mine.  In my case, the hostess planted our menus on our plate.  Our waiter was not even prepared to greet us until a couple of minutes later as he was fussing with two other staff members near the back cashier.  Even if the hostess was not trained to hand us our menus properly, this does not excuse her unprofessional demeanor during the entire greeting process.Also, the lobster caesar was a request -- it did the job, but it was not special or elevated.  I edited the review to make a note of the 'special request' to avoid further confusion.  Also, if you are questioning the validity of my review, I have photos on my cellphone ([two] of which are uploaded on Yelp!) and a credit card bill. ;)"A surprisingly simple restaurant for the chic and cool Aria resort.  The food is what you expect from any good west coast steakhouse.  Its not inventive.  There are no cutting edge cooking techniques used in preparation.  Its not even uniquely plated.  Its simply quality food expertly executed..The Steak tartare is very good.  The quail egg instead of chicken egg yolk adds a much creamier texture.  The rice cracker crusted tuna is also good.  It is served with a siracha and citrus sauce that really brings out the sweetness of the fish.  The soy glazed short ribs are delicious!  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Perfectly tender.  Wow!  The steaks are very high quality and perfectly cooked but like Prime or Charlie Palmer Steak, Jean George is more like an elegant restaurant that happens to serve very good beef and not a true steak lover's paradise. One big plus; the steaks are cooked on a wood burning grill.Do not pass up the sides.  They are meant to be shared.  The broiled bone marrow is incredible.  So rich in flavor and perfectly accentuated by the lemon gremolata.  It is a must have.  The black truffle and comte fritter is also a good choice.  It is almost light and airy in texture.Service is excellent.  Prices are relatively low for a top Vegas steakhouses.The wine list is very good.  All top producers (traditional and cutting edge) are represented.  There is good vintage depth.  Still, I wish wines from lesser regions were better represented.  Simply grilled steak make the perfect platform to experiment with wines from Argentina, Chile, or South Africa.Highly recommended.I love food. All kinds of food, from the hole in the wall burger joint, taqueria, or dumpling house to the high end Patina group restaurants. I eat out a great deal (I'm well into my quest to eat at every restaurant in Pasadena) but I actually don't write many reviews.After my experience at Jean George Steakhouse this past weekend I knew I had to write something, so congratulations to them for getting my first negative review.The service was on the low end of acceptable, but that is something I can live with if the food is good. Sadly, it wasn't. Except for the tomato soup: that was fantastic.The bacon wrapped shrimp was too salty and greasy. The mashed potatoes were salty and very runny. The medium rare fillet showed up with a heavy char. These are very standard and simple to prepare dishes that I've had many other places and this is one of the reasons that I ordered them: they are a litmus test. If you use quality ingredients and prepare the dishes with care there's no excuse to not do them well. I mean seriously, who messes up mashed potatoes? Especially ones that cost $12.00.I asked the waiter to bring the manager over and I described and showed him the food. I prefaced my discussion by saying that I wasn't doing this to get a discount, I wanted to let him know of some things that were going on in the kitchen and that I expected much better.  I didn't insist on new food as that really isn't my way. He thanked me and went off. He didn't return and the bill was for the entire meal. This is clearly one of the options open to him. As was offering to make me a new steak or taking the runny salty potatoes off the bill. Instead he chose the option that really prompted this review.As I left the manager asked me to come again. Now why would I want to do that? This also showed a distinct lack of awareness or seriousness. I am telling my Vegas friends and traveling companions that we can do much better than Jean Georges Steakhouse.This is another great restaurant in Aria.  I have been wanting to try this for two years and I finally went tonight.  I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gelée with some crème fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gelée filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gelée,Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.Jean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!The girlfriend and I chose Jean Georges Steakhouse for dinner for our first day in Vegas.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 7:45 reservations.  The hostess informed us that our table would be available at our reservation time, but we could wait in the bar.  So we did, but decided against ordering any pre-dinner drinks.  Less than five minutes after our reservation time rolled around, the hostess tracked us down and led us to our table.  After a quick review of the menu, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairing. Our first course, Almas Ara Caviar over a Meyer Lemon Gelee with crème fraiche, and dill and served in a hollowed out lemon half, arrived at the table. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ It was beautifully presented.  More importantly, the contrasting tastes and aromatics of this successfully executed dish really kicked the meal off on an impressive note.  Unfortunately, our paired wine didn't arrive with the food, instead being delivered by our server halfway through our first course with basically no introduction beyond the appellation and varietal.  Our second course, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well executed and nicely presented as well, but the dish wasn't all that original in concept and didn't provide the "wow" of the first course.  Sadly, like our first course, our paired wine again didn't arrive with the food and again it arrived without much of an explanation mid-course by a different server than the first.  The third course, a roasted Chilean Sea Bass topped with grilled Maitake mushrooms and a miso-yuzu glaze, sounded outstanding in its description, but was the night's biggest miss. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#GetRHNqeg8V60PcU-iEc0w The fish was cooked perfectly, but its topping was excruciatingly salty to the point of being inedible.  It was so salty that even after scraping it off of the fish, it was still salty to point that it overwhelmed the delicately flavored sea bass.   At least by this course, the wine arrived with the food (delivered by the second server), as was the case with subsequent courses.  Our fourth course, the grilled Wagyu Filet Mignon with grainy mustard and warm potato salad in textures, was a great rebound as our steaks were dead-on perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#Uy27bZHUGqAet7HnHcT-pw  It was paired with the best wine of the night, a Cote du Rhone.  This course was the best marriage of food and wine of the night!  Our dessert course was the JG Candy Bar, which I can only describe as six deconstructed candy bars kluged together like a sweet, rich Frankenstein's monster. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#SmNL9RpX6i_VDuiZDsb_SA  It was paired with a Madera.While the food was, for the most part, well executed, and the wine was generally enjoyable, the service side of the house seemed awkward and lacking the depth of knowledge one would expect from a fine dining establishment like this one.  The gf and I aren't really wine snobs, but we do enjoy wine with our food.  If we enjoy a particular wine that we're served in a restaurant, we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home.  Therefore, it was a huge foul that the service staff wasn't more familiar with the wine that was being paired with the food since we really enjoyed the Cote du Rhone served with the filet.  In the end, I felt the Tasting Menu especially with the wine pairings was a poor value.  While we certainly never felt rushed, I got the distinct impression that Jean Georges Steakhouse was more concerned with getting diners in and out rather than providing a truly memorable dining experience.  What a shame.Is Jean George the best restaurant in the Aria? No way! Is it solid compared to some of its neighbors? Oh yes!I came in for my birthday with some friends from out of town. We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality. To start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.Now this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it. I might not have been blown away by everything, but it was a solid dinner.It remains an excellent choice for steak in Vegas but where's the Japanese beef?Straightforward starters.  A good tuna tartae.  Chunkier than most, lightly layered / mixed with avocado with soy ginger dressing. A crisp rice cracker a good textural foil.   The tempura calamari, light and crisp with very little residual oil.  Pairs well with it's sweet chili sauce.To the steaks, USDA Prime, extremely well trimmed, beautifully seared on a hardwood burring grill, even coking to exact temperature.  The Australian wagyu filet mignon, buttery with a cloying fatty finish.  Around A3 quality.  Tender but lacks any wow factor.  The star of the menu is the Angus 300 (it is not aged for 300 days but the name of the steak.).   According to the restaurant, the steak is raised in elevations in excess of 3000 feet and fed slowly for 300 days, finished for the last 100 without any hormones or antibiotics.  The steak is wet aged 14 days and finished with a 28 day dry age.  Very good, pronounced dry age flavor, nutty and buttery with a good umame punch.Standard USDA Prime cuts are right on par.  Excellent, porterhouse and rib eye.  Both tender with good beef flavor. For sides, props to the bone marrow with lemon remolata.  Rich and unctuous.  Toss the toast, scoop the marrow on the steak, add the granita and enjoy!  A beautiful pairing that brightens the steak and makes it even more wine friendly.  The black truffle and cheese decedent.  Aromatic, covered with shaved black truffles.  Works very well with the Angus 300 further accentuating its umame goodness.Finally, for non beef eaters, the roasted Chilean Sea Bass with a miso yuzu glaze and a side of roasted maitake mushrooms good eats.  Think miso butter fish with a side of great mushrooms, umame on umame.  Keep in mind, portions are smaller when compared to other top steakhouses.Service remains steakhouse proper and friendly.  The wine list remains excellent.  High Vegas resort pricing.*****scratches head***** No Japanese beef?I'll start with a brief description of the food, but then retell the story of the worst service I think I have ever received and how they tried to scam us out of $200.The appetizers and sides were pretty good, we got a variety of what they had on offer. Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best.I was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.The reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price. We told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely false and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then! We all left feeling frustrated and insulted.I liked it then and I like it now. It was truly one of the best steakhouse experiences I have ever encountered...several times.I was lucky enough getting top notch dinners for free here at Jean Georges Steakhouse two nights in a row. I definitely can't complain about anything as the foods were simply superb and on top of it, it didn't cost me anything. Thank you my awesome business partners! The first dinner, we had tons of food. We started with Nueske's bacon wrapped shrimps, calamari, and heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad. You may recall I hate overzealous servers who always boast everything they serve to be the best. This guy did exactly that. He told us it would be the best and lightest calamari we ever tasted. He also said the buffalo mozzarella was bar none and just the most incredible mozzarella ever. Surprisingly, he didn't lie. Holy shit, those calamari and mozzarella were amazing! AMAZING! I didn't mind him so much after I knew he was just telling the truth. My filet was perfect, accompanied by half a lobster tail, creamed spinach, mushroom, truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was anything you could expect from Jean Georges Vongerichten. The next day...though I was less enthused eating at the same exact place, I quickly forgot about it when I sat down and started drinking the house mule cocktail. Whoa! It was so strong and just pure alcohol but it was really good after several days of ass kicking meetings. Now, I looked forward to the calamari and the bacon wrapped shrimps again. They also ordered the ahi tuna tartare that hit the spot for me. I started to get sick of red meat at this point and decided to share a bone in rib eye with our host. We had most of the same sides as last night plus truffle fries. Mind you.. This truffle fries weren't like any truffle fries you ever had with a douse of icky truffle oil. This one had shavings of real black truffle on top. The mushroom was also a favorite of mine. It was mixture of various kinds of mushroom sautéed with jalapeño so it had a little kick to it. I ate the peppers and it burned as it went down my throat. Yum!!The rib eye and the filet were both premium for steak. They also offered a $270 6 oz of Kobe filet. Hahaha...insane!! Both dinners were ultra pricy and I was just grateful that I could enjoy these gorgeous delicious food without breaking my bank. It was also great to spend quality times with people I work with every day. Our server on the second night, Boris, was awesome. He was probably the best server ever and was on top of everything. He catered to our host so much and to all of us in the most courteous manner and at the end, after our host signed the whopping check and handed it to Boris, he shook our host's hand. It was so classy.I will probably eat here again next year when in Vegas and I can't wait!!Considered by some to be the hipper, younger brother to Jean Georges Vongerichten's stunning PRIME at Bellagio it may perhaps be a simple case of a saturated marketplace that has seen the New York Restauranteur's eponymous Steakhouse at Aria overlooked for rankings amongst the city's best, but recently reintroducing Chef Sean Griffin's talents to some of the best protein and produce available a nine-course tour of sixteen menu items on Friday showed the sort of creativity rarely associated with restaurants pigeonholed for grilled meats.Certainly more modern than the soft stylings seen from a fountainside table at Bellagio, the dark interior and wall-sourced lighting adding intimacy to booths while tables near the expansive wine rack are better lit from spotlights up above, music trends a bit 'bumping' at times but is never intrusive in the experience, just enough to drown the din of a 400+ person room.Acknowledging that my menu was part self-selected and otherwise carte-blanche at a discounted tasting-menu price bolstered by a few luxury ingredients and service beyond reproach, it was after greetings from Chefs, Managers, and Sommelier that the meal got started, a $16 Lemon Drop dressing up Soju in citrus beneath a salted rim with herbals greeting both the palate and nose.Almost empty for the first hour of my meal, but filling to 2/3 capacity by the time 7:30pm rolled around, it was as demi-portions of most of the plates that the menu progressed and with an excellent bread basket featuring warm pretzels and lightly spiced crisps clearly warranting overindulgence the menu evening thankfully started off lightly, two thin slices of wagyu draped delicately over cream-centered fritters with shredded truffles adding a bold and aromatic edge.Favoring the produce of Kerry Clasby for almost every plate in the place Chef Griffin presented course two as "a farmers basket from the Intuitive Forager," the smoothness of the cheese playing beautifully off peerless figs, grapes, apples, and pears with nuance and crunch added by a crisp made of rice flour and ground sesame seeds.Essentially incapable of failing with a perfectly seared slice of foie gras floated on brioche in a bubbling broth of top grade sake with notes described by the restaurant's Somm, it was onward to a surprisingly even better bird that the evening moved forth, the grilled tempura-fried chicken offering the utmost amount of crunch encircling juicy flesh as hot sauce dissolved in butter found its foil in tender spinach beneath.Next offering two protiens I'd suggested as 'dull' when asked why my self-seleccted menu contained no fish, suffice it to say that although the salmon was well cooked it was completely secondary to the quality of accoutrements including shaved truffles and lightly sweetened parsnips in two forms while the sashimi-grade scallop may as well have been raw at its interior beneath a caramelized sear while light heat accented the aromatic broth.Acknowledging jokes about ordering short ribs at a steakhouse, but worth tossing that rule out the window for the soy-soaked masterpiece that embodies Vongerichten's East-West fusion style, it was in three carefully sourced steaks along with sides that savories concluded, each medium-rare strip tender and remarkably different, the nutty dry-aged funk of the Australian hybrid my personal favorite while both the sweet potato and truffle topped pasta were both sides one may wish to hoard rather than share.Impressed by elaborate desserts at PRIME, but seeing the menu trend more upscale-comfortable on the Aria's second floor, one would be hard-pressed to name s better apple pie in the city than the cast-iron masterpiece with a sugar crusted lattice and although the almond cake itself was a bit more dry than one might have wanted despite the sorbet, figs, and balsamic a far better composition was found in the tasting-menu-only sundae, a case of the classic flavors of peanut butter and jelly reinvented with no layer upon layer of texture and intrigue. Undoubtedly underregarded in a city where steakhouses sometimes seem far too common, Jean Georges Steakhouse not only steps outside the tried-and-true formula of success but does so with some of the best ingredients in the city, a fact easily overlooked by the expense account or convention crowd but one that shows the work of a kitchen willing to take the extra steps to provide those paying attention a truly excellent experience.

We came here Sunday for lunch.   Wow, what a great time we had.  Lots of parking in the lot and nice and cool inside,as it was a scorching hot day out there.   There was no line even though it was about 1:00pm. We were seated at the perfect booth for two.They brought water right away, then our drinks while we getting our food.You just do not know where to start. The selection is just like Vegas Baby.  Only $35.00 plus tax for 2. Which is called Sunday Champagne. We did not drink any alcohol, but you can get it if you like.  The food is fantastic.  Seafood, meat, chicken, Salmon was excellant!    It had a steady flow of people but, no line ever.  With Prime Rib and Ham, even an Omlette bar. Lobster Omlette.....Real mashed potaoes as well.Rest rooms were shiny and clean.  We will be back very soon.We have come here a few times in the past year, and we really liked it a lot!So we decided to come here for our END of the WORLD Dinner.Of course the world did not end because, I am writing this review, but the dinner was still great!The staff laughed when we told them why we were there. They said people had been saying that all day long when they were coming in for lunch and dinner.We had all you can eat Crab Legs with Clarified Butter. They were divine.I wish we could of found all you can eat lobster, but you can't have everything. We were lucky to find this place.Not only did I have crab, but also prime rib, trout and spicy catfish(totally fabulous). Their mashed Potatoes are real and the gravy is so worth it.I feel like I am in Vegas when I go to this place, I love it.Plus, they have fabulous desserts of all types.I love the fruit tarts, Mario loved the Banana pie. This place is so diffidently worth your time and attention. give it a try. Since we are all still here and loving life.

Whenever I'm at Gold Coast, my choice is either Ping Pang Pong or Noodle Exchange. Usually during the colder season, I tend to opt for Noodle Exchange for their hot pots. SERVICETypical service you get at any other Chinese restaurant. Not too friendly, but they are quick to take your order, refill drinks, get you the check or anything else you need. FOODMy usual is their Beef Combination ($14.99). You get a choice of mild or spicy but I can't handle any heat so I always get mild. You get a medium sized pot with a tea bag (?) which contains all kinds of spices in it. I actually ripped it open one time to investigate what was inside, as if I was in a biology lab doing a dissection. This tiny bag had herbs, slices of ginger and other unknown spices that I had no clue of. Needs further investigation. Beef Combination comes with mushrooms, tofu, fish cakes, corn tomato, daikon, taro, noodle and fish balls. Beef is thinly sliced and is very similar to shabu shabu. You also get a choice of lamb or seafood combination hot pot but I have only ordered beef.  It's a decent portion and I always enjoy cooking at the table.CONCLUSIONCome here for the hot pot! Place is always packed and super loud but I am coming back again on another cold day.

Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!I wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!A sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.We finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.The server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.Overall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer.

Review Text :
Probably 2.5 Stars.I usually do not factor in price to my reviews.  I try to concentrate on the experience itself and give a rating based on that alone.  I do that because I always am aware of the cost of my dining experiences and am willing to pay for what I get.  However, in the case of Bar Masa, I had such a case of sticker shock that I had to factor it in.  I stopped in late one night after a poker tournament and ordered some Sushi. Salmon, Eel and Hamachi.When my order arrived it was one small piece of each for $8.00 each.  They were all very good, but I was still hungry so I ordered the special Mushroom Roll. It was one of the best Rolls I have ever had.  Thin, seared beef outside and a mix of exotic Mushrooms inside.My food was good, but at almost $80 for three pieces of Sushi, one roll and one small carafe of Sake, it should have been amazing! Another thing that bothered me is that even though this is a Sushi Restaurant, there is no Sushi Bar.  As a frequent solo diner I  like being able to sit at the bar and interact with other customers and the Chef.Service was prompt and professional but rather stiff and stuffy.  They are a brand new restaurant, so they are obviously wheelchair accessible. Since Bar Charlie is closed, I was hoping Bar Masa could match it in terms of quality and value.  Unfortunately, my experience did not reach that level.If your perception of Japanese food in Vegas is $24.99 AYCE sushi, tempura, and mayo baked mussels, stop reading.Let's get this out of the way.  Quality Japanese food is expensive.  A contemporary Japanese meal in Tokyo, at a Michelin one star can easily run $300+ without alcohol.  Freshness is a pillar of Japanese cuisine and sourcing the freshest products globally cost.Bar Masa uses the freshest ingredients including fish that has been out of the water less than 24 hours before being served. Small portions, beautifully presented.  Ignore the prices and order what sounds good.  From the Spring 2013 menu, the toro tartare with osetra caviar is a must try.  The firm, meaty fish explodes with flavor when it mixes with the salty, briny, yolky flavor of the popping caviar.  Not to be out shown, the chilled sayori (needle fish) with shiso flower is Spring itself.  The firm flesh of the fish lightly enveloped with a fish stock aspic, the hint of citrus and the flowery, herbaceous finish of the shiso.  The hibachi grilled, fresh unagi with kabayaki sauce is excellent.  Very high quality unagi, very fatty with no muddy flavor.  The Nantucket Bay scallops, firm and sweet.  Both benefit from the sweet, bitter smoke.For fried items, the in season soft shell crab done tempura style is excellent.  Everything you expect from a soft shell; creamy, oceanic goodness inside surrounded by a not oily, crispy coating.Finally, save room for the uni and trumpet mushroom risotto with shaved bianchetto truffles.  One of the most unique, creamy flavored ingredients of the sea pairing with the umame charged mushrooms of land.  A simple preparation but what a flavor punch.Yes, there is sushi.  Never tried it.  That's for sushi bars.Outstanding sake list.  Probably the best in Vegas.  Resort pricing.It's not for everyone but those wanting to experience quality, contemporary Japanese cuisine without flying 5000 miles, this is your chance.I didn't think I would have to read the reviews on yelp for this restaurant because its located in Aria. If a restaurant is in Aria you would think it's suppose to be an amazing place to dine at.From the outside it looks so fancy and nice. We walked in and got seated. To us, this place doesn't look very elegant or fancy. To quote my boyfriend.."This place looks like a warehouse with some tables and chairs." Lol. It really does but with some lighting hanging down.We really don't care about how expensive it is as long as it taste good. We ordered the Sashimi Tasting Plate, the Kobe beef and Uni. Surprise, surprise, the waiter came back and told us that they ran out of Uni. How do you run out of Uni at a sushi place with barely any customers?Our food came out and the Sashimi plate was a big disappointment. How can you say this taste fresh or even good? You don't have to be sushi expert to know this was so mediocre. The Kobe beef came out next and it doesn't look very appetizing. It tasted okay but it didn't "wow" us. My boyfriend says the only thing he liked was the steamed rice. Yes, you absolutely read that. At least with steamed rice there's no high expectations on what it's suppose to taste like. It taste like rice and you can't complain on how horrible it taste. With those 2 items and my cocktail drink, the total pirce came out to be almost $200 with tips.We are still hungry. So guess where I am? I'm writing this review at another restaurant while I am eating. This is my 2nd dinner. So sad.DO NOT COME HERE unless you want to throw your money to eat crappy sushi.- One slice of maitake mushroom and two shavings of white winter truffle on a ball of rice the size of your thumb - $8- The same ball of rice with a thumb size, quarter inch thin, translucent slice of king crab - $9- One small handful of simply grilled maitake mushroom that wouldn't be half a side in a steakhouse - $28.- Eight slices of a "California" roll totaling 6" if reassembled - $32- One heaping tablespoon of finely cubed toro with half an ounce of caviar $68If you balked at the portions or prices, barMasa is not for you.Before you judge, no, I do not believe the prerequisite for a great dining experience be an incredibly expensive menu or use of exclusive ingredients.  My most memorable Vegas dining experience came from a burger at In-n-Out.  That said, for those who are willing to try, barMasa delivers the best, most authentic Japanese cuisine in Vegas.The manager himself pefaces your meal by stating "this is a kaiseki like meal".  Kaiseki literally refers to monks holding a stone against their stomach to ward off hunger pains.  This is a meal of appreciation, NOT volume.The maitake truffle nigiri, the perfect bite balancing the earthy flavor of the maitake and supercharging the umame overtones.  The incredibly high quality, gently compacted rice providing a hint of sweetness, its seasoning providing the kiss of acidity.  The flavor of the mushroom goes on and on.The same is said for the king crab nigiri.  The very small piece of crab is the right size to balance all the flavors yet finishing with the incredible sweetness and oceanic goodness that is king crab.  Simply put, more crab would lessen overpower the dish and lessen the appreciation.The grilled maitake mushrooms finished with a pinch of salt, flawless.  Meaty texture and an incredible explosion of flavor with each bite.  A sip of sake whose flavor profile provides the same earthy, mushroom flavor, and the dish is perfect.The signature Masa toro tartare caviar so perfectly balanced.  Every day toro (not o toro) is topped with caviar.  The yolky, briny, salty flavor of the caviar brings out the gentle sweetness of the toro and heightens the fresh fish flavor.  The chef's decision not to use the highest quality toro is brilliant as higher fat would have marred the clean mouth finish.The list goes on and on, from an exquisite mixed tempura plate to a fried rice of duck and foie.   Each dish highlights a single, primary ingredient so brilliantly with portion sizes appropriate not to ruin the experience.  True Japanese sensibility.The largest selection of sake in Vegas backs the menu.  The sommelier is very knowledgeable with the offerings.  Typical Vegas resort markup.   Decent wine list but do try the sake.Service is very friendly and professional.Simply put, the best Japanese cuisine in Vegas.

Review Text :
So, I've been here twice.  It's definitely an older crowd, well older than me anyway and I'm in my mid-twenties.  That's not a bad thing, just an observation.  I met a woman who told me that if she was my age again she would not be hanging out at Blue Martini.  Another guy asked me if I was twelve, so you can see why I bring up the whole age thing.  On a side note- I was barely buzzed, so I don't think I was acting twelve.  Another thing I observed, three woman (not girls) dancing on a counter and posing "seductively" for photos.  They took at least fifteen shots of just their butts.  They were some classy bitches. What else, three people confused my male friend for a female.  Yeah, he really needs to cut his hair, he is just too darn pretty!  Seriously, his hair could star in a Vidal Sassoon commercial.  He even scored a ladies VIP card.  Good times.The night was capped by witnessing the saddest drunk I have ever seen.  I thought that maybe I had accidentally teleported to Vegas or Rocky Point, but no, I was still in a parking lot in AZ.  He had his pants around his ankles, a bloody knee and dirt all over his face.  I guess he fell down a few times?  He couldn't get his pants up to save his life, seriously, I actually tried to help him I felt so bad.  He kept mumbling something about medical school.  Ah, the children of tomorrow.  Anyway, someone finally claimed him.  What else?  The waitresses all wear bustiers.  I once went on a Thursday night and they had a live band.  The Blue Martini had a glow stick in it.  The bathrooms are pretty nice.  People will step on you on the dance floor.  I think one guy seriously shoved me out of the way so he could spin his girl.  He was a prick, but I Iet it slide... he was shorter than me.My douche-bag detector was off the chart from the moment we got inside... lots of fake people and Asian hookers. It is one of the few places this far north that offers live music and dancing tho (if you're into that). I think I would have enjoyed this more during the week when it isn't as packed and they don't charge guys a cover - I hear they let people sing with the band on Mondays - Live Karaoke anyone?This place is terrible, I have been here twice and I do not plan to come here ever again. The valet crap is a joke, everyone wants to flaunt their "so called" money and cars pffff! The guys at this place are douche bags, I think women have more luck meeting a "real guy" at a gay bar. lolThe bartenders are overbearing and slutty, the 2 times that I have been here, I have seen numerous bartenders slip phone numbers to married men right underneath their wife's noses! I mean come on!I have to say this place really sucks, tons of fake, fake, fake people. This place is nothing but a competition to the most elite, superficial,  people of the world  The ultimate epitome bar of Scottsdale hands down.I give it 2 thumbs downI've been here many times, but only on Wednesday nights.  Why?  Because my coworkers love to come here for Ladies Night.  It's a fun night to people watch.Tucked away in the City North development, the location is less than ideal to drive a lot of traffic.  So, it takes a lot of work to get people out here on a regular.  On Wed nights, they do a great job of doing that.The place gets packed and you have to get there early or make reservations to snag one of the comfortable, padded chairs/table setups on the 2nd level with a great view of the band/dance floor.The party atmosphere on Wednesdays is pretty cool, especially for Phoenix which is typically dead all of the time.  A mid-week party like this is rare.We've dined here a few times.  The Margherita Flatbread and Burger are both pretty good.  The food isn't why we come here though, so it's always an afterthought for us.The staff here is really attractive and can keep up with the pace of a nightclub atmosphere, so the service levels have always been high for us.Overall, a fun night out.  We'll definitely be back.Return Factor - 100%I've been here several times and it gets less and less fun every time.  Primarily due to the deteriorating clientele and over priced drinks.  $27 for 2 margarita plus the cover charge?  Mmmm...the drinks aren't THAT good!Plus, it's actually a swingers' bar and because of that there's always about 4 sleazy men for every woman.  The outdoor patio is full of smoke so forget about enjoying any fresh air.The music is pretty decent...soooo 2 stars.Dear blue martini:You're a bar, not a dance club, not a music venue, not anything special! So why the hell do you charge a cover and inflate your drinks to levels where I feel like I could have purchased an entire bottle for the cost of one rum and coke???Mayyyyybe if your wait staff was on the caliber of old town and mayyyybe if the average age of the girls I'm about to meet wasn't 40+ I'd raise this rating to a 2, but common, really?The live band is a nice touch if you're into 1970's style lounge lizard vegas performers.  This review will without a doubt fall on deaf ears but oh well, the people have a right to know.  Thanks yelp for being the only place north scottsdale checks on where to go out.  As for you, the owner, you pretentious Gordon gekko'ish sommmamabish, I hope you're laughing it up knowing I paid $88 for 4 drinks.  Here are the words out of your mouth: "gotcha"Blue Martini is firmly known at all locations as a trendy upscale lounge with a locals only mentality and the City North location on High Street in Scottsdale is no exception.Blue Martini has several distinct areas including, a center stage for live entertainment, a VIP lounge and a super cozy patio.It's a great after work place to chill and great place to hang out with friends.I met some friends for drinks and dinner and was very pleased. Blue Martini has 42 Signature MartinisI tried:Peach Raspberry MargaritaGrapefruit Smash (Ciroc Peach Vodka, St. Germain, Agave, Lemon)Appetizers:Shrimp MartiniShrimp & Crab DipFruit/Cheese Plate Flat BreadsSpinach Artichoke Dip (what I had)Crab Cake Signature Dishes:Seared TunaMaine Lobster SaladLemon Pepper ChickenLollipops Lamb ChopsThai ChickenBeef TenderloinDesserts:Ultimate Chocolate CakeWhite Chocolate Mousse CakeBlue Martini has some of the best live entertainment in Phoenix.I saw a band rocking the classic oldies.

This place needs to seriously get their act together. They need someone who can speak clearly to take incoming To go orders. Also, I love being served quickly but, not at a price. I don't like the inconvenience of having my order wrong and not having the condiments that go with the food. As a side note --my husband also said the soup taste like dirty water and a few tree branches. I will not be eating here again. Try PT noodles they are not as big but, they are also not in the bad part of town and they have slightly better service. The food also taste better too!

Review Text :
I finally made it to this new location of Pita Jungle last week for dinner... While it has a different feel to it, I liked it just as much if not more than the other locations.  It's modern and spacious and has ample seating both inside and out.  Not to mention, you can always count on PJ for an affordable, filling, and healthy meal.I went with a group of five of us on a night that was actually pleasant (not too hot), so we opted to sit outside even though there was a ten minute wait to do so.  We sat at the communal table inside and ordered some hummus as an appetizer and then once our table was available, we moved outside.I tried something new this time - the sauteed garlic spinach.  I ordered it as an appetizer (i know, kind of weird), but it was the perfect healthy beginning to my macro platter entree.  While Jared would not kiss me that night (hello, garlic breath), it was worth it... I enjoyed my meal and our service was attentive as well - and that says a lot since our group went through a ton of water and iced tea.  Other items that our group had were greek salad with chicken, some seafood special, chicken schwarma, and curry chicken.  Everyone was satisfied and went home with a full belly.I learned that this location is a franchise and not the same owners as the original PJ locations.  I think they are planning on opening some additional locations as well.  That's fine with me - the more PJ locations, the better.  The "Jungle" continues to be an old standby for me, my friends, and family - no matter what location!I'm a jack vegan. Well, that's not fair. Most days I do it right. So everybody seems to think I'd love this place. LIke I SHOULD, for some reason, like it. I HATE IT SO MUCH. SO SO MUCH. There's nothing wrong with it unless you want your food to taste good. But if you're one of those morons who are into that, there's a little problem with Pita Jungle. Same with Schlotzky's. Everyone seems to like it. I have never had anything there that tastes good. But many wonderful people feel differently. I can't explain it but thank god for diversity in the universe.So, I might have been slightly wrong about Pita Jungle. Because of the Butterfly Effect, right after the ink on my PJ review dried, my buddy's wife wanted their takeout and since I hadn't been for a while, I thought it was only fair to the Yelp gods that I check my assessment's veracity. My decision to get the jalapeno and cilantro hummus was heavily influenced by my spritual/culinary guide, Richard Z. He's usually right about two things: My neurotic behaviors that lead me to straight to crestfallonically laced internal disharmony and food. It was tasty, indeed. And spicy enough to make me smile. But here's why I'm bumping up the stars...Our server said the funniest shit:My friend asked: How's the tuna melt pizza?Awesome Server: It smells terrible.Friend: Like Farts?A.S.: Like vagina (answers phone)- Takes order. Puts phone down.Well, not like my vagina. Dallas and Friend:... (staring blankly)Three Stars!

Another 24-hour joint I frequent off the strip, in the Suncoast Hotel and Casino.  I end up dining here before or after checking out the bands that play in the Suncoast showroom.  This café has decent Chinese food for late night eats and their breakfast menu is pretty extensive.  I remember the cheap graveyard specials...2 buttermilk pancakes-2 eggs-and bacon for $3.99.  They were actually cheaper than that back in the day.  Three solid stars across the board for most of the dishes I've had in the past year: -House salad-Club Sandwich-Fried Rice-Beef Broccoli-Wonton Noodle Soup -Steak and eggs special-Prime rib specialThe daily specials end around 10 pm and the graveyard specials were only offered during the weekdays from 11 pm to 7am.  I used to go here more often when they offered a midnight burger special for $3, including fries and a drink.  For that price, the burger was exceptional!  Service has been good for me lately.  For the past couple of visits, I didn't have to wait for a table as long as I did before...when that burger special was popular!  I guess more people opt to dine earlier at the new TGIF at the other end of the casino.Came In here with Dave's family for an early dinner.The service was kind of slow even though it was half full at 4pm.They serve Large portions for the food and my cobb salad was huge! The burgers that and the sandwiches our party ordered were okay too.Loud environment with annoying announcer on a blown speaker which makes it hard for you to have a decent conversation with your party. Overall -this place is okay.The casino cafe is an institution that has been a good value going back to when Bugsy Siegel opened the Flamingo on December 26, 1946. It is an institution serving all types of food at reasonable prices throughout the day.    The Cafe Siena is the casino cafe of the Sun Coast. It brings the old school casino prices to Summerlin. Their old school casino prices include daily specials; everyday specials featuring meatloaf for $8.99, rotisserie chicken for $9.49, and southern fried steak for $9.99; and Chinese restaurant specials for $8.49.  I am a fan of the casino cafe. They remind me of the New York Diners where you could order from a variety of entrees throughout the day. It comes as zero surprise that after hanging out in Sambalatte across the street, that in the last few weeks I'd spend time in the Sun Coast with a dinner in it's Cafe Siena.   This review is breaks down the two dining experiences I recently had Cafe Siena. It discusses the chicken parmesan and shrimp chow fun dining experiences. The chicken parmesan dining experience :    The two times I dined here, this large Cafe was relatively empty. It was unexpected considering that the Sun Coast T.G.I. Friday's is out of business. The hostess led me to the room to the right near the counter seating. There were so many entrees to choose from. What I really appreciate about the old school casino cafe is that the meal includes either a soup or salad. When I looked at the menu, I was impressed with the prices. This is where the old school casino prices meet Summerlin. There are your daily specials and just inexpensive pricing in general. But to me it was a no brainer. For $9.99, I was going for the chicken parmesan with spaghetti. What is interesting is that this is one of the few restaurants that I know of where spaghetti with meatballs and chicken parmesan are the exact price. Bottomless cola added $2.50 to the price. Up to the time that I ordered coffee, my waiter Greg was on the eight ball. The soup was good. The chicken parmesan was also good. My complaint is that half the plate was green beans and garlic toast filler. But, It was a large plate. The chicken parmesan over spaghetti was worth the $9.99. Toward the end of the meal there were some minor flaws with the service where I'd have to wait on the check. I'd appreciate Cafe Siena enough to return a couple of weeks later. The shrimp chow fun dining experience :   Cafe Siena has an impressive Chinese restaurant menu. It is my understanding that they have a separate Chinese restaurant kitchen. Their Chinese restaurant specials really are a good deal for $8.49. They include an entree, soup, egg roll, fried rice, and crunchy noodles with three sauces. I ordered shrimp chow fun with bottomless Coke. The meal started off with skinny crunchy noodles. Dipped in hot mustard and duck sauce, they were a tasty prelude to a good dinner. The hot and sour soup agreed with my taste buds. The shrimp chow fun transported my taste buds from Summerlin to the summits of the Red Rock Mountains. The bites interspersed with soft noodles, shrimp, scallions, and tasty sauce lifted my taste buds up where they belong. After the dinner, I ordered coffee. Cafe Siena serves coffee in one of those kettles where you pour it yourself. With coffee and cola added to the entree, it was worth around $15.Future check-in status:   If I were to rate my chances of returning here on a scale of 1 to 5, it would be a 4. Chances are that I will be near the Sun Coast in the future. In my opinion it is better than the Grand Cafe in Red Rock Resort. I have my mind set on trying either their spaghetti with meatballs, meatloaf, or shrimp udon. Come to think of it, with all these choices maybe on a scale of 1 to 5, I'll rate it 4 stars on returning here a few more times.

Review Text :
This is authentic Cuban! We were thrilled to find this place. The tastes took us right back to our childhood kitchen in Miami where our abuela cooked. The croquetas came out piping hot. The to stones were great. I had the masitas de puerco and they were great too. I asked for lime just because that was how we ate them growing up, with lots of lime. The boiled yuca was good, could have used a bit more mojo. My kids had a pan con bistec. It was the thin steak cooked just as it should, i am just not sure it was on real cuban bread. It comes with mayo and mustard so we opted to have it without. They ate it all though and really liked it. The Cuban coffee (espresso) was very authentic, the way they make it on calle ocho. We look forward to returning. So glad to find this place!Returning to A Piece of Havana to meet a friend for dinner, still an outstanding restaurant.I opted for one of their skirt steak dinners, which arrived accompanied by a few plantains and two scoops of very tasty rice. Not a huge meal, but a decent portion. The steak was cooked perfectly, though the steak knife was appreciated. It was melt-in-your-mouth though not cut-with-a-fork. Great flavor with some spices but also the taste of the grill.Service is excellent at keeping drinks refilled, clearing dirty dishes and generally staying on top of things without being annoying.As we were leaving, the live music was getting set up. I understand that they also do some salsa dancing here. This place would be a perfect date night.

Went here with a couple of business associates for dinner. While the wait staff was 18ish, flirty, and gorgeous, the food service was very slow. On a Monday night with place about 25% full, it took over thirty minutes for three burgers to arrive.I ordered the Kobe beef burger. It's $40 - for just a burger. If I'm paying that much for a burger, I want it RARE!! I want to taste what I'm paying for: Kobe beef.When ordering I asked for Rare. The response: "I'm sorry sir, we serve them all the same way." Ah, good! I thought. A proprietor who insists the burgers are cooked properly. I assumed it would be rare as that is universally recognized by most any foodie as most delicious.What she didn't say was "all the same way" meant EVERYTHING IS WELL DONE!!!  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!What a crying shame. To take delicious Kobe beef, grind it for a burger and cook it until it's a dried out hockey puck.Kobe Beef is bred for the FAT! The beef are massaged by hand and fed beer daily to increase the FAT. When the beef is cooked, the reason it tastes so good is because of the marbled FAT.Cooking Kobe beef well done melts all the fat, which makes it taste like supermarket chuck. There is no difference. This is a crime and I am dismayed - to put it mildly.For a well done burger, it was passable, but I hate well done. I don't know if it's a Canadian thing. The Canadian we were with flipped when I said I liked rare - going on about e. coli bacteria risk. Escherichia coli (e. coli) is a fancy word for shit. In mass beef processing plants which make ground beef by the ton, it occasionally happens that a (filled) cow intestine gets sucked in the machine and shit gets all over meat - e. coli galore.But - if it's really Kobe beef, that means it's ground in the restaurant kitchen from Kobe beef steak. That means there is little chance of cow shit getting in the mix.For $40 and Kobe beef, I damn well expect a restaurant to be confident cow shit won't get in their meat and can cook it to order - rather than playing it safe and sterilizing my burger.Fucktards.

Review Text :
Oy, Postino's. I wanted to smite you, because you took Kat's Deli away from me. I wanted to spit on you. I wanted to thumb my chin at you. I wanted to rattle my bobbles in your general direction. But, tonight, you made a lover of me in you. For shame, you bad bad boy. I met up with three other people tonight for a casual dinner; I brought the light rail because I imbibed in an absinthe gin martini at home while starting a cross word puzzle. When I arrived, I was greeted by my diner companions and a row of bruschetta. Both were lovely, but the latter were more filling. Since my late arrival, I'm not certain exactly what was ordered: there was one with bacon, one with tomatoes, one with goat cheese, one with prosciutto, among other. I macked them down double time, they were that good. But, I rather filled me up, so I wasn't able to finish my roast beef panini. Oh well, lunch for the following day isn't such a bad thing. All the food was wonderfully delicious. Postino also has a pleasant wine list and some great beers on tap (I had the Kronenbough 1664). As for the washrooms, I liked them. The sliding door made me feel butch, like I was tough enough to drag a large piece of frosted glass across the floor. Loved that they stamped their toilet paper with their name and the logos, but wouldn't want to be the first to wipe with that portion. I understand the neighbors in the Medlock District have issues with the street parking. Hey, I totally understand your concerns. But, having a jewel like Postino in your 'hood makes up for the inconvenience of losing your street parking. Being a reasonable walk from the light rail, I see this as a place I'll likely frequent.The original Postino Winecafe is a regular stop in my rotation of fave places... I love it both for lunch and dinner.  So, although it's a little further away, I just had to go try the new Postino, and I finally made my way there for lunch last week...Sure, the valet parking situation sucks (that's my one pet peeve with this place and I knew about it going in), but get over that and you'll have a delightful experience at Postino Central no matter what time of day you're there...The restaurant is brand new and beautiful - a clean, fun, welcoming atmosphere - just like the Arcadia location.  Service is friendly, iced tea and of course it's the same delicious food as the original location too.  During my recent lunch, I went with the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and added turkey to it too).  Yum!  It's delicious - I could eat that again and again and not get sick of it.  I also love their bruschetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of unique selections).While the Arcadia Postino is closer to home, I have no problem driving the extra couple of miles to go to the new central location.  (Either way, I'm a happy camper.)  I'm just excited that Phoenix now has double the pleasure (double the fun) of having two Postinos to choose from!As much as I love the original Postino, this one is equally amazing, if not a little better.The bartenders here are really sweet, and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave.  For the record...I slur my speech after a few glasses of wine, I wasn't really that drunk.They still have the amazing wine selection, absolutely delicious bruschetta (get the tomato jam and goat cheese, heavenly!), and great soups and salads.  And of course the paninis are a godsend.Though this one is a little farther, I think I will frequent it more often because of the bigger space and bigger bar.It figures two days after I finally write a review for Postino they start serving brunch. Brunch and Postino. Two of my favorite things. When I got the email that they were starting to serve brunch I had to try it out. (Not to mention it was the perfect day to sit on a patio and drink mimosas). I tried the fritatta, which more closely resembled a Spanish tortilla, and it was good. (Not as good as the tortilla Espanola at Sol y Sombra....sniff, sniff). My husband had the country toast, which was kind of like an open face Monte Cristo, except minus the French toast part. A classy Moons Over My Hammy , if you will. It was also good, although I wish that there was an egg on each piece of bread. The other brunch offerings include French toast, BELT (Bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato), a salmon dish (not quite a bagel and lox) as well as other egg dishes. They offer a few sides and starters- the walnut toast was fantastic. Walnut bread with brie and preserves? Yes please. In addition they also offer a huge pot of French press coffee, which my husband really liked. (It is Lola coffee). They have also recently expanded the patio, which I didn't notice on my last visit a few weeks ago since I was seated inside. It now has more seating space and a nice fireplace. (Which was going when we were there for brunch, a nice touch but completely unnecessary, it was quite warm). I am confident that Postino's brunch will make its way into our regular brunch rotation.Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!I'd say its pretty safe to say that I freakin' love this place. Came here with my man-friend the other day for lunch, and my only complaint is that they don't serve the brunch menu on the weekdays... Something to look forward to on the weekends though, because it is goddamn delicious. Not only is this place great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or HH.. its also got a decent selection of wines for sale, AND wine on tap.. are you kidding me? Love it.To accompany our Mimosas, because it was a champagne kind of day, we shared the prosciutto & brie panini along with their famous bruschetta  - you get to choose 4 kinds per order so we did the brie & apple with cheese spread, prosciutto with figs & marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto and the roasted pepper with goat cheese.. ahhhmazinzazing! All of them. F-ing mouthwateringly delicious. Certainly try a few if you happen to visit. Their drink deals are ridiculous.. $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer from 11-5pm, Monday and Tuesday its $20 for a bottle of wine and plate of bruschetta , and you get $9 off any bottle if you take it to go. They have a a groovy back patio that is wonderful for anytime of year since they bust out the heat lamps, 1 per table it seemed, plenty of parking and pristine bathrooms. I like the minimalistic decor.. and the fact that it was very light and airy.. literally the place was packed about 15 minutes after we sat down, and I never felt claustrophobic like I do so very often. Everything about this place makes me smile. Its just GOOD. Go here as soon as you can, I promise you wont regret it.OMG! Postino's went above and beyond for me on my birthday and I cannot even begin to thank them enough. See they do not take reservations on Sunday's because it gets crazy busy with their brunch and it is just a very popular day. Plus rain was in the forecast for Sunday which was going to make space even tighter. However I called up Postino's on Saturday and spoke with Troy # 1 and told him that I was coming on Sunday with about 20+ people and asked if there was anyway he could help me out. Hmm he says, let me get your number and I will call you back when I can figure out something. So about an hour later he calls to let me know that he can't reserve a table for 20 but that he can can hold at 4 top for me and as my party comes, we can seat them as needed and as long as their is not a wait. Deal!!!! So Sunday arrives, I go to Postino's and Troy # 2 lets me know that Troy#1 told him about me and my situation and that he was there to take care of me. :) YAY! so we were seated at our 4 top, and soon after, we were able to take over another table, then another, until we took over the entire back booth area as well as one 4 top that was close by. There was a couple, Sandy and Mike, that was sitting in the back booth who were so very sweet. We pretty much took over their area to the point that by the time they got ready to leave, they had gone from sitting in the middle of the booth to the very end of the booth. My friend Deb bought them each a glass of wine because they were so very generous and just all around great people. Now everyone told me how fabulous their bruschetta was and they were right. I only had a few pieces because I wanted to I talked to everyone and make sure that they were having a good time. But I will be back to enjoy an entire board by myself. Ok maybe not by myself but still, it was damn good. The wine I was drinking was also excellent as well. Hats off to my friend Deb for picking a fabulous red for me. You are the best. Special thanks also goes out to our server TJ who rocked it for us all afternoon. He made sure everyone was taken care of when it came to food, drinks, etc. Thank you TJ!!! I truly enjoyed myself and I will be back again VERY soon. Thank you again to the entire staff at Postino's on Central for making my 35th birthday extra special.Call me a cab bitches! It's official! Postino Central is my absolute favorite day drinking spot. I'm in love with all things vino. Some of you know this intimately. (some of you meaning anyone who's ever read any of my reviews) More importantly, I love $5 wine by the glass. Mostly because it ensures that I'm a fairly cheap date, but also because I like to try new things, so even if I hate it...hey, it was only 5 bucks.  The place isn't teaming with douchebags, which is fantastic. I think it's a prerequisite that you be easy on the eyes to work there...equally fantastic for both boys and girls, though it seems to be a predominately male crew...so, like I said...The atmosphere is solid. Bright, with an open airy feeling even if you aren't sitting on the patio. There is a Circle K conveniently located across the street, you know, in case you (or someone who shall remain nameless to protect his pretty dignity) are in dire need of a couple of Vitamin Waters and a gigantic box of Sugar Babies because it seems like a REALLY good idea after 3 pitchers of Odell's... until you start looking like a dog chewing peanut butter because you can't get them out of your teeth!!...Fuck!! There goes a filling..but that's a story for another time.The food is quite tasty and I'm a huge fan of Bruschetta. My favorites including the Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Salami with Pesto and my all time favorite, Tomato Jam with fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese. It sounds a little suspect but I promise you won't regret it.I've enjoyed every Panini I've tried with favorites being Prosciutto with Brie and Autostrada (my soppresatta mistress continues to haunt me) *sigh*I was forced into sharing dessert once, it was some chocolate cake extravaganza that was insanely good, though I don't remember the name. Good wine, good tunes, great atmosphere and delicious food + excellent company and slurred speech = good times had by all!Cheers!I went to @PostinoCentral for lunch today. cc: @PostinoWineCafe (How interesting that they don't even use the twitter for this location)I won't be going back any time soon. I am required to give at least one star. The second star was because the food was actually very good.You most definitely did not earn two stars.When I come to your establishment, it is not your place to determine that my not ordering something gives you license to treat me and my party like shit.Water was spilled on one of our group by one of the servers, and no offer was made to get a napkin, or help clean it up.Our actual server, who was adorned with diamond studs in her chest, gave the very distinct impression that everything she was doing for us was a chore.At the end of the meal, when I asked her to separate the checks, she nearly had a conniption. Excuse me for asking you to do your job, and not make assumptions about me or my party, simply because we aren't all falling over ourselves to buy each other's meal.I had the Nine Iron panini. It was pretty tasty. I had it with the salad, which was also delicious.Neither, individually or collectively, could have been good enough to overcome the deplorable treatment we received.Perhaps the fact that I wear a cowboy hat and boots is what gave the waitress the idea she had license to be an unreasonable bitch.Perhaps it's that we (our group) doesn't fit the wine-snob, or urban hipster stereotype.Regardless, you lost a potential regular. Nicely done.Wow. I can't believe I waited this long to check out Postino's. I mean what is wrong with me? It's like why did Liza wait so long to divorce her gay ass husband? Or why did it take so long KFC to come up with grilled chicken? Or why, why did it take so long for The Ghost Whisperer to be canceled? I ask you. Why? WHYYYY!!Putting that aside I have to say I was UBER impressed with Postino's on every level. I triple love the bar opening up to the intimate patio, the charming, airy and open dining room with the fireplace and cozy vintage sofas. Love it. Now let's talk BRUSCHETTA 101! OK. They have nailed it. Nailed it like Levi Johnston nailed Bristol Palin! My faves were the brie and apple and the ricotta with pistachios and dates. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the edge with a soft middle. Kind of like my Uncle Larry but don't tell him I said that. We over ordered because we definitely didn't each need our own sandwich. The Niner (I think that's the name) was gigantic and served on delicious focaccia bread...crispy bacon, juicy chicken...so so good. Side salad was, um, interesting. While I appreciate the pine nuts and the cheese I just wasn't feeling the dressing. Kind of sour. Not to worry. Nothing could spoil this fabulous foodie rampage. Service, at first a tad slow...was friendly and efficient. It won't take me long to return to you Postino's. I want to be a regular so that when I walk in everyone yells THOMAS!!!Really........FOUR stars on the previous review Kristi....realllllllllyyyy?The food and drink, as always, is on point. Occasionally, they make small changes to the bruschetta menu which I enjoy because hey, who doesn't like to try something new when you're pretty confident it's going to be AMAZING! Helloooo Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes!!There is some kind of crazy love vortex (minus the twisted trees) surrounding this Postino location. Seriously, everyone else disappears. Don't plan a date here unless you are prepared to eventually propose or accept said proposal. Don't say I didn't warn you.this place is my new jam! i can't get enough! we sat on the charming patio near the fire place and the patio warmers. it was so cozy cute back there! it felt like i was somewhere else, like a vacation. we did the bottle of the moscato d'asti. my friend wanted a pinot but i was so excited when I saw that they had my fav moscato that she let me order that for us.  what a great friend i have! for the bruschetta we tried these (rated orgasmic to just tasty):1. prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone- so good i bought the ingredients and made it for myself the next day. 2. tomato jam and sheeps milk cheese- the cheese was nice and salty and the jam was sweet. perfect harmony. 3. salami with pesto- this was good, i might not order it again but i might. i wasn't the biggest fan of the salami they used but it was good. 4. white bean with chopped tomato- this one was good but tasted like traditional bruschetta and we were looking for the funky. so probably won't order this one again unless i'm in the mood for traditional bruschetta. we also ordered the autostrada panini to split but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. we wound up taking that home. it was quite tasty.the only issue we had was when the bill came. they charged everything a la carte and forgot to apply the tuesday special ($20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta)  but they more than made up for it. they felt so bad, fixed it right away and comped our sandwich. love this place.Ok I love the food here, but the service does need some work.  Maybe I went on an off night, but the service was terrible.  We chose the outdoor seating, it was after 930 on a Saturday, and I noted the lower amount of staff.  I can say a lower amount of customers as well however.So my review is totally based on service, I would give it a 2 star, but the food is that good that I would come back; to Arcadia next time, since I still have the sour taste from poor service from this location.  The waitress did give me a box to take home what I did not eat, took my card to ring me up and never came back.  We finished our pitcher of beer, then we finished our waters and finally I could not wait another 10 minutes.  We waited 10 minutes after the waitress picked up the check and card.  When I got up and asked for my check, they handed me someone else's tab???Then I explained that they had my bill and card already??  So looking down and the table it was under all the these other tabs, like a disorganized table of bills and little clip boards?  Wow, even another employee asked my waitress if she helped another table yet at this point.  I could see the worry in his face.... To sum it up a customer should never have to get up and go look for a credit card after 10 minutes.  I was never rang up and basically my table was forgotten.  Maybe the waitress thought I was enjoying the outdoor seating at 11:30 at night, but at the end of the day I am not looking for an explanation.  I can only tell you that it has been a long time since I have received such poor service from a restaurant.  Next time I visit Arizona I am steering clear of this location for sure.  I might have to drive to Arcadia just to have a great experience of food and service.Postino, I love you.  I love absolutely everything about you.  My biggest concern is the anxiety I get when it comes time to order.  There are SO many things on the menu that I love, and I'm trying to maintain a girlish figure, so I can't order everything.  My absolute favorite lunch is the prosciutto/fig/brie sandwich on ciabatta with the mixed greens salad.  The fried shallots, pear, candied nuts, and grapes make it an unforgettable dish, and the salty-sweet combo in the sandwich is perfection.  Their lemonade is the best in town, and it is a steal when you factor in the free refills.  Of course, their wine list is extensive and amazing... but I just can't seem to give up my lemonade! The service is always good.  Unobtrusive, knowledgeable, and friendly... plus a little hipster (but not TOO much).  It is always on my most-recommended list to friends and visitors.  Their consistency and quality are always spot-on.  If you haven't been, then get yourself there pronto!I've eaten bruschetta all my life, but never had it in a form of a sampler.. pure genius!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/postino-central-phoenix?select=btNMXTdz7xbOOz2Ua7LCOQ#TIZbK4zS95CMvoIvyp0bFA1. brie & apples with fig spread2. smoked salmon & pesto3. prosciutto, figs, and mascarpone cheese4. burrata (love), bacon, tomatoAll this, cut into smaller bite sizes, and $14; a steal. The concept of bite-sized bread+toppings remind me of Fig & Olive in LA. But, I do think that Postino's just tastes better.We also got the Butcher plate with different meats, cheese, hummus, and olives. And the raspberry chicken salad. It was all very good.JY got the cucumber honey lemonade - SO refreshing and has a strong cucumber flavorI got a glass of Malbec. $11 for a mini carafe and it was great.Probably one of the best things I ate in Arizona!I had early dinner (5pm) here today with my parents, and we had such a good time!Parking wasn't a problem at 5 and also not a problem when we left around 6:40pm on a Thursday night. While the inside tables were full as we were leaving, the outside seating was very much available.The waitress who served us throughout the night was a sweet lady who called me and even my dad "honey."The brushetta ($14) was delicious - esp. the brie and apple, bacon & arugula. The tomato, basil & mozzarella was okay, but not stellar. My parents and I all had the split two ($10). The salads are pretty similar. My mom couldn't really tell them apart.The prosciutto with brie was great as was the soup of the moment (kale & sausage). After dinner, we shared a creme brulee ($7) that was not overly sweet - it was just right! The ambience of the restaurant was amazing - as the sun went down, servers placed candles on each table.Cons:1. No reservations (only for 8 ppl and larger)

Restaurant name  Primanti Bros

Review Text :
I feel silly even having to review Primanti Brothers.  Come on - this legendary landmark (even though it has several locations, each are a landmark in my opinion) speaks for itself.  I almost always order the Capicola and cheese.  If I've had a few drinks, and it is past midnight and I find my way to Primanti Brothers I usually will order it with an egg on it.  But the older I get I find myself there at much more reasonable times!They claim that they are "Almost Famous".  I'm here to say that Primanti Brothers IS FAMOUS.  I mean, come on, Sophia Vegara just tweeted a photo of her Primanti's sandwich to her million + followers.  Primanti's has been on the Food Network God knows how many times.  Drop the "Almost", Primanti's, because you Are Famous.The original location is in the Strip District but you can find one almost everywhere now.  Oakland and the South Side are probably closest to the "authentic Primanti's" atmosphere other than the original location, while the newer franchised Primanti's in locations like Monroeville or Harmar are much more of a restaurant type experience.  I like my floors greasy and my sandwich with fries and slaw.

Restaurant name  Gallo Blanco

Review Text :
I'm excited to be the first REAL review of this place.  We decided to stop by here in favor of Postino, as we have already been multiple times, and boy am I glad we did.  This is like the 4th or 5th, or maybe 12th different restaurant inside the ever-so-lovely Clarendon Hotel.  In what seems to be a revolving door of restaurant concepts in this rather charming space, I think we have finally found a winner.Gallo Blanco does something that not enough restaurants do.  They downsize their menu drastically to have only a few different options for lunch/dinner, and a few options for breakfast, plus a few assorted appetizers.  I much prefer a restaurant to have a few things on the menu that they perfect rather than a whole bunch of items that are only so-so.  The dinner menu offers a few entrees including steak and chicken and then there are tortas or tacos with your choice of delectable meat stuffed inside.  The husband and I ordered the cheese crisp (not what you think) and the pork sandwiches.  I would give the Spanish names, but I've got nothing for ya.  The cheese crisp was a fantastic giant fried concoction.  It seems like it was a large tortilla, or something, covered in cheese and deep fried wrapped around something round.  It was really good, I can't describe it much better, just get it if you go.  The pork tortas were so delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  it was mixed with some shredded lettuce, a couple slices of fresh avocado, and there was a delightfully tangy/spicy sauce underneath.  The bread was unbelievably tasty, slightly sweet with a perfect texture.  I was excited to actually have a true torta bun instead of your average run of the mill hamburger bun.  We decided to split the chocolate pudding for dessert.  It was served in a small tumbler.  The chocolate pudding wasn't a traditional pudding and was much thinner.  However, it went perfectly with the graham crackers and the truly homemade marshmallow fluff.  The marshmallow stuff was soooooo good and you can taste the quality.  A tasty yet simple dessert.What a great experience!  I only took away one star because the restaurant was far from busy but the wait for food was a little too long to be deemed acceptable.  However, our server was so sweet and charming, and her English accent was almost unbearably adorable.  It was her first day on the job but she was phenomenal.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and I hope we finally have a permanent resident in the Clarendon restaurant space.I am a woman that likes lime in her Mexican Beer. I mean, a LOT of lime. Gallo - you scratch me where I itch! They fresh squeeze lime juice and when mixed with your tecate, you are in heaven!Aside from the best beer in town, they also have amazing fresh squeezed watermelon & lime juice and iced coffee. The best news of all is that the iced coffee is $1.25 and I heard they order from Cartel in Tempe!I have been to Gallo twice now. The first time I tried the veggie tacos and took a bite of the veggie torta. Both were seriously to die for. Over the weekend I had the huevos rancheros for brunch, and those too were out of this world! They also have a tomatillo sauce that is super good. Not only is the food and drink amazing, but the prices are awesome too! I had breakfast, iced coffee and two beers for $17.  (I did hear over the weekend that they will be raising their prices soon, which sucks, but I would be fine paying more because the quality certainly justifies it!!)Even better news, you can get all of this POOL SIDE at the Clarendon pool! Ummm... you really cannot go wrong!I have no complaints about the service. The menu is small but varied, so as a hotel guest I feel like you could eat there a few times during your trip without feeling worn out of the taste.I am super stoked that Gallo is now in Clarendon, because I will spend my weekends delighting in that delicious Tecate while I munch on some $2 veggie tacos poolside!Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.I am going to hold back a star because I didn't get to take pictures off the rooftop.  A private party, with really obnoxious karaoke  singers, had booked the rooftop lounge.I was there for PFN and had drug my neighbor, Cindy Y., along.  I chose Hefeweizen and she was drinking the regular margaritas. To eat I had one each: pork taco, fish taco and carne asada taco.  All were good.  I thought the carne asada taco had more of a of a pineapple taste than I was expecting.  Cindy had a pork taco, fish taco and grilled corn on the cob which comes with parmesan and some other stuff on it.  Nathan S. who sat with us to eat had a pork torta that he was quite pleased with.  We both enjoyed everything and the prices were quite reasonable. In addition to the traditional restaurant and bar areas you can choose to sit out by the pool which is a large enough area to accommodate a couple of reasonable sized groups at the same time and still allow for mingling.  I would suggest maybe doubling the number of chairs and tables though.  They have a server assigned to the pool area or you can go inside to order.For a restaurant to make it in a small hotel in Arizona they have to have enough draw to bring local folks in during those months that are slow in the hotel business.  So far these folks seem to be off to a good start.I took my shop car rather than get to yet another downtown venue where parking my truck would be a hassle.  I needn't have worried, there was plenty of easy access parking in the lot and on the street.Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!Ok let me start off by saying I have eaten at the clarendon kitchen before it was thankfully demolished. My gf got such bad food poisoning she was barfing in a Harkins Loyelty cup on the freeway, because she couldnt make it to pull over. After emtying it several times out the window to refill it, she had a cold sweat for the rest of the night.I think she lost like 4 lbs and she is super tiny to begin with so by the next day she was skeletor... So naturally I was jealous, not really, but kinda.. no I kid, but seriously... So enough background on the horror this spot was. At first we were leary but when we arrived it was completely open and gutted, you could see the kitchen which for a germy like me that is a beautiful thing. The menu is small and slightly hard to read at first. We ordered the guacamole before I realized it was 7 bucks. When we got it it looked like the chunks would be too big for my gf liking (because I micro manage how she eats) after one bite this shit was definatly the best guac Ive had, for real. I heard about the mandarines which I actually hate, so I was a skeptic.. no it was delicious. I got beef tacos which were melt in your mouth. the veggie was pretty good but had mushrooms, I fucking hate mushrooms. Those sick ass little horse pissed on poop bi products. Aside from the mushrooms it was very tasty, i would get them again minus the poopy shrooms. Oh the best part is they serve the coke in a can and its a buck... finally someone gets that its a joke to charge 2.50 for a fucking soda.Awesome job, Ill be coming back to try some breakfast or hang out and try that beer you doctor up. If you ever ate at clarendon kitchen , dont be scared its nothing like that nightmare !!!!"It's like a jungle sometimes, It makes me wonder, How I keep from going under..."hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacosbut alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.I live across the street from Gallo Blanco and yoouuuu don't...na na na na na naaaaa! So I've yelped the delicious tacos and creamy, lumpy, salty beans and even the mango beverage I had last month that I wanted to swim in...and now I have to say I would sell my mother to the North Korean's (I hear they have two openings for hard labor camp) for the AMAZING corn on the cob and the chocolate pudding. Every time I eat the chocolate pudding, and let's not fool ourselves my yelpitas, it has been several, several times, I conjure up a particular scene from the American Pie movie. Nuff said.I really enjoy Gallo Blanco, whether it's for brunch or lunch/dinner.Is it a perfect experience? No way... not by any means. But it is a much better effort than what we all had to endure with C4 , Clarendon Kitchen, etc... Nothing seemed to stick.I will say I did not enjoy being dropped on by condensation from an AC unit a few weeks ago, but that is neither here nor there, because of our large party, and because I did not formally complain to the server/management.Every other experience has been how I like it. Servers seem a little new and lacking confidence so far. But overall, I like it. The food is decent. Not excellent, but done pretty well -- everything from the elotes to the guacamole.I especially enjoy the brunch and the value of it. Are you really serious? $5 brunch with chorizo egg and refried beans, done just right?!  Breakfast and dinner tortas served on soft bolillos are done decently here, although the crust could be a little more tough.Tacos are priced just right, cooked well and are worth the $2.50 each! Can't decide if I like the fish or the carnitas better. Anyhow, decide for yourself.Today was my first time here.  Yes, I know, I am a Big AL(big-ass loser.  You'd know this if you've ever taught middle/high school).  Anyway, I was meeting up with Tony, aka Lightrailblog for a late lunch.  I knew I wanted the elote.  I've been hearing everyone scream about the damn elote for months.  I started out with an iced tea (I am an iced tea FREAK!) that was flavored - I think mango.  Then I got an Arnold Palmer.  This was the BEST AP I've EVER had!  (Sorry, FEZ!)  It was made with freshly-squeezed lemonade and was plenty tart.  I also had huevos ranchers.  I like that they asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.  Server, Steven ("Esteban") was awesome...as soon as he figured out that everything I said was a joke. I mean, come on, am I *really* gonna put my ice cubes on your nipples?  Well, not in public, and not until you buy me dinner.  HA!Downfall:  THE FLIES!!!!  There were at least 4 flying around our table.  *shudder*so, i finally had my experience. the best food, i have eaten, thus far in my life. i literally couldnt even handle the amazingness of the cochinita. it was, well, amazing.while eating the elote i kept saying shut up. but no one was talking? thats how good it was. my friend asked if it was for real.  both of our faces were covered in corn juice and our teeth full of corn bits. oh, yes, it is for real. the service was awesome too. our waiter was so great. he let me 'taste' the agua frescas. ummm YUM! we ordered the chips and salsa too- the bomb dot com for sure. i need to go like everyday. and i will. jk i wont but i'll think about it daily.Call me a hater, but you all are brainwashed. Edit: changed my review to two stars to be a little more fair.I will start off by saying this is by far the best restaurant the Clarendon has had yet, though that isn't saying much considering their track record. The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You can't tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins, and they don't have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know "were here for dinner......"After being seated, our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo, a drink made with jalapeno, tequila, lime, and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious, but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. I'm a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything, but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding??? I ordered three tacos, and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita, which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also don't used tough, chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You don't put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality, but fell flat on it's face when it came to flavor, of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well, which also was covered in guacamole. You can't just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican, unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my "guacos" (not tacos) begrudgingly. My girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average, but I'd have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this, and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish you've managed to butcher, after the cochinita pibil. I won't even start on the rice, which was not cooked properly, was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED, and was borderline cold. Service here is good enough, but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about, all the way to the end when she asked why we didn't finish the guacamole and couldn't understand why we weren't licking the bowl, she just flat out was off. The meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be "cute" and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it, and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on it's own in the real world (outside it's "I'm to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me" atmosphere) it would fall flat on it's face, just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up.Alas! A meal at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that made me say 'wow'. Despite being led astray by MapQuest and getting lost for about twenty minutes on our way there we eventually stopped at a gas station and asked for directions which led us to the promised land. It was a fun detour though, while asking for directions we got to witness a senile homeless man get into a heated argument with a gas pump; which is always a lot of fun.First impressions are always a big thing, and Gallo Blanco made a pretty good one. Not knowing what type of place it was, we were quite surprised and excited when we turned the corner and saw a sheik and new age restaurant occupying the bottom floor of the Clarendon hotel. It looked swanky and fun... and honestly I was expecting something a little rougher around the edges; what a nice surprise. Upon walking into the restaurant we were a little confused about where exactly the entrance was, so we found ourselves standing around looking like lost children... luckily one of the managers immediately noticed us and personally helped us out and sat us down pretty quickly... really nice guy. Right when we sat down, they instantly plopped a pretty heavenly looking basket of chips with a plate of three different salsas on our table, I pretty much instantly fell in love. The chips were fresh as can be; they looked and tasted like they had just been freshly made minutes ago, which I wouldn't be surprised if they were. For our main course we got a little random smattering of stuff. Started out with the quesadilla then the roasted corn (it had some special name but I don't remember what it was) then for our main dish; three different types of tacos (beef, tuna, and pork) and huevos rancheros. Everything was amazing... just melt in your mouth good. The roasted corn which was rolled in some sort of cheese and hot sauce was just amazing; possibly the best roasted corn I've ever had. Even the dessert we ordered (banana crepes) was spectacular. Gourmet Mexican is not something I'm accustomed to... but that's the best way I can describe this place. The great thing about it, is that it's very reasonable... they sell many of the menu items a la carte; for example the quesadilla and most of our tacos were 2 bucks a piece... hell yeah! You get a lot of flavor and atmosphere for a really reasonable price, and I just can't justify giving this place anything less than 5 stars. Can't wait to go back!This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called "Picoso".Coda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual "interesting" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.This drink they call "Picoso" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word "memorable" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway.Living in a town known throughout the US of A for having decent Mexican food, and loving to eat as much as I do, you would think that I'd have pretty much hit all the high spots by now, wouldn't you?I guess not!I had not been to Gallo Blanco until yesterday for a lunch meeting.It's a long way from Old Town, and while I still have the reflexes of a cat (well, an older cat, anyway), some of the drivers I see in my cross-town jaunts just make me want to curl up in my sock drawer and weep for days!So I avoid the drive...no sense in letting the Beautiful Carin collect on my life insurance just yet:)When I got there and saw the place, I thought, "well Donald, here we go...another over-hyped joint...don't get your hopes up."But I tried to keep an open mind as my buddy ordered for us...Cochinita, Carne Asada and Tilapia Taco's that came in a little corrugated steel rack along with a couple of squeeze bottles of salsa (green and orange).Precious!I grabbed a pork taco...squeezed a little of the orange stuff on it and took a bite...and the angels sighed!Smack my ass and call me Pepe'...go ahead...I know you want to!I could not believe how delightful these tasty little morsels were...I mean stunningly good...all of them...including the Tilapia...so very, astonishingly good!And I couldn't believe that I hadn't been here before (which is why you can smack me on the ass and call me Pepe')...but I won't be away from here for long.My friend and I polished off  1/2 dozen taco's and then decided that we needed dessert...so we each ordered a Torta (a Naco and a Cochinita), and then split them so we each had  1/2...so very good!Not many people would suspect this about me, but I am something of a contrarian...perhaps even a little bit cantankerous...esp. about places that don't live up to the hyperbole.And then I write snarky reviews!But I can't get snarky about Gallo Blanco...GB delivers on all the promises!The menu is clever and innovative, deftly executed with ingredients that are clearly top drawer!The service we received at lunch was prompt and pleasant without being cloying.The décor and atmosphere are pleasant and inviting.But the real star of the show here is the food...or maybe I should say "the 5 stars"...Oh, I think I may have had better tacos, or torta's, but I can't for the life of me remember when or where it was!It takes a lot to get me out of Old Town on a regular basis (Honest to frikkin' God, the way some people drive, I'm astonished there aren't 50 fatalities a day in PHX!) but GB makes taking my life in my hands seem worth it.A new regular in the rotation...if I lived across the street like Thomas does, I think I'd eat my normal 7 meals a day here!gallo blanco makes me a saaaaaaaaaaaaaad panda. seriously whats up, dude? the service lately has been pretty crappy. way disappointed. i keep hoping it's an off night but that's turned into a pattern so i can't excuse it any longer. the food is still good, but it takes forever. and the worst part, the last two times i ordered cochinita tacos they were dry and one was just grissle. what the heck are yall doin back there? i want the old gallo back.Upgrading Gallo Blanco to 5 stars as it is now one of our favorite places to eat downtown.Even after switching to eating vegan, Gallo Blanco still rocks for us! I'd recommend:Chips & guacamole with no cheese (some of THE best guac in town)A couple veggie tacos (these come with no cheese by default)Other options:side of jasmine rice with green tomatillo salsaside of beans with no cheese+ moreBoth their red & green spicy sauces are vegan and delicious (ask for them!!).My previous qualms about their beer selection have been resolved. They have a tasty craft-brewed amber or pale ale on tap almost every time that we visit.As I walked into Gallo Blanco, I felt like I left Arizona in 2010 and entered a big city in 1975 with its incredible retro vibe. Making its home within the Clarendon, Gallo Blanco has quite the reputation in Phoenix, so needless to say I was excited to check it out. The atmosphere at Gallo Blanco is vivacious and packed full of restaurant goers most nights of the week. The bar is intimate as is the seating area. With a modern meets Mexico feel to it, the character begs for you to have a margarita and guacamole the second you sit down. Since it's crowded and not overly large, be prepared to wait if you visit in the evening during prime dinner hours. However, if you are forced to wait, they invite you to wait at the rooftop bar or by the retro pool and they'll call your cell phone when they are ready for you. Now let's move on to the food and drinks. Their margaritas as excellent. Not too sweet and not too thick. I could easily have 1...2...or 6 of them. The guacamole is tangy and tasty. I think I tasted some pineapple chunks in there and the taste had a nice kick to it. As for the entrees, I need to give Gallo Blanco another try. I liked what I had, but it wasn't what I expected. I ordered the honey chicken with tortillas and expected it to be almost fajita style. Instead, it came out as a full half chicken that I had to cut and make my own tortilla. Once I got through cutting through the whole chicken, the marinade and seasoning on the fresh tortillas accompanied by the sauce was quite tasty, but it was the process getting there that makes me want to try something else on the menu. We sat on the patio since it was a busy night, which was nice and quiet. Next time when I try something different in the cuisine department, I'd also like to dine inside as well. All in all, I had a good experience at Gallo and I give the overall evening four stars, but I will need to experience the cuisine there a couple more times to really rate it to a higher extent.Number. One. Fan.Yep, I said it. I'm their number one freaking fan. Where do I start? Location and History: inside the historic Clarendon Hotel. If you don't know the story of Don Bolles -- the Arizona Republic reporter who was murdered by the PHX mafia in the hotel's parking lot -- then acquaint yourself on some crazy PHX background. The hotel has some (rather poorly enlarged, unfortunately) newspaper clippings and photos on this throughout its hallways that lead to the bathroom. Anyway, look up the story, then drop some knowledge on your fellow diners -- they will certainly appreciate the space on a whole new level.Food: Reasonably priced and yum-yum. Tortas, street-style tacos, Mexi brunch, dessert (fresh fruit and crema is light, sweet and perfect end to, say, a giant carna asada burrito), I love it all. I cannot rave enough about their Ejote, or Mexican Grilled Corn. I make everyone I take here try it and have turned them all into addicts. Not to mention, their food is from local farms and much of it is organic...say, what?? For the price, the taste and the guilt-free experience, you simply cannot beat it. I have one note of warning, do NOT get sucked into the curiosity surrounding their Chicharron de Queso (which comes with the quip on their menu: "This is NOT a quesadilla, gringos"). It's basically fried cheese. Sounds so simple and weird that you think Well, it must be more than it sounds, to be on the menu! Nope, it tastes just like the bits of shredded cheese that fall out of your grilled cheese onto the skillet and get half burnt. But everything else I've tried gets a thumbs up. Live entertainment and extras: Flamenco music and dancing demos every Wednesday = awesome. Held inside the lobby (viewable from most seats in the dining room) or on the roof when it's cooler. Sunday cool baby night -- DJs and hipster mingling on the roof, complete with makeshift bar.Odds and Ends: The pool area and roof top. Pool area is fantastic with its brightly colored tile, water wall of glass and cacti. Soothing, beautiful and a great spot for out-of-towners to relax. Not to mention the City of Phoenix logo sculpture, which, as Bonnie G pointed out, is a great spot to snag photos with your visiting friends and family. The roof top area is just perfect -- a great view of the city, tons of comfy padded patio furniture. Between getting to tell newcomers about the cool history, take them up to the roof and introduce them to the Valley's best Ejote, this is my top "hidden gem" in Phoenix. I take my parents here and I take dates here, it's just that versatile and cool.  As such: Number. One. Fan.By far one of my Favorite Restaurants to eat Vegan at. I can't believe I haven't updated my review, the first time I reviewed Gallo I was not even Vegan, it's been a long time. The Veggie Tacos are out of this world, I usually order 5 or 6. They are pretty small in size but not in flavor. Fresh tiny corn tortillas stuffed with a varying mixture of grilled veggies like, onion, red pepper, green beans, mushroom, corn and spinach topped with guacamole and the best part is they are only $2 each WHAT!! That's right only $2 each. It gets better, during Happy Hour which is now 7days a week from 3pm-6pm, My beloved Veggie Tacos are only.......wait for it.........$1 each!! Not to mention the $5 (HH price) made to order Guacamole, loaded with roasted tomatoes, chunks of citrus and spices, (be sure to say No Cheese if you are a Vegan.) It's my professional opinion that this is some of the best Guacamole I've had, try it f you don't believe me.All this talking has got me craving it, I gotta go, See you at Gallo!I live within walking distance from the Clarendon and can't believe I haven't been here yet. Yesterday, my husband lured me into skipping yoga to go get some Mexican food here. We took the family here for Taco Tuesday and during happy hour. We ordered the $5 Chirraron de Queso (cheese cooked into a hard shell)(decent), $5 guacamole (holy hell this was good), $5 white sangria (decent), chips and salsa ($3.5), a kids bean and cheese burrito ($4) that was the side of my 3 year old's head, and 8 mix-n-match tacos (pork, carne asada, shrimp, fish, veggie). For taco Tuesday, they are buy 2 get 1 free, which is the deal we were given, but we would have saved more with the $1 off per taco during HH. I ordered a shrimp taco and pork taco. Both were delicious but the pork taco really tickled my fancy. The pork had that crispy bark on the outside which is my absolute favorite. Call it the Puerto-Rican in me but that is the best. I really enjoyed my meal and the server was great. I know I loved this place when I am trying to talk my husband into going back in a couple of days....***From the pancakes to the breakfast burrito and the chilaquiles, Gallo Blanco serves a good and very reasonably priced breakfast in a warm, casual and friendly atmosphere***Gallo Blanco Cafe & Bar is located in a hotel (Clarendon Hotel).  Hotel restaurants worry me a little.  But once you enter Gallo Blanco, you realize that Gallo Blanco is not your typical hotel restaurant and Clarendon Hotel is definitely not your typical hotel.The Clarendon Hotel seemed to have a funky boutique vibe to it.  The front desk seemed very casual and the little bit we saw of the hotel was fresh, casual and youthful.  There was a lot of interesting looking local art in the hallway and the men's restrooms were outfitted with urinals that were designed to look like open mouths (a Yelper posted a photo of it on Gallo Blanco's page).The Gallo Blanco has a very youthful coffee shop feel to it.  The restaurant is open and bright (big floor-to-ceiling windows).  The restaurant is very straightforward.  Square room.  Not much in terms of decoration (some art here and there).  Bright but not overly strong colors that give it a casual and hip atmosphere.  The seating is very functional too (no frills).  There is also an outdoor patio.We went for breakfast and it was reasonably priced.  Most of their breakfast items were $7 to $10 and the portion sizes were just right (generous enough but not over-the-top-big).We shared the breakfast burrito, which actually was pretty big.  The burrito was a flour tortilla stuffed with chorizo, potatoes, eggs, refried beans, cheddar cheese, and fire roasted salsa.  The burrito was flavorful and had a little bit of spice and kick to it (additional salsa was available on the side).  Everything tasted good and all the ingredients were nicely melted together.  The Chilaquiles Verdes were even better.  The tostadas were light and crispy; they were also flavored quite well with the green chile sauce.  We added some shredded chicken and it was good and tender (and not too dry).  The chilaquiles verdes were topped with some good sunny side up eggs.For something a little sweet, we went with their buttermilk pancakes and they were very good.  The pancakes were light and fluffy.  They also had a great brown color to them.  You get that fresh off the griddle flavor here that you don't get at a lot of pancake places.  The maple syrup was warm, sweet and good.I also had the fresh squeezed orange juice and it was pulpy and tasty.Service started off a little slow, but once we got our order in, the food came out very quickly and the staff was attentive.  The whole staff (from the owner to the hostess to the waitresses) were very friendly and personable, which added to the warm and casual atmosphere.Gallo Blanco Cafe & Bar serves a good Mexican breakfast.  All three of our dishes were good, which makes me curious about their other options.  I do not know when I will be in Phoenix next, but my breakfast was good enough here that I would consider making a return visit (even if I was only in Phoenix for a day or two).Parking is available on the street (free; no meters).Host was nice and the tacos were goodWhen first visiting Gallo Blanco in 2009, I would have definitely given it 3 stars. Service was very spotty and the HH was a lot more limited. Now, after visiting this place countless times for brunch, dinner and HH, I really do think it's an affordable, reliable and delicious destination that makes sense for a lot of different types of social situations - from a meal shared with my grandmother to a spontaneous HH with friends. As many reviewers have mentioned, happy hour is fantastic here, with tacos from $1 - $2.50 and great drink prices. Here are some of my favorite food and drink items (keep in mind that I'm a pescetarian, so meat didn't make it on the list!): *Agua fresca of the day w/ or w/o vodka*Picoso (tequila, pineapple and jalapeno) *Micheladas (make 'em bloody for a great hangover cure)*Bloody Marys (they make them with dill for an unexpected but fresh twist)*Elote (Mexican corn) with cotija cheese and cream *Shrimp tacos (amazing, juicy shrimp) *Chilaquiles (the sauce used to have chicken but they now offer a vegetarian version)*Chopped saladOne other awesome bonus is that the bar will wrap up food to go if you'd like to take up to the roof. Get your drink in a plastic cup and you're all set!Gallo is one of those trendy places to take your date to on a friday night; although I personally was here for luch. We stuck to the tacos, since thats really what I hear all the good things about from them and they did not dissapoint. A bit on the pricey side $3 for a 2 - 3 bite sized taco, if you come on tuesdays I hear they have an all day happy hour. The food was great so I didn't feel too bad spending $25+ on 5 tacos, chips n salsa, and a couple of soft drinks for 2 people. The service was neither amazing nor terrible. I will probably end up here from time to time on tuesdays to get the most ! for my $.I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review.  When I came here a few weeks ago, I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the "too cool to notice you" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer service.Here are the "highlights" of the night:1.  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm.2.  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which was not a problem for us.3.  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore.4.  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity.  Really?!?5.  Menus and water brought to the table.6.  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fiancé, who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order.  During this time, we saw other tables being tended to and waited on.7.  Walked out of the restaurant.  The hostess, servers, and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left. It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fiancé was trying to get someone's attention.  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool, hipster people there that night.  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix.  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life.  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit.People the world over have set aside Sunday as a time to fulfill religious obligations in a church or a temple or whatever. I, too, devote Sunday to a spiritual undertaking of sorts. Brunch: the most important of all Sunday traditions, and Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite houses of worship.I begin my service with a holy communion of mimosas. I reflect on the salvation that the blood of distilled grapes and fresh squeezed flesh of oranges provides to me. Then the divine Huevos Rancheros speaks to me through a chorus of heavenly flavors. The housemade tortillas, perfect blend of cheeses, and spicy tomato sauce brings me to my knees in a prayer of thanksgiving.The saints that staff this wonderful establishment are very helpful and attentive. They are always happy to bring out an additional round of mimosas or to explain any menu item. I will religiously attend brunch at Gallo Blanco because their food is amazing, and the wait is not as bad as other brunch hotspots around downtown.Amen!great happy hour prices. lots of photo ops inside and a great rooftop area for parties.One does not simply walk into Gallo Blanco, the cozy, authentic Mexican restaurant with some twists worth checking out.Learned this the tough way by seating ourselves at the bar...just as we prepared to order some refreshments, we were approached and asked if we had been seated by the hostess."What hostess?"She suddenly appeared at the entrance, where we were promptly unseated...and reseated to the same location in a minute. Please don't make people feel unwelcome. But you didn't come here for my take on the service, you wanna know about the food!I had just a little appetizer, the pork quesadilla. Yay, it was made with a corn tortilla. Yay, the cheese was good. And oh my goodness, the green chile they use is some of the best I've had. Ever. I crave more now. It totally makes up for the pork that was a bit bland. Just the right amount of heat...more than most Mexican places, but not enough to torment spice n00bs. I can already tell their menu has some pretty good stuff.The margarita left a bit to be desired. They're made with Sauza blanco , so I don't understand why they're so stingy with the tequila. The lime pulp at the bottom was a welcome addition, but this drink was too heavy on the sweet, and too easy on the sour. Next time, I'll try the prickly pear...or just go with the (spiked) aguas frescas--the watermelon was freaking delicious!Also, I'd never heard much about this Clarendon Hotel before now. But I've heard there's a roof up here. I don't know if it's part of the bar or not, but it sure would have been groovy, since I was chilling here during the eclipse. I'm honestly intrigued by this place, and will be back.It's hard to say much more after so many people have raved about the place before you, so let's keep it short and sweet. Good food and drink at great prices, served by really gracious staff in a comfortable, casual atmosphere. In a city where good Mexican food is found in abundance, the fare here easily stands above the rest. I'm getting a really strong craving for their tacos and elote  even as I type this review, so I presume there will be yet  another visit to Gallo Blanco real soon.I've been hearing about this place for awhile now and finally tried it out.  The boy and I put our name on the list for the restaurant and decided to venture to the roof top bar while we waited.The pool area is lovely, as is  the lobby.  Neat elevator. Gorgeous view from the roof.  Really nice outdoor bar.  Plus they have Hendricks, so I was set.  The bartenders were super friendly, we had a nice chat and headed back down stairs.We were seated outside and pursed the menus. We shared the chochinita and fish tacos, they were very good.  The boy got the Naco Torta, he enjoyed it.  I had the chilquiles verdes with a side of rice.  The flavors were really good, I just wish there had been more of them.  Easily rectified with a healthy dousing of the provided hot sauce, not love lost here.  Our server was efficient, he kept our waters full and the food came out correctly and on time.  Maybe a little over enthused about correct pronunciation of each dish, but I can handle it.I've had the pleasure to visit this place about three times now, and It hasn't disappointed me at all. Firstly, amazing colors through out the place, such lovely and joyful decor. Secondly, what freakingly amazing tacos!! The cochinita pibil is one of my ultimate faves, with the carne asada very close to a tie!! Thirdly, the cocktails!! Oh my! The muy buena Paloma Cocktail!!! But seriously, this place is great, I cannot emphasize enough how terrific this cafe is.I really adore and admire Gallo's style and taste in food, it's truly amazing, and closer to the actual modern food in Mexico, at least very similar to the South Central style. You won't see the overplayed cheese and beans plate here, no sir!  That's what makes me love them more, how they steer more into the actual True Mexican dishes, with a bit of a slight twist but still about the same in extraordinary flavors.Gallo Blanco is a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that serves up some quality Mexican cuisine.  No Tex Mex here, instead you can find street style tacos, a creative elote, and some pretty good happy hour specials.My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Gallo Blanco is adjacent to the Clarenden hotel, so if it's your first time you might miss it.  Inside you'll find an open and modern space that matches the food perfectly.  There's also plenty of outdoor seating and bright colors everywhere and a bar if you're looking for more than tacos.  1 Star.Service - Our servers were great.  Even though the food took some time to come out, they checked in often.  We sat outside on a cold fall afternoon, but our outdoor heater was out of fuel.  They were kind enough to move a working lamp to accommodate us.  1 Star.Food - Get the elote.  Gallo Blanco serves this up on a whole corn, placing the sour cream and spices on top.  You then strip the corn off directly.  It looks amazing, tastes great, and was a really creative way to serve elote.  I liked it more because it limited the amount of sour cream.  The guacamole was also great.  Fresh, and with pineapples mixed in.  They used big chunks too, and I thought it was great.  They tacos were good not great.  The beef reminds me of Korean bugolgi marinated beef.  It was sweet (which is ok with me).  Shrimp and fish tacos while fresh, weren't any more memorable that other places I've been too.  So while the appetizers were great, our tacos weren't as good.  1 Star. Will I Return? - Yes.  Kids eat free, and they have great happy hour specials.  I'd return for those reasons and the elote/guac.  Gallo Blanco is solid, cool, and definitely worth a return visit.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.

We were walking by this place and decided to stop in because of how busy the front patio, which is right on the sidewalk, seemed to be. Glad we did. The prices weren't too bad. We tried the moules frites and snail gnocchi. The mussels were awesome. They were large and plump, not shriveled like at many places. The leftover soup was delicious. You get a large pot of mussels. As for the gnocchi, the snails and mushrooms went together very well. The snail was tender and flavorful. The gnocchi was a bit dense but overall still quite good.

CAN YOU SAY DIRT CHEAP STEAK AND EGGS??!! Yes that's right graveyard special for only 5.95 a nice juicy tender 7oz NY Strip Steak, 2 Eggs however you want them, Fairly cooked Has Browns with Toast and Jelly. I went to vegas for a random adventure Saturday Night but since i was here I wanted to hit up South Point and get the $6 Deal. =D I recommend anyone to this cafe after your inebriated or sober after celebrating the nightlife in wonderful viva las vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!If I was Yelping 3 years ago, I'd be the Duke by a long shot.  When I first moved to Las Vegas in 2011, South Point was my home for the first couple of months.  So that meant a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the Coronado Cafe.  Now that doesn't mean that the Coronado Cafe is a "Must" stop.  It just means that I was too lazy to leave the casino when the belly was calling.  So here's my review...Service:  This really depends on the day, the time, and how busy they are.  I've gotten service as bad as 2 stars and as good as 5 stars.  Ironically, the service is actually better during the weekend nights when they are busy.  Busy here also means a lot more employees working, which means pretty good service. I found longer waits during the quiet morning/afternoons. The Food:  There's something for everyone here. The menu is extensive and there's even Chinese Food.  My Suggestions:  -Eggs:  No one messes up eggs, Coronado doesn't either-Clam Chowder:  Pretty good stuff.  Not New England or Morro Bay good, but good enough that you'll be wanting more.-Porterhouse for $12.99:  Bang for your buck!  This is somewhat dry, so if you're use to a Medium-Well, get a Medium Plus.  -Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Surprisingly, not too bad.  -Asparagus:  Not on the menu, but they'll make it if you request it.  Good stuff!-Salmon:  I've had good and bad salmon here.  But I've had more good than bad.  Nothing really special.  Taste wise it's okay, protein wise it's worth it. -Chicken Parmesan:  Just okay, but worth the try if you're in the mood.  Take my advice, avoid these:-Grilled Halibut Steak:  Flaky just how I like my fish, but it's too dry and really fishy. -Prime Rib:  Taste like cardboard -Any of their salads.  I've never had a fresh one hereOverall, I have to say that the food is just average at best.  However, Coronado fits everyone's budget.  The food is inexpensive and if you're in the casino, the restaurant is convenient. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (495/500)5 Stars for the best Late Night "Steak and Eggs"!  don't even know how many times I've come here the last few years, maybe 100 times?? But their Late Night specials from Midnight-6am are the only reasons I've come here. I do hear great things about their Chinese Food though so I'll have to come back for one of these days. Their Graveyard Specials beat out The Orleans in my opinions since it's a lot fresher and feel like they give you a bit more. Also service is pretty fast. My boyfriend always get the Steak & Eggs $4.95 now (long time ago during recession was around $2.95) and I always get the Sausage & Eggs $3.45 (used to be around $2.95 also). They also offer Biscuits and gravy for $2.95, Pancake Sandwich $3.95, Ham Steak $3.95, and even 1/2 lb Cheeseburger with fries for $3.95! Yummo!  I just don't come here as much since my boyfriend and I cut back big time on meat but we still love coming here once in a while for late night eats after going out :)

I became addicted to this place a couple months ago. I have tried a bite of what others with me have ordered but for me I can't bring myself to order anything other then the "Garlic Chicken Bowl".  I got regular size and it cost $5.99. You can get it served over brown or white rice. I really like their white rice it is cooked perfectly. The chicken has such a great flavor. You can get dark meat or for an additional charge you can get white meat. If you like garlic and you like chicken I absolutely recommend trying this one! My man had the "Spicy Steak Bowl". He got the large size and it cost $7.39. He loved it. I tried a bite and the steak was cooked just right. For $2.99 more you can get double meat. Since we got combo meals it came with a drink and "Grilled Egg Roll". The egg roll was just OK. It wasn't something I would intentionally order on the side. They recently added "Pork Pot Stickers" to the menu. These were very dry and had no flavor. I have noticed they are pretty busy around lunch time. The manager said you can always phone your order in for pick up. I'm sure I will take advantage of that at some point.I really like that they make your food right when you order it so it is fresh. The place is clean inside.Near the soda fountain they have a tray with several sauces that you can help yourself to. They cater and have multiple catering or family style dinners to choose from.

I stopped at Cafe Mix for lunch.  For a newer pad site restaurant I was somewhat impressed with the warm atmosphere.  I ordered a Gyro special which came with choice of side.  I went with the Greek salad which was pretty good...fresh, crisp lettuce, nice dressing and authentic kalamata olives.The Gyro itself was good, plenty of meat, tzatziki dressing, lettuce and tomato.The service here was prompt and efficient if not overly friendly.If you're in the McKellips & Greenfield area there are not alot of food choices and I would say this is probably one of the better ones.Please see my glowing of this restaurant on 4/13/2013. So I am on the Eastside for a meeting and in the mood for a good lunch. This place has good food. I walk to the counter, order a shwarma pita and a coke to go. Pay my $9.27 and throw the change into the tip jar. I am told to sit on the to go bench and wait for order. I thought, odd, 3/4 empty restaurant and I have to crowd onto the bench. O well, no biggie. Wait for my order handed the sandwich and I change my mind. Sit down at one of 15 empty tables to eat and the snotty cashier barks at me across the room that next time if I am going to stay I have to order it to stay. I said pardon me, why does it matter, she responds, those are our rules. I state, there will not be a next time. I then place my uneaten sandwich and coke on the counter and walk. One of the managers catches my eye, waves me over. I ask him if I am welcome to eat in his restaurant.   He states that they have rules because of the liquor board. I am stunned by his illogical statement. I was not drinking alcohol, so what does the liquor board have to do with my pita and coke. He offers nothing. I say, ok I understand, turn and leave. Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy Johns to order another lunch (far inferior in quality) stand and wait. Then the snotty cashier shows up and tries to give me ten dollars. I say I do not want the money, she argues. I ask her why she is harassing me. She continues to argue with me. I tell her to leave me alone. Bizarre. A little bit of feedback for the owners. 1. You can not get in trouble with anyone if you are not breaking the law. It is not against the law to eat food out of to go containers in restaurants. 2. The reason your dining room was not packed at noon is because of your lame service. 3. I will never return even though I really dig your food.

I've been coming here for years, so it's time for an update. Panera is a great place to get to when you want to drink coffee (free refills!) while you suck down some internet and maybe try to get some work done. Quite a lot of tables, many of which do have a power outlet nearby.The "pick two" is the best way to get a variety of flavors and textures for your meal. Choice of a smaller salad, a reasonable bowl of soup and a half of one of their signature sandwiches. But for breakfast, I prefer the toasted everything bagel (you may want to ask them to put it through twice) with cream cheese is a good meal. Especially since the coffee is refillable.During the busy lunch times (11 to 1), the wifi will cut out after a half hour. This is your cue to start tethering your phone. Though if the place is filling up, it's not polite to take up a table and not be eating. Give folks a chance. There are also a couple tables outside in the sun that still reach the wifi (but no power).The kiosk ordering system is great. Skip the line and you can still get your order in and pay. Panera now accepts NFC payments as well from your phone!Tip: If someone is taking up an entire four seat table by themselves and there is no other space, you're perfectly okay to ask if you can share.

Review Text :
One of the best looking cafes in Vegas located in the newest casino on the strip. Unfortunately, for a cafe with a limited menu, it seemed to be overpriced for average food.  For the price of the open-faced Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, it wasn't worth it.  Definitely had better elsewhere for much cheaper.The Chillaquilles didn't look or taste like it should.  The texture was soggy and the flavor was dry.  The complimentary bread with cream cheese-tastin butter was better.  At this point, my cousin just couldn't wait to "walk off the disappointment."The BLT, however, was satisfactory with thick slices of smoked applewood bacon, arugula, and tasty basil sauce.If it wasn't for the BLT, I would've given a one star rating only for the attractive decor and new vibe of this place.Just like my recent meal at Studio Cafe in the MGM Grand, Cafe Vettro really personifies a lot of Vegas dining.  There definitely seems to be nice restaurants in Vegas, but there are just as many restaurants that are below average.  What makes matters worse is that these restaurants can be really bad and still turn a profit.  These restaurants get so much traffic from the casinos that no matter how bad they are, they will always have customers.This 24 hour cafe (located in Aria) is very big.  There is not much to the decor, but it is comfortable.The menu features breakfast (served all day), sandwiches, salads and plates (including fish, beef and pasta).  The sandwiches are priced below $20; the plates go over $20.The complimentary bread was some pretzel bread (with dried fruit).  I do not know if it was purposely served cold, but the bread definitely would have been better if served warm.I went with the barramundi because it did look decent when I saw a waitress carrying it.  The barramundi (kind of like a sea bass) was pan seared and served over fingerling potatoes and garnished with edamame (kind of an odd pairing) and a thin cream sauce.The fish was flaky and moist.  Mine was not as seared as the one I saw.  It was okay.  The veggies and sauce were bland and boring.  Some of the veggies were cold too.  My friends mentioned that some of their food was cold as well.The waitress was trying hard, but the service at Cafe Vettro was not that great.  It took a while to put in the orders as well as to receive the food.  It was hard to flag down a server too because it did not seem like they had enough staff.Cafe Vettro may have some other stuff on the menu that is better, but from what I had, I probably would not give it another shot (maybe I would try it for breakfast).  I think on my next trip to Vegas, I really need to plan out each meal (no matter how small) to avoid having another subpar (and overpriced) meal like the one we had at Cafe Vettro.I was extremely disappointed in this sad excuse for a restaurant, especially because of its location in the gorgeous Aria resort. The decor is absolutely beautiful! The food was mediocre at best. The service was just bad...First of all, my party of FOUR was directed to our table after a few minute wait... There were only THREE chairs and three place settings. We awkwardly stood in the middle of the restaurant until someone carried over another chair from across the room. The fact that they were so unorganized even after keeping us waiting is unacceptable for any restaurant, and very unprofessional.I ordered the late breakfast of two eggs, sausage, and asked what their substitutions were for the hash browns and toast. This seemed a foreign concept, because our waitress had no idea. I asked if they could substitute for cottage cheese, as many other breakfast places do, and she said she'd have to ask the chef. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger minus the bun, and she couldn't perceive that idea either. Most restaurants are willing and able to make substitutions for guests. This restaurant made me feel really uncomfortable even suggesting the idea.After all of this confusion, the service was really slow. It took ten minutes after being seated at our table for the waitress to come around to take our orders. The food itself was sad. My thirteen dollar meal could have been better put together by McDonald's. I tasted my BF's burger. It may have been one of the most unappetizing ground beef patties I've ever tasted. It was overcooked, hard, and bland, except for a chemically smoke taste. My poor honey suffered through that, for $15 no less. My BFF had the biscuits and gravy, and left half of her meal. She NEVER leaves half of her meal. I happened to remember the price of what everyone ordered (probably because it was so high for what you get), which was a good thing, because the price on the menu was not consistent with the charge on the bill. Apparently they recently changed the menus, so the prices increased, but we all ordered off of old menus. Either way, the manager was unhelpful and unapologetic fixing their mistake. That type of attitude is not what I expect in a premier Aria restaurant.Please, Aria... PLEASE clean house in that restaurant and hire competent management, an interested head chef, and well-trained wait staff. The facility is so gorgeous and needs to be appreciated with cuisine complimenting its beauty, not distracting us from the unacceptable service and food.Very solid performance on two separate occasions while on a recent trip to the Aria Resort and Casino. We were able to score some Bloody Mary specials and lord knows I needed them and while we were at it we ordered breakfast. There was no line to speak of to get in and the service was really very good. We were approached immediately after seating and the food was good. For the morning after or if you're just craving steak and eggs, this is a good go-to spot for a good meal and good service.Given how late the clubs/bars close, you'd think the Strip would have tons of choices for late night eats.  Although, the hotels probably figure the late night crowd won't be sober enough to care.  Which, admittedly, isn't the worst bet to make in Vegas...Located at Café Vettro's old spot inside Aria, I can't say if ARIA Café is just their new name or a true replacement.  Either way, it's easily the nicest 24-hour café I've been to in Vegas, with its open space, huge windows, and modern décor.  Service was pretty nice as well, but the kitchen is slow.  Even though it was mostly empty when my buddy and I walked in for a late lunch, it still took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out.Wanting something light yet filling, I ordered the GRILLED CHICKEN CIABATTA, served with Pepper Jack Cheese, Poblano Chilies, Guacamole, Tomatoes, Spicy Mayonnaise, and a side of Fries ($15).  While it sounded great on the menu, the sandwich fell short.  The chicken was okay, but the relative lack of guacamole and mayo, coupled with the thick ciabatta bread, made for a dry, dry sandwich.  I ended up leaving most of the bread behind, but at least the fries weren't bad (a little salty).Although my particular dish wasn't terribly priced, we saw several on the menu that were.  It may be The Strip, but $20 for Beef Fried Rice?  $22 for FIsh n Chips?  Thank goodness for our reseort credit.  ARIA Café might not be bad for breakfast or after clubbing/drinking (The Henry at Cosmo is better), but I'm not sure I can say the same for lunch or dinner.Aria Cafe is the "new" and improved Cafe Vettro.  I really have no idea why they changed the name of this place when everything about this place is exactly the same.  Whatever.Aria Cafe is a 24-hour eatery with your standard eats.  I would only come here for late-night eats!  There's not too many late-night or 24-hour eateries on The Strip.  The food here is on the pricier side.  I had a watermelon juice with my lox and bagel and it fetched me a pretty pricey bill considering nothing I ate had to actually be cooked or warmed.  Regardless, the convenience of having a 24-hour restaurant does work out nicely when you're drunk or tired from clubbing and just need some food to soak up the booze.  Wish the wait staff had more personality but hey, I'd probably be sick and tired of drunks and tourists too!The decor and ambiance does not match the service, staff and food.Wifey and I decided to grab breakfast here since we were staying at the Aria. This is one of the few times I didn't check the Yelp reviews and I should have.First impressions were impeccable, spacious and gorgeous. The architecture was modern, open, sleek and almost looked like a club. It's nicely located in front of the hotel and you have an unobstructed view of the porte-cochere with its large glass windows. However, looks can be deceiving. Most of the people that were working here appeared to be on the verge of retirement and all lack life. What I mean by that is they were moody, slow and grumpy. No one smiled even when they were taking our orders and they were all just going thru the motion like robots or slaves. I guess those are harsh words, but it really felt like the staff came from a nursing home. So I ordered the Steak and Eggs while the Wifey had omelette with a side of coffee for the both of us. The coffee was bland and weak and my Steak and Eggs left a lot to be desired. I've had better at Denny's compared to this place. Wifey's omelette was just so-so. No, we weren't impressed, but what made it memorable for us was Hunter Pence. Yup, this was after they won the 2012 World Series and he was sitting behind us. We got to take a photo with him while I was wearing my Niners' gear. Funny thing was that I was all decked in Giants' gear the previous day. So back to Aria Cafe - you need to up your game, son."It's raw!" - Gordon RamsayI've always wanted to hulk-smash a dish of food and yell that when it comes out raw.  I figured Vegas wasn't the place to do it, already dressed to go out for the night, didn't want to get kicked out of Aria.  Ordered the calamari, chicken sandwich and spinach artichoke dip.  Although chicken and dip were good the calamari was so undercooked it was hard to chew.  I hate throwing away food, but I literally could not shallow that calamari.  Shame, calamari is my Kryptonite too.  If it's on any menu, I'm ordering it don't care if it's Dairy Queen!Bring your shadesIf you eat here for dinner don't forget your sunglasses, it's like going to a vegas pool...without the pool. Actually...don't ever eat here for dinner, its more of a lunch or late night spot.  The sun blares through the glass facade which is an entire side of the restaurant and there aren't any shades on their windows so your S.O.L. Half of the guests were literally wearing sunglasses while eating dinner. Felt like I was at an LMFAO concert. I guess if you're there to check out girls/guys that's a good thing though ;)A typical hotel Cafe. We came here twice while staying at the Aria Hotel Casino.  The Cafe itself looks beautiful. Very modern with large windows throughout the restaurant, thus providing enough natural  lighting for most of the restaurant. The furniture is also modern like with comfortable chairs, quartz table tops, and posh benches around the booths.Now for the food. I thinks it's mediocre at best. The first time I ordered their Deuce Breakfast. It had two of everything such as eggs, toast, sausage, and bacon, pancakes, with my coffee. I thought the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side. The quality and what was served for $16.00 plus my coffee. The food was more on the bland side. Yes, the eggs and my sausage wasn't too good. The bacon was good, but had too much fat in it. The second time there, I ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs. I think that order was $20.00. Again I didn't think it was worth it. Proportion wise was fine. Enough for an individual to be content. However, the whole dish was bland. Tasteless sauce, and flavorless meatballs had me use plenty of salt and Parmesan Cheese for the spaghetti. I finished it only because I was hungry and didn't want to drink alcohol later with an empty stomach.Overall the cafe was a really nice place. The service was decent, while the food took around fifteen minutes. The waiter and waitress kept filling our glass with water and asked if everything was okay. They were nice! But the quality of the food needs to improve. I thought it's a bit pricey for what was served, and especially when its worst than cafeteria food.Anyhow, a great place but mediocre food. It can use an improvement please. Three stars.

After trying their Salsa, Guacamole and Ceviche at the Yelp Event, I couldn't get it out of my mind, it was so good, so I went to have lunch here today! Let me tell you How Amazing our food was!!! To start I ordered the custom Guacamole, they give you a list of ingredients and you check which ones you would like, I chose everything except onions and word to the wise, do yourself a favor and make sure you get the pomegranates (see pics) WOW OH WOW, that was the Best Guacamole I've ever had, seriously!!! For my entree I decided to order the Acapulco Shrimp Ceviche (see pics) It was Delicious just like it was at the event. I also ordered the Chicken Taquitos (see pics) OMGosh! These were absolutely the highlight of the meal, definitely not what I was expecting and I mean that in the best way possible! Freshly stuffed with shredded chicken and bacon and then rolled and fried to a golden crisp, yet they were so delicate and flavorful. I would go here again and again just to order these babies! My hubby ordered their cheese enchiladas with two fried eggs on top, which they were more than willing to accommodate him with even though it was not on the menu. (Sorry No pics), but he LOVED every bite, only problem was he wished they had been served with a bit more of their tasty charro beans. And despite getting the generous discount card from the event last night (get $15 off $40) We didn't even hit $40 dollars ordering all that! I think their prices are very fair, especially for the quality and amount of food. My only complaint was, the place was still Bombay Spice-ish, decor and music wise. -1 star Please go get some decorations to liven up the place and give it some character along with playing some more fitting music, I'm not talking mariachi or anything but some Island beats would have been better suited than Loungey dance music. **The Food was a definite 5 stars for me though**

Review Text :
I visited Cafe Milano tonight solo for a quick dinner before seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Benedum.  I approached the counter and first asked if they had any dinner specials, which they didn't.  In light of that, I attempted to order a mini (6") pie, which the woman behind the counter told me that I didn't want, since it was "retardedly small."  I told her I usually order two slices of pizza, and asked her which size I should get, and she said the small, and maybe even the medium.  "Really?  It's just for me." I said, and proceeded to order a plain small ($8.12 w/ tax).  I'm glad I used my common sense, since I wasn't looking for leftovers since I was going to the show afterward.  Indeed, when the small showed up, it ended up being about twice as much as I usually order.The pizza took about 10 minutes to prepare, and was served piping hot to me at my table by the woman I'd ordered from.  Another odd exchange with her ensued when I asked her for parmesan and oregano, to which she responded they didn't have the latter (what pizza place doesn't have oregano or Italian seasoning?!?), but she could bring me parsley.  In terms of quality, I found the pie resoundingly average, with a sweet, non-crispy crust, a bland sauce, and nondescript cheese.  This pie was on the level of a Mineo's--and that's not a compliment.  However, it was at least filling--which it better have been, given that it contained twice as many slices as I usually eat--so it sustained me through the show without a problem.Overall, I was underwhelmed by my experience at Cafe Milano, despite that I don't exactly have high expectations of pizza parlors.  I was particularly put off by the high-pressure upselling tactics of the woman I dealt with--perhaps the sales techniques of Christos next door are rubbing off on Milano's employees?  In any case, next time I'm looking for a casual, inexpensive pizza slice or pie in the Cultural District, I'll look elsewhere.

This is for Deb:I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink.I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good.The ice in my cup was really, really cold.This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location.yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser?I saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go.Big mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore.Do quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.

Restaurant name  The Cheesecake Factory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza.   Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.   Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times.   When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes.   Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars.   The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude.   Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee.I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in like three years, so my roommate and I decided to break the three-year-long hiatus and try it out for dinner once again.We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table.They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy). As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness!My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route.Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner.

This was one of those places that I wanted to like, just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerstone of the downtown Glendale scene. I wanted to like this place so much that I didn't write this review based on one visit, nor two, but three strikes you're out!There isn't much that Bitzee Mama's does well. In fact the only redeeming trait might be the salsa (but even that isn't enough to bring me back of my own fruition). The service is "OMG - I CAN FEEL MY HAIR GROWING" slow. The food is nothing memorable - if you even get what you order (once I ordered a cheesesteak and I just got the cheese - I kid you not, no meat). The prices are actually high for what you get - and check your bill because once I was charged $47.38 for a soda and sammie which I actually had to argue about with the manager (I was pretty sure I could take her, but dang that's just not right).Mama's may have been a staple in the past, but her age is showing and she desperately needs a calgon moment!

Review Text :
came here for Happy Hour:  $5 on all food from the lounge & bar menu, $7 on selected cocktails, $4 on selected beers, $7 on selected wines by the glass.truffle mac & cheese - so you think Element Cafe (Pasadena,CA) has the best Truffle Mac & Cheese? you haven't tried the one here at American Fish.. it is SOOO delicious! Although it was a tad bit salty, but it was okay because the truffle flavor was so strong that made the whole dish so flavorful. That first bite of my mac & cheese w/ mushroom and peas, a BURST of truffle just waken your taste buds. It was so good that  I had to order seconds for this dish. oysters on the half shell - you get two in one order; the oyster was so fresh! the mignonette & bloody mary granite was perfect for these oysters.tuna tartare - you get two small pieces; in my opinion it was not worth $5. The cut was so small that i can barely taste the freshness of the fish. All i can taste was the sauce they complemented with. It just overpowered the fish.tuna tartare - it was mixed w/ pine nuts, arugula, olives and topped w/ a sunny side-up quail egg. This was pretty good. Although i think the presentation was more worth it than the taste.sea salt baked blue prawns - you get two prawns with uni aioli and pickled cucumbers. This was just okay; nothing special. main lobster corndogs - you get three bite size corndogs. Basically, imagine a corndog, but instead of a hot dog, you find a mashed up of lobster meat that's made into a paste/ ball. Real lobster meat in here, none of that imitation stuff. prime rib sandwich - not your regular sandwich, it was more like a bruschetta. Thin slices of prime ribs were placed on top of a ciabatta topped w/ horseradish, arugula, and tomato. fish & chips - wow, i've never tasted such fresh fish & chips before. The fish just flakes off, the batter was not heavy at all, it was very light. The fries was delicious because they were malted-vinegar french fries! mmmmm!I'd definitely come back for a light snack off from the happy hour menu.If you're reading this review and you see a little box on the top saying they have happy hour with $5 appetizers, I suggest you get your vegas going booty to Michael Mina's American Fish to get their Lobster Corn Dogs, Truffle Mac and Cheese, and their Fish and Chips.  I figured I'd try this place while trying to find a nice restaurant to take my girl out for our 5 year.  Not that we went here but I found this place by visiting Michael Mina's website and saw that they had a happy hour.  Walking up to American Fish in Aria is kind of intimidating.  Not because it's a huge restaurant but because you're surrounded by super classy and expensive looking everything!  We were told we could choose to sit anywhere in the lounge/bar area but were warned that the tables were small.  They knew we were there for the food on happy hour so they suggested (and helped) pushing together 2 tables to fit everything.  Lobster Corn Dogs - said to be the favorite 3 out of 4 people we were there with.  Myself included.   They (I think) mince lobster meat into a 1.5" sausage shape, dip it in corn dog batter, and deep fry it.  The lobster meat is all there with very little filler if any.  Good taste, great texture, and good dipping sauce.Truffle Mac - I tell you, this makes me a Mac Fanboy.  ZOMG SO GOOD!!!!  The perfect, harmonious blend of cheese and truffle oil made us order a second round.  Mainly because my girl loved it so much.  My only complaint is that it is a little salty.Fish and Chips - I was still hungry so I figured I'd fill up on the chips.  Little did I know, I'd be eating perfectly cooked fish with a light batter around it.  The fish and chips both had a hint of malt vinegar which was a VERY nice touch on the chips.  Those three dishes were the ones we said were worth it.  If you like raw oysters, that may be worth it too but they're not my cup of tea.  Everything else (especially the sashimi) on the happy hour menu is just okay.  The mediocrity includes their beer selection.  Anywhere that has PBR for $4 / can is just wrong.  However, those 3 dishes.  Magnifique.American Fish offers a nice little happy hour from 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Sundays through Fridays.  Happy hour offerings include a selection of appetizers for $5.00 each, along with a handful of cocktails, beers and wines coming in at $7.00 each.  Note that the appetizers are small, though!  About two-three bites per appetizier kind of small.  Between two kinda-hungry people we ordered six appetizers and two desserts, so even with happy hour pricing expect each person to pitch in $15-$20 (before drinks).So, you end up here during happy hour, and you're wondering what to order?  Well, whatever you order, be sure to save a tiny bit of room for dessert.  You have to try the cheesecake!  This cheesecake has the softest and creamiest consistency that I've had.  It'll melt in your mouth and make you want to eat the whole thing when no one else is looking.  But that would be mean, so you really should order one piece of cheesecake for each person.  Honestly, it's a hard dessert to willingly share.  As for the rest of the meal:Foie Gras Poppers - These are small.  Like, the diameter of a quarter small.  Tasty, but imagine if you got a cheeseburger the size of a quarter; small bun, small meat, small cheese, right?  How can you distinguish the flavors?  This is actually the first time I've tasted Foie Gras, so I couldn't really tell you how it tasted!  It was good, but I don't know why exactly.Tuna Melt - This was another treat.  For some reason my tastebuds only like tuna if it is sashimi/sushi.  Tuna sandwich, tuna melt...no thank you!  But this tuna melt had some very good white cheddar that mixed with the tuna to make for a delicious sandwich.Shrimp & Grits - It's shrimp!  With grits!  Truffled Mac & Cheese - This was tasty since the truffle had a very pronounced flavor.  Not overbearing, but it had enough presence to give it a pleasant flavor.  None of that, "This taste like regular mac & cheese!" business here!Fish & Chips - It's fish!  And chips!Prime Rib Sandwich - It's not really a sandwich...since the prime rib is sitting on top of a piece of ciabatta bread; not bread on top.  Still, the prime rib was quite tasty.  The horseradish didn't have much kick, if you're into that sort of thing.  I know I am.  Overall American Fish offers a pleasant happy hour.  The drink selection at happy hour pricing is rather limited when compared to their entire cocktail menu (three cocktails, three beers and three wines make up the happy hour selection).  Still, it makes for a nice alternative to a full meal on The Strip.Items selected:2010 Brut CremantBee's KneesCorn Bread, Grilled Garlic Ciabatta, Butter, Olive OilBlack Cod Tostada with Cilantro SlawNew England Lobster Roll with Toasted Parker House Roll and Old Bay ButterMichael's Tomato Soup with Maine Lobster Grilled Cheese and Micro BasilShrimp and Grits, Serrano Ham, Shellfish Broth, Jalapeno CreamSeared Scallop and Foie Gras with Pain Perdu, Candied Fennel, Charred Blackberry ButterGrilled Lion Fish with Yukon Gold Potato Chowder, Steamed Mussels, Pork Belly CroutonsCrawfish Hush PuppiesLobster Whipped PotatoesLemon Pound Cake with Melon Sorbet, Compressed Melon, Blueberry Tapioca with Pop RocksWhite Chocolate Bread Pudding - Caramelized Banana, White Chocolate Ice CreamWarm Beignets with Chocolate Mousse and Lime SugarChocolate Peanut Butter Torte with Salty Caramel Ice Cream, Peanut PralineMascarpone Cheesecake with Huckleberries and Vanilla CrustDouble EspressoHaving made friends with folks in the Mina group and harboring a great respect for the chef himself after many stellar visits to his restaurants in various cities my final dinner prior to becoming an official resident of Las Vegas saw me seated at Aria's American Fish for a self-selected tasting menu based on classics and seasonal specialties, the newly reorganized kitchen working in full view and servers happy to engage in discussions of sourcing, preparation, and approach.  A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.The Service: Our server is very sweet. However, hard to track her down. Only 1 server at the bar area. The Food: HAPPY HOUR MENU ROCKS!!! $5 for all the food. Very nice presentation. BUT... very very very small portion.New England Lobster Roll - GOOD!!! Crispy at the bottom, creamy on the top.Beef Tartare - weird texture, didn't really like itKing Crab Louie - soso, taste like devil eggSeared Scallop - Tasty scallop but wish there is one more pieceValrhona Chocolate Custard - creamy chocolate... yumm!White Chocolate Bread Pudding - THE BEST!Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.

Restaurant name  Paris 66
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We went here Friday night and had fairly high expectations for Paris 66. I was looking forward to a decent crepe!  We were immediately greeted by one of the owners in the cramped entry. She advised that our wait would be approximately 30 minutes, although she mentioned that she hadn't been in the back for awhile and didn't know what was going on back there. She did take our phone number and said she would called us. Great! We wandered around nearby businesses. Fine. We went back 30 minutes later, being very optimistic. When we arrived, we saw that our position on their notepad, (yes, they have a very sophisticated way of tracking their wait list), had not changed. So, either no one had come in since we were last there, or they had been seating customers as they came in. We were told by a different host that our wait would be just 30 minutes. When we explained that we were told that 30 minutes ago, she became flustered and said we would be seated as soon as possible. So, this time, we decided to wait in the cramped entry next to the glass display case looking at yummy food. Now let me say, they have made great use of the space in these very confined quarters. The kitchen is right inside the front door, (you can see crepes being made outside thru the front window), the chef and cooks are bursting with energy, working at a hectic pace to prepare the orders. They are warm and friendly and greet all the customer. A cash register is also located here, along with the dessert case. Tables are small and packed close together. Walls have a weathered finish, the lighting thru out is ambient, the fixtures are beautiful, all the walls are covered with old fashioned posters, post cards are under glass on the tables. Very nice. The exterior and interior finishes are very, very nice. We were offered a dining room table or a table on the patio. We happily took the patio, the fresh air was very nice after waiting by the kitchen. Not a lot to look at outside, but it's very relaxing there. We got a nice table in the corner next to large pot of flowers. Service was sub par. Our server waffled between her fake accent and Yinzer girl. Okay. We were not offered a beverage. She wasn't well rehearsed on the menu, except to say "we are out of that" twice. We also noticed that she struggled to open the wine of customers that BYOB'ed. Another thing that seemed odd was, mid way thru our dinner, one of the owners came busting out the back door with a table. She placed it in the middle of the patio, a server came out with a high chair, they moved it around a couple times and then customers came outside packing their own meals and then stood around and then decided to find their own chairs. Kinda strange. I ordered La St Germain, a buckwheat crepe with ham & swiss served with a small side salad. I thought it was a bit tough and dry and couldn't eat more than 1/2 of it. Also, it was contained very little ham or swiss, however the salad was nice. BJ had Paris-Brest, a salad served with scallops, shrimp, mussels and pesto. The scallops, (only 2) were well prepared, the shrimp (4) were tiny but well seasoned and the mussels (4) were over cooked and very tough. It was supposed to be served with bread, but none found it's way to our table. BJ also had the carrot & vanilla soup, which was nice. I so wanted a crepe for dessert, but after the savory crepe, I was afraid to try one of the sweets. Instead, we shared an apple tart. It was perfect, served with a bit of creme anglaise. The crust was very flaky, the apples were perfect. Our server gave us spoons to eat the tart, so that was a struggle. I'm sure Paris 66 will do well in Pittsburgh and I wish them well. However, I was not at all impressed with our experience.Well...I really wanted to give Paris 66 another try.  I felt like I'd missed something great here.  All the elements are here.  It's an adorable French bistro.  Cute setting and the menu looks amazing!  Last time I only had a salad so I was ready to go all out.  Great thing was, the lunch menu offered a 3 course meal for $14.99.  It included a coffee or iced tea, choice of soup or salad, 5 different main plates and then a handful of desserts.  Not a bad deal for those who want a taste of it all.  I decided to pick the warm goat cheese salad and Bastille Crepe. We received our ice teas and we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Then one slightly unenthusiastic apology from the waitress saying "something was messed up" with our order. Others beside us kept on ordering and getting food.  An HOUR passed by with no food. We finally had to summon over a manager who apologized and then 10 minutes later the salad appeared. A SALAD. It takes an hour to make a salad? I don't know what really happened... but I know it shouldn't have. It wasn't busy at all. Only three other tables in the dinning room with lots of different servers around. It was really irritating and I was HANGRY (hungry + angry)!We then received our main dishes about 10 minutes after that and my crepe was a total letdown. It was a beautiful looking crepe, but frankly, it tasted like condensed cream of mushroom soup on top of some spinach and a crepe. Plus it was lukewarm. Major fail! Our waitress then starting to do the "save face so that I can still get a tip" act and gave compliment after compliment to us. For all of this, during a lunch that we were EXTREMELY patient with (good thing we didn't have a strict lunch schedule), they comped us a couple macaroons...which in my opinion, there should have been more!  I've worked in the restaurant biz and personally felt for all of that, our meal should have been comped. Worst of all, the manager never even came back over to ask if everything was okay. Poor costumer service. Too bad, I had high hopes.It was Pittsburgh Restaurant week and I was beyond excited to try a few new places.  We booked reservations to two places, one being Paris 66 Bistro  and this was the H's pick.  I checked out their prefixed menu online and thought yea this could be really good.   Parking was tricky, but they have a valet at a very reasonable price of $3.00.  The restaurant is quaint but nicely decorated.  They have white table cloths but cover them with paper I guess to save the effort of changing the linens every few hours.  When I say every few hours I mean that was about the time it took us from start to finish to complete our experience.  Not a positive.After being seated we glanced the prefixed menu, which we had already decided upon and waited.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our waiter finally appeared, not sure what took him so long, but he seemed stressed.  We ordered drinks wine for me French Martini for the H, and immediately put in our order.  I requested the escargot and asked about the Boeuf Bourguignon which was one of the options for the entrée the other was salmon.  Our waiter immediately began pushing this lamb special they were having.  He stated he would not order that and he didn't like it.  Compared it to a well done stew.  Um ok.. I said what about the salmon?  He said that was better than the beef but still not one of his favorites and wouldn't suggest it, but he said the sauce was really good.  What the heck?  He was pushing the regular menu and or the special, even stated the food on the menu was much better than the not so cheap $45.00 prefixed meals.  . We didn't allow this to alter our intentions of ordering off the restaurant week menu but I did decide to go with the salmon over the beef.  We both got the goat cheese salad for the appetizer, H went for the beef regardless of the waiters disdain for it, and I got crème brulee and he chocolate mousse.To the most annoying part. The wait!  We waited for everything!  Our initial drinks took 15 minutes and when done  we waited forever with empty glasses.  The best part is I pushed the glasses to the edge of the table as to be noticed easily as our waiter passed several times, yet he did not stop to address it.  No actually he sped up as to avoid us calling him out as he dashed past our table.  I would have considered them moderately busy, not hustling past tables that are in need of drinks busy!  So we probably waited about 15 minutes before he finally stopped to get us a refill.  The refill process wasn't quick either, and we noticed that the servers made their own drinks.  Hmmm in a management perspective I think this is a bad idea.  But hey if it works for them, which it don't, then oh well.  He brings the drinks and in the process of setting them down he catches the H's on the tacky white paper covering the table cloth and spills a good sip or two of his martini.  The waiter blames the spill on said paper and says the next one's on me.  At least 30 more minutes, and still nothing. We came hungry this wait was excessive.  About 45 minutes in we got some bread and he dropped off a complimentary bowl of zucchini foam, quite tasty.  An hour in and finally my escargot show up.  H wouldn't even consider trying these puppies and good thing cause they were tiny.  They were quite good, but drowned in butter, garlic, and parsley that that was the primary flavor so I can only describe the escargot texture like a portabella.  Again very good, just wonder what they would have tasted like without all the disguisers.    Hour and 15 in, salads show.  I have never waited so long for a side salad, yet it was quite delectable.  The goat cheese mixed with the fresh veggies and delicate dressing made a very well balanced salad.  The problem, it was a small portion so we ate it in less than 5 minutes leaving us hungry and waiting for entrées.  So another 35 minutes pass and they show up.  The H really liked his beef so I am glad the waiter didn't deter his opinion, however it held the same challenge as the previous courses.  Small, tiny, teeny, itsy bitsy.  My meal held a little more bang for your buck.  The salmon was done nicely, though this sauce that was spoken of was hardly apparent.  The rice and asparagus that accompanied the dish were perfectly cooked.  In the course of eating again we were out of drinks and the empty glasses again sat at the edge of the table, where I would learn they would spend the rest of the night since he hustled past plenty of times without stopping.  Our final course desert arrived, Tasty we both enjoyed.So in the end would I go again.  Unfortunately probably not.  The food was quite flavorful, but the portions do not represent the price tag, and being dodged for drinks in the almost 3 hours we were there was frustrating.  I would think that would be a no brainer, hello we want wine and cocktails, we drink more your tip goes up, sadly no.

Restaurant name  98 South

Review Text :
9/1898 South is open for business again!  When did this happen?A friend and I stopped in for a drink and checked out the band and two singers for a bit.  I really liked the female singer- she had lovely strong vocals and danced energetically along to the song.  I only heard her sing once, and her other partner sang to the style of Frank Sinatra, my friend's favorite, for the rest of the time we were there.  I decided to try the mojito, while my friend ordered a Miller Light.  The bartender, with big blonde hair and a very ample, um, countenance, handed me my drink after a few minutes and had to ask what my pal was having again.  While she retrieved his bottle from the fridge, I tried the mojito.  I wished I hadn't.  It was VERY HEAVY on the mint syrup.  I'm used to drinks made w/ muddled fresh mint, but if she had used a light hand on the syrup, I probably wouldn't have minded.  I had asked if she'd re-do the drink, and she said "sure," but not w/out showing her dissatisfaction.  She returned w/ two glasses- the revised drink and leftovers from the original, should I "want to have more alcohol."  As she handed him his beer, he gave her his credit card, to which she SHOUTED back a "What do you want to do with this!?"  He was so taken aback, he had repeated the question and almost retorted back an apt response, but decided against it, just to help speed the transaction along.  I'm just glad that my companion enjoyed the jazz accompaniment, bec. I felt so bad he had to pay $12 for that terrible mojito drink, which he had me abandon after taking a photo of it.  Lesson learned: Just like with food menu selections, I should find out how they prepare their drinks.  (I really did think that a nice place like this wouldn't cut corners and use such saccharin-sweet syrups...)---10/16Just received an email from "Iolanda" who wanted to clarify that a.)  98 South only serves Bud Light.  Our bad.  My friend did order a Miller Lite, but did have to settle with a Bud light.b.)  98 South does not use mint syrup- only fresh mint and simple syrup.  Whatever they used, it was very heavy with too-sweet syrup.  So bad was the experience for my friend that he swears never to try another mojito again.  Not even one made by yours truly- ask the people I served at a party months ago... I can make a decent mojito!c.)  She swears her credit card statement went "What do you want me to do with this?  Go shopping?"  Sorry, sweetie, but my friend and I both disagree.  In the end, my friend paid $12 for a lousy drink I had to abandon, and you still received a tip, bec. my friend is still a gentleman.  d.)  Our bartender's name is Iolanda.Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!

Restaurant name  Volcano Grille

Review Text :
Been passing by Volcano Grille a lot these days and the Husband and I finally decided to check them out.  (Didn't hurt that they had a gift certificate on restaurant.com either.)  We definitely were surprised with what we got.First off - Volcano Grill is a fast food Japanese restaurant.  Walking in, there's the counter and register right in front of you.  You put your order in and pay first, then grab your condiments and take a seat.  Our food was brought to us in to go containers despite the fact that we were 'dining in'."The Plate" options include your choice of protein (filet mignon, shrimp, wild alaskan salmon, shredded crab, chicken breast, or vegetarian); choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein; choice of cucumber salad or ginger dressing salad; and choice of grilled vegetables or 3 chicken gyozas.  Your price is determined by the protein choice.For the two of us, we choice three plate options.* Filet Mignon Plate with Brown Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and Ginger Dressing Salad ($9.85) - The beef was tasty and the grilled veggies mostly consisted of napa cabbage.  * Shrimp Plate with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Generous with the shrimp and tasty too!  The gyozas were enjoyable as well.  The cucumber salad is a pickled salad.* Wild Alaskan Salmon with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Although it wasn't bad, the salmon was our least favorite.They did get the orders mixed up a bit (wrong side or wrong salad with our protein choice) but we did get everything we wanted.  (Not a big deal since we were sharing, more of a concern if you're picking up for a bunch of different people.)  Although the price says $9.85, I think he may have rang us up for a higher price.  So double check.I also ordered two regular soft drinks ($1.49) but he rang us up for two large ones ($1.79).  Which wasn't a big deal since we were dining in and they have the cool iced tea machine and soda fountain to help yourself to.  In the condiments section, they have a bunch of different 'special' sauce that you can help yourself to.  Ultimately, you don't need them, but they are nice to have.  (Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Sweet Onion Chili, Japanese Salsa, and Spicy Miso)They pride themselves on a menu that has nothing over ten dollars, which is true.  They also offer a cheaper "The Bowl" option, which comes with white rice and grilled vegetables. Overall, the food was good.  It's more of a lunch option, not some place you'd go out for dinner though.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.  This is far from a teppanyaki experience though! 3.5 starsThanks to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place. Wherever my job takes me, when lunch time comes around, I do a search of my bookmarks and Volcano Grille is what came up so off I went!This place is kind of hidden in a small plaza on the corner of Warm Springs Rd and Tenaya. If you are not paying attention, you can easily drive right by it. I guess the plaza they are in is still pretty new because some of the suites are still unoccupied. So I go with the Bento Box. For 3.99 you choose 2 sides from Yakisoba, Fried Rice, White Rice, Brown Rice, Veggies, Gyoza, or Salad. Then you can pick 2 to 3 meat choices each for a charge. Steak is 3.49, Salmon is 3.49, Veggies are 2.49, Chicken is 1.99, and Shrimp is 3.59. I chose double Chicken, Brown Rice, and Salad.Everything I had on my plate was good and you can tell that it just came off the grill. If you want to, there is a Sauce Bar where they have different sauces you can put on or dip your meat in. I recommend that you get a small serving of each in the plastic cups they provide so you can taste each one. That way you can discover what sauces you favor the most and just get more of that. Also, don't be shy to mix any of the sauces. So far my favorite sauces are the sweet garlic and the spicy teriyaki. I mixed those two together and man, I got the best of both worlds in one cup. Service is decent. I was greeted accordingly and was explained the process once I told them I was a first timer. Had to wait for my food a bit but I understand it takes a bit of time to cook it. Of course, if you have lots of people here, it will take a lot longer for your food to get to you.The ambience of the place has a laid back relax and take your time eating kind of feel to it. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs not to mention more outside.Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The only thing that I think could improve would be the meat portions. I doubled my chicken but when I got done, it seemed like I could have eaten more. Other than that, it's a solid 4 stars and woudnt mind eating here whenever im in the area.

I like burritos.  I like Indian food.  I like ridiculously surreal moments.Zyggy's offers a little bit of all of them.Zyggy's Rolls are like burritos, wrapped in paratha and filled with a variety of meats, or paneer (cheese) or aloo (potatoes).  I couldn't pick, so I went for both paneer AND aloo in one roll.  Because I'm greedy.  And awesome.Now, for the atmosphere.  First off, the old Basil Thai has been painted with nearly neon paint creating some super exotic, fanciful jungletastic cruise.  A woman looking frighteningly like Aishwarya Rai is painted on the wall chatting with a creepy looking guy.  Screeching monkeys and howling tigers are painted on the dim walls as well in bright colors.  Now imagine this space--filled with bluegrass music.  That's right, kinda jungly background, competing against the joys of twangling banjos.  Greatest thing ever.Until you realize your'e being served by super hippie white guys with long blond dreds who are working in a pseudo Indian restaurant and snapping along to bluegrass twangs.  What the hell is this place?Awesome, that's what it is.The food is delicious, spiced to your specifications, and fantastic.  The restaurant is a terrifyingly bizarre mishmash of everything, but it comes together.  So go eat a semi-Indian burrito contraption surrounded by painted monkeys, a Bollywood starlet, and white boy dreds all about.Awesome.

I'M SO HAPPY FOOTBALL SEASON IS HERE!and i practically live here... at native ny'er.no, i'm not a regular here because this is the best sports bar in town... and no, it's not because they have amazing food or anything.it just happens to be located across the street from where i live, and tragically (yes, tragically) arizona NEVER televises my NINERS or GIANTS games, so i'm forced to set up camp here like some deranged sports lunatic. i can only imagine what the staff thinks of me. i've shown up with my 2 yr old nephew in tow, with out of town friends, my brother, a gaggle of girlfriends, a rowdy group of guy friends, even a date or two. i even stopped in once by myself because i HAD to see the NY jets/eagles preseason game on my lap top. (yes, i bought the Preseason Pass on NFL.com, soooo worth it) i probably could have watched the game on my lap top at home, but didn't want to.so here's my take on their food. it's bar food. it does the job. the wings are too bready, but the beer is always cold. the bartenders are the best of the best. i forget his name, but one of the bartenders is really hilarious. he tells the funniest stories and always remembers exactly what i drink. bonus points for a heavy pour.and the best part... besides that it's cave-like dark and has about a million massive TV's? the arctic-blasting air conditioning! is always turned WAY UP. seriously, on a 112 degree day, it feels like heaven. they do have a nice patio area with misters, but it's still been way too hot to sit out there. perhaps now with the temps dropping and fall approaching, the patio will be a great place to watch games. we'll see.yeah so, if you're ever looking for me and can't seem to find me, odds are i'll be here. at the bar. like some crazed sports chick, clutching my beer and yelling at the TV.ok this review must come to an abrupt end. the patriots/bengals game is starting, i gotta go. GO PATS!

RATING: I would rate this place a 3.5!WHERE: In Town Square, right next to Blue Martini!WHY: Sandwiches are for OLYMPIANS (ie. There is a sandwich called the olympian), haha.WHAT: So with all the times I have been to Town Square, my family and I decided we were hungry right after we got out of a movie! We debated as to where we would eat and try out, and one of my cousins recommended this place! I'm glad he did, because I this would make it my first time, and I love trying new places! =DI had the Naked Evader sandwich!! This sandwich included grilled pastrami, swiss cheese, and veggies!! It is usually made with mustard, but instead of mustard I wanted to sub it for mayo. So, the downside to this story was I didn't get my order to my liking! BOO! The worker who was taking my order also didn't ask me what size sandwich I wanted! The service was a little closer toward the negative sign.Overall, this place was just goo- not great. It was roughly about $10 for a sandwich, a little pricier than normal. The sandwiches weren't as meaty as I would have expected either.*NOTE: If you do decide that you love the place, if you purchase any of their apparel (shirts are $15, beanies are $12) and wear it, you get 25% off your entire order!

Dined here just this past Saturday evening and well let's just say that this place has officially managed to restore my faith in buffets.Typically I'd never go to a buffet, reflecting on that "tried one, tried em' all" mantra.NOT THE CASE HERE^^^^!My family totally peer pressured us into accompanying them to Lin's Grand Buffet and admittedly after the 4-5 hour drive out from So Cal, ....we were seeing mirages and envisioning Flintstone sized T-bone steaks appearing upon the side of the road...Walked into this place and GOOD GRAVY!!! I became vague and delusional from all of the food choices. There was a bit of a wait but it expired as we simultaneously paid upfront for the meal. Shortly thereafter we were seated and then it went down like four flat tires!!!Picture Ontario Mills Mall (if you're in Southern California) or the Minnesota "Mall of America". There's absolutely no way upon visiting you could ever fathom conquering each and every store within a one day visit.That was my sentiment here. I felt DEFEATED.From the salad bar complete with mussels and shrimp....down to the orange chicken, soups, teriyaki steak....then over to the Mongolian station which sits adjacent a steak preparer, whereas you can request your cut of steak and have it prepared to your liking.This place has EVERRRRYTHING!!!!! Seriously. Californians are getting so reamed....paying more for less. Nothing in So Cal has come close to this place well unless the name is followed by "casino" and even then, you're paying twice as much accompanied by the cost of parking.Hands down, I would definitely be willing to travel completely out of my way to come back here. I had 5 plates of food (and provided a star for each plate, lol) and left stuffed yet ....I still don't feel remotely as if I came close to sampling everything.This place is the TRUTH!

I think the only thing I can say I am guilty to like is their empanadas and cheese sauce but how to you eff up fried dough stuffed with meat and some melted cheese?I came because I'm hella bored with the foods around the house that I frequent and we haven't stepped into a On the Border for a while. Big mistake. Look now I can't quite possibly prove that my cousin did not give me a stomach flu the night before with his BBQ, but no one else is sick.  Yes, I wasn't feeling great before eating, but it was mostly related to being hungry. I was in pain a few hours after and was throwing up and riding the porcelain bus so frequently that I wish I had a padded toilet seat. It's day two and I haven't eaten and I'm just sipping on pediatric electrolyte....Slowly, because drinking too much causes severe pains. This place is no bueno!A letter going out to On the Border CEO Clark in todays snail mail.August 21, 2013Stephen V. ClarkChief Executive OfficerOn the Border Corporate Headquarters2201 West Royal LaneSuite 240Irving, TX 75063Mr. Clark.I thought I would write to you today to let you know that I have been a loyal customer of your restaurant chain for many years. When I travel on business and get to my hotel I usually look to see if one of your On the Border restaurants is in the area and at least once a week I will wind up having dinner there or just hang out in the cantina for a while. Most often on business trips I visit your outlet in Kennesaw Georgia where my company is located.When I moved from Connecticut to North Las Vegas in the fall of 2011, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of your restaurants not far away in Centennial (5630 Centennial Center Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89149). I actually found out about this particular On the Border because I received an email from your corporate office regarding a free lunch for Veterans Day or Memorial Day 2012 (I can't recall exactly which one.)And this is where my problems with your organization began and why I will no longer visit your restaurants.1. I went to the Centennial location for the advertised Veterans special; I sat down and asked for the Veterans Day menu and I was summarily told that this particular establishment does not follow corporates advertising and marketing campaigns. I was not pleased, however, I still ate there that day.2. The week of August 4th 2013 I took my son to your restaurant. My son is 3 months shy of his 21st birthday and he is an active duty United States Marine (at the time on leave from Okinawa Japan.) While here in the Las Vegas area, my son has never had an issue sitting in a restaurant cantina or bar as long as he is not consuming alcoholic beverages. On this particular occasion we were going to order lunch while sitting in a booth along the windows as far away from the bar as possible. It was not long before we were summarily kicked out of the cantina into the regular seating area. I was informed that since he is not 21 he couldn't be in the cantina. Well, it was annoying but if that's your corporate policy, I figured we would get over it.3. At least twice a month my wife and I visit this location for Taco Tuesday. The day before my son returned to his Okinawa unit (August 13, 2013), we returned to your Centennial location for $1.25 Taco Tuesday. I walked in the restaurant and mentioned to the manager about what happened the week before, that we could not sit in the cantina, but we wanted Taco Tuesday. He told us he could not serve us Taco Tuesday specials in the main restaurant and that since my son was not 21 and could not go in the cantina, he could not take advantage of the Tuesday special! He wasn't very pleasant about it either.After I gave your manager a piece of my mind, my son and I did an about face and ate at one of your competitors locations down the street (in their cantina no less!)As stated above, I will no longer visit any of your locations, local or otherwise.Sincerely,

While waiting on a phone order of sweet potato fries from Gallagher's yesterday, I discovered a restaurant on the other end of the block sporting a "Grand Opening" banner (where Moe's Southwest Grill used to be).  Yay!  Another venue offering soul food with candied yams on the menu!!  Since none of the employees could answer my food allergy concerns that afternoon, I'd have to call the next morning.Earlier today I was able to get my food issues cleared and decided I'd have a late lunch (or early dinner) of BBQ platter with three meats (choice of beef brisket, chicken on the bone, pulled pork, or rib tips).  I ordered the meats dry since the BBQ had allergens.  Dinners come with two sides and cornbread, so I chose candied yams and brown sugar baked beans and asked that the cornbread be packaged to go.(Before I placed my order, I asked if I could sample the meat since the last time I tried BBQ meats on the dry side, I found them quite tasteless; the cook was more than happy to hand me a sample of the brisket.)Liked the brisket; the meat was so tender and moist and  tasted like a smoky version of corned beef.  The chicken was good, too, but the meat was still red and slightly raw when I sliced into it for a peek underneath.  I showed it to the server who started to say that the chicken is usually served that way, but she took it back for more time in the oven when I asked.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very charred when it was returned to me.  I was able to salvage most of it after scraping the burnt skin off.  While the first two meats were delicious on their own, w/o BBQ sauce, the rib tips did not fare so well.  I liked the texture of the meat, but it definitely could use more complexity. While I was able to determine that the dessert menu (outside source so info on ingredients wasn't easily available) is pretty much off-limits to me, I am not in the least disheartened...  The candied yams and brown sugar baked beans (both made from in-house recipes) were so delectable and sweet, they're almost like dessert, but with added benefits- vitamins, fiber, and protein!  Mmm... LOVED the spices used to flavor the yams.  Yes, there are the usual suspects of butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar, but I detect something else... almond extract!  Go and have a try yourself and see if you can help me detect what these flavors are :)  And the baked beans!  Red peppers and hatch green chilies really make this side dish sing!  Beans, beans, the musical fruit...  Breakfast menu is served all day [steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy (thickened w/ cornstarch), scrambles, and country burritos, to name a few], and lunch and dinner menus [fried chicken and (Belgian) waffles, burgers, wings, BBQ tacos and wraps, sandwiches and po'boys, chicken fried steaks, etc.] start at 11a.  I'm already looking forward to taking my grandmother and cousin here on my next weekend off!Notes to owners/manager:  1.This easily could've been a four-star review, but I thought it poor form to send back a badly-charred chicken.  I didn't think it was wrong of me to send back the bloody leg... (Ring!!  "Hello, Salmonella poisoning, How may I hurt you?") 2. I was told that the addition of sweet potato fries is being considered- please don't take too long to decide Yes! :D (With a good dusting of cinnamon-sugar, please!)3. Please change your font printing on the front and back take-home menu covers.  The current choice (white print on black and superimposed on a white background) is almost illegible.4. Kudos on having DEDICATED fryers for your fried fish (batter contains corn), chicken, and other meats (fried pork chops and chicken fried steaks)!!  Not only do dedicated fryers limit the flavor transfers of these varied meats, but they also benefit your patrons that may have food allergies (fish, spices, and other ingredients).It was a busy and rough day at work and I needed some comfort that only some chicken and greens could provide. I was craving some soul food. I spotted Aileen's write up and rounded up some of my coworkers for some hopefully yummy food. We arrived at the storefront location and immediately noticed the nice decor inside. This is a walk up and order establishment with a very large menu. Be sure to grab a menu and step aside so you can read the whole menu or you might miss something. I finally decided on the chicken and waffle combo and was given a number to sit and wait. I was told that my fried chicken would take a little longer because all their chicken is fried when only when ordered. My friends received their orders and the table was already full of food and my food was still coming! My fried chicken and waffles with a side of collard greens and red beans w/rice arrived. It was a lot of food! I wish it was a lot of AMAZING food, but it wasn't amazing. It was middle of the road, and unremarkable. Now don't get me wrong, sometimes middle of the road is all you need to get the job done at lunchtime! I just wished for a little more spice, zip, and flavor. My fried chicken was freshly fried but the batter was just..batter. My chicken was also rather dry. My red beans and rice were almost bland. I found myself pouring hot sauce on all of my food. I guess I just wasn't wowed. It wasn't poorly made, but it wasn't made with lots of seasoning which I expect from soul food. I would like to give Fat Daddy's another try. I love supporting locally owned business, especially when they're situated among large chains! Looking forward to another look-see!10/09Had an impromptu breakfast here with a friend.  The plan was for me to show him how great a breakfast one could have at The Farm at South Mountain's Morning Glory Cafe, but my car overheated and lost power at 32nd St. and Baseline, so I asked him if he would please find out if "Down Home Kitchen" is still open for business.  Thankfully,  he came back to report that "Fat Daddy's Down Home Kitchen" is still open, but that it was "totally dead in there."  Poor FD.  I told my friend that I wasn't surprised since a few of the people I know that have tried FD's found the prices to be too high for the quality of food offered.  However, we were hungry and circumstances forced us to try having breakfast here.Price-wise, my friend couldn't complain.  He enjoyed his breakfast of scrambled eggs with sausage, bacon, and cheese, although he did accuse me of dragging him to an early grave :(  He wasn't complaining, he said, since he liked grease-spoons,  just sayin' is all :)  Seems like he's better at choosing the better entree (see Joe's Farm Grill), since my biscuits and gravy with extra sausage links, gratis (many thanks to our server, who received a very nice tip!) were among the most undistinctive I've ever tasted, especially after having, for two consecutive mornings, the best biscuit and gravy dish at Scottsdale's Daily Dose!Perhaps next time I'll just order the fail-safe candied yams and brown sugar baked beans...

First to Review?I wish someone would have taken the time to save me the trouble..Very small selection, lackluster at best. The fried chicken looked yellow?WTF!They have seafood,BBQ,Mongolian,Chinese,Mexicano,American,Italian and a 6 item salad bar.plus a dessert station.The big attraction is the Mongolian which is made to order-NOT for me.I tried a little of everything and was pretty disappointed but I filled up on eclairs & cheesecake.It beat having to stand in line 2 hrs @ Green Valley Ranch but I wouldn't go out of my way.

West Charlotte is a bit of a restaurant desert. Off of I-485 this way, there aren't many places to eat. And this is a relatively new strip plaza, so when I pulled over to let Yelp find me a late dinner, I was pleased when this popped up.I chose the fresh spring rolls with shrimp to start. These were prepared very quickly and were pretty good. A nice portion of shrimp in there with a bowl of cold peanut sauce for dipping.But before I'd even manage to dig into a second spring roll, my Pad Thai with chicken arrived. Good texture and plenty of chicken, but the flavor was rather bland. No heat at all.There were a couple of other tables, but they already had their food when I arrived. So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy? Or should I have spoken up?

Everything here is made fresh onsite by awesomely surly Greek kitchen-studs who mutter "OPA!" with phoned-in enthusiasm whenever someone puts a tip in the jar. But I don't care how surly those motherfuckers are -- they make some BOMB-ASS food!On my visit, I had saganaki (a/k/a flaming fried cheese), lentil soup (!!!) and a pomegranate chicken wrap. Everything was EXCELLENT! My friend also had soup and a gyro platter, and the total was around $45.I will DEFINITELY come here again. Solidly-unpretentious-yet-pleasant atmo, excellent Greek/Mediterranean food, and super-reasonable prices. OPA!!This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!The downside:There is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.The cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.The ultimate self-serve fountain station costs $3.00 per person. The ambiance is nice - no complaints there.For the best experience at Market grille eat here for dinner. Lunch service is more casual and quick with customers ordering at the counter, but dinner consists of table side wait service. Pumpkin fans have to try the pumpkin mushroom soup. Perfect for the cold weather, the smooth, creamy soup has a pronounced pumpkin flavor in this vegetable-based soup. The Greek salad that accompanied my entree was perfect for sharing. The chicken skewer entree comes with one skewer full of moist, well seasoned cubes of chicken and a veggie skewer with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The Greek trio entree was perfect for sampling the spanakopita, moussaka, and pastitsio. The spanakopita was excellent with its flaky layers of pastry covering gooey cheese and spinach. The moussaka showed some great flavors with beef, eggplant and potatoes covered in a béchamel sauce. Rice, typically an afterthought with most dishes, was buttery and soft with a lightness that is all too rare.Dinner prices are affordable, service was friendly and efficient, and the execution of all our dishes was spot on. Market Grille may have made its way into my rotation of inexpensive dinners with one of the best Mediterranean meals I've had lately.

Great bar!! This place has it all. The food is seriously good... like seriously delicious. The staff is overflowing with super hot girls that are fun and friendly. Some are a little feisty (I'm talking about you, Staci), but that just makes the place that much more fun. I love coming in here for a quick bite and a few drinks... usually that turns into taking a cab home. Those are the best nights. This bar seems to have a good mix of fun drinkers and quality gaming. There's definitely room for both. I highly recommend the braised pot roast and the jalapeno mashed potatoes. Some seriously good comfort food. The prime rib sandwich is pretty amazing too. So far I've never had something that wasn't delicious. Great atmosphere. I'm not sure if wings are on the menu, but I've ordered them and they were really good. Kudos to the kitchen.

The asian fusion food at Wazuzu that I ate last night was AMAZING! Off the Wazuzu menu, you can order thai, japanese (sushi), and/or chinese. I am still day-dreaming about the melt-in-your mouth dishes! I went with my cousin, aunt, and uncle on our last night in Vegas... Here's what we loved:- pork potstickers: four big, juicy potstickers with yummy dipping sauce. These were so amazing that we had to get a second order!- thai beef salad: very spicy with great thai flavors. I mostly ate the veggies rather than the beef... this dish tasted SO fresh!- pork & shrimp shumai: four much small pieces; these were a bit too small in my opinion but very good and came in a cute little box- pineapple fried rice: pork, chicken, and prawns served within fried rice served in a pineapple. Most tables seemed to order this as I saw a lot of pineapples going by. Pineapple fried rice is always good but this was the best I've ever had!- bbq platter: tons of chicken, pork, etc in a chinese bbq style with a yummy dipping sauce- salt and pepper prawns: good taste but I would have preferred non-fried prawns (I didn't know these ones would be fried...). The prawns were huge though!- green tea and red tea mochi balls: I LOVE mochi and these were great ones!The prices were a bit high ($10-$14 for appetizers, $13 - $26 for a main) but really very reasonable for Vegas especially for such unbelievable food! The servers were all very nice though not very talkative and the venue overlooking the casino is nice and comfy. I thought that Red 8 at the Wynn was great but Wazuzu at Encore is even better!Highlight here is the crystal dragon. You can't miss the main feature and its beautiful, sleek & shiny and its truly a piece of art. The food is ok and at the end you're left with a large bill. You can get food for a fraction of the price just down the street in Chinatown and it tastes much better. With that said, you are at Encore and nothing is cheap here.When I worked here I would comp everything & that ruined me for life because I was so spoiled. I so miss those days! Now if I'm paying over $20 for a sushi roll it better be amazing. As I said, the food is good but not mind blowing. I've had better sushi, pad thai & bbq buns. If you find yourself at Encore or Wynn, splurge a little more and go to Botero, SW or Wing Lei. Yes these places are pricier but I've never had anything at them that was just good. Society Cafe and La Cave are also good options if you're not interested in splurging even more.The service is great everywhere at these properties and every restaurant; even the casual ones are gorgeous.

This place was pretty good.  One of those "safe bets" when it comes to pizza restaurants.  Nothing really out of the ordinary, but still much better than any chain.   Of course it's in a strip mall, hello this is Arizona remember.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good, but it ain't no Cibo!Experience all the pretension of California Pizza Kitchen with none of the service or pizza! Seriously, how snooty and obnoxious is it when the drinks section lists only an assortment of bottled waters and Italian sodas, then at the bottom in small print: "If you simply MUST have it, we also carry Cola, Lemon-Lime, and Dr. P." As though they are doing us lowly soft drink partakers a favor by sinking to our level. Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their "cola" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo). We only came here because we won a $50 gift card, and I would never come back. The hostess was nice, but the service ended there. Our server was snippy, looked angry the whole time, screwed up our drinks twice, then snapped at us when we tried to correct her. Our pizza was only barely cut, we mostly had to rip it apart ourselves, and the busboy kept trying to take our plates before we were done and without asking. The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory, but not very good in practice. There were very few options in the way of regular pizza if you didn't want to try one of their many "theme" pizzas (bbq chicken pizza, pasta pizza, enchilada pizza, etc). We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza, which was tough and undercooked, and the "Meaty Meaty" pizza, which was okay, but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza. Overall, it was a free meal, and we left full, but it was uncomfortable, and only moderately tasty. I would certainly not come here again and pay,  given their extraordinary prices (a large and small pizza, two sodas, and a garlic bread appetizer for $52???), mediocre pizza, and lousy service. Definitely skip this place.

Je dois avouer que Liverpool House a été un deuxième choix, car originalement, c'est au Joe Beef que je voulais aller. Une fois que j'ai réalisé qu'il faut réserver au moins un mois en avance pour Joe Beef, mais que juste à côté il y a ce joli petit resto, créer des mêmes personnes, je me suis dis que ça valait la peine d'essayer. Le résultat a été super et je suis heureuse d'y être allée au lieu.On a essayé d'un peu de tout. La salade de betteraves, l'entrée de calmars farcis de homard, les pétoncles grillés, les côtes levées, le brownie et les beignets à l'érable. Tout était simplement dé-li-cieux! La cuisson était parfaite, les portions généreuses sans être gigantesque, et les saveurs....oh....les saveurs....j'y rêve encore! En plus, le service est l'un des meilleurs que j'ai vu. Pour notre vin, la serveuse nous a même emmenée des bouteilles pour goûter selon ce qu'on a commandé et nos préférences afin que l'on puisse choisir le bon verre. Je n'ai jamais vu ça ailleurs, et c'est  une touche spéciale simple mais extrêmement efficace pour gagner une place spéciale dans mon cœur.

Review Text :
First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very "breezy" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces. LB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6. I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience! First impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood.4 stars for now because it's not palette and because my food was still hot. 2 huge things that make local breeze pretty damn good. Mimosas are strong so I'm buzzed. I orders a BBQ burger with a side of 2 fried eggs and crafted my own egg burger. Fucking bomb. Should be on the menu.i will continue to give Local Breeze my patronage, but i will say...the first cold plate of food i get, i'm outta there.Moving forward, you will probably be able to find me here every Sunday with my laptop day drinking to my hearts content. They have a fabulous patio with comfortable furniture and a relaxed vibe and one kick-ass mojito. I also REALLY enjoyed the chopped salad (veganized, of course).My only complaint is that it is way too expensive. Hoping that they run some awesome weekend specials so I don't break the bank hanging out!Oooooo just a quick update: BICYCLE DISCOUNT: Be Green! - Ride your bicycle to Local Breeze for Brunch and receive a 10% discount on your entire check.This place holds a lot of sweet sweet memories for me.. first dates, second dates, fun bags, binge drinking after my car got broken into, St. Patty's day pre-gaming.. I love Local Breeze, allow me to count the ways..Its like this.. You walk in, and BAM, you're immediately on vacation. The atmosphere is so super chill, and quite frankly one of the most random places I've ever been to. Fantastic (enormous) patio with cozy chairs next to fire-pits, tiki torches, bag pits, waitresses that seem to constantly be stoned, an owner who tells me that I have a beautiful head, decent breakfast and also a great dinner. Last night we had the filet Mignon and the biggest Caesar salad Ive ever seen in my entire life. I'm not kidding, there was literally 5 pounds of salad on my plate, it was shocking.. I could have fed that psycho Octomoms entire family with my leftovers. Ive had several things here and have never been bummed.. the hummus plate is the jam, a mound of delicious crispy pitas, 3 different types and all of them equally delicious. Burgers are juicy and huge and fn' BOMB. Breakfast is tasty, but slightly overpriced in my book. Full bar included, and who doesn't love that? On top of it all, the parking situation doesn't completely suck.. lots of street parking is available in all directions.Only complaint is this.. one morning I came here and wanted this crazy alcoholic coffee concoction my buddy told me about, its basically 10% coffee and 90% booze.. 4 different kinds of booze, and rather than granting my wish, she told me I was crazy and that the drink would cost roughly $30 because of all the different shots that are in it.. are you effing kidding me? If I EVER pay $30 for a drink it better be some decent Whiskey or there better be gold dust and muscle relaxers flying out of it. Okay, that's a little extreme..  but seriously, I'm not gonna pay that. Now that I really think about it, everything there is a little over priced, but the people and atmosphere totally make up for it.Anyway, I heart Local Breeze, and i'm totally looking forward to making many more memories here. Check it out!What a lovely way to end an amazing weekend. I will definitely be returning, and next time it will be on a Saturday instead of a Sunday so we have time to get our day drink on. (They close at 3pm on Sunday) Best Bloody Mary I've ever had. This is not a typo. Perfection! We only had one because of the very busy day of shopping and dodging Auburn fans that lie ahead but trust that this will be rectified soon. We ordered the Sawmill Gravy with Biscuits and the Vegan Sandwich with fries. Both were incredibly tasty, meaning I ate half of my sandwich and stared longingly at the biscuits and gravy, giving in at the last minute by stealing repeated bites. I'm not vegan, I can do that.The table next to us had some sort of french toast concoction that looked out of this world. (Yes, I was the creeper eye raping your french toast. My apologies.) I'm not a huge fan of sweets, especially at breakfast/brunch time but I'm putting this on the list of things to try. Clearly, a list that will grow along with my waistline. nom nom nom The owner is sweet and greets you in a very genuine way upon entering. Not some 16 year old emo kid that doesn't know how to make eye contact. Score!  The service was a little slow, as mentioned in some other reviews but somehow it just kind of flowed with the laid back feeling of the place. The decor takes shabby chic to a new level and has a very relaxed vibe. Kinda makes you want to smoke a big fatty and drink mimosas all day long. Not that I've ever done that...  Places like this make me happy that I live where I do instead of the dreaded 'burbs'. It's nice to see parts of downtown flourish and I will continue to support these establishments by way of alcoholism and emotional eating. Especially if someone else is picking up the tab. You have earned a way into my heart Local Breeze!Back to my belief that service needs to weigh heaviest on expectations in the "service industry," I've got to share an experience at Local Breeze from a recent visit.  My friend ordered a salad without the bacon, but the kitchen apparently missed this request and made it the normal way.Fair enough.... accidents happen. But as we then tried getting the server's attention to fix the situation, he was less than responsive. Finally, after my friend had picked around at her salad for a while and the rest of us finished our meals, the waiter insisted on bringing a new salad. My friend declined the replacement since it had already taken so long and asked, instead, that it be removed from the check. After much ado from the service staff/manager, this was the agreed upon solution.But when the check came, there was a miscellaneous charge of $6.... That was for the portion of the salad that our friend ate. Serious!?!?!? The restaurant would not back down from this position, so they got our $6 and will not likely get another dime. Ever.Too bad... Local Breeze otherwise seems like a nice place with decent food. If only they were better at being a restaurant, I would fully support them.

Review Text :
Having been to the OG location in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, my expectations were going to be high!  I've been a fan of Scott ever since I've tried out some of his recipes from Bold Italio.  Whom I refer to as the anti Mario Batali.  Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms. I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.  The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!This restaurant is in a great spot with nice window views of the Bellagio Fountain ,  Hip and Happening for a Upscale Trattoria and based on how packed it  has hit the ground running on the Strip.Scarpetta serves the best bread basket I have ever seen. And I don't say that lightly.I would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.I might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway.__________*I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt. Now I've got nothing.Cutting edge Italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the Cosmo.  Scarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.For starters, raw is best.  The tuna "scusci" is excellent.  The tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  The raw yellowtail dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  Finally the wagyu tartare.  Wow, the use of the hazelnuts and Parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  For pasta, its gotta be the duck and foie gras ravioli.  Other yelpers said they loved it.  It really is good.  The pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.Top mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped veal loin, served with sweetbreads.  The flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.The wine list is very good with a nice balance of Italian wines (not just super Tuscans).  Vintage depth is OK.  Prices are in line with Vegas resorts.Service is very efficient.Overall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.Recommended.A-OK is what Scarpetta was. I was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-Scott Conant. I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.We have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.Let's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.Here is the breakdown:Hamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.Tuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.Polenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.Black Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.Tasting Menu:Fritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.Spaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!Dessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!We tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting MenuThe bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!Overall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.So Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kiddingI think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon requestStracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-PBlack Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oilOne of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? HmmmThe BF and I had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and Scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. I love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. We were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which I happen to like). People said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  I cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the Bellagio show. It defeated the purpose a little bit....STARTERSWe started off with the raved about bread basket. There was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. If I could order that at the lounge I would. There was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. They give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. Caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.ROASTED SEA SCALLOPS- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. It was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. There was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. It was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with marsala reduction - was one I was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. I've had the spaghetti before in LA (and did not weep) and now that I actually know the Scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, I wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. This was tasty, but it was just a bit TOO rich for such a big plate of it.  Some may love a whole heap, but I'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. We're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..ENTREEMEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO - Came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. If came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.BLACK COD - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. It had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. I've always had black cod aka butterfish in a Asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. The BF preferred the Branzino and so did I.DESSERT ZEPPOLE - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. These were rich pillows of heaven. I love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best I've had. Will come back. Just for these. BROWN BUTTER HAZELNUT CAKE - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. I'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. It had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. This was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. Service was decent. There was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. Service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. A little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. I guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. It was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. I see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so I would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...I don't know if I would do a "all out" dinner here again though.The night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. Overall, Scott Conants place is solid for the Strip and I'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend.I *thought* I knew Italian food.  I thought I had pizza and pasta figured out.I was wrong.Thanks to my dinner at Scarpetta, my appreciation for the sophistication of Italian cuisine is vastly more than it used to be.In other words, Scarpetta gave me an education in fine Italian dining that I'll never forget.It all happened on a Sunday night, which was the only night of the week when I could secure a table at Scarpetta -- a restaurant notorious for its difficulty in scoring a reservation.  After walking through the narrow entrance hall on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel, I was greeted by a spacious and elegantly appointed dining room.  I was lucky enough to have a window seat directly overlooking the Bellagio fountains.I quickly received a menu from my kind and gracious server, Giampaolo, and found myself drooling over its mouthwatering options.  While I waited, Giampaolo brought by a breadbasket with sides of citrus-inflused olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese.  The breadbasket was superb -- especially the stromboli with cheese and succulent salami baked inside.I wasn't in the mood for wine, so I started by ordering of their signature cocktails -- a St. Germain/prosecco spritzer.  Sweet and refreshing, it was a lovely start to dinner.For an appetizer, I had the yellowtail crudo.  The raw fish was extremely fresh and beautifully seasoned.  I especially enjoyed that little punch of sea salt that hits you after the rest of the fish is gone.  (Who said that Japanese restaurants have a monopoly on raw fish?)The real show-stopper was the entree -- duck and foie gras ravioli.  I don't claim to be a foie gras expert, but this dish was revelatory.  The ravioli dough was delicate and flavorful.  The duck and foie gras filling could only be described as pure decadence.  The sauce drizzled on top provided a beautiful contrast.  This was one of the top dishes that I've ordered in any restaurant -- ever.After the ravioli, I was too full to order dessert, but Giampaolo was still kind enough to bring over two complementary petit fours -- a cinnamon biscotti cookie and a chocolate truffle.  Both were outstanding.Everything about Scarpetta is outstanding -- from the service, to the ambiance, to the extraordinary food.  If I could, I'd get my culinary education here every day.No words can describe how happy this experience made me. I was in Vegas for a slightly belated celebration of my birthday, and a timely celebration of my friend's. Scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and I am so glad! The restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. The waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything. But who cares about that? The food... it was ridiculous! To begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but Scarpetta bread is next level! There were some regular rolls which were bomb. But there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! I thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but I figured I was hallucinating. Nope! It was phenomenal. The bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. All delicious!So I could have left happy at this point. But my food slayed me. I think I may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. I ordered the Black Fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). Need I say more? It tasted better than it sounds. It was more than worth the $42 it cost. I also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and black cod (also amazing). But lets be real...I won.As a dessert we shared:Bombolone - Basically an italian doughnut. There were five. Two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was BETTER than nutella! Never thought I'd say that. It also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.Amadei Chocolate Cake: The richest most delicious chocolate cake you'll ever have. The inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. It also came with toasted almond gelato. Also heavenly.I implore you to try this restaurant when in Vegas.I was lucky enough to spend a semester studying abroad in Rome and Sicily, it was easily the greatest experience of my life. Ever since I have been on never ending search to find an Italian restaurant that can match the authentic flavors that Italy is famous for.... the search is over, Scarpetta is that restaurant. Squid ink pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, yet it's almost impossible to find on a menu in the states. Scarpetta does it justice. The "black fettuccine" is cooked to perfection and topped with king crab, squid, shrimp, and lobster corral breadcrumbs... ho l'acquolina in bocca. Scarpetta also has the best Italian dessert I have tasted in years. The bomboloni is heavenly. They are nutella filled donuts lightly fried and served with banana gelato. They conjure up memories of sitting on the banks of the Tevere river eating bomboloni and people watching in the Italian sun. La vita è breve, festeggiare con gli amici, l'amore come non c'è domani.Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.While it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic décor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience.On Saturday night we were invited to Scarpetta  for dinner by an old friend. We had dinner reservations at 8:30 pm and it was hard getting into the Cosmopolitan Hotel because of all the traffic. We got seated right next to the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountain. The menu is very simple. We had the following:Softshell crabs             3/5 stars the crabs were extra large. Deep fried and kinda                                                         greasy.Polenta                           5/5 stars off the hook good. excellent must order!Heirloom Tomato Salad 4/5  stars   good fresh and dressed well.Yellowtail sashimi           4/5  stars   4 small thinly slices pieces. Normal sushi fare.Duck Foie Gras Ravioli     4/5 stars OK not the gastronomic orgasm as other yelpers                                                              mentionedSpaghetti                           4/5 stars excellent al dente, Barzano Fish                     5/5 stars best entree' of the night well cooked.Cheese cake                     4/5 stars OK small poker chip sized.Strawberry Souffle'           5/5 stars AMAZING ! light great strawberry flavor with a                                                              dollop of vanilla ice cream. If you can get a seat next to the window over looking the Bellagio Fountain and the Las Vegas Strip the meal is well worth the prices. Service was excellent.Scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  Bellagio Fountains. To get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. Ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. They also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. Starting with the notable wine list, I decided to pair my dinner with a glass of Malbec.Shortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.Our server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail. For our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak.The yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. The duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. The steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. Since we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  The food timing was excellent! I wish I had more room for dessert but I was too full by the end of my meal.Overall, i enjoyed my dining experience at Scarpetta.a bachelorette party visit to scarpetta was by happenchance.  ok, i was wearing sky high heels and since there is no golf cart service to shuffle the ladies around...i canceled the she/morton rezzies for new ones at scarpetta which the group agreed to after checking out all the lovely shoes at the cosmopolitan!  plus who doesn't want to dine in style with housemade pasta?i think the folks here were trained at the school of Le Bernadin since they were on pointe with service.  you aren't supposed to notice how many interactions you actually have but they scored big.  i notice but i'm a foodie fanatic.LOVED that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.  boo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).bread:insert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.appetizers and entrees:- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.wine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  we would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.tip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required.With so many cooking competition shows out there, I've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  Certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others I'm not as familiar with.  Chopped's Scott Conant was one of the latter, but I can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...SCOTT CONANT IS BAD ASS.Although it may not have been the original Scarpetta in NY, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  I'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with The Spence in Atlanta and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.  Honestly, everything we had was terrific.  It's also easy now to see why Scott Conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - Scarpetta's ranks as the best I've had thus far!-- BREAD BASKET...Complimentary(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#hYFt6DlCGHA332ECJChzLQ)Not normally something I would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  That is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  Well played Scott Conant, well played.-- ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS with Morels, Sugar Snap, Watermelon Radish and Pea Froth...$23(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#V_vEStj9d5Uur3sAloUvZA)My friend and I split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  The scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  The pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.-- DUCK FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with a Marsala Reduction...$27(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#rJ2lg-UKLTLOss3CPgcrYQ)Simply fantastic.  I was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  The ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  Although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!-- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI with Brown Butter, Horseradish, and Toasted Breadcrumbs...$26(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#x9WaFDf-qarVghjn7g-iYA)My friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  The pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  The breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.-- STRAWBERRY SOUFFLÉ with a Rhubarb Compote and Vanilla Gelato...$11(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#UUgJpj3_-6a9_rBmpTbrSA)Not to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  I thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the soufflé had a perfect consistency.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that YOU MUST GET THIS.While the meal itself was amazing, I thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  For some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  It seems other Yelpers have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter Christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.Beyond the food and service though, Scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  The dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the Bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#3OL0vvlkTy4YgBuGuBi7cw).  Unfortunate I was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  Scarpetta, I'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to Vegas.  And considering how often I seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.Bravo Scarpetta!!!Amazing view. Flawless service. Scarpetta is one of those restaurants that will sweep you off your feet. The view that you get while dining here is just breathtaking. I could begin by talking about how delicious their appetizers and main courses are but I would rather talk about their desserts. OMG. Their desserts are to die for. Their strawberry souffle is out of this world. It was light and fluffy as souffles should be but not too sweet. Melts in your mouth the second it touches your tongue. Light and slightly sweet...thinking about brings me joy. The vanilla ice cream adds to how amazing devouring this warm delicious souffle was. We also had the coconut panacotta with guava...silky smooth and just so so good !!The Amaedi Chocolate Cake is what every chocolate lover craves when they think of dessert. Warm melted chocolate in every bite with ice cream on the side *-* Please prepare yourself and do not over eat during dinner. You do not want to skip dessert!!*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***Another restaurant that I've wanted to try now marked off the list.  The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.I was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.I was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.For the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.For the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.For dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!Service was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.You know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? Like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? It's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. This describes my dinner experience at Scarpetta, when I delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced black cod. A bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. My lawd. This must be a dream. It's too good to be true!BAM! Snap back to reality. As I used my fork and knife to draw another piece of that tender cod to my mouth, I spotted a thin black line. Hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. Let me tug at it some more. Lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. The hair was embedded in the cod's skin! I politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if I would like to replace the cod with a different dish. I just wanted another cod. I wanted to return to that euphoria I was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when I discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. Like Forrest Gump says, sh** happens. I understand that, but I'm at Scarpetta. This is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in Las Vegas, owned by the famous Chef Scott Conant. It's not something I would expect to happen here. My waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. I totally appreciate these gestures. Yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. I noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. The meat of my second cod looked a tad raw and it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. There goes my foodie high. Womp womp.The kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. I know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod ASAP since my boyfriend already finished his entree. However, I was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. This could have easily been a four or five star review. We asked for a table next to the window and the views of The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains were stunning. So romantic and beautiful. My boyfriend and I started our dinner with the Tuna "Susci" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. This is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. It was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. We couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. It's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. He said it was good but not amazingly tasty. He was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. The complimentary Amedei Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. The chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.It wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. The rest of the items are pretty solid. The view is the best thing Scarpetta has to offer. And maybe that black cod...when it is cooked properly.This is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas food scene. This is not your father's Olive Garden - this is a fine dining Italian food experience. Side note - it's not inexpensive. I'm happy to say that someone else picked up the tab for my visit and encouraged me to order whatever I wanted, so I did.The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant like this - the entire staff is attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  I had some questions about a few of the dishes and my server didn't give me the old, "hang on, let me check" or the bald faced lie.  I started with the creamy polenta mostly because I've never had creamy polenta before. It was good. Not what I expected, but it was quite tasty. An excellent starter.Since I wasn't paying, I ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.Although I was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and I hated to see it go to waste.  Wow - just Wow.Excellent food and service in a beautifully appointed restaurant.  No, it wasn't cheap but it was well worth the price. Note - they also have a gluten free and vegetarian menus.It was pretty much a perfect evening!We celebrated our 11 year anniversary here & not sure why it look so long to get here as we've tried everything at The Cosmo except for this place! Walking in was a little awkward because you go down a very narrow space & pass the bar to get to the beautiful main dining room. It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood, very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture, lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it. The view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana soufflé (AMAZING)!Now for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles, sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...Had a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did.I've been to Scarpetta in Beverly Hills and enjoyed the food there so I was delighted to see another location at the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar. Ordering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.I'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting.Scott Conant's Scarpetta boasts lavish, dimly lit and woody decor, complete with a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains from the Cosmopolitan. Be sure to make a reservation and if there are only 2 of you dining, request to sit by the window. All of the staff are well-trained and highly professional, delivering an upscale dining experience from start to finish. My sister and I came for a quick dinner before the club and didn't want to get too full, so we only indulged in the starter bread and 1 entree each. The bread basket is exquisite and features 1 piece each of Sourdough, Ciabbata, a salami Stromboli, broccoli Stromboli, and another that I cannot remember. It is accompanied by a white wine olive oil, mascarpone butter, and some type of tapenade. I ordered the famous Spaghetti. As far as I know, this dish only contains 3 ingredients. Noodles, tomato sauce, basil. Yes, the noodles were a perfect al-dente with just a little bite to them. Yes the sauce was fresh and light, sticking to each noodle. Was this worth $24? No. For only $2 more (and more deserving of the price tag), my sister went with the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. The ravioli was optimally thin and there was almost no sauce, making the meat the star. It was a rich dish and could easily be shared if you're also getting an appetizer.   I'm happy to have had my Scarpetta experience and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance, but I don't see any need to come back here for the $24 spaghetti, which is why I settled on 4 stars.So after the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon I decided it was time to carb up! Wait, do you do that before you run? My beautiful girlfriend flew into town to join me and Scarpetta was the perfect place to take her for dinner seeing we were staying at the Cosmo and it wasn't too far of a walk for my trashed legs!  I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. Scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! Thanks

Victory's Cafe is a total VICTORY in my book!We popped into Victory's Cafe to grab a quick bite to eat before a movie.  When we got to the host stand, we were greeted with a big hello and a huge smile.  What a great way to start the meal!  We were seated immediately and had our drink order taken within a minute.  The guy who took our drink order was so happy and friendly.  Our server came over to us within another 2 minutes.  She was friendly and welcoming too, as well as good at her job!  Seriously, everyone in the joint must be on happy pills because they were all so nice.  I am just not used to this at most of the local casino cafes.  It is so nice to be around happy people!The menu here is pretty large with a lot of variety.  They also have a lot of different specials going on throughout the week.  The prices were all very reasonable too, especially when you see how much food you get on your plate!  Almost everything was under $10 for a full meal.We went with the Rueben and Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwiches.  Both were awesome!  I'll start with the Rueben.  It was a triple decker style club style sandwich.  It easily had 1/2 a pound of meat alone on the thing!  It was a super duper tasting Rueben and one of the best ones in town that  have tasted.  The Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich was fantastic as well.  It came with a huge fried chicken breast covered in a spicy Buffalo sauce.  The chicken was cooked perfectly!  It was golden brown with the perfect amount of crunch.  DROOL! The Buffalo sauce was just hot enough to make your nose run a little and give you that oh so good burn on your tongue.  I had it with some blue cheese dressing and it sealed the deal on my love of this sandwich! Now for the beauty that is now as a french fry.  The sandwiches could come with all sorts of sides like potato salad, veggies, and of course FRENCH FRIES.  Seriously, is there even a choice when french fries are an option?  Not in my book, baby!  The fries were thing thin style fries with some sort of coating on them, similar to beer batter.  My fries were the definition of perfection!  They were prepared wonderfully, with a slight crunch on the outside with a little bit of fluffiness on the inside.  Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!!!We aren't regulars at the Cannery, but I see us eating here every time we come to this part of town.  Well now that have have relived last night meal, my mouth is watering for my next meal at Victory's Cafe!

Review Text :
This is easily the best gourmet restaurant near my home.  Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.  Walking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P    My wife got the "Jumbo Shrimp Marnier": shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.I got the "Prince Edward Island Mussels": sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!They don't call the main course "entrees" on their menu.  They're called the "main event".  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy "Macho Man" Savage versus Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.  The osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.  We even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.  Catherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.  I plan on supporting this restaurant more frequently in the future, one martini and mussel at a time.A pleasant and cozy room that seemed to cater to an older (and at least while we were there, douche-free) local crowd.  The tables are too close together to give it a romantic/intimate ambiance and the cushion on my chair kept wiggling and sliding just enough for me to conjure notions of the princess seat-surfing with her dining pea, but overall the place has a very comfortable vibe.We arrived when they opened at 5:00 and found they have a happy hour where you can get $2 off of martinis and appetizers between 5:00 - 6:30 PM at the bar and at a table.  While over 450 martini's selections is libation information overload...for me, we finally decided on the Ginger Lychee & Girl Scout Cookie.  And these are big people martini's at 3 1/2 ounces, complete with apropos garnish...a lychee & a girl scout cookie!Our server, Alex was exceptional from start to finish.  The first clue was his infinite patience as we tried to order a drink through what seemed like a process of studying for a SAT exam coupled with possible wrong multiple choice anxiety.  His service was impeccable; the perfect blend of knowledge and natural and accommodating service, pure perfection.We had:Chicken Pesto Bruschetta - totally delectableKobe Beef Short Rib over Gorgonzola Polenta - even more totally delectableThe Carbo test was a total success, delicious home-baked bread with butter & and the tastiest chutney I have ever had.Chicken Jakarta - Chicken Breast with Fresh Vegetables in a Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce Served over Basmati Rice - YUMLuiguine Elements - Tossed with Andouille Sausage, Caramelized Vidalia Onions, Mushrooms, Demi-Glace - the pasta was a tad soggy and overall a bit bland and disappointing.  There was a free dessert offer via Yelp, which we took almost begrudgingly because we were so stuffed.  We ordered chocolate lava cake (nice, but a bit dry) and they brought us a complimentary sample of Crème brûlée (absolutely outstanding, totally phenomenal ).We will be back!Superior quality menu, superior martini selection, superior staff.The owners (Catherine and Jose Luis) and staff deliver a dramaticly-flavorful culinary experience. There are several notable attributes of this restaurant that earn 5-stars: consistency, nuance, care of presentation, portion size (as in "just right!"), and a focus on individual attention to everything they do. Attention to detail, attention to detail, attention to detail. Plus, these folks have a wonderful success story on their website of how they came to be such a wonderful restaurant.I have been visiting Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar since just after they first opened four years ago in 2009 (back when they only had about 300 martinis on the menu, now it's over 450 and counting). The dinner menu has been perfected and has been delivered perfectly every time. "Sea Bass Ponzu" is a favorite, as is "Mini Osso Bucco", the "Goat Cheese Salad", Jose Luis's chutney with freshly-baked bread... the New York Strip is high-quality.I have brought some very important people to me to this restaurant, as I can depend on a wonderful experience every time. Catherine makes her own desserts ...Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, Strüdel, the molten chocolate cake.. everything I've had is fantastic. Chef Jose Luis is the mastermind in the kitchen.Full bar available. Seating is limited, reservations are a "really good idea". This is important to remember: this is not a mass-production, cookie-cutter place. This is a small group of highly dedicated people trying to deliver the highest quality experience. "Cozy" is a good adjective to describe this restaurant and bar. Happy Hour specials. And though I never seem to get the opportunity to visit as often as I'd like, I'm greeted like I'm family every time.It's nice to be part of a community. Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar welcomes me as part of the community. 5-stars is as good as it gets. Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar is as good as it gets.Wow, I'm so sad to write this update. I was a regular here, Jose Luis & Kathryn were amazing. I had a bad feeling when they sold to new owners, the food may go downhill. The new owners did make some changes, they are now open for brunch on the weekends, and they stay open later. We went for Sunday brunch today, the menu looked decent, I ordered chicken & waffles on a recommendation. When they came out, it literally looked like Eggo waffles with two chicken fingers laid on top. I was hoping it tastes better than it looked. Nope. It tasted exactly the way it looked. I tried my best to eat it, but it was really bad. The server ended up taking it off the bill for me because she felt bad. You can definitely tell that the kitchen is being run by a cook who came from running some shit holes downtown (Hennesey's and Mickey Finnz). The only thing I can hope is that Kevin, my favorite bartender doesn't leave. He makes amazing cocktails. I guess I can't go there to eat anymore.What a shame. I would have given this place 6 stars with the old owners José Luis & Catherine. Bread came out cold, with a subpar marmalade. That doesn't set the tone right for dinner, however I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. I heard the "Chef's special" described, without mention of any price & I opted for the lobster ravioli. I was assured it would be a good choice from the server. My Partner in Crime ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. Food comes out... Disappointed already with the outrageously small portions relative to the price (the lobster ravioli was roughly $22 & the sea bass was $32). So, as the dish is laid out in front of me, I'm thinking, "this better explode with flavor in my mouth." It didn't. The lobster ravioli was okay, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. The Chilean sea bass wasn't good either. A bit dry and flavorless. Chilean sea bass is typically an excellent choice, but the sauce that accompanied this dish wasn't anything to write home about. Lastly, the wonderful and passion derived dessert program Catherine created is gone. No more chefs tasting option nor are the wonderful made-from-scratch creations. They don't even have a dessert menu. Me and the PIC ended up going to grimaldis for their cheesecake. This place gets 2 stars only because of the new "martini flights" they offer. I had been here about three times before they switched owners. Sadly, I won't be back. Check came out to $90 (including 20% tip) and the experience was nothing special. I will still continue to support local & small businesses whenever possible (& when it's warranted).I lovED this place so much, I forwardED their 20% off promotion for lunch to my whole department, I strongly recommendED all my friends, family, and clients this place, that's why I have to write this review.I came to this place for Happy Hours and dinners. Always a pleasure especially the dinner on Thursday, 12/26/2013. The holiday special: Surf and Turf (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs) and lemon base seasoning sea bass WERE phenomenon!!  I therefore took my friend who loves fish and seafood here tonight and ordered the same things. I called before we arrived to make sure they still serve (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs). Before I ordered, I confirmed with our server, Barry, for the sea bass. Barry told us sea bass is always on the menu.I hate to say that, but the fish was chewy and definitely not sea bass. I showed Barry the picture I took last time as I am a Yelper and never skip the picture of good food. Barry was not attentive and told me next time just to show the picture first and the kitchen will make the same fish. -- If it's a dish always on the menu, why do the costumers need to show the picture to make sure getting the same food and quality??The disaster hasn't ended. The steak was way too raw that we didn't even finish a quarter. The king crabs were warm in most of part but with dry and FROZEN part. Our server, Barry, only had 3 tables at that time, and he spent 98% of his attention on one person of one of these 3 tables. After I reflected him about the fish and showed him the picture and after he witnessed the untouched steak, he just avoided my table!! Barry apparently doesn't care about the clients like the previous servers I met here before.The only right thing for tonight is the food runner, RIGO, who is awesome, professional, and much more attentive than Barry. RIGO greeted every table he served, made sure the guests were satisfied, and RIGO was the only person who asked us about the untouched steak. -- Thumb up for RIGO!!  I am not going back to this place no matter how much I lovED it when there is no consistency of food and welcoming service. I have better way to spend my $100 + bills.I'm honestly shocked at all the positive reviews here.   Came about a year ago and had a good experience and thought I'd bring the husband and some friends this time.    We sat for twenty five minutes with NO acknowledgement. According to the menu there are new owners. Message to the new owners: in a half full restaurant your size, the waitress should be over to greet within two minutes .  We stared, we waved and got nothing.  Left without even getting water.I have eaten here before it was pretty good but after watching the owner be a jacka$$ on Hungry investors I won't return ever. You don't ask someone for help then think your a god and treat them like crap when they are trying to invest.This has been a bookmarked place for over a year and I finally got around to trying Elements last night.  I had an early show on the Strip, so we went a 4 PM when they satarted dinner service.  I had made a reservation using their website and our table with menus was waiting when we arrived.  Our server was Mimi and she soon brought us iced teas as we studied the menu.  Bread service came quickly and there were three choices.  I did have to ask for butter.I ordered Jakarta chicken for myself and my wife ordered the vegetable pasta. We started with a bowl of tomato basil soup that was very tasty.  The tomato was very rich and had a flavor that was unlike most tomato soups.  I would go back for some more soup.Our main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green sautéed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.The options for dessert were limited.  I opted for the carrot cake and my wife got the chocolate brownie cheesecake.  Standard desserts but very good and a nice way to end the meal.Another Groupon successfully used and a fine meal.Superior quality, superior food, superior ambience. As the ownership has changed through the years, so has the menu. And the drink list has been complemented by some of my own original creations (Proud Orange, Frothy Apple, The Dancer, Katie's Citrus Kick, Kayleeburst, and the best of all: Man O' Th' World).  I will forever cherish my experiences at Elements and return as often as I can. This is a perfect place to enjoy happy hour ( 5-7pm everyday, even Martini Mondays $5 any martini) and Sunday Brunch.You will enjoy this unique, intimate, satisfying venue.Came here for Lisa H's birthday brunch- group of 10 was helped by server Rigo. We made reservations and they were not busy, but that they only staffed one server for Sunday brunch. Rigo was managing four tables in addition to our 10-person party! Menu for brunch is limited, and made more limited by their waffle maker being broken. Many at the table opted for the breakfast burrito or the benedict (available with filet, crab, or salmon), but I chose the BRIE GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO SOUP. Menu description states the sandwich includes tomato, but I received only a generous amount of cheese resulting in a basic and one-note sandwich of just cheese and bread. The tomato soup was sweet, oily, and rich, did not necessarily pair well with the sandwich. Highly suggest adding a side salad (a Caesar is $7 and huge) to cut the richness.  Of the three people who opted for the breakfast burrito, only one ate more than half, which I found noteworthy.The main appeal for brunch is their $10 bottomless Mimosa or Bloody Mary deal, with mandatory entrée purchase. They have a full bar and patio seating. Found it odd that the black linen table clothes are covered by butcher paper? Not sure what aesthetic they're going for. Interior is smaller than exterior of corner space suggests.After what seems like yet another ownership change I revisited Elements for brunch. I didn't partake in the mimosas or Bloody Marys and stuck with brunch items. The food was ok. There is not a lot of variety on their menu and I was fairly happy with my bagel sandwich. It was basic but decently priced. The rest of the food was not memorable either. The prime rib was drenched in sauce and no one in my party left blown away by the dining experience. They have live entertainment and the service was friendly and more attentive than on my last visit. Despite its convenient location I don't see myself making this a regular on the brunch rotation.

Posh is one of the coolest restaurants I have experienced.  The menu consists of all the protein they have available that day and you get to mark off what you do not like.  The number of courses depends on how much you would like to spend.  This place is so fun because you really have no idea what you are going to get.  I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place.WOW. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We went early Friday night and each got 4 courses with wine pairings. You get a small menu with a list of proteins. You mark off what you don't want to try and list any dislikes or allergies. You know I had to put down that I don't like corn. I went with the chef's choice and Mike went with the carnivore selection. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. The meat, seasonings, broths, and vegetables were all divine. We had heirloom tomatoes, duck with green beans and squash, baby octopus with snap peas, kobe beef with artichokes, and kangaroo with fingerling potatoes and shitake mushrooms. Sorry, if I can't remember exactly what was in the meals, as I was too busy devouring every bite. And why didn't anyone ever tell me that kangaroos where so tasty? I pretty much licked everything off both of our plates. Dessert was also very yummy. I had a chocolate pate. I don't remember what Mike had as he had finished before I had a chance to get a second bite. The entire staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar and chatted with Josh, Zac and the amusing Kirby. It was fun watching them make all the dishes. This was such a great dining experience. The lollipop at the end of our meal and cookies to take home were a special treat. I'm sure Mike is already regretting bringing me here because it's not a cheap meal and I want to come back. You have to try this place. You can find complimentary valet parking off the garage at Rancho Vista Dr.While getting new gear for this year's Native American Recognition Days Banquet at the Scottsdale Mall some friends and I suddenly got hungry - we kept trying to tigure out what to eat when I broke out my cell and texted KGB (542542) and asked "I'm at the mall in Scottsdale, AZ. Where is a unique yet nice place to have dinner near here?" Moments later I had my answer "Posh. How do we describe Posh? with two words: Improvisational Cuisine". We were hooked!I, the ever knowing yelper (yelpita to Thomas S.) have already heard of Posh and threw it on my list of places to try... became uber excited and lead the way. the parking is kind of odd just follow the signs from the road! And valet is free!! YAY!! We would've used it but the guy wasn' there!We were met by our uber cute server (dang! Forgot his name sorry!) and chose to dine at the counter. They liked it but the chairs were a lil uncomfortable for me. I kept almost falling the whole meal.I sampled a few wines and chose the rose` for a pre-meal drink. The "quiz" before the meal was different. I'm sure other reviews explain the Posh concept - in a nutshell: there was a short list of protiens, diners are asked to cross out anything they DO NOT want to dine on & then list ingredients they do NOT like or are allergic to and based on your answers - your meal is formulated improvisationally (is that even a word?) We chose the 5 course meal with wine (except for our DD) I said that I wasn't feeling the frogslegs and that I was down for anything including throwing an extra $15 for frois gras.After we turned in our surveys, the chef came and spoke to us. I mentioned his use of White Tepary Beans. Tepary Beans are a staple in our culture and its surprising to hear about it being used in haute cuisine. Turns out he purchases his beans from TOCA (Tohono O'odham Community Action)'s farms which funds cultural activities for the Tohono O'odham Nation... tiiiight! On to the food...There were three of us dining and that'd be 15 dishes!! soooo for this review, I'm only going to be describing my meal.First was an amuse bouche of Lychee in a light oily sauce. Very good, nice and slightly sweet but a good start. Next came a salad made of cabbage & wild boar bacon (that was marinated over night in DUCK FAT!). The salad was good, small but overwhelmingly flavored with onions. I wrote on my survey that I DETESTED raw and strong onion flavor... so why serve me an onion filled dish?! It was good, which is why I didn't send it back but after a while I couldn't hang and ended up not finishing it; but I LOVED my friend's popcorn soup! the BEST way I can describe it is: imagine watering down grits with chicken broth & adding popcorn as a garnish. Course 2 was a lightly fried fluke with sauteed baby bok choi. Very good - extremely light. The wine paired with it was ah-mazing! The panko coating was a little too oily but the fluke was still great! I would have like to have seen it be oil poached. My friend had a stuffed quail that was better than Thanksgiving dinner!! I couldn't believe it was so good, I wanted to switch plates!3rd course was the frois gras... the apex of a great meal. wonderfully seared and served cold... it was my first experience with frois gras... and it was sweet & delicious. It was paired with a sliced strawberry, spun sugar and a light sauce. ITs paired wine was the sweetest I ever had and complimented the dish perfectly.4th was pan roasted lamb with some kind of greens. This was a little disappointing. As my friend and i recieved the same dish! WTF? Half the fun of this place should be that everyone at the table recieves something different! I asked my meat to be cooked to medium and this was medium-well (boo!) the sous chef even commented saying that the doneness of the lamb made him cry on the inside... I was like "uhhhhh - then why did you over cook it?!" The dish was good, the lamb tender and the greens nicely flavored, kind of heavy on the bacon/pork fat flavor.Finally dessert. A chocolate pate` with more spun sugar and blackberry sauce finished my meal. Imagine taking a chocolate truffle and striping it of its semi-soft chocolate coating and forming its insides into a baby triangle and u'd have my pate`! As we were playing Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock (shout-out to all The Big Bang fans!) over the bill we were given flash frozen lemon custard lollipops (yummy!) and a small bag of cookies and brittle as parting gifts. They were great to nosh on during the giggle-filled ride home. Over all - the meal cost over a $100 a person & was VERY good, there might have been a few errors here & there but we still left buzzed & satisified! To my yelpers I say: Its a pretty penny and the add-ons do add-up but if you're looking for an amazing meal & have cash to spare give Posh a try. Just be sure to sit at the counter for the ultimate foodie experience!My, OH-My!This was my first visit to Posh and I can not wait to return. From the ambiance, service and cuisine this was a stellar experience.Nestled in a condominium complex, this wonderful 26 seat food bar gives front row viewing to the complex culinary skills of the kitchen staff. With additional table seating if that's your preference.We were greeted warmly and seated at the food bar. After completing the questionnaire regarding allergies and preferences, we ordered the five course plus the foie gras supplement and included the wine pairing. Each serving was presented to the two of us precisely at the same time then described in detail. The dining experience started with an amuse bush of persimmon salad. Then I was served a lovely salad that combined blood orange, avocado, chocolate, hazelnut and watercress into an amazing combination of flavors. Next was the perfectly cooked scallop with mustard, chanterelles, shallots and thyme. The third course was the foie gras that was a visually stunning presentation as well as being delectable. This was followed by confit of wild boar bacon, duck crackling with maple glaze on a butternut puree. A selection of cheeses was served as the fifth course that mingled creamy and savory flavors.  A clever twist of a snicker bar made of a chocolate pate with cognac caramel sauce was the finale.This was an extraordinary experience and I look forward to returning. Thanks to chef Josh Hebert and the entire staff at Posh!I was indeed intrigued by the idea of Posh Improvisational Cuisine... and although I'd been wanting to try it for awhile, I waited for a special occasion to do so.  I finally made it to Posh last week for Jared's birthday!  (And yes, I selfishly chose the restaurant since I wanted to try it!)It was me, Jared, our friend Larry G who was visiting from Jersey, and my brother met us a bit later... we took both Joel L's recommendation and that of "Josh from Posh," who called back to confirm our reservation, and we sat at the bar.  The experience was more than just a meal... it was foodie heaven, entertainment, and like nothing we'd ever experienced before!  We were there for several hours and the time flew by... in that time, we laughed a lot, got to know the extremely attentive staff, ate our fair share of 7+ courses each, and drank some of us drank a glass of wine to go with each course...I started taking notes of the courses as they came out, but Jonathan, one of our servers, insisted that they could email me a description of what I ate after the fact instead, so I took him up on it!  Here it is:Amuse Bouche:  cucumber caviar with pickled grape, (everyone had this)1st:  Belgian endive, blood orange vinaigrette, goat cheese and candied pine nuts2nd:  Shrimp chorizo, kimchee broth, baby bok choy and shaved fennel3rd:  Atlantic fluke, sesame oyster aioli, roated fingerling potatoes and mustard greens4th:  Foie gras torchon brulee, fig consomme, spun sugar and duck cracklings5th:  Sonoma duck breast, soy ponzu gelee, oyster mushrooms and carrot coulis6th: Roasted venison loin, ginger cucumber salsa, pommes anna and carmelized shallots7th:  trio of cheeses, Tomme de savoie, robiola, humbotl fog(everyone had this) Yes, I ate all of the above in one sitting and then some!  I also tasted several of the other courses that my dining companions had including Jared's 2nd course of Black Cod and his 5th course of Braised short rib... not to mention the various desserts we all shared (Buttermilk panne cotta with fresh fruit, Trio of homemade candy bars, and Honey and Mascarpone tart with ancho chocolate ganache).  They even provided us with little goodie bags of sweet treats for the road.Everything was expertly prepared.  I didn't take a bite of anything I didn't like... even the foie gras was surprisingly tasty although I only took a small bite.  Don't hate me for that, please!We were all beyond impressed with our experience at Posh and although it was a splurge, it was totally worth it for a special occasion.  We'll be back!if i have paid for this meal, i'd be pissed, period!but since i was among work colleagues, i faked my smile, i toasted my glass, i ate my meal in small bites, and filed just a little tiny complaint to our waitress at the end of my meal. Me: "I understand you are a improvisational cuisine restaurant, so you pretty mudh dictate what is being offered to my 4-course meal. yes?"Waitress with smile: "Yes"Me - afraid my colleagues might hear my complaint and judge me as hard-to-please bitch - wispered in my best manner:  "not that i am complaining, but i clearly indicated on my direction list no veggies.  Can you please explain to me why i started up my meal with a salad and ended it with a carrot cake?"Waitress still in smiles:  "I am sorry, we should have paid more attention to it.  Here is some chocolate."suuuuuuure..  and that frigging chocolate bar is something to compensate for my goddamn 4-course $100 bucks meal??!  I have had Salad! some Veggie mixed crap, more veggie mixed beef, and at the end, CARROT cake!  you gotta be effing kidding me!!and let me tell you, that foie gras tasted GAMY!  GAMY!!I have decided, this is the perfect place to bring a much-hated-but-you-can't-say-no-date, storm out and stiff him with the check!The concept at Posh restaurant is "improvisational cuisine". I think of something improvised as being made up on the spot, done without preparation. What an exciting dining experience that would be, albeit fraught with danger for both the chef and the patrons. But don't go to Posh expecting that. The days menu is set long before you arrive and all you get to do is check off on a printed list what proteins you dislike so they won't be served to you. It's disconcerting to be asked to think about food you don't like at the beginning of a meal. Your other decision is how many courses you desire and if you want wine pairings: from $45 per person for 4 courses ($77 with wine) to $110/$165 for a full tasting, which is more than 7 courses.     Our meal started off promisingly. We shared a nice cocktail called a Cosmonade ($9) made with Hangar 1 Citron, Chambord, and lemon. An amuse bouche of papaya sorbet with mint "caviar" was delicious (this tiny spoonful doesn't count as a course).  My first course was an heirloom tomato salad with haricot vert and a few shavings of cheese. With something this simple  the ingredients need to shine, and these did not - the tomato, while ripe, had little flavor, and there was so little cheese it's impact on the dish was negligible. Ken's vichyssoise with chive oil was pleasant enough. For me, the fish course was sea bream with bok choy. The fish skin had been blasted with a propane torch which rendered it beautifully crispy. The Asian-y sauce on the vegetable was pretty salty, a harbinger of things to come. Ken received shrimp (they were called some fancy name) served with gnocchi, baby garlic, and a blastingly peppery aioli. The shrimp had been way overcooked, rendering them rubbery and tasteless.      On to the meat course. Mine was venison served on farro (which is an Italian whole grain), with a rhubarb gastrique. First I took a bite of meat - it was flavorful but tough. Then the farro. I gasped and almost choked. It was that salty. The insipid gastrique was totally overpowered by the other elements of the dish. Ken was kind enough to swap plates with me, and his braised short rib (hardly a seasonal dish) was at least edible, though also oversalted. Interestingly enough it was served with fingerling potatoes, making this the third dish in a row served to Ken that contained potatoes (assuming that the gnocchi had been made with them). When our waitress, cooly professional throughout, asked if we enjoyed this course, we mentioned the salt issue and she said she would inform the kitchen.     Finally, dessert. We were both given chocolate cake, cut into unattractive chunks. Mine topped with cubes of apricot, and Ken's with plum. Neither of these fruits complemented the cake, which contained a distractingly large amount of pepper. The drizzle of chocolate ganache was tasty. At this point we were seriously considering going to Crudo to have dessert since we needed a satisfying conclusion to the evening.Just then our server brought us a complimentary cheese plate, an apology for the salty food. That turned out to be the high point of our experience (along with the amuse bouche). The cheese selection was excellent, and the buttery grilled bread outstanding.But for $130 you'd expect more, wouldn't you?     I strongly suggest that if you want a an exceptional "tasting" experience you should visit Crudo Cafe. You even get to choose the foods you like to eat, not those you don't.This place is amazing! We decided on the 7 course meal without the wine paring. We started with vodka martinis and I asked if they had blue cheese stuffed olives and the waitress said she would make some, fresh! The olives alone were amazing. The best blue cheese I have had in a long time. The courses were all fabulous. I think the wild boar bacon was one of my favorites. I also loved the red cabbage jelly and curry soup. The prawn dish was a little disappointing. The prawns were overcooked and chewy, but that is my only complaint. For dessert we requested something savory as we are not really into sweets. Wow, we made the right decision. They brought us a cheese plate with the best cheese I have ever had on it. There was a Humbolt Fog goat cheese and the star of the dish, Epoisse Du Borgogne. I have never tasted anything like it. The waitress wrote down the cheese names and told me where I could purchase it. I love it here. It is a wonderful experience. We spent 4 hours (we told them there was no rush) a lovely laid back dinner and drinks. Go, savor and fall in love!Never in the history of gastronomy has there been a more clean-cut love-it-or-hate-it dining concept as POSH Improvisational Cuisine. I was literally dragged here by friends who had enough credit left on their cards and who wanted to show me how "out there" Scottsdale could be. POSH is different. Really different. You don't order. You check off a long list of things you like and don't and they concoct something on the fly for you. You'll never know what you are about to be served or what it will cost but you can assume it will be strange and so expensive that you will be able to watch your FICO score drop.This is a place that is trying to be the snootiest restaurant ever while pretending to be a relaxed, friendly environment. I did see some normal people but I saw a lot of the types one sees in North Scottsdale and San Marcos, Ca. You know the type. Those out to impress - mostly themselves by being different. Really different. If art is what you like instead of food, this is the place to be. It is all about presentation and dulcet tones describing what has just been put in front of you. It really is a beautiful presentation, but I have no freakin' idea what it was even after asking for the explanation to be translated "into a language". Descriptions are a lot like a real estate brochure: "Spacious, upscale, beautiful, wonderful, elegant" without any hint of substance. It tasted like tuna that had been marinated in a puddle and hit with some soy sauce. The teepee of veggies that hovered above it was interesting. I didn't know whether to eat it or wrap a tortilla around it and re-enact the night before the battle at the Little Bighorn in miniature. I just don't get or like the concept so perhaps I am being unfair to this hole in the wall on Scottsdale Road in a building that looks like a bombed out munitions factory from Dresden, Germany, circa 1944. People live in that place? It reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". Yeah, big bucks to live above the store. I get it. It's Scottsdale and this is "trendy". Do a foreclosure and resale search of that zip code and you'll see that at least seventy percent of the building is up for sale, often with notations such as "Fully furnished" and "Motivated seller". I bet they're motivated. It all fits with the wannabe nature of POSH and the people it seeks to inculcate.  POSH is a restaurant where only the truly adventurous need apply after checking their credit worthiness. It's a niche restaurant and I'm clearly (and happily) not in that niche. For a totally unique and almost otherworldly dining experience, this is the place. They have NO competition in this area. They are without peer when it comes to originality and invention on a scale beyond comprehension. This is the area where POSH shines. If AZ88 is your thing, this is AZ88 on a combo of crack and meth. I did not care for this place but I am sure the feeling is mutual. While I feel the food merits one star based on goofiness and price, I'm giving POSH two stars just for having the cojones to push out this concept on Scottsdale and not to crack a smile when delivering the check.I find my reaction to Posh similar to Will Ferrell's reaction to Jersey Boys in the criminally overlooked 2010 feature film "The Other Guys". It's not great, it's FANTASTIC. You guys totally undersold it! Wow, what a restaurant.Actually, the basis for that comparison stems from feeling the need to assuage the fear that "I'll pay so much money and won't get enough food". I just bought tickets to see Jersey Boys in Vegas. You know how much the tickets cost? $76/each. More than a 5 courser at Posh PLUS a couple glasses of wine. Jersey boys was about two and a half hours. Five courses at Posh, if you're really enjoying yourself and your company, can easily take that long. The difference is that Jersey Boys does not feed you (well, it does, but in a different way). Point being, going to Posh isn't a meal, going to Posh is an experience. And, in my opinion, it's worth every penny.I've been several times, including taking my Mom when she was in town from Cleveland, Ohio. Needless to say, she freaking loved it. Not that she's an inexperienced diner. She's from New York and considers Mario Batali a God among men, but according to her, dining at Posh was like being a judge on Top Chef. She didn't specify which judge but I'm going to go ahead and veto Padma because she is just unbearable. But I digress.I've been exposed to foods at Posh that I wouldn't have had anywhere else. I don't want to screw up the proper dish descriptions so don't take this too literally but I've had chilled cucumber soup with a lime-chili oil, ahi tuna sashimi with wasabi and soy pearls, mother effin sweet breads (which everyone told me I should mark off but I didn't because I've never had them, and even though I might not necessarily ORDER them, I'm glad I tried them), and of course the creme brulee torched-style foie gras which is quite simply the most decadent thing I've ever eaten. And I've had bacon flavored ice cream. Again, I'm sure I'm butchering these courses but it's from my hazy wine memory and just trust me, they were all good.While I think you would be fine with five courses (it's my typical order..since the first is always a soup or salad and the last is a dessert), more courses is always better. I mean, you're already there. Might as well give them as many opportunities as possible to blow your mind. Trust me, they will.If you haven't gone, you should go. You won't regret it. Same goes for Jersey Boys, but that's a different review.01/05/112.25 stars.Took my cousin for a five-course meal, and I unfortunately must write that I was NOT very impressed.  Yes, I have food allergies, and yes, maybe I should've just thrown caution to the wind that evening*, considering that I was going to spend $60 per person, plus a glass of wine for me, and a 20% tip, but after all the hype, I expected more flavors, more ambience... just something more than the experience I ended up with.  After speaking with our server and asking him if they served grass-fed meats or animals fed an all-natural diet, not commercial grain feed, it was at the kitchen's discretion to stick to serve seafood for me.  I wish I was told what my options were, instead of just the chefs' decision not to serve me red meat at all, or we might've gone elsewhere.  We may have just decided to stay there, who knows?  It would've been very CONSIDERATE of the chefs to have let me make that $150 decision.  I have no complaints about the dishes my cousin received-- they were delicious and nicely-presented, and she enjoyed each and every one, but to pay $60 for five uninspired courses, starting with the salad, to the same type of fish for every course, but with different vegetables, and then just undressed berries for dessert, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g#Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g it was a very disappointing meal for me, which is why I haven't had the inspiration to write about the entire experience till now.  (Probably one of the best decisions I've ever made, for I surely would've ranted a year ago...)When I pass this establishment every time I go to Camelview, I can only shake my head... :(Amuse bouche http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6Kg#bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6KgCousin's salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9A#BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9AMy salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXw#znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXwOne of cousin's dishes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQ#Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQFish course http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndA#keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndAWe each got one of these http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkw#5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkwFrog legs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMw#MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMwAnother fish course.

Well, at least she had a terrific time!  :)I can only give my opinion of their monthly Wednesday late night menu, so take this for what it is; I've not been here for lunch or dinner.Excited to find out about their uber secret, (monthly?) late night ramen gathering, five or six of us decided to make an evening of it. Starting out with one of their Gin cocktails was a delicious decision, and I sipped on it while sharing a couple of items from the menu. I like cabbage and was excited to try out the Okonomiyaki; a grill top  cooked 'pancake' of cabbage, a few other add ins, topped with super tasty sauce, bacon, and a few other items, sans the shrimp cause of an allergy, it is worth ordering again. We shared an ordered a the Goma ramen, pretty tasty, similar to other ramen, but notably better. Unfortunately there were a few hangups with the order, some holier than thou service from the waiter that evening, and issues refilling drinks.After the meal I chatted with the chef for a minute or two, he told me they were thinking about doing their Ramen menu during lunch soon, but I haven't seen it happen just yet. Overall the experience was fun but that was mostly from getting to watch the chef cook and hanging with our friends!Happy Yelping Phoenix.Tuesday Nights at Posh is ramen night, and I joined up with the International Supper Club UYE to try them out! I'm glad the ISC choose the ramen night because I have wanted to try it for months! I went with the Goma , it had bok choy, shishito peppers, scallions, sesame seeds and char-siu pork, it also came with bonito flakes, nori, leeks and bean sprouts, I also added an onsen egg.  The broth had great flavor, the pork was perfectly cooked and tasted so good, next time I will add more to the bowl, and the egg gave it a creamery texture. The noodles were perfect! This was a great bowl of ramen, the only thing next time I will ask for it to be a little bit spicier, the hotter the better for me. I am already craving another bowl of ramen, soo good!Service was great and friendly, and we were a big group and they didn't add on gratuity, so always check our bill and add the tip accordingly. So don't forget Tuesday nights at Posh is ramen night, and it won't break the bank, with a bowl being 12 bucks, because I added the egg it made it 13, but really that's  a steal, it's a huge delish bowl of ramen!Tuesday night ramen night!This place was very busy tonight. We got there shortly before 6pm and although we were seated right away, service was real slow for ramen night.  By the time we left around 7:30pm, i noticed several people were waiting for tables.It's near the Fashion Square Mall, garage parking underground make it easy to visit this resturant. Plenty of sign around, I found this place no time.Ramen has four flavor choice. I went with Goma.  Broth was very close to Japanese miso ramen. I didn't try miso as I was told it taste too much like miso soup miso, not ramen miso.  Shishito peppers distinctive smell was trying to fight against ramen broth, althought they added nice spice but I thought they could have picked different peppers to add spiciness to the soup if they wanted.Noodles were cooked just right, this type of noodles went really good with the broth they had for goma ramen.I added onsen egg for additional $1. They know how to make real onsen tamago. It's jusst soft boild egg but to master the timing and create just right softness and runny yolk, one really need to know how to cook egg right, and they do here.Their chashu was also really good as well. They used good quality pork belly for chashu.I like the decor of this resturant, and clean bathroom is always nice.Rare to have really good ramen in Arizona but this one is really good. Next time I want to try shyoyu flavor.This is mostly based on the ramen and not their other dishes. And ramen is only served like 4 hours a week. However, I think I found the best ramen in Arizona. I say Arizona because the other places in Arizona aren't that great.Posh actually gets it right in flavor, texture and other things. I have had ramen in CA, WA, and even Japan. This place at least creates a ramen that let's you know that they know what they are doing.Is it the best I have ever had? No. But it's pretty darn good. Especially here in the desert. I had the Miso ramen with the onsen egg (it was delicious). The chasui pork was so yummy as well. It melts in your mouth and sort of melts in your chopsticks if you don't hold it right. The flavor of the broth was great. It wasn't watery. You can tell that the flavor is blended into the liquid.I wish the parking structure was easier to find (I parked at Macy's at Fashion Square) and I wish it wasn't so darn expensive. We are talking about a $12 base price! I guess when you have the good stuff and no one can match you in taste, you can raise the prices a little bit.Overall, BEST ramen in Arizona as of right now this moment. 4/19/2015.

Review Text :
We had been out and about doing some shopping when lunch crept up on us. My daughter likes to say hi to Bobby (the dog statue) whenever she gets the chance so we decided to pop into Tangs which is right behind this grand statue. The place looks small but has an upstairs area, plenty of seating. Very relaxing environment. The menu is a bit confusing and the items are quite expensive unless you opt for the lunch menu which consists of ramen soups that all look quite similar and not too appetising, in my eyes. My partner got the lunch ramen bowl which had a very tasty broth but literally had 2 super thin slices of pork lunch meat. I got a mish- mash of items to share with my daughter. She ate well but overall quite an expensive meal for not so outstanding flavours or food. In general I would say pretty run of the mill Japanese. Not really that special but will do the job if you are willing to part with a handful of cash.

Review Text :
Never again.  RUDE. RUDE. RUDE.My boyfriend and I came in a half an hour before closing so we already knew not to expect much. We walked in and the ladies at the front counter told us to look inside at the food because they would not be bringing any new food out, which was fair enough. We said it was fine and they gave us a discount which was nice of them since we did not expect them to do so. They quickly showed us to our seats and then we took off to the food. After rushing to bring back our food to the table our server asked us for the receipt and I told her that we paid at the front already but if she wanted my receipt was somewhere in my bag and I would gladly find it for her. I knew all the servers were eager to get out of there, they were all sitting in the back and looking at us so I was looking in my bag in a hurry and it took me a few minutes to find it (it was in the side pocket of course lol). During this whole time she looked at me with a disgusted look and kept talking to her coworkers in Chinese. I swear she was thinking we never paid in the first place. I finally found it and she was like.. 'it says one' and then gave me another disgusted look. I told her it was a discounted price for two meals. Bad communication from front counter to servers I guess. Anyways, the food was pretty good. The sushi was not fresh of course as well as other food but it was closing so I wouldn't mark down for that. All in all, the food was over all, good!It was the servers that really made me upset about this place. When the table next to us all left, one of the servers rushed over to the table, counted the tip of three dollars and threw it back on the table. She shouted to her coworkers 'three dollars' and other words in Chinese and started laughing. Her doing that in front of all her customers was not cool at all.We left in a hurry, since all 15 workers were staring at us hahaha. No 'thank you' or 'good bye'. Weird. LOL whatever.I am writing this review as I am sitting here. James and Sandy are the worse servers I had ever encountered.Food is okay but for $9.20 is still a ripoff. Sushi is warm. Like my boyfriend says if you don't have unagi, you should not serving sushi. How can you serve warm watermelon that tastes funky?Service is by far the worse I had ever experience at any restaurant. my bfs family wanted to switch to a seat where we don't have to bug each other to go in and out. From that,  they moved us all the way to the otherside. They gave us attitude while we moved out drinks and food to the seat without thier assistance.Then when I was done,  they passed back and forth helping everyone next or around us. Now I'm getting an upset tummy.

So I have ZERO idea what this space is like when it's not a Fringe venue, but when it's a Fringe venue, it's pure chaos.Purse, freakin' chaos.First off, the outside, which is a giant patio area with a screen for football and rugby matches. Everyone crowds together, especially as it gets later in the day, and things go to hell. At some points, you can't even move from entrance A to door B in the back. Yikes.And then the venues themselves to see shows, small and filled with people. We had to line up at least 15 to 20 minutes before any free show to make sure we can see it, and even then sometimes it wasn't enough.And in the spots, the bars were almost never manned, so you had to go back outside into the chaos to get a drink. Yikes. No thanks. But I will say this: their selection of Fringe shows was top notch and easily some of the best ones we'd seen! What a lineup here. Whoever curated this one deserved a pat on the back.And it is a fun venue. There is so much energy and life here and it's kind of contagious. So know what you're getting into and enjoy it, it's a ride.

This location inside the Gold Coast is really cool. The bar area has indoor/outdoor seating and flat screens everywhere you look.It's mostly boothes in the place but plenty of seating so no long wait to be  seated. There is stuff hanging on the walls everywhere from a frankenstein head to a bicycle to random signs.The new menu has smaller portions and just one side but the prices for really cheap for a casino steakhouse.I always get the Jack Daniel's Flat-iron steak cooked medium-rare and they always get it right. 1 point.I learned long ago the ribs are nothing special but the kid isn't picky so he got a 1/2 rack with side for $6!!Sweet potato fries and cajun lime shrimp skewers were right on point as Guy FIeri-would say(his face is plastered all over everything in this place)The service was a little slow and I noticed for others eating there it was a little sloppy. The table next to us had a plate full of ribs brought to their table and left-they didn't order it and when they told the  waiter he picked it up and took it across the room to the other table. GROSS!!!!!!!!I wish I could just get their Jack Daniel's sauce to go then I wouldn't have to spend $50 to get a good steak.The food was just okay on a late Sunday night.  We had the sliders, chicken strips, green bean fries, and buffalo wings.  Didn't care much for the chicken strips though.  They were on the sweet side and breaded too much.  Since it's happy hour all day and night here, all of our dishes/appetizers were half off. Unfortunately our happy hour ended early.  We had a server who was rude and lifeless, not at all happy.  We never saw her smile and she was always rushing.  It really looked like she hated her job....which reflected on our dining experience.

Review Text :
When I was told that Cartwrights serves 'game meats', I was worried that it would be the type of place where I would need to avoid making eye contact with taxidermied animal heads mounted on the walls. To my relief, there was neither a buffalo nor elk head in sight to gaze at me accusingly. Instead, the interior reminded me of a rustic and comfortable yet upscale ranch house. I especially liked the ambiance added by the fireplaces within each room. Although they were not lit (hey, it is summer in AZ) I can imagine how welcoming they would be on a chilly evening. Oh, the menu! It had a little bit of everything - seafood, steaks & game, poultry & pasta. It was hard to decide what to choose, since so many things looked good. I went with the salmon prepared Mediterranean style. Wise decision! It was beautiful - pan-roasted with artichokes, leeks, garlic, roasted tomato & spinach, atop pesto-tossed angel hair pasta. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. My friend, more adventurous than I am, chose the buffalo tenderloin. Prepared medium-rare, it came with wild mushrooms and a peppercorn sauce that was beyond good. I had never tried buffalo, and was pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste. Of course, my positive opinion could have been influenced somewhat by the mini-cauldron of mac & pepper-jack cheese... The wine list is impressive, with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes. I have been on an AZ wine run lately, and chose the AZ Stronghold Nachise (a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah). My friend went with the Rutherford Ranch cab (great with the buffalo!), and we were both happy. What a nice way to spend an evening meal. Our server was outstanding - attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable too. I already know what I want to try next - filet mignon and the S'Mores dessert are calling to me!I really do love this cozy steakhouse! First of all, I love Cave Creek. It's got cowboy charm and fun everywhere you turn. Whether it's live bull riding, eclectic shopping or simply setting up shop at a coffee shop, the town has character. Cartwright's falls into this category of character and charm. It's a fine dining steakhouse that welcomes "cowboy couture" complete with wranglers and a cowboy hat. Walking in, I was welcomed by the wooden beams and old Arizona charm. You would never expect such character inside, by looking at the restaurant from the outside. Now on to the food, oh the food! I ordered the steak sandwich which melted in my mouth! It was tender perfection at its finest. The sandwich is open face with a steak smothered in blue cheese placed on top and complete with a big onion ring. Every bite was better than the next. I am the first to admit that I gobbled up every bite and didn't look back. Before the sandwich, I had the tomato and mozzarella salad which was a fresh way to start the meal. The tomatoes tasted like they were straight from the garden and accompanied the fresh mozzarella perfectly. We ended our feast with my favorite type of dessert...the s'mores! However, these aren't your typical s'mores. These are s'mores with a culinary kick! They came in a skillet pot with a chocolate souffle at the bottom and marshmallow on the top. The server then lit the marshmallow on fire and let it sit until it was burned enough for us. Once we were ready, we blew out the flame and consumed the delicious dessert. Order this dessert. It's sinfully amazing and I continue to dream about this dessert until the next time I get to visit.I still love it here but I found out tonight that they changed their menu and they have removed their steak sandwich. I'm heartbroken because I love this sandwich and hope they bring it back! Their food is still amazing though and I love their atmosphere.

Restaurant name  La Brioche True Food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
La Brioche is something that must be tried, but they have some big flaws and it's not something everyone will like.First off, they have the best Croissant ever made.  Period.  I've been to the "actual" La Brioche in France, and I still like the Croissants here better than anywhere else, so that's saying a lot.  The Chocolate Croissants are equally as good, so don't skimp when you go there.  The Croissant has a nice hard shell (not hard like stale bread, good hard), and a creamy-butter taste that you'll be longing for after you leave.  Plus, almost zero flakiness like most other quality Croissant makers.Secondly, the restaurant itself is fairly new (they used to have a small bakery down the street), and they did a nice job with the furnishings.  It looks very victorian vintage, with a unique color layout and pleasant dining areas.  There's also an outdoor section when it's nice outside, and a comfortable waiting area when they're busy.Those things said, they have a HUGE problem with service.  At the old bakery, there was 1 or 2 curmudgeon employees who were extremely rude no matter how you approached them.  At this new restaurant, there's now a handful of people who share that behavior, except they also have inexperience and no tact to add to the list.Additionally, the food items are hit or miss.  They all have a little something off about them, and the presentation is pretty basic considering the steep prices.My Recommendation -   Stop in and buy a few Croissants, don't stay for lunch.I thought I had figured out how to have a good meal at La Brioche: take out.  I very much enjoy the organic burger and some of the omelets, and, with take out, I had been able to avoid the horrible service.Alas, no more.  I called in an order for my usual burger with avocado and swiss, stating I would be right over.  I arrived, paid for it, and waited.  And waited.  I checked, only to find that the person who took my call had indicated that I would pick it up one hour later than I had said.  No apology from the staff involved, barely an apology from another staff member, and certainly no gesture like, "Please, have a pastry on us."I am done with True Foods.  Madison has a number of other restaurants with better food and much, much better service.Incidentally, while waiting for my missing order, I discovered how to get good service at True Food: have a relationship with a staff member.  A young women who was apparently attached in some fashion (girlfriend?) to a staff member received lavish attention from that person and other staff.So, unless you are related to someone who works at True Food, look elsewhere.I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon.I don't get the allure. Is it the furniture? The water pitchers? When I go out to eat I want food that tastes great. It's why I have decided not to cook and actually leave my abode to go spend money somewhere else. And the food I've had just doesn't wow me. Now I've only been for breakfast, so maybe things really get exciting around lunchtime? Add to this the fact that servers are a bit aloof (I find myself having to repeatedly ask for things) and the insane prices for eggs (I get the whole true food thing, I do) and it's just not a place I'll find myself returning to soon.If I could sum up La Brioche in one word it would be: Overrated. I've been to La Brioche more times than I've liked because I have an aunt in town who loves it and we go together often. Also, I used to work at the UWHC and would go to lunch with coworkers there sometimes.I like that La Brioche is attractive. Their decorating style is cute and reminds me of an eccentric old lady's house. The hot pink wallpaper on the back wall is the bomb. I also like how the egg dishes come with mixed greens on the side instead of carbs. Here is what I don't like about La Brioche: -It's EXPENSIVE. Last time I was there a couple months ago, I took a new employee out for lunch. We both drank water and ordered a sandwich each. The sandwiches come with green salad on the side. My sandwich (a BLT) in particular, was tiny. It was more like the size of a half-sandwich from a place like Panera. The bill came to something like $30 dollars with tip. I thought this was ridiculous, and I didn't think the service, food, or atmosphere warranted that price.-The eggs are bland. At least, the times that I've had omelets and such there, the dishes contained little flavor, and were in desperate need of some salt. I'm also pretty sure based on flavor (or lack thereof) that they use non-stick spray to cook eggs as opposed to using butter. This is a cardinal sin in my book. Butter is not to be feared, but embraced!-The service is friendly, but SLOOOOW. The aforementioned lunch with my department's new employee took over an hour from the time we ordered to the time we got our bill. For two sandwiches. Nothing even had to be cooked! This is not good if they hope to appeal to people on limited-time lunch breaks.-Finally, and this is picky, I'll admit, but it really rubs me the wrong way that they have signs up on the wall (and a note in the menu)  that prohibit the use of laptops and cell phones. I get that they want the place to retain an elegant vibe, but at the same time, it irks me, as a functional adult, to be told what I "should" do, especially in such a passive-aggressive manner. Also, La Brioche, if you're going to take over an hour to bring people their bill from lunch during a workday, they will probably have to check their email at some point to avoid getting fired, and thus being unemployed and unable to eat at your expensive restaurant.Overall, I guess I'd give La Brioche 3 stars, but that's being extremely charitable.While  I've never had an appalling experience here, I've NEVER been wowed, and I've definitely been annoyed on several occasions.The breakdown:Taste of food: 2.5 starsLocation: 3 starsService: 3 starsValue: 2 stars

Review Text :
I want to give this place six stars because it's so good, but I apparently don't have that option. Sucks. I love this place, guys. I really do. They have really good food here, and it's truly the best Peruvian food I've had in Las Vegas, on par with El Rocoto in California. Not only that, but it's nice to go to a Peruvian place that has a real restaurant feel to it - some Peruvian places are a little bit more dumpy, where this place is really dressed up. Win for this place, my friends. But I won't bore you with details of the decor (it's tasteful), the staff (friendly and polite), or parking (plentiful!). Let's talk food. The food here is great. That's all there is to it. Please, please, please listen to me when I recommend that you get the jalea for your party. Trust me. It's so good it'll knock your socks off. Plus, the dish is huge! I order that just so that my date/family/whomever-I'm-eating-with eats that and leaves my plate alone. Plus, the red diced onions?! I could eat those as a dish. Whatever you eat, you need to drink chicha. It's a purple maiz drink, which makes it sound gross. Except it's the exact opposite of gross! It's an epic win! If you're not feeling that adventurous, try the Inca Kola. My non-Peruvian friends tell me it tastes like bubblegum, though I say it tastes like happiness. Also, try the lucuma ice cream. I really have no way of telling you how good this is, other than to tell you it's amazing. Everything here is good. The lomo saltado, ceviche, jalea... everything. It's really good food! I'm trying to think of more things to say that will tell you how good it is, but I can't. Because my work schedule was nuts for a while, I haven't been here in forever. I need to come back here soon, so you'll probably see me here when you come!mi peru is one of the best peruvian restaurants i have ever been to. you can taste the authentic quality taste in their dishes. my friend and i enjoyed both of the dishes we got. mi peru offers a lunch special on MONDAY- THURSDAY from 11am- 3pm. 5-6 dishes are priced at $8.95. we got the papa a la huancaina and the arroz con pollo. the potatoes and egg is always delightful with the yellow sauce. my favorite was the arroz con pollo dish with the rice and chicken. the dish came with a side of pickled onions that made the whole meal. the chicken was so moist and flavorful and the rice was really good. im only in vegas for a little time but i wouldn't mind to come back to try the other dishes. the server also gave us some fried corn kernels with the green sauce which was great!the ambiance is quiet with low music and the furniture is very traditional. service was great and always made sure everything was going good. i would definitely recommend coming here for a nice lunch or dinner.

I crave Ethiopian food.  I crave the spice factor, the flavors that only Ethiopian food can give.  And this week I gave into that craving.We've tried quite a few Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas, and decided to try a new one this time - Blue Nile.We arrived on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was empty.  We weren't deterred because most Ethiopian restaurants are always empty when we choose to dine.  It's the timing!You definitely have to pay attention when you're looking for this restaurant.  The outside is nothing to rave about, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  We had our choice of tables and the waiter asked if we were okay with the basketball game on.  We were and once he realized that the Husband was paying attention to the game, he asked if we wanted to move closer to the TV.  We declined but appreciated his offer.  (Note: No language barriers here!)We now know what we want these days without needing to look at the menu.  Their menu is pretty short - only 13 items on there!We chose the Vegetarian Combo "A combination dish of pureed split lentil cooked with onion and hot pepper in zesty spicy sauce, green pepper, collared green sauteed with garlic and cooked cured cabbage, potato, and carrots." ($9.99) and Kitfo "Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice...raw, medium, or well-done." ($10.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-las-vegas?select=u5U9roXHFQ1IWpfU1UGZJw#BSv57_OeogGrShN-lmwVMwThe Vegetarian Combo arrived first and we were starving, so we just dove right in.  We couldn't wait for the Kitfo to arrive although it did shortly after.  (It did seem like we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food...not sure if it's because we were famished or it actually took longer.)  The Husband commented that it looked like we got less food in the combo than other places and looking back at some of the other places we've eaten, I do have to agree.  However, the amount of kitfo we got was quite generous.  We had leftovers!The waiter explained everything we got - which was actually Yellow Lentils, Chickpeas, Collared Greens, Red Lentils, Fresh Salad, Cured Cabbage, and String Beans.  (No potato or carrots as mentioned in the menu description.)  Each item was good, but I do believe that the lentils have been a bit more flavorful at other places.  The kitfo was super flavorful though!  We did ask for it to be medium and it was more medium rare, which we still ate.  It also came with a homemade spinach and cheese concoction to help with the heat.  I didn't really notice that much heat coming from any of the food, except when we chose to add the much needed hot red pepper seasoning.We needed more water and injera bread, and did have to wait to be noticed first about needing those as opposed to it arriving before we were out.Overall, it was good.  There were some things better here than others and vice versa, but we'd come back. We usually never have leftovers, so that was a first.  I think I might be craving it again next week...where to next?3.5 stars.

Restaurant name  Autostrada
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Yay - a FTR for Gabi K!Located on Market Street at DC Ranch, Autostrada is the latest concept in Chef Aaron May's "collection" of unique restaurants in the Valley.  Autostrada, which means "an expressway or highway in Italian" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.I had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.We waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.Once seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  Next up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could've stopped here, but we kept going.For the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... I didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I'm not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.We finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.As you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  With the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I'm sure they will be a success.  Buon appetito!After much delay, Autostrada is finally open, surprisingly with little fanfare.   The couple we were meeting had trouble finding the new Italian osteria in DC Ranch.  Apart from a large red "A" vinyl on the doors, there was no other signage.  It's located at the intersection across from The Armitage.The menu is simple and straightforward at very palatable prices - nothing is over $18.  Food is encouraged to be shared family style.  All of which sounds like a great concept in a recessionary environment.None of the antipasti piqued our interest so we jumped straight to the pastas. Fettuccine with scallops and mushrooms ($17) and orchiette with pork sugo and peas.  The marscapone sauce on the fettucine was deliciously creamy although a touch heavy handed.  The pork sugo was a bit too sweet and the dish just fell flat for us.For the main, we shared the roasted sea bass with fennel and tomato ($16) and NY strip steak (pre-sliced for easy sharing) on potato and sunchoke puree.  Both were solid dishes.  Steak had great flavor but oddly it was not sliced across the grain and had a little gristle.Our favorites were the contorni (aka sides). The tiella - baked layers of eggplant, zucchini & tomato topped with parmesan was packed with flavor and delicious just as Gabi said.  The baby artichokes were fried to a nice crisp on the outside contrasting nicely with the tender interior.For dessert, we chose vanilla bean panna cotta with sliced strawberries and the marscapone tart with poached pears and spiced walnuts.  Again both were solid dishes.The interior has an industrial cool vibe to it with a long metal bench running along the wall and a stainless steel walled kitchen that runs across, separated by glass so you can get a full view of the action from most of the dining room.  There is an equal if not greater number of seating outdoors including tables for up to 8.Autostrada serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Over Easy and The Lodge fame's latest dining destination.

Review Text :
Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!Scramble has become a new favorite spot for breakfast... and clearly from the number of people that are packed in on any given visit, I am not alone. This is one of those places that I had to ignore my first impressions. My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level. Between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!). Now for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique... My only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; ) On-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place. This is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!For my favorite person in the world's sake, I wanted to write a raving review of this place. Sorry Christina P, I just cannot do it. Honestly, not one thing impressed me. In fact, I did not particularly care for my three cheese omelet. The hash browns are pre-made with bacon, so I could not order them being a vegetarian. The pancakes were really thick, and I only like thin things. The outdoor patio is nice. Unfortunately it was super windy the day we went. The prices are relatively reasonable. It's not good, it's not bad. I'm sure I would eat there again if I was in the area and needed to eat really bad, but I wouldn't make the trip up there again.I love, love Scramble! I don't know what it is about the place! Is it the sleek and simple decor? Hmm, is it the friendly, attentive service? Is it the supa yum food? Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint! I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day! On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying. My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home. Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food. I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!I  know I will be going back to Scramble.. I can definitely see this becoming one of my go to places to meet friends, or get breakfast on way across town or just to treat the family on the weekend..  After the recent UYE here for Foster Kids ( A group I hold especially dear)  I really can't wait to take others here..Scramble could be  a great place in my list of restaurants because of a few reasons ..1. Located on 7th street  near many of my friends  who live in Central Phoenix or Moon Valley  -great for the girls to eat before going on a day outing 2.Food is served with a walk up line and  served fast ..that means not fussing with waiter, or  waiting for service and you eat good but quick3. The food is tasty  , while maybe not rich  or decadent or over the topthe food is great tasting  but without leaving you feeling like you need a nap. Food quality is good , it taste like they just made it in Grandmas kitchen without adding a lot of grease. 4. It's got that modern coolness thing  going on ...Atmosphere does say something specially when you are meeting friends... Thanks Scramble for your unique niche in my mental list of places to eat breakfast....  now if you only served Brinner every night!Egg whites and oatmeal and brizza oh my!I've been hearing about Scramble for months now and I finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today.  I loved it...The oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion's brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!I love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.  I wish I lived closer to Scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Even though it's a bit of a drive for me, I will be back... especially to check out their upcoming "breakfast for dinner" charity events on Wednesday nights.  (Stay tuned for info on the Yelp events calendar).You've got a new fan in me, Scramble... see you again soon!If anything could get me up in the morning, a shop like Scramble is it. I finally had the chance to try Scramble and it's apparent that I've definitely been missing out! On your typical Saturday morning, breakfast joints can be overpopulated and require a 45 minute wait which normally dissuades me from visiting and causes me to just skip ahead to lunch instead. But this morning, I visited Scramble and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that not only does Scramble have plenty of seating to accommodate the mass crowds, but it's an order, pay and seat your self style restaurant so it cuts out the dreaded wait time. Everything on the menu looks delicious, especially the brizza! I ended up opting for the veggie scramble with sun dried tomatoes, peppers and cheese and accompanied with roasted potatoes. But the sourdough french toast sounded so delectable that my friends and I decided to split that as well. I'm glad we make the choice to go big or go home because the french toast was worth every bit! The service was relatively quick despite the crowded restaurant and the food was delicious and steaming hot upon arrival. While visiting, I noticed a sign announcing that Scramble is offering unlimited pancakes through the month of October. Sign me up for that! I also enjoyed the serve yourself unlimited coffee and soda fountain. It kept my thirst quenched while filling my belly with the tasty food. Like I mentioned, the restaurant offers plenty of seating and the atmosphere itself is clean and modern. But be prepared to sit in a less than comfortable seat. The restaurant would deserve an extra star if they had better seats and possibly more booths. But, like I said, the atmosphere was great and I like the fact that you can sit either inside or outside and enjoy the view of the desert mountains. I can't wait to find my way to CenPho again soon so I can visit Scramble and try other items on the menu!So we took a gamble when selecting Scramble so please forgive my Scramble ramble. Ugh. So much potential. Friendly staff. But so so food and though friendly, an untrained staff. Upon entering I like the open and airy room. I like the railing along the east wall with great views of the mountains. But. Wait. What are all these people standing in line for? The host I'm sure. WTF? It's an order at the counter sit down with a number on your table kinda place. Ugh again. Not my thing. Like camping. Or hiking. Or that second Narnia movie. I'm with two people and they are ordering up their grub. Scanning the menu. Asking some questions. At one point my friend was ordering a blended coffee drink. The shelves behind the cashier were loaded with frape type powders. I couldn't believe I heard her say "Oh. Yeah. I don't know how to make those!" LMAO. I had grabbed some bottled Vitamin water so I was in the clear on potentially prepared beverage fiasco. When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward. I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey. Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes. Lastly he realized as he scanned his check that his omelette he ordered didn't come out because it wasn't even listed on the bill. So Scramble. You got potential kid. I felt the heart in the room. Just didn't get much from the brain.A few weeks ago, I probably would have hooked Scramble up with a 5-star update, but they did something to piss me off and the service has been a bit sour lately.I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man??? The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted. I have to admit, the french toast and the English Muffin (when cooked right) have a special place in my soul! And there is nothing better that vegan butter  being readily available.More knowledgeable cashiers, quicker bus service on a busy day, and a re-introduction of the chili garlic sauce and you will have me back. As for now, I'm so mad about the discontinuation that I cannot even look at you!This was The Breakfast Club - UYE 2nd meet up, and this time Scramble was picked for the place, it was at 10am on a Sunday, one thing I can say is that people must love Scramble because it was busy from the time we got their to the time we left.As sometimes I do, I did a little research on the menu and I knew exactly what I wanted to try. The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish, I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash, visually this dish looked freaking fantastic, however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen, barely any egg whites and small yokes,  the ham was good, had great flavor, I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread, taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen, just seemed like dry corn bread, oh and the hollandaise sauce, have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce, oh high hopes for the sauce too, because cilantro, it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff, I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect! But the hollandaise sauce didn't have the hint of cilantro, and the sauce itself was lacking flavor, so I will continue my search for the great hollandaise sauce in the valley.  The sweet potato hash, ok I had no idea what to expect on this, it was bland like it needed some salt and pepper, but it was fresh, it had mushrooms, zucchini? and onions sautéed  mixed in with  slices of sweet potatoes, never thought of doing a sweet potato like that, now I know, going to have to try it at home! I ordered the cinnamon roll too, just to try it, again visually great, but the roll was dry and hard and inedible but the icing was perfect. Service seemed to be ok, for some tables they were on it and others it was eh, maybe they could work on that too.I don't think I will go out of my way to come back, I came, I saw, wasn't thrilled, back to the east valley I went.We were looking for something light, quick and good before hitting up the Phoenix Zoo and my sister had the perfect suggestion: Scramble.  She said there wouldn't be a wait--unlike most breakfast places on a Saturday morning. I was a bit puzzled when we pulled up and the line was out the door--my sis explained that it wasn't a line to be seated, but a line to order. Scramble is different than any other breakfast place/diner I'd every been to in that you place your order; pay; grab a seat; and then they bring your food out to you. After about 10-minutes we got up to the cashier and placed our order.Santa Fe Benedict- The two perfectly poached eggs come with Ham, Chipotle Hollandaise sauce and Jalapeño Cornbread instead of the typical English Muffin. I can't describe how good and innovative this dish is--exactly the kind of thing I was looking for in my trip; the perfect breakfast. 5*Toluca Brizza- If I thought my Santa Fe Benedict was innovative, then my wife's Toluca Brizza pushed the limits. The Brizza is a Breakfast Pizza, and I can't believe I've never seen this before. The Toluca comes with Chorizo, Eggs, Monterey Jack, Bell Peppers and  topped with a Jalapeño Cream Cheese. It's delicious, packed with toppings and big enough to share. My only complaint was the dough was a bit too dry for my liking but that's just a minor gripe. 4.75*Service & Ambiance- Upon first arriving we were greeted by a manager at the back of the line, and again when we left; he was super-friendly and asked intelligent questions about our experience. The service inside was good, quick and efficient. Scramble is very clean and modern looking. They have lots of TVs broadcasting different channels; I'd advise that you pick a spot to sit where there's something on you want to watch. 4*Value- Scramble is a great value with an average of ±$10/person with a beverage (e.g., coffee, OJ, etc); otherwise each plate is around $8.Scramble is very avant-garde in that they don't do breakfast in the typical way with the same old ingredients. I'm always looking for something different and progressive in a restaurant and Scramble is definitely that. I wish them luck and I sincerely hope that the Phoenicians who visit really appreciate what they have. As for me I can only hope that something like this pops up close to home, but in the meantime I'll be sure to visit whenever I'm in town. I give Scramble a huge thumbs up!We go to Scramble 3-4 times a month for breakfast because the food and service never disappoint us.We some times just stop in to get the jalapeño cornbread to go because it's so yummy, but, especially on a lazy Sunday morning, Scramble is a great place for breakfast or brunch.I really like the Toluca brizza, but my boyfriend prefers the Santa Fe Benedict.Because Scramble uses such fresh ingredients, EVERYTHING tastes great.The servers are very sweet and attentive, and the atmosphere is really homey.Scramble is our go-to spot for breakfast and brunch.  ENJOY!

When I first came here, I was very skeptical but little did I know that I would actually love this place!  Prices are very good.  Quality of food is excellent.  You can definitely taste the freshness of the fish.  Although, they don't have a lot of selections when it comes to their all you can eat sushi, it's still the place I go to when I crave it.  They just started it so that can be one of the reasons they didn't add all the sushi on that menu.  They have the best Green Mussels ever!  My all time favorites are the chef's specials like the Island Roll...I love it!  I haven't tried anything that I didn't like.  The staff here are very nice.  The atmosphere is great.  Very clean restaurant.Throughout my life I have been fascinated by all things Asian. I as a child I saw my first Japanese Spinning Sex Basket. My father brought it home on my 3rd birthday...he had no present for me...unless you call a slap and "don't ever come in my room again" a present. Knowing him...I do. Years later he passed out and his Swisher Sweet fell out of his hand and burned down our trailer...for the 5th time.  I cried for the chair that had made it through 4 fires, 8 wives, 9 waitresses named "Rose" and a guy in a dress...named "Rose"...and it was gone. Craftsmanship, luck...and an incredible amount of lubricant has protected it over the years.  My father wept. He cursed God. He flogged himself with the red plastic track for my toy cars.  He ran away...neither me or his badly burned 9th female Rose ever saw him again.  I heard he spent decades trying to replicate the feel of that basket. an obsession that nearly killed him. Rose despite his burns was a good stepmother to me....until...well...that is another story.Rex remembered...he remembered the squeals of delight...the screams of ecstasy...the snapping of the chain and the cries of help from my father and his companion of the day. He was insastiable...and animal...I was insatiable...and animal. I read everything i could about the Pacific rim...i nicknamed my anus "The Atlantic Rim"...I was a scholar of all things Asian. I even bought pictures of tigers on black velvet...very Asian.  I had two true Asian loves...Margret Cho and sushi.  Margret left me for some film director...I was crushed...but my search for all things sushi never subsided.  I would go to the finest sushi houses. I would eat canned tuna straight from the can. I was hardcore.In these times of want and woe....I want roe...as much of it as I can eat.  All you can eat sushi is usually like having a naked dance party in a Weight Watchers...never good...and not good examples of what fun you COULD be having...if you were in a different situation.  Kai Sushi and Steakhouse is like having a naked dance party in the backstage area of the Victoria Secret modeling show.  It is heaven. It is perfection. It is better than Margret Cho in my father's basket. My dream of good all you can eat sushi is realized...great all you can eat sushi for under 25 bucks!!  If this is dreaming...don't wake me up.I will start out with something not necessarily brought up first when reviewing all you can eat sushi...they have the best mussels in town! Bar none. Amazing. A touch spicy. A touch sweet. The best ever. Their sushi rolls are perfect. Great mix of some sweet, some crunchy, some with acidity, some with a combination.  The best roll...the Lion roll. Second best...the Stacy roll.  Everyone i had, in the many times I have been there, are great. The fish is so fresh, the roll is perfectly built, the sauces are spot on.  It is a miracle they do this for all you can eat.  They even do substitutions!!! I listened to a person ask to have a Stacy roll with cream cheese...and they did it! The salmon roe is excellent and the sashimi is very good as well...because the fish, and i can't say this enough...is so fresh, so tasty, that anything that is made with this kind of care is going to be good. The tempura is perfect in the roll, out of the roll...and most importantly...for the soft shell crab. The soft shell crabs are included and they are great...you would think perfect...OH NO...not until you get the Charlie handroll.  The Charlie is the single greatest roll in all of Las Vegas...and the best I have ever had. People who come from NYC, Philly and other major cities have sat in silence with me and ate bite after bite in sheer amazement. The crab is crunchy. The sauce is creamy and spicy. It is the single best thing I have had in my mouth since the time I met Emma Stone. Amazing service. Great people. The sushi chef is helpful and funny. The free refills of soda keep coming. The drinks are made strong and good! The menu is full and very little isn't included. Much more than most all you can eat sushi joints.Go. Eat. Think of Asia. Think of Rex. Think of the basket. Be in the basket with Rex...but he won't be with you.

Pretty classy and a great way to celebrate our anniversary!They have a private location for dining and we were treated like VIPs. The decor is very modern and upscale. We spent an hour and a half visiting and dining and never felt rushed.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The service was great! The hostess was very friendly and had our table ready when we arrived (reservation was right on). Our server was friendly and helpful in describing different entrees. You definitely want to dress up when you go here. It's a classy place for a date night or to celebrate something special!

Review Text :
We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise, AZ. What was our horrific crime? Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer, one that my husband has ordered there, and received, at least five times. Today, the manager refused to do it, saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant. Everyone who? It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty. We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah), as we always did, but he blew up and told us to get out!We are clean-cut, polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's. We tip well, love the food, have a good rapport with the staff, and never cause a problem there. This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's, and that manager has seen us before. Thanks to his nasty attitude today, we won't be back, and that's a shame. Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches, great latkes, and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages. The sandwiches are big enough to share, but we always buy two and take leftovers home. It's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup. Now he lost our business. $60 every other week adds up, Archie's. In this economy, isn't customer retention important?Think long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here. We won't make that mistake again.

Review Text :
The buffet itself isn't horrible but the service is pretty bad. Came here on a Sunday night and they were way understaffed. People were confused as to where to sit and the hostesses didn't know which tables were open. Out drinks weren't refilled as the poor waitresses was running around trying to take too many tables on. Food: It is allright. You obviously can't compare it to the Bellagio or the Wynn but it's decent. The garlic naan was SO GOOD! It has to be good since it was actually made in those cool stone clay pans and made fresh right on the spot. The shrimp is very large and fresh. The crab labs weren't bad. Dessert: Ok well you know it has to be good since it was designed by Pastry Champion Jean-Philippe Maury. I literally tried everything! Not too sweet and not too decadent. I really only came here cuz I had food credit from Aria. I guess it's not bad for the price. I believe it was around $27.00 for dinner per personHow many nice restaurants are there in Las Vegas on the strip alone?  A lot.  How many did we eat at?  ZERO!  Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.So Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.The buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.  The "free" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Minus two stars alone for the senseless slaughter of crustaceans.  If you can't prepare it well enough to at least be edible, don't bother offering it!With all of the buffets on the Strip, there isn't a lack of destinations to choose from.  However, considering how much I like Aria, I figured that their buffet would have to be on my list of spots to check out.  After all, if their buffet can match the hotel, then it must be pretty decent right?  So, after checking out their menu and being decently satisfied, some of my friends and I ended up coming on a Thursday night to give them a shot.  After paying and making our way in, I already started to get an ominous feeling though.  Now, I don't know about you...but I generally get worried when I start having doubts before I even make it to my seat.  Why so worried?  Well, although the spaciousness of the dining area might have had something to do with it, the buffet seemed pretty empty to me.  Though I didn't expect it to be a madhouse like how it is at some Asian buffets, I figured there would at least be a steady stream of people shuttling back and forth between the food and their tables.  In this case, not so much.   Refreshing as it was to be able to reach for the serving utensil without someone right on my ass waiting for me to finish, it made me wonder if all those missing people knew something I didn't.  Like most Vegas buffets, they have a decent variety of selections to cover just about every diner that should pass through the place.  From the usual buffet staples to Asian selections to Mexican food, they cover a lot of territory.  The question isn't so much what you want, but what is worth eating - like your choices, the quality varies as well.  For the most part, the food is fine - nothing terrible, but nothing that drives you back up there for seconds or thirds.  The Mexican food was pretty bad, though I like the chips and guacamole/salsa bar.  Then again, at a Vegas buffet, that's probably not the sort of thing you want to be chasing.  Among the few things that were of note, I thought that the prime rib was better than average for a buffet.  The seasoning on the outside was pretty good, and it was still juicy and tender.  The star though, if you're a fan, is the fresh crab legs they have.  Haven't seen all of the buffets in Vegas, but it's one of the few that I recall seeing crab legs at, and it's certainly the best that comes to mind.  They were very fresh and tasted great, and it's always handy when they slice it all the way through so it's easier to pick the meat out.  Hassle free crab legs?  Sign me up please!All in all, the buffet isn't terrible, and it's definitely worth checking out if you like crab legs.  Just that in Vegas, with so many other choices (relatively) close, you're probably better off heading over to Cosmopolitan or Wynn.Any buffet that calls itself "The Buffet" is either very comfortable with what it is (a buffet) or is trying to sound like "THE buffet" (kind of like the pretentious alums of THE Ohio State). In the case of "The Buffet" at Aria, it is the more humble laidback version. The light, bright, and open atmosphere of the buffet and simple, yet delicious dishes means The Buffet is a good choice when at the hotel, casino, or City Center. This isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in Vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.It's only $21 for lunch. If you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. The good stuff (aka Gourmet with Lobster) is only served Friday and Saturday dinner. If you are used to Las Vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and salads will seem very familiar. Nothing really stood out or sucked. I liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. Maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. Of course, desserts are a highlight of any Vegas buffet and the same is true at Aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.I was at the Aria buffet in its first incarnation and I liked it a lot.  I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.It's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!A few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.Now the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.This isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!Black M-Life membership means free buffet!  So dinner at The Buffet?  Why not!If you're expecting to be treated like royalty, get real.  This is a buffet.  Drinks refills will be slow but at least the food quality is great and nothing suffers from being overly-steamed or super frozen.  There's a wide variety of offerings here.  There's mini sub-sections for Chinese food, Indian food, Italian food, and so forth.  They have your standard fare of snow crab legs, Alaskan crab legs, king crab legs, prime ribs, pasta bars, salad bars, fancy desserts, et cetera.  I like how they have sugar-free items and gluten-free items so if you're on a strict diet, you won't be misled.I'm not sure if I would have stopped in if it wasn't for the M-Life membership perks but I will say that they make a delicious panna cotta.  Delicious!Given that the Aria Hotel and adjacent Crystal Shops are jaw dropping in their design, the buffet is especially disappointing.  Not much that you want to eat and, I am sorry to say, the seating area was quite dirty.  The tables remind me of the waiting area at the local auto club.  The extra star for this otherwise two-star review belongs to the Naan -- it's just awesome.  Made by hand as you watch and cooked in this heated earthenware pot ... oh man.  Who needs dessert?  However, should we be spending $40 for a casino buffet just for the Naan?   Nein.I was in Vegas the past few days, and had the choice for a comped dinner buffet at Aria, or a lunch buffet at Bellagio. After reading reviews for both, I chose the dinner buffet at Aria, and I was not disappointed.First, let me say this: I did not go to this buffet to eat gluttonously. Instead, I took small portions of several items (6 trips, which I will explain in a bit) so I could sample more items.I added on the bottomless alcohol package for $12.99 and paired different drinks with different "rounds" of food. I will notate which drink I had. I had one beer, one Pinot Noir, and one Champagne. I also had a glass of club soda, which I used to cleanse my palate between items.And yes, I took notes while eating dinner!Round 1 - Stella Artois Beer-----------* Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'd never had truffles before and I love mac & cheese. This was delicious. The sauce was light, and not overpowering, and the truffles were tasty!* Jasmine rice - This was from the Asian section. It was good - not dry at all.* Prime Rib w/ Creamy Horseradish - a bit dry for my liking.* Meatball w/ Marinara and Parmesean - I had two of these - and they were so good. The marinara sauce was a bit spicy, which was a nice and welcomed surprise.* Multigrain roll with cranberries - I thought this was a standard multigrain roll. When I bit into it, I saw there were cranberries. Bonus! Round 2 - Stella Artois Beer -----------* Carnivore Pizza slice (pepperoni, sausage, bacon) - It had been sitting out for a bit, and was a bit cold.* Pineapple Sausage - This was from the Asian section - quite tasty, I liked the fact the pineapple was mixed in with the sausage. I'd never tried anything like it before.* Chicken Pot Stickers - Cold, hard, and stuck together. Very disappointed.* Vegetable Pad Thai - Good, but not a lot of spice/flavor. But good.* Beef w/ Veggies - Similar to a Mongolian beef, w/o peppers. Was a bit cold.* Provolone Cheese - Wow, these were pungent!Round 3 - Stella Artois Beer-----------* Beef Steamship - Like the Prime Rib, this was a bit dry. Perhaps I should have tried the au jus (in retrospect).* Lentil Orzo - Cold pasta salad - orzo, lentil, and tomatoes. Freaking delicious!* Portugese Sausage - One of my most favorite items all night - spicy, tender, and delicious.Round 4 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City-----------* Clams - I tried clams for the first time....and I liked them!!* Sirloin Oscar - Served with crab meat, bernaise sauce, and asparagus. This was grilled to order and was the highlight of my meal. Great char and flavor on the steak. I got mine Mid Rare+ (between MR and M). The Bernaise sauce was phenomenal. The crab was delicious as well!Round 5 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City-----------* Pork Belly - Nice crispy skin, very tender meat.* Chorizo Rope Sausage - Hello flavor explosion! Spicy and tasty!* Au Gratin Potatoes - Very good - mild flavor, not overly cheesy.Round 6 - Prosecco Champagne - La Marca, Veneto, Italy-----------* Red Velvet Whoopie Pie - Nice tender cake, great cream filling. Nuts on top.* Creme Brule - nice glaze, but too creamy inside for my liking.* Coconut Macaroon - Nice toasted outside. I could've eaten so many of these!* Brownie - Rich, chocolatey - it's a brownie! But seriously, this was wonderful.* Oreo Gelato - One word: divine.* Cinnamon Crunch Gelato - The show stealer of the desserts. Oh. My. Gosh.Regarding drinks, the Pinot Noir was really good for being, what I assume, to be their house Pinot. The champagne was delicious as well. In fact, I will be looking to purchase a bottle of both the Pinot Noir, and the Champagne later this week if I can find them.While some of the carved items were dry, I will admit I did not use Au Jus, and I can only imagine the difference that would have made. There are so many choices here: Italian, Latin, Indian, Asian, Deli, Seafood, Carvery, Desserts, and much more. I did not even remotely try everything on the buffet, nor could I, as I would not have been able to eat it all. But I will try more items the next time I go back.Do yourself a favor, and have dinner at the Aria buffet the next time you are in Vegas. Despite some of the items being cold, the service was outstanding. This place gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.Alright I have stayed at Aria a few times but never really wanted to eat The Buffet when I was ever in Vegas. During my last trip here we actually got free buffet dinner so we decided why not! The inside and the look of the place seemed pretty nice but in general the food was just not that amazing. Some of the plates were empty most of the time even though I got up about five times and went and walked around. I thought the service for the ladies that got us drinks was pretty nice and she was quick about it! But food wise I would say go somewhere else and it is not worth it to eat here! I didn't really think they had a lot of variety and the food wasn't tasty or something that I could even remember.Dear Aria, Thank you for including a buffet promotion with my recent stay. Overall, I do and have enjoyed your buffet during my past and current stays. The buffet is moderately priced, has a variety of culinary options (in particular a great pick for seafood lovers), and is extremely convenient. What takes away from your buffet and will impact if I return is the buffet line. For lunch, we waited over 40 minutes to get into the restaurant. Per the wait, I can only assume that all of the other patrons had a promo too. Waiting in that sort of line without a promotion is nonesense. ClaudiaPS. I wrote this review while waiting in line.The buffet here is okay. I have tried better elsewhere  with a larger selection of ethnic foods. Since we were hungry and a little hungover from the night before, anything that looks appetizing was good.I basically stuck around the section with all the crab legs. Now you know what I eat the most. Lol. They were fresh as it was packed around ice. The beauty of these crab legs wasn't about its size, but how they're already cut in half for you to easily consume. Delicious! Other items I've tried was the roasted beef (not prime rib), roasted chicken, smoked salmon,  spicy tuna sushi roll, broccoli, pepperoni pizza, their dim sum sieu mais (dumping), the tossed green Cesar Salad, and finally their fresh fruits.I don't know why they call their beef "roasted beef" rather than using the fancy prime rib. Maybe it was a different area of the cow? But that huge roasted slab of meat did look wonderful.  But I think they should have let the meat absorb the marinated flavor a bit longer since it wasn't too flavorful in the mid cut. Believe it or not, aside from the crab legs, I probably enjoyed the salad and the fresh fruits the most. It look so fresh that I had to indulge. Yep, I need my greens and vitamin C. It kind of sounds like I'm an oinker for eating so much which I actually am, but really I only took a small proportion of everything to try out. Yes, I was stuffed from the variety.The buffet is well kept and very clean. I wouldn't worry too much about getting food poisoning since they deal with huge volumes. So the probability of something getting spoiled is rare.Again, the food is mediocre. But come and enjoy anyways. For us, nothing beats a free comp meal.  Haha.I've been to Las Vegas now 10 times over the years....I've had meals all over the place, and visited many buffets.  I like a good buffet every now and then.  I redeemed a few MyVegas vouchers for my friend and I.  Buy 1 get one free buffet, and two unlimited beverage passes.  I DO recommend the buffet, I do not recommend the additional $12.99 beverage pass, unless maybe you're going with options like beer, or sangria...options I didn't try during my brunch.  I guess I'll start with that part of the experience.  My friend and I tried a bloody mary - when I asked what the difference was between the two kinds, it was just one was spicier than the other, and they ARE pre-mixed, so nothing special.  We weren't thrilled with them so we got the mimosas...which weren't any better.  The orange juice seemed "fresh" with a tad of pulp, but not sure about the rest...it wasn't light or bubbly or anything.As for the food... we stopped in for brunch.  There weren't a whole lot of breakfast options, but what they had was good...as for the rest, they had EVERYTHING! Italian, seafood, sushi, salad bar, asian, you name it!!! And I can't say enough NICE things about the dessert options, along with a tasty gelato section which had flavors like peanut butter pretzel, and cinnamon toast crunch.I will say, if you're in a bit of a hurry...and have the drink pass, you do have a 3 hour time limit.  We didn't plan on having a 3 hour brunch anyway, but the service was a bit slow on the beverages so I'd keep that in mind if that was an option you were considering.Overall, the Aria is wonderful...the buffet is as well, lots of options and very clean!Monday lunch was $26 for adults. The selection of food was pretty good-----a lot of variety in cultural dishes. The desserts were better than expected. The server was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area.

Review Text :
Wow. This place is amazing! A few people at work keep telling me about this place. I swing by on a Thursday around early evening time to try it out. The inside of the restaurant looked like a place I would see in Hawaii. It wasn't over done but it was nice. The place looks like it could fit 100 people easily. What did scare me was the place was empty. Well, when I first walked in, I did see some ladies sitting on a table... but to my surprise they were the cooks and help just sitting around waiting for hungry patrons like me.After telling them I wanted to order to go, they handed me a regular menu menu with daily specials and let me at it. They had the typical things you would see on any Hawaiian restaurant menu. What thing I did notice is that they didn't have any Spam entrees. After a good five minutes of looking over the menu, I decided on the following:Beef Teriyaki Steak - (Bottom sirloin marinated with our special Asian sauce then broiled to perfection and sliced thin - $8.75) Wow. When they say Steak, they mean it! I have never seen Beef Teriyaki so large. Its like regular Beef Teri on steroids! Check out my pictures on how huge the portions are. The beef was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order this again.Hawaiian Style Roast Pork - (Cooked local style with Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped with our rich homemade brown gravy - $8.25) Yum! What makes this dish work is the homemade brown gravy. The roast port was tender and soft. Large portions as well. Great dish. I would definitely order this again as well.Korean Chicken - (Golden fried drumettes $ wings tossed in our delicious Korean sauce - $8.75) Yay! This dish was awesome as well. When I first cracked open the box, I just saw crispy chicken wings. I scooped some rice and pick up a piece with my fork and placed the chicken on my plate. I licked my fork and damn.... it was over. Just the taste on the fork was really really good. I had to dig in. So many flavors hitting my taste buds! I love this dish! Would definitely order again.Each dish comes with two scoops of rice and a side mac salad. The mac salad was good as well. Overall.... I love this place! The food is awesome. The portions are large the price is comparable to other Hawaiian joints. I would seriously recommend this place to my friends and everyone else who reads these reviews. You will not be disappointed. Pictures included!We try to keep the review short today!  This place is "Brok' da mout!"  Forget L&L or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ...you want the closest to genuine Hawaiian food?  You gotta come to Island Flavor!  Even the owners from Hawaii!  Big Island to be exact.This place is phenomenal for local island food, the portions are local too...HUGE!  We had enough leftovers for another meal that's how much food you get.  Island Flavor is actually only 4-5 miles away from my house but we never came around to eating there.  Finally tried it because of my coupon from Restaurant.com.  Be sure if you go you are hungry cause these folks don't skimp!  You walk out hungry, you definitely went to the wrong place.  Four of us went, and four of us walked out stuffed with a doggie bag in tow.  If you don't like white rice (what kine' Hawaii local are you?) then don't come here you crazy carb-conscious workoutaholics!Hawaiian food is usually a mix of cultures, Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino all combined.  Island Flavor's food made me fond of days spent home on Maui.  I had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of  Teriyaki Steak and Teriyaki Chicken.  Their homemade teriyaki sauce was just right, not too sweet and not too runny.  Perfect for mixing with your rice and macaroni salad.  Macaroni salad with pepper and tabasco...yum!  The steak was tender even though it wasn't a very expensive cut (sirloin) and cooked great with a lil' pink inside.  Chicken thighs were big and moist.  The gf had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork.  There must have been 3 large rows of katsu, enough to share!  They were fried just right too, not heavy or soggy at all.  The roast pork was juicy and the brown gravy wasn't from a box, very succulent.  The kids shared a Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Korean Chicken and Kalbi Ribs, and Chicken Katsu Loco Moco ($8.75).  The Korean Chicken is so ONO!  Those golden fried wings with their special Korean sauce was addictive!  Very good!  The Kalbi was great as well, their marinade pretty close to what I remember as a kid, lots of sweet from the sugar and soy sauce and grilled on an open flame.  The Chicken Katsu Loco Moco was a big gut-buster.  A massive portion of rice (like 4 scoops) topped with chicken katsu, two eggs (sunny side up in this case...alright!) and their homemade brown gravy.  It's like heaven and hell on a plate at the same time!  Definitely not a calorie or cholesterol counter.  But oh so yummy!  They serve lots of other things local Hawaii people love, Kalua Pig & Cabbage, Poke, Spam Musubi, and Pork Won Tons.  They also have oxtail soup, saimin, and burgers.Needless to say, we did not finish all of our food and ended up taking half of each of our dishes home.  The leftovers were good reheated too the next day.  Just don't heat up your macaroni salad!  No good on that one.A return visit to this neighborhood gem definitely did not disappoint!My mom was easily sold when she saw Oxtail Soup on the menu!  (No more waiting for California Hotel's Market Street Cafe's late night menu to be available!)* Oxtail Soup "Fresh beef oxtail cooked with ginger until tender." ($9.25) - Sure, it's a bit more expensive than Market Street Cafe's, but we're saving on gas money here! And it's available during the day - big plus!  It comes with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad, so that's always nice.  The oxtail was tender and flavorful, which is super important - and she got a bit more oxtail here too.  It has honking slices of ginger in it, so it has a gingerly broth flavor.  But the best part of all - we don't have to deal with the grumpy service we got over in downtown.Meanwhile, I was super excited that I came on a Friday to order: * Aloha Friday Special "Lau lau served with poke, lomi lomi salmon, haupia, steamed rice, & macaroni salad." ($9.75) - For under $10, I got a lot of food.  The customary two scoops of rice and scoop of mac salad AND poke AND lomi lomi salmon AND dessert!!  And the pork lau lau was ono delicious!  You can't go wrong at Island Flavor, we're glad it's in our neighborhood and definitely hope they stick around.Their only downfall - they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!  (And three weeks in a row, the Husband has wanted to go and I had to remind him that it was Sunday or Monday.)As everyone mentions - portions are really large. For the money, you're getting quite a bit of food. I loved the homey atmosphere and our waitress was very sweet & friendly. Fried poke salad ($10.25) - I was feeling adventurous. I can't say I enjoyed this very much but I guess it's more just my weird tastes. So I love seared tuna and I imagined it'd be like this. The problem with poke is each piece is a different size so the cooking is really uneven. Some pieces were burnt and grey and dry, some were pink and pretty, some weren't cooked at all, etc. I should have realized this before I ordered but that's my loss !Hawaiian mixed plate - we got this with double rice, kalbi short ribs and kahlua pork. My husband was so ecstatic - the first place we've found where you can get the pork with no cabbage mixed in! This was tasty but not as fatty and wonderful as the pork in Hawaii. The kalbi ribs were incredible, husband declared them best ever. Delicious! We'll return - and we'll be getting a big ole platter of kalbi short ribs next time !ALOHA LAS VEGAS yelpers!just moved to Las Vegas and I found myself craving Hawaiian food!Found I.F. on yelp and got super excited!Called in my order and picked it up.I had the mix plate- pork/kalbi, kona coffee mud pie, and shoyu poke.It was my guys 1st time having hawaiian food so I talked him into getting the hamburger steak. I grab 4 spam musubi's at the counter.We loved the food! I'll def come back for more! Take out or dine in. casual. indoor seating.Big serving! My whole order came out to around $50 fpr 2 people.If you love Hawaiian food, stop by Island Flavor!Aloha!- Miss Yelp 2011Aright so I moved to Vegas recently, but so far this is one of my favorite places to eat.  I came here for lunch yesterday with My T. and Thao T. and I have to say it was pretty dang awesome.  I haven't had lunch yet, so I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.Aright, I'm going to give you the low down.  The portions are big here, so I would suggest you go with a couple people, and you guys all try each others' stuff.  These are the 3 things we got, and I'll probably get them again.  1.  Korean Chicken - I have had wings like this once before in my life, and it was called Dry Fried Chicken at a restaurant in San Francisco called San Tung, and they are legit.  I wouldn't make a meal out of this, that's why I'm saying share.  Juiciest wings ever, and that Korean sauce is wicked2.  Kalbi Short Ribs- Again, it's a lot of food, so most people would die if they had this whole plate.  They are so tender, you can pull them off the bone.  I want it now.3.  Baby Back Ribs (can't find on menu for some reason, maybe new item) - My least favorite, but fantastic in the least.  It just doesn't compare to the top 2 items I mentioned.  Owner served us, he's a great guy.  So humble, very chill vibe in the place.  You can tell it's really Hawaiian.  I will come back.You're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youTropical food in L-VDesert oasis, you seePortions big on plate lunchOh how I loved it a bunchYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youPardon the way that I eatSuch island flavors on meatChicken 'yaki sweet and sourChopped steak I quickly devourKalbi ribs were just fineHOISIN RIBS so divineYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youI love you 'FlavaYour food is outta sightI need you 'FlavaOn a hot Vegas nightI love you 'FlavaTrust in me when I sayOh Island FlavorYou beat all the buffetsOh Island FlavorYou truly do amazeAnd so I Yelp! you 'FlavaLet me Yelp! you...You're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youHaupia cake so creamy lightGuava cake a delightOpakapaka salad so freshBrought goosebumps to my fleshYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of you I love you 'FlavaYour food is outta sightI need you 'FlavaOn a hot Vegas nightI love you 'FlavaTrust in me when I sayOh Island FlavorYou beat all the buffetsOh Island FlavorYou truly do amazeAnd so I Yelp! you 'FlavaLet me Yelp! you...Yelp 365 Challenge #150/365 (Operation Rice / Las Vegas Adventures)FOR THE WIN!!!In my previous review, I shared that we had an all day that was busy at the Adventuredome then watching the Fountains at the Bellagio. By the time that we reached our vacation rental it was past 8:00 and I asked everyone what did they want to eat for dinner?Everyone replied, "Anything with rice"So, of course, I opened up my trusty Yelp app and typed in local food.Well, waddaya know...there was a local food restaurant, "Island Flavor" RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.If I wanted to weep with joy because I didn't have to drive very far!I wanted to weep further because their menu made our stomachs growl happily.I called up the restaurant to place a takeout order. I shared with her that all the plates were all rice instead of salad. She was really friendly and then asked if we ate brown rice too? I though they ran out of white rice and it didn't bother us to where I shared her that we did. But, she said, "No, I'm going to give you that in a container on the side too." After placing the order, she shared that they close at 10 and if I got there before then and the door was locked, I could just knock on the window and they'll open up for me. If you live near Durango, this place is very easy to find. Sure enough the door was locked but they let us in. After we paid for our food and was loading it up in the car, she came out and told us to wait because they were also including haupia with our plates. YES!!! I didn't win no jackpot but we got some good eats from Island Flavor!!!When we brought the food in the kitchen, everyone just wanted to swoon not only because there was rice but the portions were HUGE.Loco Moco: The hamburger and eggs practically filled the entire plate oozing with gravy.Kalua Pig and Cabbage: This plate was HEAVY because it was loaded with kalua pig and cabbage.Kalbi Short Ribs: Oh my heavens...if you were ordering this plate in Hawaii, you would have three regular size pieces that were cut on the thin side. But, Island Flavor didn't give me three...they gave me FIVE THICK PIECES.Along with these plates, they included shoyu and whatever brings warm fuzzies to a local person who loves local island food. Breakdown of Island Flavor:Food: The menu is extensive. Poke maybe on the pricey side BUT since this is the desert, you have to expect it. Overall, the menu caters to everyone who is visiting or moved to Vegas from the 808 state. I thought it would be like L&L or Loco Moco but nope, their flavors are more of the homecooked style that makes you miss your family back at home in Hawaii.Customer Service: FILLED WITH ALOHAPrices: Reasonable especially because the portions are HUGELocation: Easy to findRestaurant / Ambiance: Just right, clean and family friendlyRecommendation: FIVE STARS...it is a must go-to for anyone who never tried but wants to try local food from Hawaii, 808 visitors or 808 people who moved to Vegas and just misses the food from the islands.Very disappointed! If I had reviewed this before I'm sure they would of gotten 5 stars but after tonight's visit they deserve only 1 for overall service. I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door. Today's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. After the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. Finally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! My blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape. I about had it so I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door made me lose my appetite!After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures of the island, local grinds served, I convinced my work to order lunch for pickup, boss to pay for it and so glad I did. I ordered a katsu chicken loco moco which was infused with great island flavors, which consist of plenty steam rice, katsu chicken seasoned well with a nice breaded crunch, topped with  2 over medium eggs and indulged with rich, carmel gravy along with tasty mac salad on the side. Like Whoa! Did I enjoy every bite, food coma if eaten at one seating but worth it, OH YEAH! Don't know what eveyone else ordered because I was focused on my food but I know everything was a hit since everyone ate what they had ordered, leaving no leftovers for me to pick on the next following work day.Dont know about the in-dining experience yet but the ordering was easy, pickup was fast and the food was a hit. Can't wait for another Island flavor food experience.I often complain about the lack of good eats in the depths of SW Las Vegas.  Sure, we have a few decent spots on Rainbow but i feel like we deserve more place in my neighborhood.  I've probably eaten at about 8 different Hawaiian places in the vegas valley - I give my local place, Island Flavor, the GOLD !First of all, the employees are great - great attitudes, great services and consistent food.  The space is pretty simple - i'm pleased that they recently remodeled the space that resulted in adding more table space.  I've been told by a couple of the employees they make more $$ on catering than the restaurant itself.  I've been in a few times while they've prepped the food for catering events - it's a sight to see !Anyways, the food - large portions, very reasonable prices and good 'ol stick to the ribs style grub !  My personal favs ?  The pork loco moco ( awesome !! ), the korean ribs,  the mac salad,  i REALLY dig the gravy ! and most of desserts.It' all good !!This place has great reviews from Yelpers, so I went with Chad S. to see what was up.  We arrived around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and there were only two tables open, as the place was busy, always a good sign.  I already knew that I wanted Kalbi, so no need to really peruse the menu.  Our friendly waitress took our orders and then our food arrived quickly, which was a great thing because we were hangry.  I was very pleased that I got four big pieces of Kalbi and there was meat on them bones, not a lot of fat, which can happen with this dish.  There were also two big scoops of white rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I ate one scoop of the rice and didn't touch the mac salad, but only because I am trying to be more protein-oriented and eat less of the bad carbs, but you gotta have some rice with your meat, right?  The kalbi looked and tasted like it just came off the BBQ in someone's backyard; after three pieces, I was fully satisfied.  I'm just sad that we couldn't get any of the Spam Musubi before we left.  They have musubi in a warmer next to the cash register so you can buy some to go; they sold out while we were eating.  Oh well, it just gives me an excuse to go back.  Aloha!Came here on a packed Friday, but we were still seated fairly quickly and got to enjoy some chill island music and vibes from the person performing that night. He did a great job making people laugh, having some playful banter and just keeping the overall mood light and fun. Be sure to tip the performer too if you find yourself grooving along :D. I got the Laulau which is usually only available on Friday nights. It contains haupia (coconut-flavored) and smoked fish flavors, but I happen to be a really big fan of those seemingly conflicting tastes and would definitely order it again. The other Hawaiian staples all look delicious here and their portions are huge! You'll definitely have enough food for breakfast or lunch the next day and I would recommend everyone at the table getting something different so you can get a taste of everything. I've also been craving POG since I was last in Hawaii, so I was excited to see that they give 50 cent refills here! I was super appreciative that the owner took time to talk to us on a busy night and welcome us since it was our first time here. He even apologized for the not-so-long wait, which was actually the most enjoyable wait I've ever had at any restaurant. This is definitely a great place to bring friends and family, without the hustle and bustle of the strip.I don't particularly enjoy writing negative reviews, especially for a place that I once loved and highly recommended. Because we absolutely loved their kalbi short ribs, we decided to order a party tray from them. (1/2 pan size kalbi short ribs = $80) Imagine my disappointment when several of the short ribs were blackened, as in burned. They sat on the bottom of the tray and went unnoticed for awhile. We were wondering why our guests weren't eating them and that's when we saw the unsightly pieces. My mom went to the restaurant later on that week to let them know. They took down our phone number and said they would call us to talk about it. No one called. A few months later, my mom returned and went in to talk to them and again was told someone would call us to talk about it. We were told that usually the owner would have checked out our order before it went out, but on that particular day, she came in after we picked up the order. Therefore, she never saw the order go out.  Again, no call from them.Because I was so disappointed with that experience, the food and the lack of customer service, I decided to just not eat there anymore.After almost a year of protesting, we finally decided to order food from there again. I initially tried ordering Pork Lau Lau on a Friday, but was told they didn't have any. I ended up with the combo Kalbi short ribs and furikake shrimp. My short ribs were blackened again! However, the Husband's order of short ribs were just fine. Also, the shrimp just didn't taste that great anymore. My Mom always orders the oxtail soup and always comments on how fatty their version is. You can see chunks of fat on theirs that probably should have been trimmed a little. (I'm all down for a little fat, but theirs is just too much.)Their tuna poke salad, both raw or cooked, was pretty damn good...especially the dressing. But it's since doubled in price and not really worth it anymore. Overall, I'm pretty sad that Island Flavor isn't in our repertoire of food choices these days. Quality and service had just gone down since they first opened and I get a sour taste in my mouth when I think of them now. With their current 4.5 star rating on Yelp, they won't be hurting for business I'm sure.I would drive all the way back to Las Vegas, just to come eat here! It was such a random find...we were driving to Vegas and I was really craving some poke and somehow found this place because it was still open by the time we reached the area. Located off the strip, in a small strip mall with plenty of parking. Upon walking in, I knew we were going to have a nice hawaiian meal. Almost everyone there was hawaiian and there was a guy singing and playing his ukelele. First and foremost, the service here is beyond amazing! The lady running the place is the sweetest. She's fast and efficient, makes great suggestions and she cares so much about her food! And the food...oh my goodness!!!! So yummy. We ordered the shoyu poke as an appetizer. And it was such a large amount...I definitely had my poke fix:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=liUDL0_QkxmQ6GZwxsd8YA&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggI ended up ordering the chicken furikake, which I've never had before but it was suggested:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p_62gNsitkBL2YWYKZDETw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggIt was probably the best thing I've ever had in a long while. It was so good!!! My sasquatch ordered the kalbi short ribs:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hvuk6dldYcVr1aajI25Rrw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggHe was so hungry he started eating them quickly. The nice lady who was running the place saw that the short rib was slightly undercooked. She was so concerned, even though he didn't mind much. And she ended up putting in a nicely cooked new piece into our to-go boxes. She was so sweet. So definitely it was a 5 star experience for me. The food. The service. It's worth the drive! I miss this place already and wish there was something like this in LA!Food was very good and the portion size is huge so try sharing the dishes. I had teriyaki chicken plateAloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors. With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order. The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating "lechon", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is true to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!Guys at Island Flavor: "Oh, back again, huh?"  Ummm, I totally Yelped this place a week before going to Vegas and came here twice in three days.So I totally live for plate lunch.  Note that my profile's "last meal on earth" is Hawaiian plate lunch, and my home city is surprisingly short on Hawaiian restaurants. (So short the number is zero.) So I had to get a fix in! Or two or five.The meals here are so big that it just hurts. There's a reason why 90% of the bouncers at XS are Samoan. They don't get that kind of mass needed to punch creepy misbehaving guys in clubs by eating salad. I've made 5 meals out of my 2.This is the most legit Hawaiian food I have had in the lower 48. Everything is seasoned well and tastes sooo bombbbbb. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. Service - 5/5 All the waiters working here are legit! Either they got island accents or fake them like bosses. Love how genuinely nice they are. Service is not over-the-top or fake. Just nice people being nice and bringing me tasty things. (If you split a plate, don't forget to tip like you ordered two entrees! These guys won't make sheet otherwise!)Food:Basic menu is on website, but they have a paper insert with daily specials. So if you're calling an order for take-out, ask them if what the specials of the day are! Also, the desserts aren't on the menu. They are listed on the table (see picture). Aloha Friday: Come early so you can get a seat! This place is jam packed on Friday! They have the most amazing family come out and play bass, uke, and guitar while singing traditional Hawaiian music. I grew up on an island, and it felt like coming home. I didn't realize I was getting my soul healed while eating lau lau.- Lau lau- 5/5 wrapped in delicious leaves, juicy, and the perfect saltiness when you eat it with rice!- Lomi salmon- 2/5 This was almost all tomato and no salmon :( I guess it counted as my vegetable of the day?- Mac Salad- the guy asked me "Are you sure?" when I said I was fine with the mac salad and white rice. Was he expecting me to sub a vegetable instead? Please, bee-atch. I'm not from California.- Kalbi ribs- 5/5 These are BOMB! Way thick slices and grilled with a nice caramelization on them! They don't skimp, and the pieces are super big! - Furikake chicken- 5/5 Super crunchy exterior so that it stands up to the glaze and stays super crunchy. You know how Panda Express orange chicken gets all soft if it's been sitting there awhile? No flaccid chicken here, folks.- Haupia cake- 5/5 I used to work at a bakery on island, and we made haupia cake. Theirs here is even better. The cake itself is perfect density, and the flavor is dynamite.- Kona pie- 2/5 Ehhhh eat the haupia and guava cake instead! The coffee flavor isn't strong, and the other sauces they schlepp on the plate overpower any coffee taste.I'm glad this place isn't in my home city. I'm not looking for employment as a Samoan bouncer at XS quite yet, which is what I would probably be if I lived in Vegas and continued eating here. Fill up on aloha spirit, leave happy, and then go take a nap.This was my first foray into eating Hawaiian food other than just trying some of these items from a buffet.  Three of us came here to share plates and try a number of different things.  Items ordered:1/2 portion poke furikake styleChicken katsu and kalua pig mixed plateKalbi short ribs and shrimp mixed plateRoast pork loco moco1 musubi Banana bread puddingChantilly cakeGuava cakeHaupia cakeKona coffee mudd pieThere were three standouts in the savory items ordered--kalua pig, kalbi short ribs, and roast pork loco moco.  I've been a fan of kalua pig and this did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were grilled perfectly with the meat being very juicy.  I thought the marinade was a little sweet and I didn't care for the flavor of the small container of sauce we got in a small container.  The loco moco was good as far as the pork was concerned and the gravy was good.  There was just so much rice that everything else got lost in the rice.The two combination plates we got both came with two large scoops of rice and one large scoop of macaroni salad.  There was just an overwhelming amount of rice.  The macaroni salad was quite good.I enjoy poke but this was different than other poke I've had.  The tuna was crunchy in texture and not soft like other times I've gotten poke.  I don't know which is the way it's supposed to be.  The furikake flavors were good.  I'd skip the musubi.  A whole lot of rice with only a small piece of spam inside.  For the sweet items, we got smiles from the server when we started ordering.  At one point he said, "You do know we have large portions?"  With a laugh, our order continued until we had four slices of cake and a banana bread pudding.  Standouts here were the banana bread pudding and the guava cake.  My favorite was the guava cake.  The Haupia was nothing special and the chantilly was a bit disappointing.  Understand that I would not turn down any of these if offered to me, but I wouldn't order those.  I found the Kona coffee mud pie disappointing.  Stick with the guava.Now I know why my friend, Candace C, says in her review that ..."this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-­elastic-band-before-­coming kind of food."  Service was OK.Items Selected:Half-Pound Furikake Style PokeSpam Musubi Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pig mixed plateKalbi Short Ribs and Furikake Shrimp mixed plateRoast Pork Loco MocoBanana Bread PuddingChantilly CakeGuava CakeHaupia CakeKona Coffee Ice Cream Mud Pie No doubt a neophyte regarding Hawaiian culture as well as cuisine it was with two friends that I sat down amidst the spacious confines of Island Flavor for dinner Saturday night, and going in with modest expectations based on what could be gleaned from reviews of those more accustomed the results were at times precisely what I'd hoped for, and occasionally far better than I'd originally been led to believe.Admittedly at least 'familiar' with some of the styles comprising the genre, a number of Asian influences  noted amidst fried and roast meats with rich sauces rarely lacking in salt, it was just moments after 5:15 that I entered the sparsely decorated space and with the room half-filled by a mix of ethnicities that included several island natives it would not be long before drinks were filled and menus were navigated, a three-course feast soon to follow as  light mid-tempo music echoed from speakers overhead.Well trained in service, the majority of the staff clearly longtime employees of the restaurant and happy to answer questions related to portions as well as preparation, it was with a duo of cultural staples that the sampling of Island Flavors began, and although neither would have been a preferred order if dining on my own both the snappy tuna and  Spam Musubi proved mostly what was anticipated, the former loaded with umami while the later, perhaps fortunately, saw the saline pork product mostly lost within the roll of warm rice. Warned that portions run large despite costs that hover around $10 per plate, it was onward to three entrees that the evening progressed, and although the fried shrimp were a bit overcooked while the chicken was mostly flavorless without sauce, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in either the smoky shortrib or tender kalua pig, an equally well cooked piece of pork found strewn amidst rice beneath two sunny-side eggs and a rich brown gravy that, on its own, could have likely served a family of four.Leaving at least four cups of rice behind, along with a few bites of macaroni salad that was actually quite enjoyable with plenty of creaminess packed in each bite, it was with an "all-in" approach that sweets were ordered up, and despite warnings and raised eyebrows from more than one staff-member the finale to follow was almost entirely worth the indulgence, the $5.50 Mud Pie a bit of a disappointment due to gritty ice cream while each cake from nearby Andrea's was presented at a bargain $5 per large slice, the faintly coconut Haupia not unlike something one might find at a wedding while the chantilly and guava came across sweet yet balanced, the quivering bread pudding taking a far less subtle approach with each banana-packed spoonful making a strong case for best in the city, or at the very least a good reason to come back.Purporting no expertise in Hawaiian cuisine, but hoping to learn more in the coming months and years, Island Flavor represents a tremendous bargain to those looking for something familiar yet different with service and setting far superior to most eateries broadly grouped as 'ethnic,' the desserts a particular strong point even if they are mostly outsourced.

#104I arrived at the Fireside Grill after a really HOT day in Arizona last May (yes, it took me a bit to post my review).  I was looking for something refreshing and comforting to relieve me from this tough, hot, steamy day.  A friend suggested the Fireside Grill in Fountain Hills.  Sounds great.We entered the place and the bartender/manager Louis greeted us in a super friendly manner, welcoming my group to the establishment.  We took a seat at the open bar area and began watching TV--they were showing the Baltimore situation as it unfolded.  Louis asked me what would I like to drink as I looked over the menu.  I ordered a drink and began to ask Louis about the menu.  He offered several suggestions; however, I (and my companions) decided on a few items:The Southwest Chicken SaladThe Cobb SaladThe Pasta and MeatballsThe Southwest Chicken Salad was incredible.  It was served in a toasted tortilla bowl with beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, olives, avocado, and sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The Cobb salad was good, not amazing.  This salad was replete with tiny chunks of turkey, bacon, thinly sliced egg, fresh blue cheese and whatever dressing we chose.  It was a large portion, but kinda boring.  Finally, we had the penne pasta and meatballs with marinara sauce.  This pasta dish came with garlic bread layered with melted cheese and a small side salad.  The place is clean, and open, looking out onto a pool and the valley.  Live music was preset with a singer.  Many regular guests were there as Louis knowingly greeted several customers as they arrived.  The service from Louis was impeccable.  He was attentive, friendly and informative.

2.5 starsThis is my sister's go-to resto for Chinese in Charlotte, and I can see why: House of Leng's serves tasty rice and lo mein dishes, as well as fantastically crispy and flavorful chicken wings, and it's next door to her favorite nail salon.  Whenever we get a mani/pedi, which we almost always do when I fly in for a visit, we usually do take-out at HoL before heading back to her home.I'd probably rate today's visit 3- or 3.5 stars had my take-out order not taken more than the eight minutes I was told it would take for the wings to cook, which the guy even apologized would be the reason I'd have to wait a bit, and had I received the shrimp lo mein entree (for Mom) I'd asked for, rather than the shrimp lo mein combo that Mom found after we'd already arrived home.  (Btw, the wait for the order was around 25 minutes.)Still, Mom and sis enjoyed the meal (the eggroll looked so delicious and had a very delectable-sounding crunch!), so three stars will do.  However, I wished I didn't have to suffer the blame for HoL staff getting the order wrong...

This place is flippin fantastic!!  A new restaurant from a bunch of ex-KJ Kitchen employees.  The menu is quite similar but the atmosphere and service are certainly a step up.  They don't have their liquor license yet so people were coming in w/ bottles of wine and 18 packs of beer!We went with the ginger lobster, crab and fish maw soup, sauteed green beans, jellyfish and squid in XO sauce and they gave us a cold chicken dish on the house.  Every dish was insanely good w/ the lobster blowing everyone away at the table.  I think this might be my new favorite Chinese restaurant in town!!!Went solo for lunch today at HK Star. It was an impromptu decision to get lunch here, since I was originally planning to go get dim sum with some classmates afterclass. But being the first week of school, things were hectic and things rarely goes according to plan.Anyway, I figure since I was in the area taking care of errands, I will drive a few more blocks to try another new item on the HK Star lunch special menu. I have typically ordered the more expensive items, so decided I want to try something from the $4.95 portion of the menu.  Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting, and I have never ordered it and would like to find out what exactly is HK Style Chow Fun.When the waiter came, that was what I told him I wanted "Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" (#8 on the $49.5 lunch special menu - okay I didn't say the #8 part of it).  He said theone with the gravy. I have never ordered it, so I said sure. He also wanted to confirm that I wanted Chow Fun, because on the menu the Chow Mein option is also available, and I said yes.  He looked a little confused to me, and I repeated the order again in Mandarin "Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" and off he went to punch in the order in the POS.Minutes later, a generous plate of chow fun with gravy and vegetables, shrimp, chicken and fish arrived.  I was hungy for the past 2 hours so I took a quick picture and dug in.  The food was delicious, and I was thinking this is a great deal for $4.95. I ate the entire plate of chow fun without being interrupted by the wait staff.  It wasn't until the very end when I have ate everything that the waiter who took me to the table brought over the check.When I saw the bill, I realized the fantastic deal was a mistake, because they have made me "House Pan Nood, sub Chow Fun", which I interpretted as House Pan Friend Noodles made with Chow Fun and asking me for $6.51 for my lunch. I was annoyed enough to write a comment on the bill that I "asked for Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" and left my $7 for lunch. I figured besides taking my order wrong and delivering the food and provided no additional service, such as asking if everything was okay or if I needed more tea or water, that was what was earned.So downgrading my rating to 4 stars solely on the poor listening skill, not knowing the menu and non-existent service.  I feel had I called my order ahead and the regular waiter took my order, I would have been given what I ordered. Or my experience today at HKS was due to being stuck with the crappy waiter that some other Yelper have complained about.  Hopefully next time the ordering process will be better, and if I sense any confusion in the waiter repeating back my order, I will just have to point to it on the menu to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.Came in for dinner after experiencing LA Reve. I was reluctant after my last experience  here at lunch but I was craving seafood. It was a Tuesday evening so the parking lot wasn't crazy like a weekend.They were running a special  - purchase 3 entrees and get lobster for $10.00 a pound. Ended up ordering clams with basil, rock cod stir fried with Chinese veggies, Mongolian beef and lobster with green onions and ginger. All the seafood was fresh tasting and solid (They brought me the lobsters live to approve). My least favorite was the Mongolian beef which was spicy to my surprise. The waiter who was a younger Vietnamese gent spoke perfect English and was funny conical but was on the spot with service. What a difference compared to my last visit.Overall a enjoyable solid meal for less then half a La Reeve show ticket!I don't normally eat Chinese food. But when I do, I prefer something good.Sorry, I couldn't figure out a satisfying conclusion to that catchphrase. But Chinese food isn't something that I tend to crave. It doesn't come to my mind as really must-eat since it became mundane territory with wedding banquets and dinners with relatives growing up. Long story short, I've rarely eaten it in Vegas.However, an opportunity came today when several friends gathered at HK Star for dinner. It was my first time here, so I mostly deferred to others for ordering. We ended up having more than enough for all of us.- "Spicy" jellyfish ($9.95): always seems like more of a textural experience for me than something that I seek out for a special flavor, but it was crunchy enough and came with pickled onions. I didn't really detect any heat when I ate it. I'd skip it unless you specifically like jellyfish or want to try it.- Minced chicken with sweet corn thick soup ($9.95): they bring out your large bowl and then ladle it into smaller bowls at the table. Much better than the last corn soup I had, but let's not dwell on it. Definitely solid flavor in the corn, egg, and chicken in this soup.- Honey walnut shrimp ($14.95): I specifically ordered this. The shrimp were cooked fine, although they could have been more crunchy. Good flavor, not overly drenched with sauce, and plenty of chopped honey walnuts. I usually prefer whole walnuts, but these were fine.- Deep-fried flounder ($23.95): my favorite dish of the night. Tender, delicious fried fish that you'd expect to get from a Chinese restaurant.- Chinese broccoli ($9.95): I'm not a vegetable aficionado really, but these were crunchy and juicy. They are worth an order.- Seafood, dry scallop and egg white fried rice ($14.95): tasty enough and not overly fatty, but I wasn't that impressed when considering the price. My friends definitely loved it though.- Roast duck ($19.95 for a "whole" order): a little less sweetness than you might find elsewhere, but juicy and flavorful.- Lobster, breaded and fried ($94.27 for 4.5 lbs at current market price): They pulled a lobster for us to look at when we were ordering, then took it back to the kitchen. It came out tasting pretty good, and it was cooked properly except for the claw piece that I had (too mushy there), more of the salty flavor is in the breading than in the actual lobster meat. I would probably try a different lobster preparation next time.- Complimentary hot dessert soup: delicious and not overly sweet.They probably have a pretty big kitchen in the big. Despite a fairly crowded dining room, our dishes all came out quickly and in quick succession, requiring some careful manipulation of the Lazy Susan and the other free table space to hold all the dishes satisfactorily. A server helped out a little over halfway through by giving us fresh plates and taking away the old ones with bones and mixed sauces. Decor is certainly on the nicer side for a Chinese restaurant.At the end of the night, I felt satisfied with most of the dishes. I have no problem coming back here for Chinese food should the craving actually strike.

Review Text :
Looks like I get the FTR on this one... hooray!Recently opened in the last few days, Arcadia Tavern took over where Red Tomato used to live on 48th Street and Indian School.  The space is awesome and has an outdoor patio, spacious bar area and restaurant as well.  Plasma TVs are all over the place, so there is definitely something for everyone to watch... perfect for sports fans!  It's family-friendly too - I think there is complimentary wii for the kids!  In addition, for those over 21 that have one too many, they've got cruisers you can ride home and bring back the next day if necessary.  This is the perfect neighborhood tavern for those that want to hang out - day or night.  The staff is super friendly and totally on top of their game - we had no complaints dining there on one of the first nights they were open.  Attentive service, reasonable prices, and fabulous food in a laid back, fun environment - that's my kind of place!Jared and I met friends at Arcadia Tavern for dinner... We started with chips with salsa and guacamole and the meatball slider app for the table - both were tasty and we cleaned our plates!I went with the roasted veggie salad as my entree (love that although it's bar food, they offer healthy options).  I had them add chicken for protein and even though I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken, I was a fan of theirs!  Jared had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with seasoned fries and the others shared a salad and a Tavern Burger with tots.  I admit it... I stole a tot and it was yummy - reminds me of the good ol' days of school lunches!We skipped dessert even though we heard that the Arcadia Chocolate Chip Cookie (Baked in a skillet warm and gooey, served with chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice cream) is worth the splurge... I have a feeling we'll be back soon to try that and to visit our new favorite local tavern.Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.I was going to write a two word update.And those two words would have been "Tot Cho's"...a thoroughly delightful creation that they serve at the Arcadia Tavern...Tater Tots with nacho stuff all over them:) Yeah, that's right...nacho tot's!The Beautiful Carin and I beginning to make a nuisance of ourselves here:)Fixtures, denizens, habituates...The patio has become a bit of a "home away from home" (but with drink's that I don't have to mix myself:)We keep showing up:)Last week, Carin correctly guessed the number of golf balls in the vase in the entryway, and she won us free drinks and food:)Matt (the owner) is thinking of adopting us (although that would technically make Carin and I brother and sister...both creepy and hot at the same time:)We haven't had a bad meal or bad experience yet...tonight they had a Jimmy Buffett (or Boofay, for my friend Ryan) clone , softly playing guitar and singing during happy hour:)I am happy:)Stopped by Arcadia Tavern tonight around 9:15 pm and it was packed... Granted, it was a perfect evening to be outside for an August night in Phoenix.  The entire patio was full, the bar area had not an empty seat, and from the looks of it, the restaurant was doing some decent biz as well.  Jack Young was the singer/guitar player rockin' the place with tunes from Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffet, and more.  I'd already eaten dinner, but Jared shared a bite of his miso salmon (with rice and asparagus) and it was delicious.  I'm writing this update partially to let it be known that this is just one of the new menu options along with chicken parm, steak salad, edamame, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, caprese, chopped, and cobb salads.  I guess the feedback made its way to management... I am pleased with the new variety of healthy choices.  Robert, the Chef, came out to say hello - or perhaps we caught him red handed having a drink at the bar... either way, it was nice to see him. I'll be back on my own sometime soon to order my own miso salmon... and if not me, you'll likely find Jared drinkin' a Guinness at the bar.  Cheers!I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...REVIEWUninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.Fish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:Fish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk. Anatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop. Tots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Olé for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.I want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream "short-term, dabbling in the industry business model".Will update after another visit. Maybe.I sometimes feel as if I am wildly misunderstood by restaurant staff.  Yes, I appreciate specials on booze. I learn them, I study them, I remember them. Give me a day of the week and it's likely I will be able to list of 3 or more booze specials going on in any given area at any given time.  This is not because I'm cheap. This is because I'm a lush.  My bar tab is going to be high, no matter how much the drinks cost, so just get me as drunk as possible and you will be rewarded handsomely.That said, I was super stoked to find out that after ditching our former trivia location, we were going to give Arcadia Tavern a try for their Tuesday Night Trivia.  Partially because trivia is super fun. And partially because, upon doing my due diligence, I learned that not only are Tuesday nights $20 Wine and Pizza Night, but they also offer 1/2 Price Any Bottle of Wine Mon-Thurs from 9 PM- Close!  Guess what day is in between Monday and Thursday? TUESDAY! It's like I hit the booze special lottery! Upon sitting down we immediately got our wine and pizza on.  This special is not nearly as awesome as Postino's $20 Bruschetta and a Bottle deal, also on Tuesday nights. For one, only 2 bottles of wine are offered, whereas Postino gives you a choice of ANY FREAKING BOTTLE OFF THEIR MENU.  Secondly, it's limited to one per table. So if there's 4 of you and you're all a little hungry and a lot thirsty and would like to split 2 pizzas and a couple bottles of wine, you only get to use the special once. Kinda lame, but I guess I understand (though Postino does not limit you whatsoever, and that is why I love them).So we start trivia, eat our pizza, drink our wine, have a couple beers and 9:00 rolls around . We grab our waitress and ask if we can begin partaking in the excellent half-price bottle special they have going on Mon-Thurs from 9:00 PM to close.  We were told that no, we could not.  We apparently already used our special for the day when we ordered the Pizza and Wine special. This perplexed us.  When you go to a restaurant for happy hour. And then, say, happy hour turns into happy 4 hours and you happen to still be at the restaurant by time their nightly specials kick in, do you not get to partake in both? And do you not call it a Happy Booze Sandwich?  Ok maybe you don't, considering I just made that term up, but I doubt anyone has ever been denied cheap booze on account of previously imbibing cheap booze at the same establishment. We also wondered if we shot ourselves in the foot ordering the pizza and wine deal at 7:00 PM when we could have waited until 9 and had half price bottles ALL NIGHT LONG. We asked the waitress and apparently we did not, because in Arcadia Tavern world "Half Price Bottles of Wine from 9PM to Close" really means "One Half Price Bottle of Wine per Table from 9PM to Close".  WTF? How they expect to compete with any other special at that time with this lame ass promotion is beyond me. We have Vig down the street with $5 martinis, Postino with $20 Bruschetta and a Board. Hell, even Zipps will give you $3 premium pints from 8PM to close and this is AFTER lubing you up with $3 Zipparitas from 3-7.Basically, I was fully planning on putting Arcadia Tavern in constant rotation on my weekly booze session calendar, but they clearly can't handle it. I've been here a couple time and the food and service has always been okay, so I guess I'll give them 3 stars. But I'm still going to the Vig on Tuesdays.My friends have all said this place was great, and I was really excited to check it out. Well, it may be really cool, but we had an awful experience with one of the managers from the second we sat down. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and we were quickly carded (we're 24, but look about 18) which was fine.  I never, EVER mind being carded. I was a server for a long time so I get it. But the manager walked over and proceeded to interrogate my boyfriend like he was a 15-year old who just snuck into a rated R movie-- just because his ID was a little haggard.  He peaked smugly back and forth from my boyfriend to the ID making rude jokes and belittling remarks. Once he was done with the investigation, and after he had scanned the ID (why he didn't just scan it in the first place, I do not know), he hesitantly handed my boyfriend his card back like he just gave a toddle chocolate. SO MUCH ATTITUDE.So I angrily asked him why he had to be so rude about it. "I understand that we look very young but I don't know why you had to make him feel uncomfortable. I get carded often, but I've never had anyone be so rude. You were very belittling." And then he replies, "Seriously? You think I was being rude? That's totally not true. I'm sorry you THINK I'm being rude."And then he proceeded to argue with me on whether or not he was being a polite person. I was a server for four years on mill avenue, and I have never, ever treated anyone that way while carding them. And the thing is, if some one IS of age, you do not want to piss them off because, DUH, they're buying your product. They're giving you money. So why have attitude? The manager never actually apologized or offered to remedy the situation at all. He just judged us as teenage hoodrats instead of young working professionals that we are. So we left. Go ahead and give this place a try, but make sure you look rich, dress well and have 15 forms of ID available. You don't want to be judged.  Oh and stay away from the short, stubby manager in glasses with a smug grin-- he'll make your skin crawl.Arcadia Tavern is one of my top five favorite places to wash sports in the Valley. With a bar on the right side and restaurant style seating on the left side, it's a solid sports bar for either a family or young professionals looking to have some cocktails and bar food.  Since I am kid-less, I normally hang out on the right side. If people complain about walking into empty bars in the Valley, then head over to Arcadia Tavern because on a game night, chances are you won't be able to find an empty seat there. But don't let that deter you because it's worth staying for a seat to open up. I like Arcadia Tavern for several types of occasions: if I'm looking for a place to watch the game, to have some food and drinks before going out or to eat lunch on a weekend afternoon. The patio is great and when the weather's nice, it's a must visit. Arcadia Tavern is in a random location within Arcadia but it's perfect neighborhood joint with so many houses nearby. Parking can be a bit tough so you might want to park across the street and walk. As for food, this is your classic neighborhood bar so it has all American food. The burger is great and I normally go for the BBQ chicken sandwich. If you're a fan of nachos, give those a try. So if you're looking for a neighborhood bar with TVs and a fun atmosphere, you should check out Arcadia Tavern.Listen, if you love bars that cater to locals and also are super accommodating for first-timers, this is the place.  Great options on tap, super sweet and prompt bartenders and honestly really good food.  This joint is an A plus...go!

Review Text :
We stayed at Encore and we decided to have lunch here. Boy, did we choose the wrong place.1. They have a thing called "stop-seating", where they take a couple of parties, seat them, stop the line from moving for 30 minutes, then repeat. Why they do this when they have a bunch of empty tables available for seating? I have no clue.2. The menu is very limited and when we finally ordered, it took more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive, AND we weren't served any bread baskets, when other tables clearly had. How long does it take to make some scrambled eggs and toast? Definitely not 30-40 minutes. The toast were also completely burnt, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer. My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy. My main dish, a Ham & Cheese sandwich, didn't come out for another 20 minutes.3. The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 20 minutes for our bill.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, and 90 minutes of that was spent waiting including waiting to be seat). If the food was delicious, all may have been forgiven, but the food was mediocre and pricey considering quality and quanitity.I'm never eating here again.If not for photos, and reviews posted by Betty and Cindy, I wouldn't really be able to go into detail about what we ate here. I was not hungover, but completely buzzed all throughout dinner. However, I do remember that my tastebuds were happy about what was consumed. I didn't really have much of an appetite, but everyone seemed to force me to eat each of my 3-courses. We started with mac 'n' cheese bites, which were the perfect combination of two of my favorite comfort foods: mac 'n' cheese and tater tots. The dipping sauce (I think it had truffle oil in it) was so yummy. I chose to go all out on carbs and got the trenne pasta with prosciutto for my main entree. I think this also had truffle oil in the sauce. The triangular penne pasta was delicious. For dessert, we had the donut balls. I'm pretty sure the caramel sauce I had with it did NOT have truffle oil in it.Our server Todd (thanks for refreshing my memory, Cindy), and the Assistant GM Patrick were both very accommodating and friendly. Even though they had taken off the petite filet mignon from the $36 prix-fixe menu, they were still able to offer them to us since the concierge had told us it would be available. Although we missed out on a fabulous dinner at Mix at Mandalay Bay, I'm glad we went with Plan B and came here. Again, thank goodness for photos.Any restaurant that can successfully host a wedding party and actually provide good food - from the hors d'oeuvres to the appetizers to the main entrees - definitely deserves at least 4 stars. In fact, I still dream about the appetizers: buffalo wing "lollipops", the best crab cakes I've ever had, and fried mac-n-cheese balls (drool-worthy pictures provided). The cafe itself is chic (almost excessively so) and the friendly-yet-aloof service is exactly what you'd expect at a fashionable cafe named Society. Overall, I had a great experience there and definitely want to go back for a regular dinner and some more of their yummy mojitos.*EDIT*Misti Y. made me realize that I should clarify something: it wasn't MY wedding =)I have not been so excited for a meal since I ate at Alex. Wynn really, really has it going on for us vegans. I heard through the grapevine that multiple outlets in the Wynn now serve s fast food-esque meal - cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake made with coconut milk ice cream. And it's $9. Upon hearing this, my husband and I practically ran out of the door. With a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this meal out at Society Cafe. It has an open atmosphere to which you can people-watch which is fun. The seating and design of the cafe is impeccable - gigantic, bright pink sofas, black & white, and soft lime green is a very soothing yet hip palette to me. When we walked up to the hostess, she immediately asked us if we wanted a vegan menu. Very nice that I didn't have to ask! We were seated and greeted by our server Michel, who upon hearing our order exclaimed with genuine delight that we were really going to enjoy our meal. This made me even more excited! He also automatically told us he would bring out vegan bread and butter. Upon doing so he remembered a second kind of bread, some pretzel sticks, were also vegan which he brought out too! Great customer service for sure. The fast food meal was adorable. The cheeseburger (which looked like a 100% doppelgänger for a certain famous golden-arched restaurant's burger) was wrapped up in foil; the fries were in a cardboard sleeve. The two hot items were in a cardboard half-box, all served on top of a white rectangular plate. And the chocolate shake was in a Wynn plastic cup with a really thick straw which was great for drinking. The burger I adored, although I passed off the pickles to the husband. I think the Gardein patty might have been slightly overcooked, or it might need some light seasoning... it wasn't as juicy as it could have been, and was a little bland, but overall I liked it; I really want to know what kind of "cheese" they used! The fries were delicious, and the milkshake was TO DIE FOR. I could seriously have that every single day. IN LOVE! The meal was beyond delightful, and the customer service was wonderful to boot. Michel really made the experience pleasurable, and answered every question quite knowledgeably. Even when he wasn't sure, he asked and got back to us in a very timely manner. We asked him about a dessert area in another part of the hotel to which he got the hostess (her name escapes me, but she was brilliant) who divulged that she was a vegetarian and tried her best to get us some answers, and spent some time chatting with us. She was very nice and extremely helpful and both her and Michel went above and beyond to make our meal lovely. I think this might start to be a weekly thing for me. Not only is this meal affordable, but the Wynn has really turned into a haven for vegans. Not once did I get an eye-roll, or was made to feel like I was annoying or asking too much. I felt really accepted at this restaurant, and I love that even the staff enjoys the food and can really talk to it with their customers. Society Cafe really pulled out all of the stops even for our humble meal, and I can't wait to come back for more!High SocietyAfter reading up on all the restaurants that grace the Encore property, I was pretty much set on stopping by this trendy cafe during my next Vegas visit! ::ENTER BACHELORETTE PARTY OF 8::Alas, the bride-to-be decided that Society Cafe was the place for us to dine before we head down the hall to party it up @ Surrender Nightclub. I made a reservation for 9pm as we did some last minute errands & got ready for our extravagant Saturday night rendezvous. Limo driver, you're FIRED for dropping us off at the Wynn entrance. Oh well, I guess we could use the walk through the casino from indulging in the sinful meal we were about to consume. Upon arrival, we checked in at the host stand and waited an additional 10 minutes to be seated. No biggie.Service was nice and professional. She took care of us but we could have definitely seen her more often. It's all good though since we were graced with the presence of the "food runner/server assistant" to grab dishes off our table. Now for the food.. our table ordered several different menu items as well as some chef specials. Let me tell you what was a hit and what was a miss during our Saturday night visit (excuse me for not knowing the real names)..HIT: *Fried Mac & Cheese: the truffle dipping sauce was amazing!*Beet Salad w/goat cheese: Yes, its tiny but the warm goat cheese hit the spot*Caprese Salad*Filet Mignon w/Bearnaise sauce: top notch filet but the Bearnaise wasn't as exquisite as I'd like it to beNot very good:*Vegan burger: it was just real plain and not very fancy for being here*Mushroom Pasta: two friends got this dish & said it was not good and very buttery- BLAH!*Lollipop chicken wings: ehhh! Not worth the 12 bucksThose dishes were worth mentioning for your reference. Anywho, I do like this place even though my main entree wasn't very yummy. Next time I'll have to try another option on the vegan menu or stop by during Happy Hour!***Society Cafe Encore offers a good and upscale breakfast; their steak and egg sliders are expensive but satisfying***I am not sure if Society Cafe Encore is Encore's cafe, but it is a lot different from the other casino cafes I have tried.  Society Cafe, which opens up to the casino, has a much more distinct and striking decor.  Society Cafe has a mix of traditional elegance and modern decor (the kind of mishmash decor I've often seen in West Hollywood places like The Bazaar or the now closed XIV).The decor raised my expectations for the food and the breakfast menu featured many nice sounding dishes.  There was an abundant use of premium ingredients throughout the menu.I went with the ultimate steak and egg sliders, which were featured on The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The sliders consisted of filet mignon, scrambled egg and creamed spinach on bacon and cheddar muffins.  The sliders were good.  Even though the individual components were not excellent, they did combine to make a satisfying sandwich (but maybe not an exceptional sandwich like the fried egg sandwich at Huckleberry in Santa Monica).The scrambled eggs were moist and I liked the creamed spinach even though I wish it had more flavor.  The filet mignon was meaty and savory though I wish it was cooked more medium rare or at least medium.  While the filet mignon was not dry, I would have preferred more juiciness (I do understand this type of temperature in a sandwich though since you don't want the redness of the meat to combine with the muffin to make an unappetizing color).While the bacon flavor of the muffins was not that strong, the muffin was still cheesy and flavorful and had a good combination of softness as well as a crisp and distinct edge.I also had the pain au chocolat (the order was actually 2 small chocolate croissants). The mini chocolate croissants were similar to the ones at Breadbar in Century City.  The croissants were flaky, crispy and chocolatey (I think the pain au chocolat at Breadbar has a more even chocolate flavor--a noticeable chocolate flavor with each bite).  I liked the pain au chocolat at Society Cafe Encore much more than the same pastry at Bouchon Bakery (in the Venetian)--more flakiness and more chocolate.Service was very good.  My waitress was very personable, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.Prices were high for breakfast, but that is common on The Strip where restaurants tend to be anywhere from 15% to 40% more than what you would pay in a city like LA.  Still, Society Cafe was not that much more expensive than some of the other casino cafes and the difference in quality was very noticeable.I enjoyed Society Cafe Encore and it was my best casino cafe experience in Las Vegas so far.  I would definitely consider coming back on future Vegas trips to try other menu items.I am not sure what the parking situation is, but I imagine Encore offers both valet and self-parking.This is still the best breakfast bet at the Wynn. We got a smoothie, a green juice and steel cut oats to go for our car ride home and everything was fresh and healthy. Just what I needed! There aren't very many healthy options while you are in Vegas so this is a gem when you are in need of something healthy in the morning!Society Cafe advertised their daily happy hour on the casino floor and since we stayed at Encore, we figured this would be a good stop to get some drinks and food in us before the gambling and all-night partying began.Their HH drinks are two-for-one of either domestic beers (no thanks!), mojitos (classic, pineapple, or watermelon), or their Society sangria (red with rioja and Grand Marnier or white with cava and Remy Martin). We started with the white sangria, which was phenomenal. Too often white sangrias are simply too sweet, but this sangria was well balanced in flavor, the cava gave it a nice fizz, and the Remy gave it a good richness and oaky notes. We ordered another round of those and for our third round we opted for the watermelon mojitos. Those were refreshing and tasty, yet I preferred the white sangria.For HH food, they offered a list of 4 appetizers from which you can pick three, as well as a flatbread, two different slider options, and fish & chips. We picked the Pulled Pork Sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#o_dYFC2NbX9J2Fdfi4FeTQ) topped with virginia slaw and butter pickles and served with a side of sweet potato fries. The sliders were juicy and delicious, the slaw and pickles giving the mini burgers a good crunchy texture to offset the soft meat and sauce. I loved the crispy sweet potato fries and the mini bottle of ketchup that they serve on the side is just frickin' adorable! From the 4-option list of small appetizers, we picked the Mac 'N Cheese "Bites", the "Lollipop" Chicken Wings, and Grandma Rose's Meatballs, deciding to forgo the Crispy Rock Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#SifqxmBDGINvsYDstK_Qew). However, they punched our order in wrong and we received the rock shrimp instead of the meatballs. That was quickly rectified, although after seeing the caper aioli that was served alongside the shrimp, I was sad they took the dish away to swap it with the meatballs rather than letting us have both. The Mac 'N Cheese Bites were definitely our favorite. Greasy pasta and cheese made into little tater tot battered looking things and served with an insane truffle dipping sauce. Once all the Bites were gone, we started dipping our sweet potato fries into the sauce. I then proceeded to dip my finger into the sauce to make sure none of the heavenly concoction was wasted. The meatballs were pretty decent, but the tomato sauce lacked excitement. Maybe some spice could have helped elevate it to the next level. The buffalo chicken wings had a perfect spiciness to them and I'll never say no to cold blue cheese dipping sauce!Having read about their amazing pretzel bread on other Yelp reviews while sipping on our cocktails, I asked the bartender for some. She said they usually only serve it with dinner, but she made an exception and got us an order. The bread was warm, had a good saltiness in the pretzel dough and was paired with an amazing mustard butter.I would certainly come back for the food and would definitely come back for more sangria! The decor here is stunning, making want that interior decorator for my place! Cream walls and ceilings, black & white curtains draped everywhere and nicely accented red couches make this place super chic and modern.Since I was staying at Encore, it was only appropriate to have a meal at Society Cafe.  And that appropriate time for me would be for breakfast.  It was a very good way to start off my day before heading out to the Strip.Right off the bat I already knew that I would be picking up their Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders.  It totally stuck out from the rest of the menu and it's pretty obvious that that's what they want you to order.  To go with it, I went an interesting choice and decided to try one of their blended juices, The Green Monster.The Green Monster - Cucumbers, Celery, Spinach, Fennel, Green Apples, Parsley & Ginger. CHEERS!!! --  http://bit.ly/Z3dr2FThis was a very invigorating juice blend but it was pretty tasty as well.  Not sure if it was exactly the right pairing for the Sliders, but it did the job.  Plus it also made up for the lack of fruits and veggies I didn't have the day before.The Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders - Filet Mignon, Scrambled Eggs, Creamed Spinach, Bacon Cheddar Muffin --  http://bit.ly/11dtlDUJust reading the description is good enough to build your appetite.  At first I was a little discouraged when the waiter said that you only get two, but when you look at the picture, you could probably understand why.  These sliders were big!  The fact that there were mini filets inside just upped the ante with any typical burger slider.  These were really good.  The filets were cooked perfectly that they weren't tough when you bit into them, but instead were really soft and easy to chew.  The bacon cheddar muffins were awesome and the creamed spinach and eggs helped the sliders all come together.  They were definitely Ultimate!!Overall, solid restaurant and worth dining at if you're staying at Encore or Wynn.  It definitely made for a great breakfast!Society Cafe Encore offers a slightly more casual venue for brunch. It's a more open and airy sort of area, and service was less formal than somewhere like Tableau. Sirloin and egg sliders:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HMGpW7k88K5ScfnkWh93CQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I'd heard great things about these sliders, and our server recommended them to us as well. I liked the cook on the sirloin and it did taste like quality beef, but the overall concoction was much too heavy for brunch. The bread on the outside was even fried (I believe?), and it felt like a heart attack slider. I might order these again as a late-night munchie, but perhaps not as a breakfast or brunch dish..Egg white frittata with goat cheese:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dzq0RXzFcYAU-eZEYAosnw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The egg white frittata was cooked very well, as egg whites have a tendency to harden very quickly, but these were still soft and springy. The goat cheese was maybe what kept the frittata soft, but I couldn't taste too much of a distinct flavor. There was a nice ratio of filling to egg whites, and it was a pretty generous portion. Souffle pancakes:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c7ZzGBK0KKXSMdNuApwbUw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I haven't ventured too far into pancake territory, as I'm usually a French toast addict, but the addition of "souffle" was too tempting to resist. The pancakes themselves were very well-shaped, and I was surprised by how stiff they seemed on the outside. The interior was a little too dense for me to say that it was similar to a souffle, but the adjusted sweetness of the pancake was palatable. Society Cafe Encore was my last stop in Las Vegas before heading home, and it wasn't a bad meal to leave on. I would be open to venturing back to try some other dishes next time.

Review Text :
For a $14 buffet, that too in Vegas, you would expect some quality. The Breakfast Buffet at the Imperial Palace provides none of that. Avoid this and the lunch buffet as well, at all costs. Seriously, I don't have write anymore for this review; it's just a waste time for you and for me. Just avoid this place, at all costs. It's just that terrible. Why isn't there an option for 0 stars? It's finally deserved. One of the previous reviews is absolutely right about Burger King being delicious compared this; and that's the most barf-able fast food joint of all-time. I've never missed $14 so much in my life.Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #3 of 7 12:00 PMThe 3rd stop in our single day tour of the Buffet of Buffets lead us to the Imperial Palace and the Emperor's Buffet.  Located on the 2nd floor above the casino, the buffet is the smallest in size and variety of the seven.  Our expectations were pretty low, so we weren't going to fool ourselves into expecting any pleasant surprises.After browsing the buffet line for a while, I decided to try out the Desserts.  Nothing on the main buffet line looked appealing to me and I wanted to save a little room for the other 4 remaining buffets.  The Desserts were OK.....the Cakes were very dry.  I'm glad I passed on most of the items here.Overall, it's the lowest rated buffet in the Buffet of Buffets.  Will it fill you up?  Sure.  Will you feel satisfied?  To each their own, in my case, no.  To end on a high note, the employees here are friendly.Return Factor - 2%

Apparently I am a victim of a disapearing review. I reviewed Tinys about a month ago, right after they opened. Back then I tried the Meatloaf dinner, corn bread and salad. The meat loaf was dry but good. The corn bread was dry but goodThey slathered brown gravy over it and made it great. I will not hold the dry food against them as it was soon after grand opening and there were not too many diners in and out yet. Today I had a egg salad sandwhich, and frys. It was nice because sitting at the counter I could see him make the egg salad fresh. I asked to add a little pepper and mustard because I like it like that and he was more then happy to do so. I have yet to try breakfast. Maybe next week.As the name would indicate this place is fairly tiny. Upon entering every table was taken, so my husband and I sat at their counter area. We were greeted and given menus right away. I knew I would love this place when I asked for iced tea I was given the option of sweet tea. I love sweet tea and it's hard to get some in Arizona. My husband ordered coffee, but our server made the mistake of giving him sweet tea as well, but my husband didn't complain as he is a southern boy who loves his sweet tea.Both my husband and I ordered omelettes. He the Spanish and me a Denver. Both omelettes were very tasty and so fluffy they were like scrambled fluffy clouds. The hash browns were great. They are not frozen or from a bag. The potatoes are fresh cut and delicious. Tiny's also has their own yummy homemade salsa, which I pour on just about anything I order. Our server never left us with empty drink cups or even half empty. Most anytime she walked by she checked on us and refilled our drinks. The counter area is a good place to sit as you get to see the food prepared right in front of you and experience the hustle of the cafe. I will definitley be back for the wonderful food and spot on, friendly service.Since this review my husband and I have been to Tiny's a number of times. We love it here. The service and food are always spot on. On our last visit we ordered the milk toast which is buttered toast with cinnamon and sugar in a bowl and served with hot milk. It's almost like the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but way better. Maybe it sounds odd, but it's worth a try. We also ordered the hillbilly benedict which is biscuits with eggs, bacon and their homemade gravy poured all over it. It's delicious.

Restaurant name  Lemongrass

Review Text :
***There were some good dishes at Lemongrass (as well as a few items that did not feel outrageously priced); there were also a few mediocre things at Lemongrass; if you do your research though and order popular items at Lemongrass, you are probably in for a satisfying and maybe even not too pricey lunch or dinner for Las Vegas***I saw in a taxi that Lemongrass is the only Thai restaurant located in a major resort and casino on The Strip.  Lemongrass is located in Aria and it is open for lunch (it was surprisingly busy for lunch despite its location; it is kind of located in the back of Aria, which I would assume would not get much foot traffic).  Lemongrass features an all-day menu consisting of satays, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees featuring all kinds of proteins (beef, chicken, lobster, prawns, pork, tofu, sea bass, and crab), curries, rice dishes, and noodle dishes.  Like a lot of Thai restaurants, Lemongrass features a big menu so maybe it should not be a surprise that some dishes are good while others underwhelm.I thought their chicken wings were very good.  They were not battered, but the outside was crispy while the inside was very juicy.  The chicken wings had a good flavor too--a fair amount of spiciness.  The chicken wings were served with a sweet dipping sauce.The Pad Thai Ghoong also had a good amount of spiciness too and the spiciness was more than I would expect with pad thai so it was a nice surprise.  The pad thai also featured good noodles, a generous portion of prawns, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts.  I did feel that the portion of noodles was a tad small.The fried tofu with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onions, scallions, and oyster sauce featured really good deep-fried tofu.  The tofu had a great and distinct edge while the inside was soft and very creamy.  Unfortunately, the sauce was very lukewarm in temperature.  Even if the dish had been served fresh and hot, it might have needed more heat or flavor.  In addition, with the tofu and the cooked vegetables, the dish felt too soft (there needed to be more crispiness or crunchiness).The yellow curry with chicken, onion and potato was quite watery and bland.  I really liked the potato, but the chicken was shredded without care and overly dry.  It was disappointing given the quality and moistness of the chicken wings.The beef satay was not that good.  The texture of the beef was a tad chewy.  The flavor was okay though.  The satay came with garnishes of peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and ciabatta bread.Service was good--pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.The restaurant has a mostly dark decor.  The room is comfortable.  And despite being very close to the casino, the restaurant feels very blocked off with walls and such to keep the smoke from wafting over to Lemongrass' dining room.Prices vary.  Appetizers are in the $10 and below range while several main dishes go for $16; there are several courses in the $25 range and portions vary with some dishes feeling generous with proteins and others feeling stingy with proteins or noodles.Lemongrass probably has enough good things on the menu that you can have a good lunch or dinner here.  You need to do your research before coming here.  I thought the chicken wings and pad thai were both good, but the other dishes were mediocre.  I imagine there are other good things here and there are probably a few reasonably priced dishes as well.  If you know what to order and get the kitchen on a good day, Lemongrass can probably be a satisfying and not too expensive lunch or dinner on The Strip.Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Aria offers free self and valet parking.Unlike many reviewers here, we were staying at the Aria on a group rate, so did not have a "meal credit" to blow.  We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, as after spending all day at her conference, the wife had to "send a few emails, and quickly look at something for work", which destroyed any chance of date night.  We weren't inspired by the Aria's in-room dining options, and know that Thai is often a decent choice to offer alternatives with her gluten allergy.  Make no mistake, we didn't expect a terribly authentic Thai experience.  The signs were a broad menu that included udon, sesame chicken, and pho, and the fact that their signature beverage is a Watermelon Caipiroska.  I'm not sure why their menu covers so much of Asia, as there are separate Chinese and Japanese dining alternatives at the Aria.  But, that's neither here nor there, as we were after the usually-GF Thai stuff.Because the wife was going to be busy, we just were going to pick up and bring it back to the room.  We both went downstairs, in case there were questions my wife would need to answer.  The young lady working the hostess stand on a Sunday night was, honestly, more friendly than we expected.  She walked us through our allergen questions, quickly dispatched our order, and before we could comment very long on the what looked like young, fit, and well-dressed platform-heeled blonde twins going to the secure Tower Suite elevators with what looked like their very affectionate dad, she came out with our bag of goodies.We just went with a straight up chicken "Phad Thai" (not used to that spelling).  I didn't find it overly spicy, nor did we ask for extra hot sauce to customize it with.  Even though it took a bit of time for us to get back to our room, the food wasn't "stuck together" like some report here.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed, and come back downstairs to grab a pizza slice or something for my dinner later, but the ($18) entree was plenty to feed us both.  So, for the ability to handle my wife's gluten allergy without worry, the nice hostess who helped us, and conveniently and quickly feeding us both for about $20, we were pretty happy.3.9 starsThe best thing about this place is that they open late EVERYDAY! That's a big convenience for us staying at Aria Sky suites, the restaurant is located right next to the Sky suites tower. We ordered some simple items and a Goose Bloody Mary to go. After too much partying on Saturday, both hubby and I were extremely tired and in serious need of some Asian food! We ordered garlic wings, wonton noodle soup and hot & sour soup, all hangover cure food of course! The hot and sour soup had no shredded pork in it, just generous amount of veggies in very sour and fairly spicy hot soup, that was all I needed at the moment! Hubby loved the garlic wings and wonton egg noodle soup, extremely flavorful and very delicious! We felt so much better after some super yummy Thai food, glad we decided to take advantage of this opening late restaurant, we really had no energy to get out of Aria hotel to find comfort Asian food at midnight. Ps. was too tired to take photos.

Supremely delicious! Went here for dinner with a friend before a show at the cabaret. It is a very unassuming looking restaurant and was not very busy. It took our waitress a little time to get over to us, but we mentioned that we had a show and she made sure to bring our food out as quickly as possible. We got the samosas, which were huge and delicious. We also shared the chicken tikka masala and the chana masala at spice level medium. I love spicy food, but if you don't I suggest going lower on the scale because even at a medium, these dishes had some serious kick!  I loved the chicken tikka masala. So much so that I took the leftover sauce over rice home just so my hubby could try it! We also got the garlic naan and poori. Both were delicious and helped to scoop up the delicious food. The portion sizes were also very generous for the price and my friend and I were each able to have a to go container from what was left over. I can't wait to go back!I stopped by with my friend on Fri. night for dinner before seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum.  Between the convenient location in the Cultural District, the good reviews from other Yelpers, and the reasonable prices, this place seemed like a potential winner.  Unfortunately, however, the food and atmosphere left something to be desired.The a la carte dinner menu is pretty extensive, and includes most of the usual dishes offered at Indian restaurants.  Because I'd tried samples of chicken makhni (butter chicken) from friends at another Indian restaurant in Oakland and really liked it, but had never ordered it myself before, I decided to order it.  Bad move!  The sauce was less creamy than that served with the dish at the other restaurant (see photo), and the chicken was of poor quality--all dark meat, with several pieces of gristle that I had to pull out of my mouth while eating (as discreetly as possible, of course, to avoid grossing out my friend).  This version of the dish was disappointing, to the point that I only ate a bit more than half of it before abandoning the rest.In addition to my entree, I ordered a mango lassi, as I usually do at Indian restaurants.  Even this was a disappointment, given its thinness in comparison to versions I've had at other Indian restaurants around town.My friend ordered the malai kofta, a vegetarian dish consisting of potato balls stuffed with paneer and vegetables in a light cream sauce with nuts and raisins.  She let me try a bite or two, and it tasted much better than my chicken makhni.  If I'd ordered this dish, I probably would have finished it and left with a much better assessment of the food than I did.  Indeed, my friend did so, and expressed satisfaction with its quality.Aside from the quality of the food, I was rather unimpressed with the ambiance, which I'd describe as a notch below no frills.  There was no music, the wall decorations were pretty sparse, and the tables were unadorned except for menus under the glass tops.  Moreover, the place had a slight aura of griminess that was apparent from the odd odor that I encountered upon entering.  Service was okay, and the food came was served in a reasonable timeframe, so I have no major complaints there.Overall, I've had better Indian food in superior settings at other places around town, so I probably won't return.  It seems as though most people come here for the lunch buffet, so it's possible that the quality is better than their a la carte cooking.  If you do order a la carte, I'd recommend sticking to the chef's specialties (the malai kofta was one of them), and avoiding the chicken makhni, for sure.  If I went solely by my own experience, my rating would be a 2, but my friend seemed pretty pleased, so I'm averaging to a 3 to better reflect our combined judgment.

I am always on the look-out for a new BBQ place and I found this one at N Durango & Farm just around the corner from Mountain Ridge Skatepark.Their claim to fame is "Vegas-Style" BBQ. Looking at the menu everything is very reasonably priced and they have beef,pork,chicken & links plus burgers and all the standard bbq sides and red skin potato salad.It's a real small place next to DQ and it has 6 small tables is painted purple and has a flat screen on the wall to watch while you wait & you will wait.Well I tied the beef brisket,pulled pork & hot link sandwiches plus mac n cheese,coleslaw & red skin potato salad.$5.99-for a sandwich & 1 side.-What a deal!!all the sandwiches come covered in cheese, onions and sweet bbq sauce -that's VEGAS-Style?!They smoke their meat so it was real tasty I dont get why they smother it in a sweet bbq sauce. The pork sandwich was the best with coleslaw on it and the bbq sauce mixed real well.The link & brisket were good but I'd rather skip the VEGAS-stuff. Mac N cheese was weak, potato sald was alittle runny but the colslaw was quite a suprise. real good.This place has good prices & good meat-just know how to order it without sauce & it's a winner.

Review Text :
My FAVORITE pizza! And although I do enjoy the toppings (such as hot wing, kona, Barros special & mega meat), I would say it is greatly because of the delicious crust :DI've read others reviews where they say there's nothing special about it, but I would beg to differ. It is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside & it doesn't give me an upset tummy after eating it, lol. They also have gluten free crust for those who prefer it. This is also the only pizza place I know that sells it's pizza dough! You have to call ahead of time so they'll have it packed for you, but isn't that cool?  For lunch they sell pizza by the slice & have different pizza's available on different days of the week. The only thing I don't like is that they have such a great relationship with all the local schools (which is good) that during the school year they sometimes reserve the entire restaurant (which is bad), leaving no seating room for any walk in guests. That doesn't quite seem fair. I love kids, but I love to eat my pizza sitting down too, lol! I'm terrible that way ;)So instead of the regular Friday Papa Johns pizza for dinner, we decided to give this place a try!Location & Aesthetics - located on W Greenway Road by the corner of N Reems and W Greenway by the Walmart Neighborhood Market.Parking was a bit difficult to find as the parking lot is shared with part of Walmart Neighborhood Market, and it was a Friday evening. The restaurant was clean on the outside and inside.  The restaurant (eating area) itself is spacious however the area where you order at the checkout immediately upon entering is a bit limited in terms of space.As we entered, there was a lot of people waiting around - some waiting for their orders that was placed, some picking up their orders, some who can't decide what to order and are looking at the menu, some in line, and some who can't decide what place they are in line.There is a three-seater bench/chair with two extra single chairs placed in the waiting area in case you wish to sit and wait for your order which nobody was really taking advantage of.The place was hopping which ought to tell you something!Menus - the menu was self-explanatory and up on the wall.  Very easy to read.  Plus there are copies of the menu on the counter top in case you want to grab one and have a more in-depth perusal.Service - We were there to place an order to go as when we attempted to call prior to place the order, we encountered an error message on the phone.  Thankfully there were 3 cashiers on deck trying to whittle down the crowd milling around at the checkout/cashier area, and they were working fast and efficient to take orders.  Despite the craziness of it being a Friday evening, they were very friendly, patient, and answered any questions we had.I asked about the phone situation and was told that on Friday's, their phones can get busy as they have 5 lines and they do get filled up quickly so it's best to keep trying and hope that you get through.The cashier even offered us water while we waited for our order!Food - We order the large chicken supreme (Chicken, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Onions, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese) with a side of 12 wings.  With the 12 wings, you can't mix-and-match however with the 24 wings you can which was no biggie.  The 12 wings was ordered as mild but still had a little kick to it which again wasn't a problem for me.  The wings were hot, juicy, well seasoned, flavorful, and very tender (not too tough) to work off the bone.  You do have a choice of original (bone) or boneless.The pizza pie was heavenly!  The pie was piping hot and pulling it apart, one can see the beautiful strings of cheese attempting to hold itself to the pie.The crust/dough was soft, buttery and moist, and not very dry.  The pie had lots of cheese, and adequate and equal amounts of ingredients on each slice.  The chicken was well seasoned, soft and tender.  The ingredients like the green peppers, onions, and mushrooms tasted fresh!I think I've found our new go-to place to order pizza from now!  Absolutely love the food and their service!

Astoundingly expensive for the quality and authenticity.Look, if you've never been to a country where Gyros are served out of clapboard carts, you won't know what I mean when I say "THAT AIN'T NO GYRO!". There are always tons of people streaming in and out of this place, and a Gyro, Fries and Drink is ten bucks (!!) for just a totally un-authentic gyro meat.  Apparently nobody but me noticed. And what is *up* with the pretend "tzatziki". Could you *borrow* some garlic and dill from someone? Holy cow.The only reason this business gets two stars is because there are no undocumented workers (nee: illegal aliens) in sight...just high school kids. Blech. I tried really hard to like this place. I've eaten there at least a dozen times over the last couple of years. Always the same experience...except this last time. Apparently, they "lost" the nozzel to the Pepsi dispenser in someone's drink and one of the high school girls was walking around asking people if they were drinking Pepsi and would they look in the bottom of their cup. *(sigh)*

I enjoy Sammy's.  My family & I eat at Sammy's often.  I was meeting a colleague here for lunch and have never been to this particular location.  I think it's one of the newer locations in town.The service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.Since it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.They were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.In any case, the lunch was enjoyable.Will I return?  You bet your Sammy's I will!Came here with my man to check out their HH since we were hungry but didn't quite know what we wanted to eat so what better than a whole bunch of different apps/tapas to satisfy our cravings??? -Duck Tacos: my boyfriend hates duck but he liked these... Probably because there was really no duck taste to them but they did taste good.. Crunchy with lettuce, tomatoes, creme fraiche and cheese.-Crispy Tofu: light crust comes with a delicious ginger dipping sauce.-Mediterranean Plate? With hummus and baba ganoush.. I didn't have any but it looked nice-Chicken Lettuce Cups: love the butter lettuce that comes with but the chicken filling was too salty -Chicken Satay: not bad, not great-Truffle Fries: definite truffle taste to it... Yum! Service was great from server to the food runner! They even brought out a couple different dipping sauces when we just asked for ketchup! HH prices range from $3-$7 .. Great deal! HOT TIP: DAILY happy hour 3-6!!! Including $2 off all wine and beer~My co worker and I brought a client here for lunch on a Monday. Located in a large strip center where parking is no issue. We arrived before the noon hour so the place was bare and we got a choice table.After receiving our beverages our friendly waitress took our orders. I went with the chicken and hummus wrap and picked the side of cole slaw. Our food arrived promptly and my wrap was healthy tasting but flavorful and the slaw was decent too.We were in and out without a hitch and I would recommend Sammy's for a business or personal luncheon.

Nope.Just...no.Slow service, inconsistency in dishes, sometimes lukewarm food, pervasive blandness, and ingredients that have been sitting out too long are what await potential patrons standing awkwardly in the doorway unsure of when and where to sit.  Given the sloppiness evident from a seat in the dining room (so to speak), I don't even want to know what other rules of running a decent restaurant are routinely ignored in that kitchen.Simply put: Forget taste, I don't trust the kitchen here not to make me sick.I'll be a happy Oakland resident when this place closes and something else moves in.  Right now it's just taking up space.

Review Text :
I used to love Garcia's. Then after 2 really bad experiences (we are talking raw chicken bad), I didn't go for close to 3 years. Decided to go back about 4 months ago because I had a coupon and was hoping they had fixed the problems. Now after 3 visits, I can say they are back!!! I always get the Pollo Fundido. Chicken wrappted in jalapeno cream cheese and deep fried. YUM! I love their chips and salsa and bean dip that they serve. The service has been great each time since we started going back. There are usually $5 off coupons out there which is a great added bonus. They have great fajitas as well but I have a hard time straying from my pollo fundido! I am so happy they are back to really good food and service. Reasonable prices as well!

Review Text :
Maybe if I write a review like Dallas G, I'll get ROTD.  Here goes:"Who am I but a slave to the forces of nature?  As a slave, am I free to pass judgment on those slaves toiling aside me, dawn till dusk (at which point I go and fornicate with whomever may be willing)?  No, I am not, and as this commonest of men will tell you, no one should ever cast such noble servants of the world order to the depths of a poor Yelp review.So I say five stars to any old establishment that can churn out even the most mediocre of food!  Qdoba is just such a place.  Good people with good intentions, making decent food for other ants in the giant ant farm we call life.  Go there, enjoy yourself, bask in the glory of it all."But I am not Dallas G, nor would I want to be, because he is vegan and that makes life inordinately difficult.  It also means that his burrito had probably 900 calories fewer than my burrito, which was essentially the same except with two cups of queso sauce and a bunch of steak.Of course, with queso and steak means that there will be at least a modicum of taste, and that is true--but I say that the food is average there, and only deserving of three stars, because I don't know if it was the salsa or what, but there was a strange flavor that permeated the entire burrito. Not a bad flavor, but not a good flavor--it almost was like eating two pounds of roasted tomatillos in a burrito.Finally, I begrudge them for having water that came straight from the bottom of an overly-chlorinated pool.  Qdoba is decent, worth a meal once or twice a month, max.  But order a real drink.

Review Text :
I have to say, Ice Tango holds a special place in my heart... Maybe it's because Ice Tango gave me my first taste of tart yogurt, or maybe it's because the employees are super friendly. Perhaps it's that the toppings always look fresh and appealing.  But I think the real reason is that Ice Tango fro yo is just delicious!  It's refreshing and fat free and I just can't get enough!I stopped into the new old town location today for the first time, and I loved it!  Jared does too!  I had the coconut flavor and it was love at first bite.  This location also offers a soft serve gelato and granita (sorbet like dessert) as well.  I'll be back for sure!Maybe I'm not as much a fan of the self-serve concept afterall... I think I prefer a serving size as I request it - not my amateur serving getting way too big since the fro-yo comes out way too fast and I'm not used to it!  And then you have to pay for it... 38 cents an ounce adds up!I stopped back by and treated myself to some fro-yo last night.  I stayed awhile to do some work while I was there as well (since my power was out at home).  In listening to the other customers while I was there, it seemed like everyone was having similar experiences.  Regardless, it was good to see the place packed on a Tuesday night.  I guess I'm not the only Ice Tango lover in this town.So, just to clarify - I still love the product and the friendly service and the delicious toppings, but I think I'm safer financially and diet wise, heading to the the other location!So what is the dealio with fro-tang?It's a question that keeps me up at night, pondering...pondering.I needed an answer, so when I got out of the office and went for a walkabout in Old Town for lunch a couple of days ago, my route took me past the fro-tang palace in Old Town, Ice Tango!I thought (as I made my fateful decision to walk in) "frozen yogurt...how difficult can this be?"Plenty difficult, as it turns out!I was greeted by the guy who lost on American Idol (apparently, maybe a dead ringer), as I walked in. He pointed to the 10 rows of soft serve machines and said "you can try any flavors you want" and indicated a stack of exquisitely tiny paper thimbles, in which I was supposed to put a small serving of fro-tang to try out.I had no idea what the fro-tang was going to taste like, so thought "good idea"...I could not have been more wrong.I approached the first soft serve udder, with a label that said something like "creamy tang-fro" and gave it a short pull.2 1/2 cups of creamy tang-fro cascaded over the sides of my thimble and onto my hands (desperately cupped to keep the yo-tang from hitting the floor and marking me as a non-pro tang-fro jockey).I didn't really get a taste as I dumped the thimble and the extra 2 lb's. of yo-fro in the trash bin.While unsuccessfully trying to clean my sticky hands with a wad of napkins, I decided on another approach.I walked by the 30 different soft serve machines looking at lables in a hopeless attempt to find my standby...vanilla...no go for vanilla fro-yo.I did find some sort of chocolate blend, but it was in one of the 6 or so soft serve udders that were not in working order (swirling, cold, but the udders just wouldn't  give:)I finally settled on Mangy Tango (or was it Tangy Mango?) and Coconut Something combo.I got a small cup and by now well aware of the awesome dispensing capabilities of these hard core soft servers, I pulled the lever on the combo udder for 1 second...1 second!My little cup was only 1/3 full:) Just right! I added a spoonful of strawberries to the concoction and took my prize to the counter to pay for it.Adam (probably not his real name) motioned that I should set my tangy treat on the scale...he was going to weigh it and I was going to pay $.38 per ounce for my sweet confection:) Good Deal! I didn't have that many oz's:)$4.27? Adam, do you want to weigh that again? Are you kidding? Who do you guys think you are...Sprinkles?I asked Adam how they hide the ballast in the cups. Adam looks at me like I'm not all that funny...but I am:)I would tell you that I have never had better fro-yo-tang, but I had never had any of the stuff before.The Mangy Tango part was OK, but the Oil-Can Coconut had a chemical taste and I tossed about $3.49 worth of tang-yo into the trash(:So, no bro, on the fro yo from the tango.

Ate the summer barley soup. $5 for a good sized bowl of warm goodness smack dab in the middle of the casino? Let's not get too judgemental, people. That's a good deal for a meal literally steps outside of Hakkasan to end your drunken night of shuffling and/or fist pumping.There were plenty of veggies, chicken, and barley (duh, it's called barley soup)... And I liked it! Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I'm a soup gal. I probably wouldn't order anything else anyway.Haters gon hate.The MGM poker room and Stage Deli's sandwiches go together like peanut butter and jelly.  But PB&J sandwiches aren't offered at Stage Deli.Thoroughly confused?  Here's the explanation:When playing poker at MGM (and clocked in with your MLife players card), you'll earn $1 an hour at the $1/$2 table, or $2 an hour at the $2/$5 table.  That might not sound like much, but it actually adds up pretty quickly and unlike regular MLife comp dollars, these NEVER expire.  After wracking up those dollars, see the floor man for your running total, and to redeem a voucher for discounted or FREE food at Stage Deli.  He'll even have a Stage Deli menu available with all the item pricing (including tax) so that you can have that voucher printed out for the exact desired amount.Sometimes during a long poker session, you might not feel like taking a long break for a fancy lunch or dinner.  A quick, simple sandwich might hit the spot, and that's exactly what Stage Deli offers, in addition to soups, salads, breakfast, drinks and desserts.The service is extremely fast, moderately friendly, and the sandwiches are reasonably priced ($8.95 to $10.25).  All meats are delivered from the East Coast.  The taste is...  Acceptable.  Do expect to dress your sandwich up a bit with the provided condiments, and donn't expect to be blown away by quality or uniqueness.  Speed and simplicity should be what is appreciated at Stage Deli.

Bill W. brings up a very good point in his review.  I ate at BT's around 8:15 on a Saturday night with my fiance and was extremely disappointed.  I took notes on a receipt as I sat and ate because I was so horrified.  Let me preface this review with two things: 1, I worked in food service as a cashier and as a shift supervisor for 8 years and 2, BT's was not busy whatsoever so there is absolutey no excuse for the following! -The first thing I noticed was that the floor was filthy.  Receipts, food, paper products, etc.  It probably didn't help that line cooks were throwing small food items FROM THE LINE at one another.-The glass on the cooler had dried splatters from the milkshake machine on it, it probably hadn't been wiped down for at least a month.-There were rags everywhere...counter tops, spray bottles, in the gloved hands of a line cook (gross!)-The manager was worthless.  I didn't see him do a lick of work except to clear a total of 2 tables in the 45 minutes we were there.  He was obviously more interested in texting than running a restaurant.  He also walked by our table at least 5 times and never once made an actual table visit.-One employee in particular had sagging pants (this isn't jail) and ate directly from the line.  This same employee brought the bag of ketchup out to a table and proceeded to fill the ketchup bottles at the table, something I feel should be done in the kitchen.-I know for certain drinks are not allowed to sit at the register.-Not once did I see any line cook change their gloves.Needless to say, I will not visit BT's again.

This use to easily be a 5 star place for me - awesome location, great atmosphere, super drink selection (beer & wine), and something way different than your usual marketplaces. I spend a lot of time and money here since I live in the neighborhood. BUT...  I have had some major issues with customer service lately..why the heck are they hiring mean people?! When I made a comment about a product they were out of - the person at the counter literally shrugged...I mean really you cannot have an actual response? I wasn't making an off-putting comment - it was more disappointment than anything else. I noticed on another occasion a girl told her boyfriend " wow that guy must not like me" ...it was the same guy being rude to another customer. Then on a separate occasion I waited 20 minutes for a deli sandwich ...as I watched several people walk up and take their sandwiches home I finally had to ask where mine was. I was told " some asshole took yours"- and then he slammed my sandwich down on the counter in front of me. Well excuse me, last I saw you had to hand the sandwich to that "asshole" -so you actually just gave my sandwich to the wrong person. I was honestly stunned by the response. I would have been fine if they at least told me why I was waiting so long (before having to ask) or here is a novel idea offer an apology. I love the venue but with the attitude I've experienced lately - I will have to start looking elsewhere.

Only 1 other review? This place is a locals late-night hotspot! Cheap specials and decent food.As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, $3.99 Steak & Eggs, $2.99 Strawberry Shortcakes!BEST spot to eat after drinking, YES! Fast,Cheap & Filling.I had the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs,hashbrowns and wheat toast.The wife had the NY steak and scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and a biscuit w/gravy(instead of toast)Mine was real iffy, too fried-gravy was too thick & lumpy, hasbrowns were good,eggs were a little runny, toast was soaked in butter.Steak is a little fatty-NOT real New York Strip steak, biscuit was tasty & flaky but again gravy was too thick.The service was a little slow only got 1 refill the entire time & it wasn't very busy at all at midnight.Overall it was $20 for 2 people and we left full. It was cheap,fast and OPEN!They have great specials! If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat then look no further, Sourdough Cafe has great prices and decent food. You can save a few cents if you obtain a players card. I always order the steak and eggs special which costs $4.49 with the players card, normal cost is $4.99, that's a whopping savings of $0.50 cents! HahaLike I said, the food is decent, the steak isn't  thick, it's actually pretty thin but still delicious, seasoned right, juicy even when it's cooked well done. My eggs over medium are always cooked to perfection, hash browns are okay, they're a bit oily, the meal comes with your choice of toast (white, wheat, or sourdough) all buttered up. I strayed away from the steak and eggs once and ordered the pot roast, it was very dry so now I stick to what I know is good.The cafe itself is clean, the service isn't the greatest. We were seated promptly and the bus person brought our waters out right away. The waitress took our orders quick as well but she brought out our food and we didn't see her again until she brought out our check. She checked on the table next to us various times but we were invisible to her, she asked the table next to us if they wanted to have dessert before she brought out their check. We weren't even asked that, what if I wanted some dessert? Lame. Maybe I should have spoken to her in Spanish since she was more attentive with her Spanish speaking customers. After your check is brought to you, you go up to the cash register to pay. The cashier was very friendly so kudos to her!

Review Text :
Jeff, the bartender at Sage that helped us, is a pretty awesome mixologist. He isn't afraid to just hear an ingredient and make up a delicious concoction for you to try. He knows his ins and outs of liquor flavors, mixers, fruits, and all that jazz. When Misti Y and I stopped by she was able to sample a most refreshing mixture that contained canton, fresh muddled raspberries, and ginger beer among other ingredients. I myself had the Tea Rose cocktail. This is made with tea vodka, rose water, St. Germain, and is garnished with roasted pine nuts. It's as interesting as it sounds and while I don't think the flavor is for everyone I also don't think it was so offensive or strong that you couldn't drink it if you had to.Misti and I also shared a tuna crudo and cheese plate for snacks, both of which I really enjoyed. The cheese plate had 4 varieties on it I believe and it wasn't an overwhelmingly large selection so if you're sharing between more than 2 people you may want more than one plate. Overall though I can see why Sage is such a hit for yelpers. I'd love to come back and try proper dinner and more cocktails the next time I'm in town.KK and I are in Vegas right now, since Wednesday, for a conference. It's always a big dilemma for me when in Vegas. Do I revisit the place I know I love, or do I try the millions of new restaurants that have opened since I was last here?On this trip, we've been doing both.One of the new places we simply had to go to was the Aria Hotel; this much, I knew.  KK made a reservation prior to our arrival to dine at Sage, Aria Hotel's posh restaurant.The decor at Aria is nothing short of beautiful.  It's a great mix of romantic balanced out w/ modern and sharp. One entire wall of blue light extends an element of fun and lively, but the conservative hardware used to design the place makes it intimate and romantic. Never before have I seen a restaurant that gave so much space in between tables -- privacy was never an issue.We arrived early to our meal after a happy hour at Social House at Crystals, and the host sat us immediately at a corner table.  The server was nothing short of perfect as far as attentiveness and friendliness.We ordered a bottle of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and read over the menu.  Everything read beautifully.I chose to have the sweetbreads and flatiron steak; KK chose the eggplant soup, Kusshi oysters, and pork loin.The amuse bouche of the evening was a sterling silver spoonful of smoked salmon -- totally underwhelming and entirely too small to form a real opinion regarding this dish.But then began a wonderful procession of food.I tried KK's eggplant soup - and never before have I tasted eggplant so delicious!My sweetbreads were delicious and perfectly cooked. The taste was not masked by sauces - and it was accompanied by thick slices of pork belly.  How could one go wrong with that?KK's pork loin was absolutely delicious. I usually refrain from ordering pork loin due to it being dry, but however Sage cooked it, it was phenomenal.The true show stealer, however, was my flaitiron steak.  I can honestly say that never before have these lips of mine come together with flatiron (not a normally impressive cut) cooked and seasoned so beautifully, with shaved truffle atop the beauty of this dish.  I had asked for it was "medium rare, but err on the side of err" to which the server replied, "So, rare plus?"  I agreed, and this was PERFECT.  I licked the plate clean.So why four stars?Well, it's the oysters.  I know and love Kusshi oysters but these were subpar -- I've had better elsewhere.  If you're going to dress them yourself and not offer the typical horseradish and lemon, then you best be sure that you dress them well.  The kitchen, however, didn't make such an impressive creation, and any restaurant that doesn't serve their oysters properly cannot be given 5 stars, in my opinion.We had originally intended to return to Social House for dessert, per the request of the general manager of Social House.  However, given how great Sage's food was, I was inclined to try at least one dessert.  When our server told us about their french press coffee, well -- he had me at "French".Strangely enough, neither KK nor I remember the pannacotta we ordered.  I do remember the coffee, which was quite delicious, but not the pannacotta.  Very odd.  We simply shared the dessert, then ran back to Social House to try their new coffee and desserts.Sage is an outstanding new restaurant. For such a new place, they had their act together. The front lounge is phenomenal, and the back restaurant is nothing short of impressive.  The meal is expensive, but well worth every dollar.On your next trip to Vegas, be sure to check out Sage at the beautiful Aria Hotel.  Running around the Aria Hotel from place to place, bar to bar - and having great company was without a doubt one of my best Vegas memories to date.Great new American food in a modern, cool setting.The ambiance provides a strong contrast to the simple, well edited, delicious food.  First the lounge menu; the crab and sweet corn fritters or the fig and blue cheese tart are both so good.  It makes me hungry just thinking about them.  Both pair so well with an extra dry Hendricks martini!From the ala carte menu, the foie gras custard brulee is incredible.  What's not to like after all; its paired with cherries and cocoa.  Yep chocolate.  The Heirloom beet salad is also excellent.  The Braised veal cheeks also deserve special mention.  The flavor is so delicate and the meat so tender.I was skeptical about trying the restaurant when I first read the menu online feeling that the combinations of ingredients seemed a bit off.  I was thankfully wrong.Most people come to Vegas to gamble, to party and to sin.Truth be told, I don't gamble and I can party much harder and sin far worse in my hometown of Los Angeles than I can in Vegas.My sin in Vegas is gluttony. Add to that worshipping at the temple of Michelin, whose bright stars cast a long shadow over Vegas, and idolizing the three French gods of cuisine who have set up outposts here (Robuchon, Savoy and Gagnaire), I'd say I have my fair share of penance to pay.So it's surprising, then, that the best meal of my recent trip was neither Michelin starred nor devised in France.It was at Sage, Shawn McClain's contemporary American ode to the farm-to-table/artisanal/sustainable/seasonal ethos.Now, let me be clear, those terms hold no particular draw for me. I'm just as happy for my produce to be exotic, my fish to be endangered, and my truffles to be out of season. And this is Vegas, a neon outpost in the desert, a place where money trumps ideology and possibly the least sustainable city in America.No, what brought me to Sage was that, after the buzz had quietened and the dust had settled on the new CityCenter's more talked about restaurants -- Gagnaire's first US outpost Twist and Bar Masa/Shaboo's $500 hot pot -- Sage emerged as the most interesting new restaurant in Vegas.Not that Shawn McClain doesn't come with accolades. Esquire magazine's "Chef of the Year", James Beard winner for "Best Chef Midwest" but it's safe to say he's not a household name outside of Chicago.Yet.The restaurant space itself is everything you'd expect in Vegas from the newest Dubai-funded casino on the Strip. Opulent, expansive, classy and swathed in plum and gold. This is not a restaurant you wander into from the casino floor.This is a destination.And the service there was impeccable. Probably the best I've received in ANY restaurant. Ever. Friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, and generous.Vancouver Island Kusshi Oysters | Piquillo Pepper and Tobasco Sorbet / Aged-Tequila MignonetteI love kusshis by themselves but the piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet was stunning. A perfect cold and hot complement to the briny oyster. With a nod to Mexico, the mignonette sauce was made with aged tequila rather than vinegar.Heirloom Beet Salad | Duck Prosciutto / Point Reyes Blue Cheese / Roasted Walnuts / Celery VinaigretteOne of my favorite dishes of the night. Simple in its preparation, the beets were soft and flavorful, the vinaigrette perfectly balanced, the blue cheese creamy, and all sitting atop slivers of duck prosciutto.Foie Gras Custard Brulée | Bing Cherries / Toasted Cocoa Nibs / Salted BriocheOne of the best mouthfuls of food I've enjoyed in '10. I love foie gras, I love creme brulée, and I can honestly think of nothing better than combining the two. Except perhaps shaving a torchon of foie gras onto it and serving it with a sweet and salty salted brioche. Absolutely craveable and made all the better by the complementary glasses of sauternes paired with it.Crescenza Cheese Mezzaluna | Grilled Mushrooms / Braised Black Kale / Parsley EmulsionOf the two pasta dishes we tried, this was the stronger although nothing extraordinary. Still, the pasta was pillowy and well made, the mushrooms adding a nice, meaty texture to the dish.Roasted Sweetbreads | Glazed Bacon / Creamy White Polenta / Marinated ChanterellesI'm a big fan of sweetbreads. The breading on the sweetbreads here was less crispy than I would have liked although the polenta it sat on was very good, having soaked up all the juices of the sweetbreads and bacon. Bacon is one of those things I'm really getting over although, thick cut like this and glazed, it was a welcome addition to the dish.Maine Lobster Ravioli | Lemon-Olive Oil Puree / Baby Spring Peas / Mascarpone / Fresh MintThis dish was a disappointment. The sauce overpowered the taste of the delicate lobster to the point that I wouldn't have known I was eating lobster if I hadn't read it on the menu. Overall, oversalted and rather leaden.SmoresRemarkably beautiful and satisfying at the same time. Did it remind me of childhood s'mores? I don't know. I didn't grow up here. But the bruléed marshmallow was suitably sweet and sticky and the gingerbread crisp a great savory counterpoint.To finish the meal, the kitchen sent out cups of hot chocolate infused with citrus. A fun and whimsical way to end the meal and the citrus finish was a nice touch to the chocolate.So there you have it. Yes, there were a couple of missed steps but whether it was the gorgeous space, the opulent and classy ambiance, the wonderful service or the company of great friends, this meal transcended its faults and was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.Possibly the meal of the year so far and definitely the dish of the year for the foie gras custard brulée.For me, Sage is the best bet at CityCenter.And, as I said, I don't like to gamble.Full review in the blog.  Highlight courses below.I must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.  High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word "sexy" comes to mind immediately.  With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a "casino restaurant."  Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.Beginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.  Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.  Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.Already abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.  Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.  Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.As good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.  Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.  Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.  Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.My sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.  Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.  With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.  Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.Warm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.  Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.The first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.  Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.Hands down, Sage is probably my most favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. From the service to the food, you won't regret it. I have been here a couple times and I am amazed at what they can with just an egg. Saturday night we had the signature tasting menu with wine pairing and was excellent. We had plans to go out after so we asked to share our waiter was nice enough to allow to do so.Amuse Bouche - Sunchoke soup with tarragon -- great start, chilled and light.First course - WAGYU BEEF TARTARE -- Crushed Caper Aïoli/Slow Poached Egg/Crispy Chocolate. My favorite dish of all the courses. So light and went down way to easy. (paired with a vouvray.) perfect match. Second course - MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS -- Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms/Salted Caramel Reduction. I never knew that Dayboat scallops have a more sea flavor. I loved it. The dish was very asian influenced almost teriyaki flavor.  Third course - IBERICO PORK LOIN -- Brussels Sprouts/Crispy Confit Shoulder/Smoked Dates. Almost bbq flavored, you could taste the smoke. Final course - WARM CARROT CAKE --Roasted Coconut Sauce/Candied Ginger/Cream Cheese Ice Cream. I normally am not a carrot cake lover but this one will change your mind. Light, moist and rich. The best part of this restaurant; the Absinthe cart. Who wouldn't love an entire cart of Absinthe?!!  ha ha! Our server suggested the Germain-Robin, USA. This is the lightest out of all the ones listed. Great for beginners, such as myself.It food is unforgettable and so the absinthe. ;)  I can't wait to go back.An excellent dining experience, without a doubt. Sage is one of those no-brainer restaurants where you know you're going to have a great meal and not have to stress about it. My folks were in Vegas and they like to go to fancy restaurants from time-to-time and Sage was on their radar. All I had to do was get ready and show up, which is how I like it :)We arrived about 15 minutes before the reservation and decided to have a drink at the bar. Sparkling rose, please. I ended up guzzling down about 4 glasses of this stuff over the span of our meal. Can't get enough of the bubbly. Our server was quite jovial. He even tolerated my Dad's cheesy jokes, which automatically promotes him to Sainthood. More good news? It was Restaurant Week, which means there were even more delicious dishes to choose from beyond the regular menu. I ended up splitting the ribeye + bone marrow + foie gras special. Not my *favorite*, by my favorite +1's eyes lit up when they rattled off some of his favorite foods together on one plate. How could I say no?  Food was excellent. Rich, decadent - everything one could expect from a meal of duck liver, red meat and the marrow. It even came with a side of creamy pureed potatoes. Dessert? It was OK. Actually, I don't even remember what we ate. I was more into my glass of sparkling wine than anything else. And after two hours at the table, I was itching to go somewhere else.Why 4 stars instead of 5? As much as I enjoyed the experience, it's not going on the "Best Meals Evar" list. There's absolutely nothing wrong with Sage, it's just not a restaurant that I would pick again. Perhaps I'm not classy enough or my palate is not as refined? My parents loved it, though, and that's all that really matters, since they were the ones picking up the check ;)4.9 stars!Decided to come here for dinner before seeing Sade and John Legend at the MGM Grand.  My cousin was also in town, so we met here a couple hours before the show.Ambiance was tones of gold and lavender lighting with dark accents.  The entrance was through glass wine displays that opened up into their bar lounge then main dinning area.  Ambiance:  5 stars!I arrived first and sat at the bar and ordered a fancy cocktail, whose name escapes me, but contained a smoked peach whiskey.  It was fabulous!  The bartender shares that they smoke their peaches, infusing that flavor into the whiskey.  Pretty amazing.  Knowing we had an 8 pm concert, the staff asked twice throughout dinner how they were doing on time.  Nice to know they know, you know?  Service:  5 stars!My cousin arrives and we delve into the menu and opt for the $79 Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings (that went perfectly, btw).  Although it wasn't the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu we were intending, we couldn't resist the urge to splurge.We started with an amuse-bouche of some fish inspired concoction that was a nice start.  The prix fixe allowed us some room to decide among 2-3 choices in each of the four courses.  First course:  1)  Wagyu Beef Tartare of crushed caper aïoli, slow-poached egg and crispy chocolate.  I don't like raw meat, but this was fresh and extremely flavorful.  An intriguing pleaser despite our aversion for raw meat:  4 stars.2)  Foie Gras 'Brûlée' that was more like a tartlet rich with creamy goose liver:  5 stars!Second course:1)  Glazed Pork Belly with sweet corn tortellini, Porcini mushrooms & crispy pancetta:  5 star brilliance!  Probably the best dish of the night.2)  Maine Dayboat Scallops with braised Oxtail, Wild Mushrooms in a salted caramel reduction:  5 stars!  Succulent medallions of scallops adorned in a beautiful sauce that turned out to be my cousin's favorite dish.Third course:1)  Iberico Pork Loin with milk-braised cannelloni with baby eggplant and Creminelli Mortadella.  The fact that my cousin offered me none is testament of its superiority:  5 stars!2)  48 Hour Beef Belly with golden chanterelles, Padrón peppers and California plums:  5 stars!  I'm a big sucker for belly meat, so this outrageous dish won big time in my book.Dessert course:1)  Peach Praline Profiteroles or roasted peaches with praline gelato and peach jus:  4.5 stars.2)  Crunchy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Tart with cassis sphere & in a toasted marshmallow sauce:  5 stars!  Give me chocolate or give me death!  A high brow example of a low brow standby.A great experience, exactly what I wanted to mark my ten year return to Vegas (no joke!)Tally:Ambiance:  5 stars!Service:  5 stars!First Course:  4+5= 9/2= 4.5Second Course:  5 stars!Third Course:  5 stars!Dessert Course:  4.5+5= 9.5/2= 4.8Wine Pairings:  5 stars!5+5+4.5+5+5+4.8=5= 34.3/7= 4.9 stars#Yelp 365:  050/365My sister made reservations for this place based on the reviews.  Thought we would fine dine it out the last night before we left the sinful desert.  Sage definitely did not disappoint.Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - $79.00/person for Chef Mcclain's Signature MenuSeafood - Yes, oysters, Pacific Yellowtail, tuna, cod, scallops, black bass, troutMeats - Yes, beef, venision, veal, chicken, etcVegetables - Yes, salads.Dessert - YesFruits - YesOther - (1) Located in the Aria Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Chef Shawn McClain creates "The New American menu laced with Mediterranean contexts."  (4) McClain has received the 2001 James Beard Foundation Best New Restaurant and 2006 Best Chef Midwest awards.Appetizer:Chicken Sausage (Complimentary) - A-Ok (3 Stars) - Quarter sized slice of chicken sausage served with jam and green bean.  If I was blind tested, I would not of known that it was chicken.  It definitely had the texture of a sausage but it was not as tasty as I thought it would be.  The only odd thing is that it was served cold.Bacon bread and Sourdough (Complimentary) - So they have a guy walk around offering bread and you get a choice of bacon bread and sourdough.  My sister's fiancé is a bread fiend so he asked for both.  I did the same not because I love bread, but I was worried I would leave hungry since these fancy places tend to serve small portions.  Trust me, get the bacon bread and it's for obvious reasons.  The bread comes with silky smooth butter and sea salts.First Course:Wagyu Beef Tartare - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Wagyu beef tartare with crush capered aioli, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds, and crispy chocolate.  This dish does come with a side of toasted bread.  Tasted great!  The texture reminds me of pate.  The soft, raw beef along with the slow poached egg made it really creamy and went well with the toasted bread.  Very generous portion of tartare--approximately 3" in diameter and 1" thick.Second Course:Bacon Wrapped Rabbit - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Bacon wrapped rabbit with heirloom carrots and roasted garlic ravioli with salsify cream and black truffle.  You get 3 pieces of bacon wrapped rabbit (3" x 1") and 2 ravioli (2" in diameter).  The prominent flavor was the deep smoky bacon.  The rabbit tasted like regular white meat because the bacon was so overwhelming.  The roasted garlic ravioli tasted good as well, however it was bland because the smoky bacon would not leave your mouth.Third Course:48 Hour Beef Belly - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 Stars) - Beef belly that have been cooked for 48 hours with roasted chestnut puree, Brussel sprouts, and pickled sweet onions.  This beef was totally like butter--soft like it, you slice through it like it, and melted like it in your mouth.  The flavor is to remember because to this day I think about how wonderful it tasted.  Other beef will not be the same after you had this beef belly.  This is the beef you marry--we are soul mates.Fourth Course:Warm Apple-Fennel Strudel - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - This is a deconstruction of apple-fennel strudel with hazelnut crumble and brown butter ice cream.  The apple was nicely sweet and warm and worked well with the smooth and creamy brown butter ice cream.  The paper-thin sheet of dough was crispy and flakey and gave the dessert a little added crunch and texture.Complimentary:White chocolate dessert shot - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Our waiter for the evening came by and brought this out stating it was the compliments of the chef.  It was served in a white ceramic shot glass.  It was served warm and was very rich and sweet.  It reminds me of the warm soy bean that is served for Taiwanese breakfasts.  The only main difference there is a spicy kick at the end.  The service and food is wonderful here.  I definitely recommend Sage as a must try whenever you are in Vegas.  You'll like the ambiance as well--very dim and warm lighting.  Plus, the area is very spacious and you will not be in the space of other diners.  Sage is a Woohoo! As good as it gets!The service was spectacular, the orders came out promptly, the environment was lovely (what a relief it was to be on the strip but not have music blaring), the cocktails were top notch, and the menu was creative.  Sage lacked "5 star" complete excellence due to some dishes lacking a bit of flavor.   Some were amazing, some were good but not great.  My two "must try" dishes were the scallops (oh, drool, I can only dream of replicating that at home), and the heirloom carrot and roasted garlic ravioli (with a generous serving of shaved truffles and chantrelles).  Oh my, that ravioli was decadent and so worth the price!The oysters, beet salad, and tuna sashimi all could have used a little more oomph.  The flavors on the menu looked amazing, but they were all a bit muted.  Especially with small servings fancy-restaurant style, I want every bite to smack me upside the head.  Those at our table also thought the beef tartare and beef belly were just okay.  While they were cooked to perfection, the accompanying flavors should have been a little more intense.Deserts were nice, rich, and complex, with our favorite parts being the salted caramel ice cream that came with the pine nut torte with fresh berries.  I am enamored with the candied pine nuts, need to try that at home, and had to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.  Overall, the experience was very nice, and worth doing once every couple of years.  But, for a meal that approaches $100/person, I want everything to be AMAZING with no dishes that are just "pretty good".During the Restaurant Week 2012(Feb 27-Mar 4), my friend took me to this beautiful place.  We decided to have a dinner together since it was my birthday week.If someone asks what will be the best dining experience ever and why it's so special...?  I can say without hesitation that it is not the best seat in a fancy 5 star restaurant, it's the joy of company having a nice conversation and a meal.  I will not trade that for the world :) I sometimes hear people describing the art work, a music concert, opera, or even poetry reading along similar lines are beautiful but I wish more people would realize that sharing food can be the same way as well.Actually, it wasn't my first time trying out food at Sage.  In Aug 30th 2010, there was a fundraiser for Three Square("Wet your Appetite @Wet Republic - MGM Grand).  I had a chance to sample the foods, cocktails, & desserts from each restaurant's food station including Craft Steak, Jean Georges Steakhouse, Circo, Sensi, Joel Robuchon, Fleur de Lys, Burger Bar, & Sage.  All the dishes were excellent but the Ginger flavor cocktail from Sage was outstanding that I still remember the taste of it! I started my dinner at Sage ordering a glass of cocktail called, " Dark & Stormy" It was basically a rum with a fresh lime & a ginger beer :). It was very refreshing and tasty. *1st course: "Spring Green Garlic Soup" - very mild flavor of Spring garlic, light texture of Greek yogurt,  & crispy duct confit.  It was a very unique dish that I never had it before. "Seared Bison Tenderloin Carpaccio - Amazing!  At first, It looked as a raw tuna by the color but the taste was very solid.  The roasted pistachio & beets were sprinkled over the bison carpaccio & it blended well with the dish I thought. *2nd course: "Roasted Jumbo Fluke" - This dish was well presented with spinach, brown butter apples, & crispy leeks.  It was so tender and juicy inside and the crispy golden brown texture outside. I learned one thing from this dish that the sweetness of the apple can go well with the fish."American Wagyu Flat Iron Steak" - Oh, it was melting in my mouth!  We ordered a medium cooked for our steak and it was perfect.  It was fairly pinkish red in the center, beautifully juicy, with crisped and crunchy edges, and so much flavor! It wasn't necessary to cut the steak with a knife because it was so tender.  I was enjoying the dish along with the salsa verde and the potato puree. *3rd course: "Gianduja Pave" - it was a small dessert/ice cream with a flavor of caramel, hazelnut, & tangerine.  The taste was so rich that the small portion was more than enough to spoil my appetite for a dessert!*a complimentary drink for surprise: At the end of our dinner, the server brought a tiny porcelain cup of warm chocolate milk infused with fresh rosemary :) The aroma of rosemary was pleasant and I learned that it is a valuable in digesting foods that can be used in many dishes. I thought the pine-like fragrance & pungent flavor of rosemary went well with warm chocolate milk.  I would like to say our server, Johnathan, he was the picture of perfection in service.  He was taking time to explain all the dishes we had and waited on us at exactly the right moment each time checking on us.  And he remembered to put a little candle on my dessert and that was very nice :PI extremely loved the interior decor such as high columns, huge mirror walls, elegant lamps on random tables, and chocolate brown colored theme all the way through out entire restaurant. I really think the chef & food make a great restaurant, but also the staff & environment ambiance also contribute. I am definitely coming back for the chef McClain's Tasting Menu to try more dishes and can't wait to taste their famous "Foie Gras Brulee" :PPS $50.12 - per person for Restaurant Week Menu       $14 - classic cocktail priceI don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there. My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!! This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me. The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great. The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT      English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY  Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming! We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.**COURSE #1**Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.**COURSE #2**Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.**COURSE #3**48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.**COURSE #4**Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. **AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.If you subscribe to the "you only live once" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.Finally we tried out Sage tonight for my bf's birthday.  The signature tasting menu has upped from $79 to $89 and wine/beer pairing has upped from $39 to $44.  Here are the items we got:Amuse Buche: Smoked salmon profiterole.  One bite that excited our palate.  Then we got to choose the bacon bread or the sourdough bread to spread some chive butter and sprinkle some Himalayan sea salt on it if we like.  I prefer the sourdough. 1st Course:-Wagyu Beef Tartare -Delicious.  The beef was tender and yummy with the nice crushed caper aioli to give it that oomph and the slow poached egg to bring everything together.  We were given crostini to top the tartare on.  This was paired with a Chimay white.-Foie Gras Brulee (extra $10)-like a savory dessert.  Too rich for my taste.  I only ate a quarter and was done with this.Winner: Wagyu Beef Tartar2nd Course:-Grilled Spanish Octopus: The octopus pieces were so tender...never had it this tender ever!  These octopus slices were served with smoked Potato Puree, fried potatoes, and other veggies.  This was paired with a Unibroe.-Maine Dayboat Scallops:  2 jumbo scallops and they were cooked to perfection.  American Fish can learn from Sage how to cook seafood.  They were served with braised oxtail and wild mushrooms.  The scallops were the star and I could care less about the oxtail and mushrooms.Winner:  Both were delicious, but scallops win by a few points.3rd Course:-Iberco Pork Loin: the pork loin was a bit salty, the ham was not memorable, the crispy pork shoulder was delicious.  This was paired with a dark beer that my bf cannot remember the name of but he loved this beer.  -48 hour beef belly:  Very tender.  It was served with grilled peach.  This was paired with a Chimay Red.Winner: 48 hour beef belly, although the crispy pork shoulder in the Iberco Pork Loin was pretty darn good!4th Course:-Gianduja Pave: This is an olive oil ice cream with pieces of hazelnut crunch and basil jam.  It was quite beautiful  but a  bit hard to eat since we have to spoon a bit of the ice cream, the blue berries, the hazelnut crunch, the chocolate, to get them all in one bite.  My bf didn't like this dessert as much as I did.-Pistachio Tart:  The tart was in little pieces, strategically laid out on top of some stringy cake, served with sauteed strawberries and a strawberry-black pepper gelato.  Interesting flavor combination.  It also came with a lit candle for my bf.  My bf loved this dessert.  This was paired with a fruity lindemann beer.Winner:  Tied.We ended the night with this white chocolate drink, compliments of the chef.  Was yummy in my tummy.  The total bill, including tip, was $300.Worth it?  Yes.  Service was impeccable.Once a month, a few friends and I get together to dine at a nice restaurant. Sage has been on our list for a long time. Three of us got there early and spent some time at the bar. The signature cocktails are innovative and fresh. Most of the ingredients are not your conventional elements and mixed well. Personally, I like the Moscow Mule. Served in the traditional copper mug, the blend of lime, ginger beer, and vodka hit the spot. James, our server, was beyond amazing. We started off with a glass of champagne. We found out that any full bottle of champagne or wine under $500 is half off. That is dangerous, because it lead to five bottles being consumed throughout dinner. It is a great deal for locals and a great way to get people to come back. The best appetizers are the oysters with aged tequila mignonette and a Tabasco sorbet, roasted sweetbreads, and frois gras creme brulee. The wagyu beef tartare was decent. Nothing amazing or unique. The ones we could have done without were the octopus, yellowtail, and the brussel sprouts salad. The greens had too much of a bacon flavor. I never would have thought I'd be the one to say that. Normally bacon is the solution to all of life's problems. In this case, the smokiness was overbearing. Two different places have taught me that yellowtail is not to be ordered outside of sushi restaurants. As for entrees, the veal cheeks and NY strip were melt in your mouth buttery goodness. The side of creamed potatoes were irresistible. The tile fish was not worth getting. I would suggest getting something else. Both of the pastas are impressive. The raviolis had large pieces of king crab meat on each stuffed pocket. The cavatelli had a generous amount of shaved truffles on it. The toasted pine nuts add a textural component to the dish that was complimentary. We were told that every dish was rich and heavy. By the end, I was done for. If death was at my door, I would gladly go. Desserts are Sage's weak point. The sweet potato sundae was the best offering. Otherwise the other three desserts we ordered were forgettable. Skip dessert and just order another entree. Otherwise go to Jean Philippe Patisserie.Of all the five star high end restaurants in town, most disappoint me in one way or another. However, every once and awhile, you stumble across one that not only meets but exceeds your expectations in every way imaginable. From the service to the ambiance to the food, everything thoroughly surprised me. Mind you though, that all that fanciness doesn't come cheap but I am a huge believer in getting what you pay for. The last couple of times we have eaten here, service has been superb and the details never a miss. While the portions are generally on the smaller side and served a la carte, it does allow one to sample many things off the menu which is always a treat. However, the best way to get a little of everything without getting to full or breaking the proverbial bank is the tasting menu. I generally try and always take advantage of tasting menus when available because they truly allow you to sample a little bit of everything on the menu.DATE/TIME: August 20, 2012 // 10:00 PMPRICE: $70/person for Chef McCain's Signature Menu - 4 Courses (+$10 supplement for foie gras brulee) - Increased to $89 as of 3/15/13VALUE: A great deal. After a series of disappointing dining experiences at a few Michelin-starred restaurants, Sage was a pleasant surprise. AMBIANCE: Dimly lit. Romantic. Modern.CHANCE OF RETURNING: 80%___________________________________We were here for our 3 year anniversary, which we forgot to mention when we made reservations. To be able to taste a wider variety of dishes, my husband and I usually have a habit of ordering different dishes for each course and swapping plates. A few dishes that we both had trouble swapping include: foie gras brulee, dayboat scallops, beef belly.___________________________________:::: [ THE FOOD ] ::::* FOIE GRAS BRULEE (+$10) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sage-las-vegas-2?select=vhHgJh_3RxC2PVTNyCTneQ#vhHgJh_3RxC2PVTNyCTneQ)              - [5/5 - This dish fully converted my husband into a foie gras lover.

Aria's upscale restaurants are much more contemporary than the traditional fine dining spots you will find in older casinos like Caesars Palace and Bellagio.  Sage follows that trend.Sage is in a very modern space that has kind of an upscale lounge feel.  There is  no white tablecloth though the restaurant does feel like a fine dining restaurant when it comes to their menu--a la carte items with premium ingredients, a pre fixe menu and a tasting menu are available.I had the pre fixe menu, which offers the choice of several of Sage's signature dishes across four courses.  The meal started with complimentary bread--two crusty options including a bacon roll and salt dusted sourdough.  Both breads were fine but nothing special.  The amuse bouche was raw tuna with cucumber and wasabi.  It lacked the brightness and vibrant flavor of a good amuse.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xx2ixDh92XbugQPNsARWxA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQI started with the foie gras creme brulee, which was a foie gras custard base with a traditional creme brulee caramelized sugar crust.  Garnishes included good and sweet Bing cherries as well as warm, buttery and sweet brioche (topped with a little bit of salt).  The starter was very dessert-like, but it did have a strong foie gras flavor as well as foie gras' creaminess.  The brioche was a little oily.  I liked the dish, but I think it would work better as a dessert given its very sweet flavor.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tuTEWuF9RJLCM0gO39PSEA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQNext came day boat scallops with good mushrooms, greens and braised oxtail.  I did like the garnishes.  The oxtail was very good--tender, juicy and meaty--though there was too little of it.  The scallops were just okay. They just were not as soft, fresh or moist as I have had at other restaurants including Vegas spots like Picasso, Table 10 and Olives.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-AmrCdNy2bPb4g30EVVeSQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQI had the braised beef belly for my entree.  It was an okay tasting dish.  The garnishes were decent but not as good as what came with the scallops.  The best garnish with this beef dish was the tart pickled ramps, which was the only real flavor that stood out.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7u38OgDbTux-a4MU7_N2dQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQThe beef belly was like ribs.  The beef belly had a good flavor and it was tender and juicy.  I did not like the unevenness of it with some meaty parts but also fatty parts that were not rendered down.  It could have just been the nature of this cut.Dessert was an almond tart, which was really dense and thick with the texture of a butterscotch square.  It was dry and had no cake-like or cream-like consistency.  I did not like the core of this dessert though the garnishes of macerated berries and creamy, refreshing and fragrant lavender gelato were both good.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W9-266MC8A3Rbr7hAIaKYQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQA la carte prices were very high like other high-end Vegas restaurants with entrees in the $40s and $50s.  The pre fixe menu was not too bad of a deal given the variety of ingredients and generous portions.Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a quick pace.  Our server had a matter of fact manner (which I liked).  It was a little different from the service I have had at similar restaurants where servers tend to be very gracious and eager to please.  Even though she did not have that incredibly pleasant approach of those other places, she was still polite, professional and engaging.Overall, the food at Sage was decent and properly cooked though not much about the meal stood out.  Though Vegas has a lot of fine dining and upscale restaurants, I actually find it quite hard to have a really great high-end meal in Vegas.  If you are looking for really good contemporary upscale cuisine, I recommend the more expensive L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in MGM Grand.  If quality of ingredients and good flavors are what you are seeking, I recommend the similarly priced though more formal and traditional Picasso (in the Bellagio) over Sage.Aria, like most casinos on The Strip, offers both complimentary self and valet parking.A top notch restaurant that was delicious from start to finish.  The people working there will literally give you the shirt off their back!  My wife was freezing and our excellent server offered the manager's cardigan to wear during dinner.  Who does that??We went with Chef McClain's Signature Menu for $89.  No wine pairings because I am usually too buzzed at the end to appreciate the flavors.  I started with the "Wagyu Beef Tartare" with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg and dark chocolate.  Chocolate and beef isn't a combo I am usually down with but it was a fun twist that totally worked.  I literally could've had this as my whole meal.  The buttered and grilled sourdough bread complimented it perfectly.My wife got the "Foie Gras Brulee" which was wow, wow, wow.  It was such a creative dish and a wild mix of flavors upon first taste but it just got better and better after each bite.  It's ok to lick the dish, right?  This could have been a dessert and I wondered if the chef ever considered that.  I got the "Australian Wagyu Sirloin" for my main entree.  It was as tender as expected but I was ready to swap after having a bit of the 48 hour beef belly.  That was treeeeemendous and what I would go with had I done it all over again.  "Gianuja Pave" was my choice for dessert.  It's not often I get to try olive oil ice cream with basil jam.  That was a really excellent ending to the meal and kept up with the creativity of the experience.Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brûlée.The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.Happy Eats!New American at it's finest.  Combining globally sourced ingredients and flavors with classic American cuisine then trying to achieve the broadest range of taste results in incredible good eats.  It's all done without molecular gastronomy. For starters, the wagyu beef tartare; great beef flavor and just the right accompaniments to balance the usual cloying fatty finish (pickled mustard seeds, capers, the usual coddled egg yolk, and CHOCOLATE).  The bitterness balanced the entire dish.  Not to be missed, the foie gras custard brulee; excellent.  Cherries for the requisite acidic sweetness, toasted cocoa nibs for bitterness and a twist, salted brioche.  Imaginative.Finally, the roasted sweetbreads; stunning.  Bacon fat (from a thick cut piece of bacon) provides the seasoning to the airy sweetbreads they blend well with polenta and wafting umame of trumpet mushrooms.  Slightly one dimensional texturally but good eats for sure.Salads are anything but common.  How about a heirloom tomato salad with smoked peaches and baby fennel accented by lemon pickled cucumber.  Vibrant acidity, complexity from the licorice fennel, sweet bitterness of the peaches.  Perfect.For mains, the Iberico pork loin, cooked medium, tender with a pronounced heritage pork flavor.  It contrast well with a piece of crispy pork shoulder.  Served with a sweet, smoked date pure that makes the perfect accompaniment heightening the natural sweetness of the pork.The 36 hour braised wagyu short rib, equally good.  One of the best braised short ribs I've had (the best being Craftsteak).  Served with an earthy horseradish potato pave and caramelized onions, glazed in its own braising liquid.  The braised beef, rich and melting the sides providing a sweet, earthy balance.Excellent and efficient service.The wine list remains excellent.  Vegas resort pricing.Truly a foodies playground!I think my expectations were too high. This was not a bad experience by any means, but I have had better meals at some of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. I treated a friend for their birthday and we opted for the early evening dinner three course menu ($59 pp) with wine pairing ($29 pp). The restaurant is classy and beautiful with plenty of quite and intimate space. Our server was attentive, but overbearing at certain points. Overall, I think he did a great job, so I won't really nitpick there.We started off with an amuse-bouche consisting of kampachi and mango. The texture and flavor was incredible. I started off with a chilled sweet corn soup while the other party opted for a fresh vegetable medley. I absolutely devoured my soup, it was perfect. Her veggies were completely unoriginal, they tasted fresh, but that is about it. There was no interesting spin or vinaigrette to accompany the meal. As my entree I opted for the Pacific Yellowtail Kampachi with chanterelle mushrooms, bacon, manila clams and black grapes. The fish was not cooked evenly, but the overall flavors worked superbly together. The other party opted for the flat iron steak which ended up being $10 extra on top of the tasting menu price. It was a generous serving of protein that was cooked perfectly.The final course was the dessert, and that was heavenly. It was a caramelized pineapple mousse with all sorts of other goodies added to it. To acknowledge her birthday, it came with a single candle that I though was a nice touch. Overall it was an enjoyable, yet not a mind blowing meal. Especially for $250 with tip.Totally hip, totally fun, totally delicious. Servers were attentive, playful and far from uptight.  Great all around dining experience -- Vegas style!Starters:Grilled robada apricots with toasted pecan purée, shaved pork belly, watercress and crispy guanciale -- Different and tasty!Wagyu beef tartar with crushed caper aoili, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds & crispy chocolate!  Heaven on earth!  Foie gras custard brûlée with bing cherries, toasted cocoa nibs & salted brioche -- My favorite way to have foie gras.  DAYAM it was GOOOOOD.Main Courses:Maine scallops with braised oxtail, wild mushrooms and salted caramel reduction - Fabulous-O!  Salted reduction was genius.  The short ribs were dynamite.  They were so tender and quite the party in my mouth!  I've been dying for something like this after watching an episode of Master Chef season finale.Dessert: Efferescent grape mousse with greek yogurt posset, carbonated grapes and lychee sorbet. Unique! Never seen anything like it on any menu & pretty darn amazing.  Didn't think I would like it but wanted to try it because it's so different.  What a perfect combo of balance... especially with the lychee sorbet.Apple fritters with root beer panna cotta, apple cider sorbet with sassafras ice cream. This is supposed to replicate what you would get at the fair, but with a sophisticated twist.  The edible paper was so cool.  Definitely a lot of intricate details involved in crafting this piece of art.UNIQUE & EXCELLENT in every way!  Talk about creative.  Must try the grape mousse.  I was a bit nervous but the pastry chef knows what she is doing.  Complex, creative & delicious. Better move quick though because the options change with the season.At the end of our meal we were given warm sage milk.  How fitting and perfect to help cleanse the pallet.Sage is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!  They have had two of my favorite appetizers...maybe 2 of the top 5 or 10 appetizers.  One being their Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg--Smoked Potato/Shaved Black Truffles/Toasted Country Bread.  The other being their famous Foie Gras Custard Brulee--Apricot Chutney/Toasted Cocoa Nibs/Salted Brioche.  If these two weren't enough, Sage continues to shine with other great starters.  The Aged Tequila Mignonette that accompanies the already creamy and succulent Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters is fantastic!  Moreover, the Wagyu Beef Tartare is a solid choice and the Chilled Sweet Corn Soup is outstanding! Additionally though, this cocktail snob can't stop thinking about their "Seville Constelation." This is my current favorite drink.  There is nothing I'd rather start an evening of whiskey/bourbon/scotch/rye drinking more than this drink.  It is refined and delicate for a whiskey-based cocktail, but still has enough of a backbone to entice whiskey purists.  It is the epitome of a balanced drink!The menu is not perfect in my opinion, I have had a few dishes on occasion that have fallen flat, but in general Sage's dishes are inventive, and bring together a wonderful combination of technique and flavor.  I am certainly more of a fan of the Starters then I am of the Entrées, but that doesn't mean that the Entrées are bad, just not as euphoric as the Starters.  I generally prefer lighter meats and seafood dishes.  I think Sage does a good job with these items, but I would recommend the Steaks and Braises to those looking for more cohesive plates.Always check to see if they are participating in Restaurant Week when it rolls around. This year's Restaurant Week menu at Sage was the best value on all of Restaurant Week....it was a delightful excuse to come in again.Furthermore, Lauren is one of the best servers you will ever have the pleasure of experiencing.  Don't request her though as we are trying to keep that on the DL so she is available for us when we come in.We were staying at the Mandarin Oriental and had a positive experience when we came to Sage for dinner on a Friday night. We made the mistake of coming back on Sunday night to have a cocktail at the bar. Aaron B. was our bartender and I can say that, without a doubt, he was one of the most unpleasant people I've encountered in the service industry. If this was a low-rent bar with cheap drinks, I'd forgive him. But...we paid top dollar for an enjoyable high-end experience and, after attempting to make polite chit-chat with him about how he was making our cocktails, he became oddly aggressive and insulting -- as if we were idiots questioning the work of a master. Absolutely ridiculous.A few moments later, we also overheard him complaining loudly about a female customer who was "so f--ing stupid that he had to explain every item on the menu three times." Very classy indeed. For our last night in Vegas, it left a bad taste in our mouths. We visit Vegas often, but we won't be going back to Sage. There are too many other places to spend our money -- and we've encountered many other bartenders who make comparable drinks and understand how to engage with their customers.Wow!  All I can say is, wow!  I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened, so when the opportunity came up I  jumped on it.  I had family in town and thought it would be perfect to try a good selection of dishes.There were four of us and we were seated promptly in the main dining area.  I really liked the decor.  It was hip, modern, and had a nice quaint atmosphere that wasn't too loud, but not too quiet either.  We were approached by our server, who wasn't very inviting and were presented with menus.  She didn't bother going through the menu, nor did she offer us any specials or the tasting menu.  I would've liked the option of a tasting menu.  The waitress seemed rather rushed to get our orders in, I guess we came in towards their closing time, but she didn't offer any suggestions or help with the menu to expedite our ordering.  I asked her what she recommended and she pointed out the octopus and foie gars for appetizers.  I asked her if she could come back in a minute and she left annoyed.  Anyway, we ordered the Ricotta Cavatelli, Braised Waygu, Foie Gras Custard, Spanish Octopus starter, Poached Egg starter and Organic chicken.  She then told us that the chicken would take about 30-45 minutes to prepare.  It was kind of upsetting because my cousin had her heart set on that chicken, and for a dish that requires extra prep time, it should be mandatory they tell us in the beginning.  She could've put her order in the first time she came around.  She ended up going for the lobster ravioli instead.The food was horrible, to say the least.  Six dishes came out and all was difficult to eat, some more than others.  We left the Waygu, Cavatelli, Foie Grad brûlée and octopus uneaten.  The waitress saw this and cleared the plates without asking us how our food was.  She just wanted to get out of there and I could tell while she stared at us from across the room that she was hoping we'd finish fast.  Seriously, service was such a joke.  She was useless, rude, and unhelpful.  I asked her about the portions and she said they were individually portioned out, which was fine.  I just wanted an idea of how much we would order to get a good selection.  To my surprise, the dishes were actually pretty big.  My pasta could've fed two. THE FOOD:-The Grilled Spanish Octopus (starter) was extremely acidic.  The texture was tough and kinda rubbery.  You couldn't really taste any other ingredient, and the plating was messy.-Foie Gras Custard Brûlée (starter) was ok, it was the best dish out of the six.  I liked the salted brioche it came with.  The texture wasn't like a creme brûlée though, it was more like a mousse.  They added some fig and brown butter chestnut, which over powered any taste of the Foie Gras.  It was a really sweet dish, so I felt like we had a dessert for a starter.-Slow Poached Organic Egg (starter): I didn't try this dish, but my cousin said it was good.  How can you mess up a poached egg though?-36 Hr. Brasied Waygu was extremely sweet and acidic, as if they braised it in vinegar.  One bite was more than enough, so this dish went to waste.-Ricotta Cavatelli: They tried to make Spaetzle for this dish, which is a thin pasta, but ended up making it so thick it had the texture of gnocchi.  This extremely thick doughy pasta was the only thing you tasted.  Moreover, it looked like they just took a bunch of ingredients from a fridge and threw it on the plate.  Less is more with this dish, and they over did it.  No one at the table wanted to eat it, so it sat untouched for the duration of our dinner.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS DISH.-Fennel Ravioli w/ Lobster was a joke.  It was pasta, topped with lobster and whatever else it came with.  All of the ingredients were sort of layered and just laid on top of empty ravioli pasta.  My cousin decided to finish the dish, even though she did not like it, because we left so many dishes uneaten already.Didn't bother with dessert.  At that point we were already pissed at how much money we threw away to this restaurant, and our server just sucked.I believed all the hype that came with this restaurant and was extremely disappointed.  I will not go back, and will not recommend it to anyone.  I want to think I came on a bad night, too close to closing time, but the quality of the food and service is not worth the $30-50pp price mark.  Also, they shouldn't be taking tables an hour and a half prior to them closing if they are going to end up rushing you out.I really want to come back and give this place another try, but my experience was just flat out horrible.  I did like the bread they offered, lol.We were SO NOT impressed with this restaurant, NOT at all. I was debating two stars or three stars, considering we were tired, maybe our taste buds were a little numbed from too much drinking, or our judgment was a little impaired from vodka, so I think three stars is fair. Beautiful restaurant for sure, it was nearly empty on a Saturday night, not a good sign. Got seated at a comfy and intimate booth, very romantic indeed. Brought our own Perrier Nuit Blanche, corkage was $35 too. Took a short while to look through the menu, our server introduced the chef's tasting menu, but I don't eat meat so we can't order that. They have vegetarian and vegan tasting menus too. Starters:Garlic soup with prawn, the best dish of the entire meal, very nice garlic flavor, not too light or too strong, tender and fresh prawn, so good! Dozen of Vancouver island Kushi oysters: fairly fresh, the housemade sauce was a little bland, had to ask for tabasco, tasted better with hot sauce though. Romaine greens with parmesan cheese, my salad never came, so I asked to pack it to go, but didn't eat it when we got back, so it was a waste because they forgot about my salad. Entrees:American kobe skirt steak in rare plus: it was not rare enough for hubby, he liked the flavors alright, was not mind blowing at all. Pacific red snapper with veggie stock: server said this was a popular dish, OK... The fish was completely flavorless, the veggies in it were a little too raw for my taste, it tasted like grass to me, or was it the veggie broth? But the fish was very fresh and tender, just extremely bland! This dish FAILED! We weren't interested in our entrees, didn't want desserts either, just asked them to pack everything, including our unfinished Champagne, I have to say that I had high expectations for this restaurant because of the high ratings on yelp, and the major advertisement of fine dining at Aria hotel. It was a HUGE disappointment! The service didn't meet my expectation either, our server wasn't attentive or friendly enough, there were a few staffs served us, they all looked dull to me for some reason, or probably we finished our meal too fast that they didn't have time to check on us.  I don't think we will ever be back for Sage, this restaurant didn't work for us, just one of those high rating restaurants fell short I guess, it happens sometime.Close your eyes children, it's about to go downIf this was my last meal on the face of this Earth, I would have died the only way I would like to and then gone straight to heaven to take a nap. Luckily, this was my last meal of the trip, and then I went to see Calvin Harris after at Hakkasan. So it's pretty much equivalent to going to heaven and taking a nap because I don't remember anything after.Definitely sexyIt's the kind of restaurant you want to spend your dinners at in Vegas. Very fitting for a sexy night out, dark and welcoming space with warm colors and vibrant high-end materials. Not to mention the at tentative servers who make you feel like a boss. I literally left there telling people to give me their TPS reports. "Apparently you didn't put one of those new cover letters on the new TPS reports......" Who doesn't like feeling like a boss? I wish I had an endless stomach.For occasions like this, I want to eat their food forever. Try their tasting menu or off a la carte in this exact order: 1) Vancouver Island Oysters 2) Wagyu Beef Tartare 3) Grilled Spanish Octopus 4) Main Day Boat Scallops 5) 48 Hour Beef Belly 6) Meyer Lemon Cheesecake.............then tell the kids to close their eyes.

Review Text :
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A RESTAURANT!This is so disappointing to have to write about. This last summer our family and my husbands family bought vacation homes in Fountain Hills. My husbands family was visiting from England and I told them we should definitely stop by the Vu. I had been there once and the views and food were delicious. This time we arrived at 8pm and there were just a couple tables there of people. No music this time (last time it was fabulous) but it was a Thursday. We ordered a few drinks and they came pretty quickly. We also ordered food and that was a problem all together. We ordered a caprese salad, 3 calamari's, seared ahi, 3 kobe burgers, 1 pasta dish, and 1 risotto. 45 minutes later we had only received the ahi. We had some starving folks so we asked if any bread would be available. The waiter was not very friendly with a response and finally said but yes I can get you some. Did not provide any update on how much longer our food would take. Then one person asked to see a wine menu and again the waiter in an unfriendly tone said "why don't you just ask me". My sister-in-law was a bit taken back by the response and quickly tried to figure out what she might want. It seemed like it was a burden to him to get a wine list. He took her order and walked off. I walked in and just picked up a menu for her to look at for her next drink choice. Then 15 minutes later, no wine and no additional food (no appetizers or salads even). Now it's been an hour and we've had not updates, no water refills, not any friendly visits from the waiter at all. Everyone was so hungry and the restaurant was pretty empty (only two other tables)! My husband decided to get up and speak to the waiter. As he did the waiter came with a plate of bread and one caprese salad (why did it take an hour for an uncooked caprese salad?). My husband said, "Whew that was close, we were getting ready to walk out!!". The waiter quickly snapped back "but why?" and that set off a lot of angry hungry people. The waiter continued to argue with no apologies at all for the length of time it was taking or reasons. All he seemed he could add was "your kobe burgers aren't even ready". (yes....that is our point). He didn't even realize we hadn't received our calamari either. He was so rude and unapologetic it was truly shocking!! My husband asked to see the manager and the waiter said "I kind of am the manager". So my husband said there's no way we can stay here now, we want to pay our bill and leave.  The waiter gave him a bill for $98 dollars. lol it included a bunch of the food we hadn't even received. He fixed it for him in a major huff and saying "here's something you won't be having" in a way that he was trying to make us feel guilty. So awful! We ended up leaving right after to try to find another restaurant. Which in Fountain Hills is very difficult after 9pm. The best we could find was the The All American Sports Grill. We went in sat down and instantly started to have way better service from the staff there than at the Vu. They were actually friendly, smiling and helpful.  We also received food within 10-20 minutes (varied based on appetizers and burgers) and it was still pretty tasty. If Vu would have been friendly, showed a bit of "care" in their attitude and communicated a bit better I'm sure we would have been patient and waited even though it was taking so long. We just had no idea if it was going to be 5 minutes more or 45 minutes more. Really ridiculous and a huge disappointment as I had high hopes for this being one of our favorites in Fountain Hills.

Don't believe its name in Chinese. "Number One BBQ, jook and noodle" restaurant is sure as hell not number one in anything except grossness.BBQ pork was orange in color and had no taste. Roast duck was fatty and unseasoned. Did they truly expect every person to dip the duck into the plum sauce? What if you don't like plum sauce? The ratio of meat to rice was amazingly vast -- 70% rice to 30% meat. We also ordered the wontons in soup -- wontons were not anything special. The accompanying broth was overwhelmingly fishy. When I asked the waitress (in Cantonese) if they accepted credit card, she barked "for a little over $10???? PAY CASH!!!"YES MAAM! I paid and left hurriedly! Never returning.

Restaurant name  Pho Saigon 8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I just got back from a two week trip to Vietnam and was excited to test out Pho Saigon 8 after reading some good reviews from John Curtis.  First, I noticed that some have complained about the service.  It's not prompt, or attentive, but trust me, that's authentic!  In Vietnam servers don't get tipped so they have no reason to be attentive, and there you have to ask for your check... So, if it really is Vietnamese staff working there, expect to have to request your check and realize that it's not rude to approach them.Now for the food!  We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were tasty, although they could have used some more herby additions.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  We split the Pho Tai (thin strips of beef in the beef pho broth).  The pho was good, not the best I've had, but a solid middle of the road.  It was pretty flavorful, add-ins are appropriate (giant basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers).  But, what impressed me was that they had the rice crepes that have become my favorite Vietnamese meal!The crepe is made with rice flour (it's a savory crepe, folks), cooked in a pan until a bit crispy, and filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork.  It comes with a fish sauce based dripping sauce that augments this dish wonderfully.  With this meal (which appears in the appetizer section, but I use as a main course) comes a giant plate of ruffage.  The proper execution is to take a lettuce leaf, cut off a chunk of the crepe + filling, and use the lettuce leaf as a wrap to make your own little spring roll out of it.  Add in the carrot, some kind of other root vegetable, and mint that they provide.  The rolls are cool and crunchy on the outside, warm, crunchy, and flavorful on the inside.  Don't forget the dipping sauce, it's well worth it.Most Vietnamese restaurants in town don't extend past pho and some stir-fried rice dishes, and maybe a "clay pot" type dish if you're lucky.  This rice "crepe" will keep me coming back for more, yum!I came here for lunch with several co-workers. The weather is cold and what better time than that to get some pho. We came around noon since my coworker mentioned they get pretty busy. The decor is nice and they keep the place pretty clean. I wasn't in a soup eating mood, so I decided on a vermicelli bowl. My other coworker ordered some eggrolls to share and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they had a nice crunch. My vermicelli bowl was a little lackluster. I usually enjoy all the nice crunchy vegetables that are included and this one just included a few leaves of lettuce and some sprouts. Definitely not what I had hope for. The pork and shrimp were ok, but definitely not one of best bowls I've encountered. Since they are the closest pho place to work, I'll probably give them another shot, but I'll try their pho next time. The prices are a little on the high side, but I guess that's pretty typical for the Henderson area. For now, I can't give them much beyond three stars.Table for 1...dinner was less than $10 bucks + $2 dollar tip!Ordered & enjoyed one of their Pho Bo (rice noodle w/ beef broth) soups.#18 Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach - noodle w/ rare eye round, flank, brisket, tendon & tripe. It was good. (see photos)I asked for Banh Mi as an appetizer, but the server said they don't offer any sandwiches.Nice artwork on the walls, including several unique roll up window shades that have beautiful waterfalls silk screened on them. (see photos)I'll be back again!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #211

Review Text :
This is another 3.5 star restaurant on Yelp that I feel is a little more deserving of 4 - 4.5 stars rather than the 3.5 it actually has. As you can see by my checkins, I've been here a couple times. I started coming here right before they moved. I was actually quite worried because I had fallen in love with one of their dishes and was told by my waiter that the restaurant was closing for remodeling in a week and they weren't sure if they would even have a Marinelli's at the M Resort anymore. Just my luck! And whatever they were putting there was top secret and even staff wasn't privy to what was happening. I was so bummed because I had finally found a place where I could get my pasta with vodka sauce craving in check, as evidenced by the Yelp tip I left here & now, in the blink of an eye, everything was all in limbo. Well... what ended up going down was that they remodeled the old Marinelli's spot and gave that space to the new Jayde Fuzion restaurant and moved Marinelli's to where the old Anthony's Oyster Bar once was & renamed it Marinelli's Pasta Bar. I was pleased to see that I didn't lose my beloved restaurant after all! I have major issues with losing a faved place to order Penne ala Vodka ever since Ago in the Hard Rock closed down. I still have yet to recover from that whole experience and have been searching high and low for a similar place to get my fix ever since. So... I always order the same thing here. I get the Penne ala Vodka off the menu but then I get all high maintenance on them and have them add prosciutto (to make it like the dish I fell in love with at Ago) along with roasted garlic slices & crushed red pepper flakes. I recommend my fave concoction with a glass of the Prisoner wine. I also really enjoy their Caprese Salad.Service is excellent here... Particularly if you sit at the bar. The seating is very comfortable and there's plenty of room, so you aren't giving up anything by sitting at the bar as opposed to a table. Plus, if you need anything, there are at least two chefs right there cooking in front of you that you can ask as well as your waiter.I must say a big thank you to the M Resort for keeping Marinelli's around. I am going to keep patronizing their restaurant for as long as I am eating carbs. :)

SW corner of W Sahara Ave & Torrey Pines inside Sinclair(Formerly it was located on Jones between Spring Mtn & Desert Inn-right out front of the old Boston Bar & Grill.)You can smell the BBQ from a block away, they cook on an open pit bbq so you can see it & smell it before you even get out of the car.I have been trying to try this place ever since I saw it reappeared in this gas station.It's only open Tues-Saturday.Sandwiches are 2 for 1 so I got a HOT link & pulled pork-coleslaw & chili for sides.$10!! What a deal!John the owner/operator is quite a character-very friendly and he takes great pride in his work.The pulled pork was great, nice & smoky with a little crunch from being grilled.The HOT link was one of the best I've had at any BBQ joint. REAL Spicy.The coleslaw was ok & the chili was meat & beans -NOT red chili or verde with any tomato or peppers, but it was  a very nice change-a kind of BBQ chili-smoky with al dente beans. I'll go back & try the ribs & tri-tip next time.

I wanted to bring in lunch for clients who requested Famous Dave's. There were a total of 6 of us and this was the first time I had visited this location. For delivery the order needs to be a minimum of $150.00 so I called my order in for the All American Feast the day before and advised the staff I would pick up at 11:30 amI arrived just after they opened at 11:00 am and went into the bar area where the waitress was very helpful. Within ten minutes my order was ready to go and they included paper plates and utensilsThe lunch included a full slab of St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a whole Country-Roasted Chicken, 1/2 lb. of Texas beef brisket, creamy coleslaw, famous Dave fries, Wilbur beans, six pieces of fresh sweet corn and four Corn Bread Muffins. I added on to my order an additional two pints of sides - beans, slaw, 2 corn muffins and 6 cans of sodas. The food was put on a large tray with the exception of the sides which were packed efficiently. The food was a hit and tasty. Ribs were smoked and tender, brisket was yummy and chicken flavorful and moist. The sides were solid and the extra pints weren't even touched BC we had so much food. Actually the platter fed a total of 7 and was a great choice.My clients were happy, since it's difficult for entire staff to get out of the office and I was able to secure some orders! I would definitely use Famous Dave's BBQ in the future for lunch to go.

Country Diner alert!!  All your breakfast  and lunch diner favorites !  We have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like.  Well we wonder no more.  For lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an Oklahoma Diner , I could almost see my  country country cousins stopping by this place.  The menu is full of classic sandwiches like French Dip, Monte Cristo, Hamburgers and other American Sandwich Staples.  The menu is big on Breakfast and has lots of Omelettes to chose from .They even mark all the low carb items so you for those South Beachers it's a little easier. For starters Linda our server was instantly like family, she was sweet and kind . I love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , "So Sammy what are we having today?" Linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations  .She even warned us about the size of portions and boy she wasn't kidding. Linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service. We noticed in this small establishment  there  were four servers , whoa that's rare these days. I had the avocado Omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa  but I never asked for any either. The hash browns were not my favorite style  more mashed than chunky but you decide. You can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast. Plus One( husband) had the  Prime rib and eggs breakfast which he couldn't finish. The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch! The decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only.hobo eggs dish = ridiculous. My waiter warned me that it was "alot of food". I thought, ok, it's gonna be a big plate of food.I was wrong, way wrong. It's not a big plate of food, it is a MOUNTAIN of food! http://twitpic.com/awqxk A tasty mountain of hashbrowns, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers & eggs, with the majority of it being hashbrowns. This behemoth of a serving had me shocked & joyed. Crazy Otto's made my day yesterday. I'll be eating leftovers all week.While I reserve the right to upgrade this my gut is 3.5 stars rounded down Thanks yelp. Service: 5 stars, granted there were only us and 2 others for a short time. The staff was great and friendly. Food: 2.5 Stars, I had a burger and knew that it was not going to be the best burger ever but decided to try it anyway. They Flat Grill (fry) a hand pattied 1/2lb burger and serve it with mayo, mustard, 1000 Island, let and tom. While it was not over cooked it was too thin to cook med rare. The flavor was ok but there was no seasoning at all on it. The fries needed salt desperately also. There was a small and I mean small cup of what appeared to be coleslaw.. wow it was bad. Building: 3 Stars Clean open, plenty of light. Looked nice to me. I WILL be back for some breakfast.

Review Text :
I have never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but I am officially converted!! Let me start by saying the Gyro house has the best chicken gyro I've ever had!I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that aesthetically, this place is not something to look at. It's located in a small strip mall and the restaurant itself is not the fanciest. However, it definitely has character. It looks like your run-of-the-mill small, local business. The owner was in the store when I went in, and he was super friendly and I received great customer service.Now for the good part... the food! I ordered a chicken gyro with french fries. Both were delish! The chicken was very tender and was served on the fluffiest pita bread I've ever tasted. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion (which I picked off), and tzaziki sauce. I paid about $7.50 for my meal, and it was definitely worth every penny. If you're a fan of a great gyro, this is the place for you!

Update of the Update. They are still charging me for my food. Which I didn't get. Because this is the SANDWICH SHOP that ran out of BREAD! NOT COOL. Didn't want to have to do the CHARGEBACK but since they want to be dicks about it, time to do that and contact Corporate. Hey Yelp, I wish we could give out NEGATIVE STARS....********************************************Unfreakinbelievable. I go through the hassle of online ordering....it's a hassle since their crappy online page uses Flash it blocks iOS devices from ordering. So I go online with the laptop, place my order, get in the car to head out and get a call: Sorry, we're out of bread and we closed the store an hour ago!ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?I have never, EVER had anyone cancel an online order on me, and when a sandwich shop can't even keep their most basic item, bread, in stock, then they've got a damn problem. Venting my frustration even more.... I finally got a whole group of people to figure out what they wanted to eat and jump through a byzantine crappy website only to get told sorry...we can't get our head out of our rear end enough to order enough damn bread....Oh and they want me to come by the store to process the debit card refund sometime tomorrow...I have a damn job, I don't have time to come back and deal with stupidity. Refund? How about I pick up the phone and yell CHARGEBACK to my credit card company tonight instead! Placement on my Jackassery! list is about as guaranteed as it gets. I don't do stupid and clueless, and especially not when social media lets me light you up over it. And this experience was an example of both.

I'm just going to say "ditto" to Alan L's review.  It's because of his detailed review that we knew to order outside and to bring cash.  So thank you, Alan!  The Hut is a great little Chicago-style joint that took me right back, not to Chicago, but to Hot Dog Heaven in Orlando, which has been ranked in the top hot dog places in the country.  We got a polish dog, a combo with sausage and beef, chili cheese fries, and a bottle of water for something like $13.90.  GREAT dogs, low prices, friendly staff, and excellent chili cheese fries.  We sat outside so we wouldn't have to look at any Cubs gear.  (GO CARDS!)  I'm sorry it's in Gilbert, but make the drive.  It's worth it.

I just need to start off this review by stating that I worked in a Cajun / Creole restaurant for half my life.When I arrived it was pretty empty so I had time to chat up the bartenders. I started talking to them how I worked in a Cajun/Creole restaurant and they warmed up to me real fast. They started recommending everything that was popular and their own favorites. I started with the Seafood Gumbo. Fresh seafood, nice thick veggies and a great roux base. Served with a piece of french bread. * Now they use Leidenheimer bread which is a New Orleans staple. Not my favorite because it has to be served fresh within a day or two. But this placed seemed like they had that under control*  Next I tried a side of the Red Beans and Rice. You really got the flavor of the   smoked ham hocks and Abita beer. With some local smoked andouille sausage. Chalk this one up to a win! For my main course I had the Catfish Po Boy. Now they do this right. You can get it dressed, (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and red onion) or naked and you can choose you sauce, (mayo, tartar, remoulade or cocktail.) The hand cut fries that came with it? Just stop right now. You won't find any better than this. For dessert, yes I was not full, or just did not care, I had the Creme Brulee. By know means am I a dessert snob but I have tried a lot of different ones and this one was good. It had a good custard / pudding texture and the sugar was browned, not burnt. A nice portion sizing as well. Now the best part of the review? The beer. Sweet baby alcohol gods the beer!! They have Abita, and lot's of it. So many choices you will not know what to do. They even had a nice selection that was no longer in season so they were hard to find. 12 oz. and 22 oz. bombers. If you have never had Abita get your butts down there for the drink alone. They also had a great selection of cocktails. \This place really blew my mind. I cannot stress how great this place is, how friendly the bartenders are, and how tasty the food is... and all of it is well presented to, because we all know you eat with your eyes first.Another Saturday afternoon and here I am at The Bayou again. Happily, the have one of my davorite beers on tap again....Abita's Grapefruit IPA!! This pairs so well with the grilled oysters that I specifically made the trek all the way from 'the land beyond the beltline' for. Unfortunately,  the Grapefruit IPA is a seasonal beer, and it's been on tap for two weeks already, so how much longer they'll have it is anyone's guess. I debated whether to even tell y'all about it, since that means more for me while it's here, but being a good Yelper, there it is. All the food I've had here has been excellent but the oysters are always my go to. Whether you get 'em fresh on the half-shell, grilled, or 'dirty' (in a shot of vodka), you will not be disappointed. Make sure you get here for Fat Tuesday! The most fun celebration in Madison and they serve AMAZING beignets!! (which are served freshly made year round!)Do yourself a favor, take a Saturday afternoon and make the trip to New Mad-orleans!

Second off, do not follow the directions on google maps on the phone. Because it says that it's behind the palms hotel which is a load of crock. It's actually located on the other side of Wynn Rd. at Chinatown. Towards Spring Mountain Rd. Thirdly, this is not a sit down restaurant. It's a take out deli, but instead of sandwiches they sell POKE! They have ahi poke and tako poke, all made fresh daily! I was able to try the Limu ahi poke, shoyu ahi poke and the tako limu poke! All were so good. My favorite of the three was the shoyu poke...but next time I'm trying the spicy garlic poke! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=o6i23tiQnEs6Z2KMvx91egah...poke! Poke! POke! POKe! POKE! POKEEEEE!I didn't even know this was here until Yelp. I've been craving poke and decided to try this new place out. There isn't a inside seating, but outside there are some stone tables and benches. It was way too hot today so the inside of the car was our lunch table.The BF and I got about half a pound of each:Garlic Ahi poke- pretty good. Good garlic flavor and I like the two kinds of onions in it plus green onions. We asked for a little spice and there was pieces of chilies thrown in it. Wasabi Ahi Poke- this had a creamy sauce base, onions and a bit of green onion. This was no joke wasabi. I complain that most wasabi poke just mix a tiny bit for flavor into some shoyu and call it a day. I like that they aren't afraid to give you wasabi here and I like the creaminess, BUT this was seriously overpowering. I love wasabi, but this was my nasals and eye ducts were burning at every bite experience. Even with taking bites with the other poke and some rice it was a bit much so I tried to scrape some of the cream off. Maybe gonna ask them to go a little lighter next time and mix.Limu Ahi Poke- fairly good, but lacking something for me..I should have asked for a little dab of shoyu to open up the flavor. For those who love the bits of limu- they are generous about putting a lot here. Poke is $10.95 and can be ordered in sizes as small as a 1/4th container to a big ol' bucket. I got a package of rice ($2) to go with the poke. We also got some Arizona Green Teas and I've never seen "Extra Sweet" version of it but they have that here... (is that a Hawaiian thing?). For dessert, some LiHingMui covered peach gummis ($1.75) from their small selection of Hawaiian snacks. I am a big fan of Poke Express (Craig Rd.)  and they are compared all the time on reviews. After trying it here, I would say they are different. The fish is about the same freshness and the way they season their poke isn't even close to being the same so it's about taste preference. Taste preference wise, I think I learn towards Poke Express overall. However, I think this place is good so I want to try more of what they have to offer and revisit a lighter version of the wasabi.Great little poke in the City of Sin!This tiny little place located in the China Town area of LV, is pretty tough to find if you don't pay close attention while driving down Wynn Rd... Once you are here, you will notice that the place is small, unattractive, and simply plain in overall appearance including the cold counter where they they "hold" the pre-marinated pokes...So why did I give it a 4 stars?1)  Flavor!  Love their Spicy Mix Ahi Poke!  Spicy mayo mix all combined with fresh ahi, sesame, green onions and red onions may this poke super delicious!  (Reminded me of those that were in Maui)2)  Freshly made!  Yes... there's not much in the counter, however, all items can be made to order!  Just tell the owner and he will be more than happy to whip some up for you quickly!  And of course, FRESH TOO!!!3)  Decent price!  Price actually cost slightly less than Maui!  So I'm happy to pay for more delicious ahi!4)  Friendly service!  Owner is real cool, real chill, and very nice overall!They have many other varieties of poke to choose from, so I'm sure there is a flavor that suit your tastebuds as long as you are a fan of fresh ahi!Next time you are in town, give this place a try as a nice little appetizer to one of your delicious meals in Vegas... and while you are at it, why not take a picture in front of Floyd Mayweather's boxing gym location just around the corner?If they run out of one of the pokes they will make it to order for you! they make a small batch at a time so the food doesn't sit out. bare bones kind of place so just swing by to pick some up. most everything is $15/lb - pricey if you're coming from LA (bc poke is trendy and everywhere there) but worth it once in a while bc there aren't many legit poke places in Vegas - and none near me.

Food Express=The food here was surprisingly good! I arrived to my room at the Palace Station Hotel/Casino, dropped off my stuff then hit the gym for an hour and a half. I worked up a pretty good appetite so I stopped by the Chinese restaurant in the Casino and ordered the beef chow fun with gravy to go. I have to give it to this place, it was a lot better than I had expected it would be. There was plenty of beef and chinese broccoli in it and tasty ho fun noodles all stir fried with a thick gravy. Delish!I totally recommend stopping by here and checking it out if you're around this casino.
Nicks Deli and Pizza=Our kitchen is torn apart, in the middle of a renovation. So last night, there we were again, hungry, and no way to cook. Delivery choices are limited in our area, unless you want pizza or Chinese. We were pretty burnt out on both. But decided to go for pizza. I sifted through our stack of menus, and came across one for a place we'd never ordered from - Nick's.I was pleased to find that, in addition to pizza, they offered pasta dishes, hot and cold subs, salads, and cheesesteaks for delivery. Score!  We ordered a meatball sub, a cheesesteak, and a caesar salad. Delivery was fairly timely (way better than the 45 minutes Streets of New York delivery!). The goods were a pleasant surprise as well.The caesar salad was HUGE! The round to-go container was jam-packed with romaine lettuce, parm, and croutons. Dressing was served on the side. Thank goodness for that, because we tucked right into the subs first, and were way too stuffed for salad afterwards. That left me with a huge salad to take to lunch the next day. The subs were on a soft on the inside, crusty on the outside roll. The meatballs were nice and juicy, and with good flavor. You could tell it was made with mixed meats (ideally, beef, pork, and veal), as a good meatball should be made. The cheesesteak, on the other hand, was OK. The meat was rather salty, but otherwise good. That tab wasn't too bad either - around $22. I would definitely order from them again.
Cafe 24/7="Ugh... I'm done!" I said as I wiped away my tears. I've had enough of a certain friend of mine who had talked shit to me for the last time. My sister, feeling my pain suggested that we go where every saddened Indian Girl goes when feeling bad... the nearest Indian Casino!! WHOO!! Well... okay, maybe not the nearest Indian Casino... but the one across the freeway and down the road... the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino. When we go into the Nuevo riche diner... I was surprised by how shiny it all was! There were deli cases showing off desserts that looked meh and these pedestals that showcased modern Native Art... but it didn't mesh well with the decor of the place. The dining room was big and the tables were very well spaced apart.We were escorted to our table, sat down and looked over the menu trying to decide the best way to cap off the night. The menu contained all American favorites in all their greasy goodness. Think of the Late Night Denny's menu but sans the moon over my hammy and you'll be dead on. Were told that Alan (or Alec?) was our waiter and would be by soon to take our drink order. So we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited! The last time I waited this long for a friggin' drink order it was because the bar was being danced on by stripper wannabes getting their Coyote SURE Ugly on!!  Yeah, I'll wait for the clear-heeled ones to vacate the bar... sure, why not? But this was NOT the case at Cafe 24/7. Not wanting to wait around in this crazy color changing world... oh yeah - did I tell you about the colors?! OMG! These damned lights in the ceiling keep changing!! Like from green to yellow to blue to pink to clear and back again!! It's not even a gradual change either!! It's a sudden change and the moment my eyes get used to the new hue, the color changes again! It was distracting and annoying especially when looking at the huge multi-screen TV behind the deli case that for some reason was set to channel 12 and displayed everything in green! But anyway... I digress... I got up and went to the deli case and told two employees that we have been waiting for a very long time. I learned that the staff is very good at apologizing and the hostess took over our table. We ordered and got our food very fast. Okay now the food...Our sampler appetizer that came with potato skins, chicken tenders, onion rings and mozzarella sticks were good and light and crunchy and crispy and nothing was over done or soggy. I was happy and surprised. I don't know why, but I always expect casino food to be bad food. The next round was our entrees. I ordered the Angus burger with cheese and bacon and this half pound bad boy had too much bacon on it!! I shared with the sis who was happy to receive it to go on her Turkey Sandwich, more on that in a second. My burger was cooked well and was fresh as was the toppings and bun. I was delighted but I wasn't happy with having to pay extra for French fries, seriously - it should just come with it. At the other Gila River Casinos, fries come with everything. Boo on Café 24/7 on this faux pas. My sister's turkey sandwich was awesome! It was piled high with nice... real... turkey! Lol! Like, someone took a knife to the bird minutes before it hit our table. No pre-packaged water logged sodium filled meat product here! We ate and I tried to laugh and get my mind off of the night's drama. When we were approached by the Café's manager, he informed us that the café is actually owned by the same company that is associated with Chase Stadium and not the Casino's usual food and beverage department. He also slightly chuckled when I tried to seriously complain about the long wait at the beginning of our meal. *sigh* just like a man huh? Oh well...To my Yelpers: all in all - if you're on that side of town and it's late... like really late and you're over 21 and the thought of going to Denny's by the freeway seems too disgusting for words... feel free to go to Café 24/7. The food options are the same but it's done so much better. The service might be shit like ours was, but get up and to go the deli, complain and you should be alright. I say go but don't go out of your way to go. Oh and leave your rose-colored glasses at home! Cuz the color changing throughout your meal might make your eyes bleed! I'll give it one more try before I die... but just one.
Paradise Cafe=After going to the Secret Garden to see the new white lion cubs, I stopped here for lunch when I found out that you could go here even if not a guest of the hotel. I was promptly seated with a good view of the pool area and the waterfall there.  No sooner than I sat down, my server Cathy arrived with a tall ice water.  She also broguht me an iced tea that I wanted. I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich and I mentioned that I could always take half the wrap home with me.  Cathy pointed out it was a ciabatta sandwich.  I asked her if they could do it as a wrap and she replied that she didn't see where that would be a problem.  For a side, I got fries.The wrap was excellent, filled with much turkey and bacon and the fries were a good accompaniment.  I did not get dessert.  Instead, I got a to go box and took half the wrap and some fries home.It was so pleasant sitting there and watching the tourists--one of my favorite things to do in this wonderful city!  Even though the temperature was in the high 90s, the outdoor restaurant was pleasant.  They have a very good misting system.Since I have a year's pass to the Secret Garden, I think I'll stop more often during pool season when I go to visit the animals.
New Gyro House=So this place is in a gas station. So there's that. But overlook the smell of fumes as you order and I have to tell ya, it's pretty solid. The woman ringing me up was DELIGHTFUL. I couldn't help but feel good cramming gyro and french fries in my face due to her pleasant disposition. It takes a bit longer but that's because everything is cooked to order. The menu is extensive, a weird compilation of southern and Chicago style (dogs, beef, gyro). I felt like the price was fair for the amount of food, about 8 bucks for a gyro pita and fries, and I liked that the meat was actually juicy. I do wonder if they're slicing it from a rotating deal or just heating it up, but I was also so hungry, it didn't matter as I scarfed it down.
Da Lat=This is a really small Vietnamese restaurant run and operated by mostly the members of a Vietnamese family.  The dad works in the kitchen, the daughters work the front (waitress, busser, cashier).  Counting the number of seats available, the capacity is probably 34 at the most.The menu is full of pictures to help you with ordering, if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  The price is pretty reasonable, not the cheapest and probably not the most expensive by off-Strip Vietnamese restaurant standards.Most items are under $10.Their Chicken Wings (comes with 3) is pretty good. It has nice flavor and has crispy exterior.  It is served with some salt and pepper, which you are supposed to squeeze some lime juice to form a very traditional Vietnamese condiment.  I think the chicken is good on its own, but the salty citrus flavor gives it a new depth of flavor.I also tried their combination pho on this visit.  The broth was good, on the mild flavor side, but not greasy (I like that!).  The tendons that was in my bowl was very soft, indication that it was simmered for hours to get that nice texture.  The herbs and bean sprouts served with the pho is also very very fresh. It is just a minor detail, but it is all of the little things done right that makes something as pedestrian as pho to be elevated to the next level.  Gotta love that.And I was told by one of my friend that this little restaurant is considered the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas by other Vietnamese!  And after trying some of their food, I can see why.  I will definiately be back for the delicious food and friendly service.I went here once before my yelping days and never went back. But groupon had a deal for $8 for $16, and the budget savvy person in me just could not resist.So I went and told them I had a groupon. They asked me for the coupon and no issue at all. It was one waiter in the place and he was actually very on top of his job. He made sure that I was doing okay and had everything I needed. However, I just wasn't feeling the place. I was quickly reminded once I started eating why I never came back.special combo pho with extra tendon - The noodles were just too soft. Way too soft, I felt like they were extra soft for a child or senior citizen. That is the best way I can explain it. The broth wasn't bad,  but it just had this flavor to it that I wasn't fond of. papaya salad -  I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. It was just plain shredded papaya mixed with shredded carrots and sliced shrimp. They served it with shrimp crackers and the server just told me to use the fish sauce at the table. But I wasn't sure how to use the nuoc cham with it. So I never finished it. I did eat the shrimp crackers though.pork sausage patty roll - probably the best thing I ate. Or maybe not. The sausage looked a little under cooked. Other than that, it was pretty tasty. So in the end, I really wanted to give this place a two but it wasn't horrible. I just didn't care for it. So this should be like a 2.5It's a pretty small place so if you come with a big group it just might be a little crowded. The restroom is back in the kitchen. Just a little uncomfortable for me.Here is an interesting piece about Da Lat. When I first moved here to Las Vegas, after driving for 3 days and over 2000 miles, Da Lat was the first restaurant I ever ate at in this fare city. I thought it was one of the best pho's I've ever had, and ever since then, it has always been in my top 3.Over the next several years, I've had the opportunity to come back here on several occasions. The Vietnamese crepe, bun bo hue, and every other items that I've tried were some of the best that I've ever had!Well, I came here the other day wanting to recreate some of my past experiences here. I noticed on yelp that they have new hours, and they are open until 4am, when they used to close a lot earlier. And I came in at 2am. When I walked in, I noticed that they had done a complete makeover of the place. It had turned into a more sleek and modern vibe, rather than the previous mom n' pop feel. The waiter told me that even though the restaurant went through a renovation, the owners are still the same owners.After scanning their menu I noticed that the prices are still the same, which is good because I thought Da Lat always gave great value for what you got. But, it looks like they have taken their awesome crepe off the menu.. Darn!! So I decided to go with the pho.Combo beef pho - the broth is still as good as I remember, you can taste the beef flavor as well as the spices commonly used in a good broth. The meatballs and brisket was good and plentiful. I can't remember if there is any rare beef that is supposed to come with the combo, but I didn't receive any and I don't have a menu with me to check.So here is the big reason that this is not a 5 star review. They brought out the traditional accompaniments for the pho; bean sprouts, Thai basil, and sliced jalapeños. The bean sprouts were turning brown, limp, slightly slimy and smelled off. The basil was dried up. And, the jalapeños had a dried up as well, noticing the white on the outside. I made the mistake of adding these items to my great soup, and it ruined everything. I've never had this problem before, but I usually have come in at earlier times, when the husband and wife are in the kitchen...I would come back here, but probably at an earlier time. I don't know who is working the menu at late-night, but they need to be trained on what is acceptable and not acceptable to send out to the customers. Oh, and bring back the crepe!!
Cadillac Ranch=Came here last night with a friend who was in town. I didn't want to go thru the hassle of going to a club on the strip, and I've seen this place before in passing, so this was the pick of the night. We got there a little early (around 10) so there was no line. There was also no cover which was nice and it didn't look like there was any dress code, but most people looked decent which kept the respectability of the place. There a several bars, A BUNCH of tv's always on a sports game/espn (ya!) and a mechanical bull, which is always fun to watch. I didn't eat the food, and from the others reviewers of this place, i don't think i ever will. The prices for drink were a little on the expensive side so I'm pre-partying next time. A few dance floors, DJ, bottle service (from what I was told) was about $200, which is pretty good. Alot of cougars last night. I mean ALOT. bachelor parties, and whatever else you can think of. definitely a diverse crowd. Truth be told the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because somewhere in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about how this place reminds me of a more classy version of saddle ranch at citywalk in Hollywood (which is not a good look). Its a little off the strip, so if you get tired of dealing with the politics of place on the strip and wanna go for something different, this is your place.Hitting up Cadillac Ranch just in time for their Happy Hour!  As advertised, it's Mondays through Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm - half off all drinks and half off appetizers.  (It's actually $7 select appetizers, but half off all drinks still!)We ordered a couple of drinks off their cocktail menu: * Pear...fect 59 Cadillac "Enjoy our signature cocktail made with Grey Goose La Poire and fresh pear puree." ($10) - We were surprised to see it arrive in a martini glass, something to think about if you're expecting a pint glass.  It was sweet and you can definitely taste the pear puree.* Seville "Experience a delightful and refreshing blend of Sauza Hornitos Plata, Citronge, Fresh Mango Puree and Fresh Lime Juice." ($10) - This arrived in a pint glass and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  Decent overall.  We were initially going to order a bunch of their half off appetizers, but changed our minds after we saw their $7 select appetizer menu.  They did offer a Complete Dinner for Two for $29.95 from Mondays to Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm.  (Add 2 Well Drinks - $34.95)  You can choose one select appetizer to share, one select entree each, and one select dessert to share.* Kettle Chips "Thinly sliced potatoes deep fried to perfection and served with garlic cream sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Finished with a Balsamic drizzle and scallions." - A hearty portion of tasty potato chips with a yummy creamy garlic sauce and a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles.* Candied Pecan Pork Chop "One thick-cut chops grilled and crusted with candied pecans.  Served over caramelized onion mashed potatoes and green beans." - Their regular entree course includes two pork chops, but you only get one in the dinner special.  A nice crust on that pork chop.* Bourbon Sirloin Steak "8 oz. beef sirloin seasoned and broiled to perfection, then placed on a demi glaze.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans." - The regular entree course is a 10 oz cut.  Ours was also served with corn.  * Strawberry Fried Cheesecake - Only available on the dinner special.  Asked the waitress about it and she couldn't say much beyond that she really liked it.  She didn't think it was deep-fried since it wasn't oily.  It's actually a flaky pastry with the cheesecake mixture inside and covered with cinnamon sugar.  Served with a strawberry sauce and cream.Food and service were okay, nothing special.  The busboys were quick about clearing out the dishes as they needed.  We probably wouldn't eat or drink here without it being happy hour or they were offering a special.  Some specials they are offering: Sundays: Salsa Night, 8 pm to close with a salsa instructor from 9 pm to 10 pm$3 Corona and Corona Light (from 9 pm to close)$5 House Margaritas and Cadillac Margaritas (from 9 pm to close)Mondays: Kids 12 and under eat free, from 11 am to 10 pm with purchase of any full priced entree, free bull rides for all kidsCame here last night to meetup with a large group of people to watch the USC vs Hawaii game on the patio.  Our group made arrangements to have the patio to ourselves during the game.I've been here once before and didn't like it, but came here anyway because of the group get together.  The service all night long was atrocious.  Here's the breakdown:Our server gave my table a menu, but failed to mention that even though it wasn't Happy Hour, you could still order from the Happy Hour menu but pay full price for the items.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I thought I overheard someone at the table next to us order Nachos....I scoured the menu looking for them but didn't find it....so I assumed that I was hearing things and we proceeded to order a Pepperoni Pizza and a Mushroom Lover's Pizza.While we were waiting for our food, our glasses of Wine & Beer went empty....then our Water glasses went empty.  We had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each time.....this went on throughout the night.  They brought out the Pepperoni Pizza and we started to devour it....thinking the Mushroom Pizza was still being prepared, I didn't ask about it at the time.  Meanwhile, a huge plate of Nachos gets delivered to the table next to us....what the hell?!  Then another table next to us gets Nachos too!  So, I asked our server....."Where is Nachos on the menu?".....she says "It's on the Happy Hour menu, since it isn't Happy Hour they are $9, do you want to order one?"....I say "Well, if we didn't already order a Mushroom Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza, I would have ordered Nachos".....she says "What Mushroom Pizza?  All I have is a Pepperoni Pizza for you."......now I'm pissed....I told her to put in the order for Mushroom Pizza.  I asked how they knew about the Happy Hour menu and she said that they asked for it.....that's crazy....how are people suppose to know to ask about something they are unaware of?The 2nd Pizza came out after a while, but what a disaster for service all night. The Pizza was good...not great.  The Pepperoni didn't have enough flavor.  The Mushroom Pizza was far from a "Mushroom Lovers" Pizza....very few Mushrooms.  I expected more Mushrooms.  I would have rated the food 3 Stars.Will I return?  Unfortunately, it looks like our group wants to meet here for games all year long, so if I want to hang out with them, I'll return.  Next time I'll eat before I arrive.After a really crappy visit to Cadillac Ranch a couple of weeks ago, I stopped by here to watch a college football game with some Alumni friends this past Saturday.  Because they chose this place, I didn't have a say in where to go....but decided to give it another shot.The experience was a 180 degree change from the last one.  Even though it wasn't Happy Hour, the server had Happy Hour menus out.....which is great because the items on the HH menu are not on the regular menu....I don't care if I have to pay full price.I ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.The Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.Will I return?  While I don't prefer this place, it's the official spot to watch games for our Alumni Club, so I'll be back soon I'm sure.
La Reyna Mexican Restaurant & Mariscos=Had to take care of some stuff in this part of town that I have never had any reason to visit.. On the way home, I spotted this place and had a sudden craving for a Mexican Seafood platter.Mojarra Al Mojo De Ajo: A Whole Fried Tilapia sauteed in garlic  sauce and topped with more garlic sauce. Comes with beans, rice, salad green chile sauce and fresh handmade tortillas.  - The fish was fried perfrectly and tasted fresh from the sea, the garlic sauce was no joke (smothered with Garlic!) and extremely strong but I loved it, the green chile sauce was intensified with spices/heat but did not linger (Very nice!)- Rice and Beans were typical and satisfying- The Tortillas were Mesmerizing!! There is Absolutely No Comparison with store bought tortillas and their handmade tortillas served here.Carne Asada Taco: Litlle diced meat, very soft, not much flavor but their red chile sauce, cliantro and onions, especially the handmade tortilla made it a success.The Price was inexpensive for portion and taste, Place was decored surprisingly vibrant and server was helpful and kind. Would come here more often if it was closer!
Pho 87=Another review from an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) where we had 4 participants who accepted the Pho Challenge that day (Jen S., Bobby Y., James A., and Robert R.) out of our party of 20+ diners.We gathered at the two tables to the right, at the front of the restaurant near the fish tank with the lone gigantic fish (who I think has been eating too much pho during its lifetime).  It's a pretty simple menu, with pho prices ranging from $7-8 for a small, $8-9 for a medium, $9-10 for a large.  And of course, we can't ignore the gigantic bowl for $30 (if you can't finish it in the allocated time).  At a first glance, I would say it's a bit pricier here for standard pho.  The better value is to go for the large pho portions, and then it's not as expensive.  (I think it's probably a better value for two people to share a large, but the waitress strongly discourages sharing pho since it changes the temperature of the soup, etc. etc.)The Husband went for the $10 large bowl of oxtail soup pho.  It's a pretty big bowl with lots of oxtail meat present, so I think he definitely got his bang for his buck.  Whereas I went for one of the regular pho bowls, size small for $7, and it was just okay.  The meat portions are on the smaller end. I'm used to seeing larger cuts of rare beef, but that wasn't the case here.  Also, my soup was just warm and the Husband concurred the same about his broth.I also got to try two variations of their spring rolls - the shrimp and pork ones.  I liked the shrimp ones better since they grilled the shrimp prior to putting it in the wrapper.  The pork ones were just okay.The waitress was a bit anxious with trying to figure out how many people were going to compete, and it was pretty early on when we told her it was going to be four.  She said the cook needed to know how much meat to cut up.  Everyone wanted rare beef only in their pho, and she checked with the kitchen to make sure they could do this and they said yes.  I did ask her if she could serve the competitors first since they had 87 minutes to eat, and the rest of us could get our food last.  In the end, everyone else got their food and finished it long before the four competitors even saw their bowl of pho.  This was definitely not an efficient use of time at all and I think it also affected those who were competing. When the challenge bowls of pho did arrive, it definitely looked like it was more noodles than beef.  It's supposed to be 1.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of noodles, and broth.  The broth isn't such a high priority to finish since she said that by the end, there's usually not that much broth left anyway.  It was super hot when it arrived too.  (Guess that's where all the hot broth went!)  James A. came really close to finishing and he even brought his leftovers home (and finished them).  Word is that him and Robert R. might go for round two!   Pho 87 is a pretty large restaurant from the other Vietnamese restaurants in town, and a bit fancier.  There's a whole set up in the back that makes you wonder if they offer some kind of lunch buffet since they have those self service hot stations.Service definitely makes for an 'interesting' and 'entertaining' experience.  The waitress assigned to us definitely has comments coming from left field that probably are not the most politically correct.  She spent a lot of time discouraging us from participating in the challenge in the beginning, then she encouraged the females in our group to 'give a show' to encourage our male friends who were competing...comments about flashing and fake boobs were included.If you do complete the Pho 87 Challenge, your bowl of pho is free, as well as the bowl.  And she said they'll put your face on a billboard!  She said no one in Las Vegas has completed their challenge yet, but a few from Los Angeles has at their other location.  (Apparently she really wants a " white boy" on the billboard!)It's hard opening yet another pho restaurant in Las Vegas.  Props to them for creating a hook that will bring the customers in.  Not sure if it's enough to make it a regular joint though.This place has big portions, which explains their higher priced menu.  This place is hard to miss, but with the five signs out on the front...  how can you miss this place.  When you go inside you will notice pink sheets of paper with signs stating, "Only order water if you are going to drink it."  and "If our service isn't up to your standards, you should lower them."  Sarcasm at it's best.  So I ordered Pho Ga one time and the owner brought out Pho Tai.  She told me she thought I said, "Pho Tai."   She got upset at me and told me to never speak Vietnamese because I can't speak it.    Wow!  I was somewhat shocked at the service.  I tried to abide by the sign and lower my standards.  The pho bowls are big.  The broth is okay...  the noodles are not the typical noodles that you will find at other pho restaurants.  I decided to give this place another shot.  I forgot how hot it was in there.  The restaurant is big with a weak air conditioner.  There are fans on top of tables to keep you cool, but to make sure your pho stays hot.I took my friend here and she harrassed him too.  Questioned the way he ate his Pho and told him that he shouldn't put Chinese Ketchup (Hoison) because it ruins the broth.  She also asked him where he usually goes, and she mentioned that her restaurant was better. She didn't stop to comment once either. She came back every couple of minutes to see what he thought about the pho. After leaving, I apologized to my friend and said I don't plan on coming back. If you like big portions...  they definitely have big portions.  If you don't care about the kind of noodles, this place is ok.  If you want to lower your standards in Las Vegas or wherever you are from, you can come here and take pictures of the signs and post them on your wall.Pho - 2 starsService - Lowered the standard to 1Outside Sign Arrangement and Decor -1The Food Network sign fooled me too. $9 for 6 egg rolls. $7 the small sized bowl of pho. Am I at a Vietnamese place? The owner had a wry sense of humor, as evidenced by the signs on the wall. I appreciate her trying to joke around with us. That didn't make the pho taste any better. I couldn't smell any of the spices in the pho. It tasted like canned beef broth with meat and noodles. It wasn't mediocre pho; it was outright bland, tasteless pho. We were also overcharged by $10. The owner said she made a mistake and made some joke about being the only Asian to ever fail math. It seemed a little suspicious to me that she was able to write the correct sum of our charges, but when she added the $4 tax, it somehow became a $14 tax. I'll give her the benefit of doubt, but I'd scrutinize my receipt if I were you.Won't be returning.Saw the billboard and decided to go in and try their pho.  My husband and I decided to split a medium bowl of pho, spring rolls and egg rolls and when we ordered it the lady which we think is the owner/server gave us a look like we're crazy for sharing and started commenting about asian specially vietnamese DO NOT share pho and my husband who's white made a funny comment that we would like to share it because we're not asian!  Well, I'm filipino (100%) and so my husband made that comment to be funny and the server looked at me and said oh that's why I married my white husband because I'm not asian, I took this very offensive and then when we're done I asked her for a to go box and she again made a sarcastic comment abut bringing left over home!  Very RUDE and TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Food is nothing special for me to come back!  I think the owner forgot that there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurant in the valley that she's competing with! Definitely a mistake and waste of money trying out this place.  I will have to just go back and stick with PHO KIM LONG!WHAT THE PHO!I tried this place out months ago and I didnt think it deserved a review. The only reason why im doing this now is because I had a what I thought was a weird dream until I woke up and realized it was a nightmare!Bare with me. So here's my my Nightmare on Pho Street. Me and my wife just happen to be driving down Jones Blvd wondering what to eat for dinner. We see the sign that they were on the food network. Can't go wrong with that right? So we mosy on in and see that it is a nice sized restaurant. I see plenty of tables but only see one person eating soup by herself. Weird because it was around 6:30 dinner time. Out of nowhere this old crazy lookin lady sits us down. I look at the menu and wonder if the prices were in Vietnamese knowing that the US dollar has slipped a little bit. So im thinkin a small bowl of pho and a small bowl of oxtail soup wasnt gonna max out my credit card. All the while the old asian lady was throwing out suggestions like an announcer at a horse track only with a heavy asian accent. "You want try eggrolls?" No thanks. "How bout spring rolls?" No thanks. "You want order drink?" No thanks just water. "You wanna no soda?" Just water.So off she went to go submit our order. I don't know if she was mad or if it was normal because it sounded like she was having some sort of argument with what I assume was the cook. After about 8 minutes she brought out our food. My wife was in the bathroom at the time so I decided to to take the opportunity to photograph our food. All of a sudden the asian lady comes out of nowhere and says "What you doing? You should eat the soup right away. It's good hot!" I explained to her that I was about to take a picture and that I was waiting for my wife to come back. She just gave a "I don't understand confused look." The two stars are for the pho and oxtail soup. I thought it was tasty BUT that's the only positive thing. Since we both ordered small bowls, we weren't hungry any more but at the same time we could have eaten more. Kinda pricey for small bowls too. That and the "Hurry up and buy!" attitude of the old asian lady did not help either. Im not makin fun of her. All that I described was what actually happened.So I guess you can say she was Freddy Krueger and we were the hapless sleeping victims. I don't think I will be coming back. If you want good Pho place at decent prices and better service, I recommend Pho So 1. That's my go to Pho place.Yelp really needs to allow negative ratings.I've been there a total of three times now. The lady watiress/owner, from the first time she TALKED, I already knew she was a rude one. However, it's an Asian place so it's expected. So I ignored her attitude, ignored her snide/not-so-funny comments, and just ate my food because that's what I went for. Plus I always go with a group of 6 or more people so I always have my friends to chat with and make jokes with. That way, her little signs of lowering my standards won't be so annoying. But our recent trip was, by far, the worst. THE WORST. I don't think I've ever been treated this poorly in any Asian restaurant. And trust me, I've been to plenty. I wasn't really feeling all that well and that's why my friends were willing to go to pho instead of the originally planned ramen shop. Bad idea. I think my stomach would've preferred the thick ramen soup. The wait for water/soda: 40+ minutesThe wait for pho: 1 hour and then someThe wait for the food was so long that my stomach had begun hurting before the food got here. And even when the food DID get here, the food did not help cause the damage was already done. So instead of sitting back and relaxing in contentment of a full stomach, I was busy cringing in pain. Who the shit serves pho an hour after the order? So my boyfriend brought me a bottle of vitamin c tablets for me to take prior to everything. It was a new bottle, so all the plastic wrapping and cotton inside was put on the table cause where else are we going to put it? So what did the owner say when she took our orders?"CLEAN UP YOUR MESS PLEASE."THE FUCK, LADY? You think YOU won't have to clean up the mess AFTER we eat? Or what? We eat and WE CLEAN the TABLE FOR YOU BEFORE WE GO? The shit?Needless to say, we didn't tip much and got a sarcastic comment from her because of it. "THANKS FOR THE HUGE TIP!! You're so GENEROUS!" Then she repeated it as we were walking out the door. Why do I have to tip you if you're going to take an hour to bring out pho? ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. LET ME REPEAT. ONE HOUR. I normally can get in and out of a restaurant in one hour, not wait for water and food for an hour. Oh, the food wasn't anything that special either.But yeah, I suppose you can blame us for not leaving asap but I was trying to not to be rude to people and in front of my friends. Normally I don't have a problem with waiting cause we're in a big group and we always have a lot to talk about but this was a little bit too much. It was one of those:Hey, it's a lil long but maybe it'll be here soon. .. toWe've already been here this long -_- might as well.DO NOT COME HERE!!My family and I use to come here years back. I stopped coming after I orders a rice plate and I got really sick from it.  Couple years later (which is now), I wanted to take my boyfriend because he's been wanting to try this place. We walk in the restaurant and the lady just tells us to come over to her. Doesn't say hi or welcome. All she said was "Come here!" We sat down and I look at the menu. First of all, they don't have a lot of selection. Secondly, they are very pricey. Regardless of how "good" their soup is. I don't remember them being THAT pricey. It was $21 for a medium bowl!The lady was very rude and rushing us. My boyfriend asked a few questions and she just answered it carelessly. We then decided to leave because of the bad vibe. We told the lady we'll try it out some other time. She snatches the menus away and says "Well, come back when you have money and eat our good food!" Then, as we walked out, she then turned to the only people there and said "Can you believe that these customers walked out because of our price". I think that's very unprofessional. So, this review doesn't even deserve a star. No customer service at all. All you get is a lady that has some bad attitude. There are other pho places that will treat you better and they're still good. I think this place just blew their heads a little bigger just because they were "featured in the food network". And, I've actually seen that episode and they had 5 minutes of fame, which is nothing. I wouldn't want anyone to get treated the way we got treated. Never coming here and I will tell people not to come here.
Bar Louie=I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!I love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a "scene". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!We escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free "luigi" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. The downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding "specialty cocktails". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and "martinis". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. Food was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!All in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines. I loved the chill, yet upscale, atmosphere.PS - Tuesday is $1 burger night.. maybe someone can make it out there and check out how good these $1 burgers are!!
360 Gourmet Burrito=Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.The lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).The Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.Anyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.Will I return?  No!The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier "I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?"  She said "No" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, "Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.That does it for me, I will never eat here again.Return Factor - 0%Is anybody ever REALLY excited about being stuck eating airport food?  The options are extremely limited, most are unhealthy, and the prices are always significantly higher than you'd find elsewhere with a significantly lower quality of food served.So imagine my surprise when I discovered a 360 Gourmet Burrito shop during a recent 2 hour layover at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'd actually eaten at a 360 Gourmet Burrito restaurant in San Ramon, California (Near San Francisco) and really enjoyed to food there, so I entered this restaurant with high hopes  in spite of their two star Yelp rating with over 60 reviews which would normally have caused me to steer clear.I decided to switch it up and try one of their bowls, and chose the curry bowl with steak that comes sauteed with veggies over rice.  I can't say that it was the best curry bowl I've ever had, but it was still far better than a lot of airport food I've endured.  The steak was not overcooked, the rice was fresh, not starting to dry as if it had been sitting around, and the quantity given was decent.  It was far better than fast food would have been, yet not quite up to my memory of the other 360 Gourmet Burrito location I visited.  All in all, I don't regret having eaten here and would probably do it again if stuck on another layover here.  Better than your average fast airport food.  There wasn't really anywhere inside you could sit down to eat your food, but my plan was to take it back to the gate to eat so that wasn't really an issue for me.
Hurry 4 Curry=I visited Hurry 4 Curry on a Saturday evening for a take away dinner. I believe I visited on their second or third day of operation.I entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean. Having read about the restaurant in the Republic prior to arriving, I immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order. Ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the Indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine.I ordered butter chicken, naan bread and Basmati rice. This came to $8.50. It was a pleasure to see, as is done in many other countries, that the tax was included in the price of each item. While I could have swiped my credit card to pay at the "menu monitor," I chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash register. She also validated my parking in the AZ Center garage. My butter chicken (you can choose naan or rice as a side) was $7.50 and my naan was another dollar, which brought the total cost of my meal to $8.50. Because I was ordering take away, I did not order a drink. I did, however, see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license; presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no "bar" in the quick service space.After a wait of maybe five minutes, I received my food in what one might describe as "higher-quality" Chinese food boxes. The naan bread was wrapped in foil.After a short drive home, I transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner. While the rice was very well cooked (generally fluffy and not clumped together), the naan (as the Republic also reported) was somewhat disappointing. While it was definitely naan and not pita bread, I found my serving to be almost cracker-like in texture and too cool of a temperature. (I assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day. I wonder, though, if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven?) My butter chicken was flavorful, but also rather cool in temperature. Portion sizes were more than adequate.When I visited, the restaurant was empty. Because I hope this restaurant will survive (I think the concept is novel), I sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner. Would I return? Sure. I enjoyed a healthy, filling and flavorful dinner for a fair price. And, when I return, I will be happy to adjust my star rating upwards if some minor improvements have been made.ok so here is the skinny on a place I have been anticipating for quite some time. Hurry 4 Curry is small, basic, and completely neat-o.Ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid for by swiping your credit card. If you want to pay cash, you can do so at the counter. You'll slow things down for sure, think of the visa commercials. They are pending a liquor license right now.The people working there were nice, and offered to help me with the ordering process. Sorry, if you can't figure this out, you need to go off yourself immediately and stay out of the gene pool. The food is premade, and in 5 pots in the middle of the kitchen. When you order, they go get a plate, put some rice and some main dish on it and bring it to you. The food I got was tasty, albeit a bit underspiced. They are planning on staying open until 9pm nightly. I thanked them for their ambitious plans and let them know I hope they don't give up like a lot of places do. If you live in the city, and like this place, I ask you to do the same. It would suck if I got used to this for dinner and they changed to say, 6pm closing.
Archi's Thai Cafe=This is actually my second time here. The first time, we waited ten minutes to be seated at the almost empty restaurant. We eventually gave up before walking two does down to Bachi Burger. I decided to give it another try. I have to say, both food and service are unimpressive at best. I will not be returning.After tonight, i'm increasing my previous visit last month of a 4 star rating to 5 stars!!!!!Tonight the Po Tak soup, pork satay and Panang Curry were all delicious!  Jasmine tea with free refills is something a couple might enjoy sharing, we did!Archi was in the kitchen overseeing his operation. Nice to see he takes ownership to his ownership, so to say; ensuring excellence.Closed on Tuesdays.Open til10pm the other 6 nights.As always...excellent service, impeccably clean restaurant including restrooms, beautiful wood decor, pleasant background music.
Mimita's Cuban Cafe=My youngest daughter and I stopped in here after spotting it as we were driving by with an eye peeled for something for dinner that was:1. Not fast-food.2. Not a chain.I consider Mimita's a find.  Service from our waiter Ty was very good.He answered many questions that my daughter had and helped ease her comfort level about Cuban food.We started with papas rellenas which are essentially big balls of mashed potato that are filled with creole ground beef, rolled in some light coating and fried.  So fried meat n' potatoes.  Tasty.Next we shared a sandwich, the pan con lechon.  It was pulled pork, sauteed onion and mayo in fresh bread.  Also quite tasty and large enough to share.We finished it off by sharing an order of dulce de leche.  Wow. It is not a very large dessert but the 2 of us could barely finish it, it was so rich.  Great caramel flavors with wholesome vanilla and cinnamon, perhaps a hint of rosewater or something else.Prices are good.  Our app, sandwich and dessert cam to about $20.Yes... you can indeed find Cuban food in Arizona; you just have to search for it!  Or join Yelp AZ's International Supper Club - we meet on most third Thursdays of the month and this past week, we met at Mimita's.Standout appetizers for me were the yuca frita and the papas rellenas.  I also had a small "ensalada de tomate y aguacate" (tomato and avocado salad) and went with the "filete de pescado al ajo" (fish fillet sauteed in butter and lots of garlic) for my entree.  Yes, it was a ton of food since the entree also came with rice, beans, and perfectly cooked sweet plantains, but everything was really delicious.  I washed it all down with Mimita's mango iced tea. Warning - the tea is tasty but sweet!Kelly was our server and she was wonderful.  She's got a fabulous Venezuelan accent!  Prices are moderate and portions are healthy.  The restaurant is kid-friendly too... I did bring the baby, but if you're going to do so, note that there is no changing station in the bathroom. Last note: the garlic sauces and dishes are really garlic-y, so be forewarned!
Deejai Thai Restaurant=OK, a few of my foodie friends are obsessed with Deejai and I just didn't get it, well I got it today at lunch. YUMMMMMM. We ordered a lemongrass, ginger beef, green curry chicken, and a spicy ground chicken dish. Of course, I ordered my green curry spicy, it did have a kick but it wasn't as hot as the other dishes on the table. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. A little one star addition for this cute, modern establishment. Deejai also offers a private dining room downstairs that can accommodate up to twenty people and outdoor seating. It's on my radar now.Deejai Thai has stolen a piece of my little Thai-loving heart.... and soul. I've ventured in a few times, on a whim, and have always found something worthy of plate-cleaning. I've ventured in only for dinner but would happily oblige a go at the lunch menu. The location tends to be a bit finicky with parking. Get here for dinner during a 7pm or 9pm movie at The Manor and you'll be hard pressed not to find parking along one of the neighboring streets. I've made the mistake of trying to fight for a parking space in the lot outside. You may find yourself up against a few soccer-mom buses. Savvy? Either way, once you find yourself inside of Deejai's dimly lit and relaxed dining room, it's all downhill (in the best freaking way possible).Staff is always very welcoming and quick to seat you. There is lovely seating along the side of the building and great on temperate evenings. Candle-lit dinner seekers, this is your area. Very romantic and sometimes rather quiet despite resting so close to Providence Rd. Here's my recommendation: Basil Rolls. Filled with basil and shrimp and accompanied with a light and perky plum dipping sauce. I'd drink the stuff if I could....that may be a little audacious, but it is really good. You get two with each order so maybe ordering a few plates for your table is in order. You won't regret it. Pad Thai. Bet you didn't see that one coming. I've always loved it at Deejai. Sweet and balanced with sour from lime wedges. Tender rice noodles and filled with veggies and tofu. You can get tons of other proteins in your order. Duck, though pricey, is definitely worth the venture. Curry Fried Rice. So filling. Generous portion of rice and vegetables. Wonderful yellow curry flavor and the eggs are a wonderful addition. DESSERT. This is the coup de grace on your appetite. Ready? Mango with Sticky Rice and Ice Cream. I died and went to dessert heaven the first time I had this. Sweet, hot, cold, chewy, creamy, melty, fruity heaven. This is the perfect balance of textures, temperatures and flavors for a dessert. I'm not typically a dessert person, but this beats the pants off anything else I would choose to end my meal. Well done, Deejai. I'm a believer. Deejai has an expansive menu with wok options and sushi. I've yet to try these but plan to in the near future. Price point is rather fair. My wife and I can eat here for about $30 (including dessert but not drinks). If Thai is what you're seeking, Deejai needs to be on your list. Cheers!
25 Degrees=Walk in, seat yourself.  Beer prices incredibly high, it is indeed $8 for a Guinness.  They offer PBR.  PBR, at an upscale restaurant, for $4.  This is a fairly significant fail, simply given the fact that i've never seen such swill (at those prices!) offered at a place like this.  There was Stella and Hoegaarden offered as well, but at $7, who wants that?  We should have immediately abandoned all hope of ordering beer and turned to the fairly impressive-looking wine selection, but no one in my party was inclined to do so.  So that was the first disappointment.  Miller High Life and other domestics do not merit $5.  I honestly wondered whether this was an intentional choice, aimed at adding a touch of irony to the menu, but finally must simply conclude that they're attempting to drive people to the wine list.  The burger options: there are three pre-designed burgers, none of which quite seemed to call out to me, and one yellowfin tuna sandwich counted among the burgers.  I elected to build my own.  13 different cheeses are named and a brief description is provided, along with the source.  Refer to the menu if you're confused.  I thought this was an excellent touch.  There are extras (ie, bacon, toasted tomatoes, etc) and sauces (ranch, garlic aoli, bbq, so on) that can also be added.  I opted for a simple combination of midnight moon cheese and jalapeno bacon.  I didn't say it was a good combination, I said it was relatively simple.  They offer a side of 1000 Island dressing with any burger, along with basic lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onion according to your preferences.  I ordered mine rare.  Our table of 4 also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, ($4) which were good.  The burgers emerged not long thereafter.  Mine was medium or medium well, only a little pink towards the side.  This was the other disappointment of the evening.  Unevenly cooked, and cooked far beyond my order, I was more than a little let down given that their name (supposedly) refers to the specific temperature difference between a medium rare and a well done burger. Thankfully, the burger was still juicy enough that I wasn't forced to apply loads of ketchup or resort to the dressing.  The cheese was excellent, mild, and the jalapeno bacon was quite tasty as well.  The bun used is a very fluffy white bread, which combines with the thick patty to make the whole package rather intimidating when it's first brought out.  I did thoroughly enjoy the burger, despite the goof-up with the cooking.  I didn't check to see how my companions' burgers were cooked, but they claimed to enjoy theirs as well. Another note: we asked our waitress about the beef used and she did not answer with confidence, informing us that the beef was 100% ground sirloin, 100% grain-fed beef.  I kind of assumed a burger place like this would consider the beef a selling point, but she hemmed and hawed a bit, seeming only too glad to move on with the conversation as soon as her questioner's curiosity abated.  She didn't have to prove anything about the beef to any of us (I don't think we were expecting really low-quality meat), but she could have been a slightly more enthusiastic salesperson, in my opinion.  It looked like lack of training.  The decor is eclectic but very upscale on the inside, the patio, where we sat, was pretty plain.  The service was really good - other than the brief description of the beef; I have no other complaints for our servers.  There's nothing wrong with this place, in fact despite my little disappointments, we all enjoyed our meals very much.  A few fairly small adjustments, and I'd easily award this place 5 stars.  But this beer selection, in this day and age where beer drinking is no longer vilified even among higher-end restaurants, is an absolute joke.  Many diners will be even more incensed at the failure to prepare the burger correctly - I felt that the juiciness of the burger at least partially redeemed this error.  Perhaps those that prefer their burgers medium to medium well will be less dissatisfied.  I'll almost certainly be back, and I'd be glad to see these issues resolved on future visits.  This place is too nice to not have substance to match the flash.25 degrees + date night = great night. We tried out 25 degrees tonight and really looking forward to our next visit.We started out with some beers. It was a 1st for me trying out a Dirty Ho which is quite the funny name for a Guinness and Hoegarden beer (similar to a black and tan).  We were on our way to see a movie so unfortunately didn't have time for full dinner.  We tried out 2 appetizers and both were  amazing. The cheese and smoked meat board was really good. Definitely ask the really friendly staff for advice on selecting which cheeses you want as I had not even heard of some of the cheese options before.We also got the tuna and eggplant that sounded odd but wish we had time to order a 2nd plate. It was just that good.Next time we will try out the burgers as those sounded really good.  25 degrees is a must visit!
Coffee & Tea Express=11/18/10On the day I stopped by here for what I thought would be just a cup of coffee and some down time to write a review or two, I found out that Coffee & Tea Express had experienced a burglary-- windows were smashed and a TV was ripped off the wall.  This happened in the early morning hours, and had I not overheard otherwise, I'd never have known it-- the place was disheveled just enough to show that customers read the news while they enjoyed a cup o' joe, grabbed a bite, and/or worked on their laptops.  The barista/phone operator/sweeper/cashier had his work cut out for him as he took my order for some coffee and a salmon burger (I was failing at my attempt to hold out for the OYE at the Pink House an hour later); answered my questions about the ingredients in their bread products; and jotted down a phone order for takeout, all while maintaining a clean environment.  He said I could pay for my meal at the end, when I was ready to leave.  How convenient!Did I forget to mention that the barista made my coffee from beans he'd just ground up right before my eyes?  Talk about serving a fresh cup, and all for $1.60!  The salmon burger was made w/ previously frozen Alaskan salmon fillet.  I knew this, bec. the otherwise tasty, buttery, crisped, yet flaky salmon patty, w/ crisp large-leafed lettuce and tartar sauce, on a buttery, crisped, and flaky croissant had edges that were still frozen.  If it weren't for the fact that I had an OYE to go to, where there's a promise of more food and drink (in actuality, there wasn't!), I might've felt more disappointment over this mishap, but I took cutting away the frozen bits as an opportunity to lower my calorie-intake at the coffee house!  :)Free wi-fi, good coffee, and sincerely friendly customer service make this coffee shop a winner that I wouldn't mind visiting again!
Johnny Rockets=3.5 stars This location is in the Meadows Mall. I purchased a $6 for $12 groupon which ended up making me feel better because I wouldn't pay regular price...ever.The menu at this location is limited so don't expect the regular JR menu if you want to eat at this one. I ordered a rocket double without lettuce or tomato and fries. I really enjoyed my burger and fries. They were both made fresh to order. My total was $12.92 for just the burger and fries, no drink. That is too steep on the wallet if paying full price and not even getting a drink. With a coupon I would come back again.There is a counter if you want to eat at JR or you can sit in the food court.OMFG this place is loud!  FIFW consider bringing earplugs!Pert and perky service with a smile the two times I've been here, FYI.Food is okey dokey neighbor!Prices are fair 'ta middlin' for the burger joint grub.This place is awash with hard surfaces...even the ceiling tiles.  Hence the loud music and other hubbub careens around and leaves you with ringing ears...
Chestnut Lane=Arcadia is such a mecca for upscale lunch places (Wildflower, Pita Jungle Chelsea's Kitchen, La Grande Orange, Acacia and more are all within a few miles of each other) that it's easy to miss some hole-in-the-wall lunch spots that compete with (or beat out) the more well-known places in the area. The first spot like this that I discovered (and was surprised to see that only a few people had reviewed) was Bertha's Cafe. Then, thanks to Joel L and Sean O's reviews, I stumbled upon Chestnut Lane. What a great place! Truly. The atmosphere is striking with refreshingly simple and minimalist decor that's interrupted only by gorgeous brightly-colored fresh flowers. The  menu is up on a simple board with a few cafeteria-like selections in glass cases. The woman who either owns or manages the place is clearly passionate about what she does and is very friendly and efficient in running the place. What about the food, you ask? Well, what I've tried is been really flavorful and satisfying. A few standouts: the house salad with arugula, orange wedges, parmesan and candied walnuts (I don't love salads so if I like one, you can bet it's good!); the pumpkin black bean soup; and the tuna melt. I have not yet had the pleasure of trying the corn chowder (the soup rotates on a daily basis), but I have this feeling that I will love it, especially if it's paired with the delicious crusty bread. Personally, I thought the blackberry lemonade was a bit sweet, but I can picture watering it down with some club soda (and maybe some vodka?). Now that's homemade I can truly appreciate!Definitely check Chestnut Lane out if you're in the mood for a fresh, good-quality and affordable (for the area) lunch. You won't be disappointed.Wow... After reading the previous CL reviews and hearing from Joel L that he thinks I would like this place and that I must try it, I finally gave in.  I wanted to see if I could really trust Joel's opinion, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about!I didn't realize that Chestnut Lane was a tiny little spot, nor did I realize that it's the type of place where you order at a counter and then sit down... I must note that they have limited seating.  Luckily, my lunch companion and I met on the later side (1:30 on a Thursday), so we had no problem getting a table outside and luckily, it was in the shade.We walked in and I was blown away by how fresh and delicious all of the salads looked in the case... I was torn between the old fashioned egg salad, lobster cobb, chestnut lane chopped, and asian chicken salad... and the farro looked amazing too.  I went with the large version of the lobster cobb and was not disappointed.  It consisted of fresh lobster mixed in with butter lettuce and just the right amount of avocado, tomato, bacon, hard boiled eggs, and a light lemon vinaigrette dressing.  Served with a fresh baguette - it was the perfect lunch.  If it were not so filling, i would've gone back in for a side of farro or one of their scrumptious but healthy sounding pastries.My lunch companion had a turkey BLT sandwich on whole-grain bread that was stuffed to the gills with turkey, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and mayo... it looked amazing and he ate the entire thing along with a cup of chicken noodle soup.  I am quite sure that I'll be back again soon to experience some of the other organic goodness that CL has to offer.  And kudos to Joel L for insisting that I would enjoy Chestnut Lane... I guess you can get to know someone pretty well from their Yelp reviews!
Long Life Vege Restaurant=Almost entirely vegetarian chinese restaurant (they serve some dead fishies. boo!)  There are like um no veggie or vegan restaurants in las vegas and this is an oasis in the oasis (ha!)...if you are a veggie or vegan or a connoisseur of fake meat, you MUST try this place. amazing. order the mongolian beef, tomato beef chow mein, sweet and sour chicken.  support this place if you live in vegas or are visiting vegas on more than a stripper and coke binge.  or fuck it, even if you are on a stripper and coke binge...stop by for a respite from the madness! l will be eating here again tomorrow night so I will have another update when I get back. everyone, please sit tight.hours: 11:30 am - 10:30 pm every day.  CLOSED SUNDAYS.  learned this the hard way.
S7 Buffet=Bland & Boring BUT Cheap. $9.99 per person.Smallest buffet I have ever seen. Very limited selection,dessert selection is the WORST.Nothing special-the pictures tell it ALL.Service was fast & friendly but didn't make up for the food.I won't be back unless it's FREE.It matches the name.Of all the drunken places I ended up at WHY couldn't i have been at Secret Pizza!? Or at least Earl of Sandwich! this is how it went down.waiter: what would you like?me: nachos!!!waiter: that ended at 11pm.me: NACHOS!waiter: that ended at 11pm.me: okay, loco moco.waiter: how would you like your beef cooked?me: medium rare.waiter: we don't do medium rare. medium well?me: what do you mean medium well? no no, MEDIUM RARE.waiter: we don't do medium rare.me: then why did you ask me how I wanted it f*#$&#(*cking cooked??? okay I'm sorry sir I didn't mean to cuss at you. Medium well. FINE.*texting on group chat*I'M DRUNK AND I AM SAD BECAUSE THEY ARE COOKING MY LOCO MOCO MEDIUM WELL WTF. AND I AM EMO. AND IM NOT WEARING A BRA AND IT'S COLD IN HERE AND MY NIPPLES HURT AND MY LOCO MOCO IS MEDIUM WELL!!!!!!!!!!my friends: what the...Yea I don't know what happened man. All I know is that it was barely edible to me.I came with a friend and we arrived at the S7 buffet at about 9:15 on a Saturday morning. The prices were reasonable and the guy at the counter told me that you get an extra two dollars off if you have a players club card. I thought that was a nice discount and it was worth getting signed up for.The buffet was pretty good and it covered the basics for sure! I was in breakfast mode so I hung down towards that end of the buffet. I grabbed a couple of plates of scrambled eggs and bacon and then I poured gravy all over it. As of late, I love going with that gravy option when it is presented to me. I will call this my gravy phase lol!The people that worked there were nice and they had this cool vegas lights kind of mural on the wall next to the booth that we were seated in and that made for a good back drop for our pictures. The gal that took the pictures was a good sport because I get a little picky when it comes time to take pictures.
Tacos El Compita #2=Was looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).There are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.While I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I noticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said "Sangria" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's "non-alcoholic".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!Within a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with "Everything", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.Overall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!Will I return?  Orale, of course!
The Turf Public House=Have my bar prayers been answered by the Phoenix Gods? The Turf quietly opened today and the only reason I know is because I walked by on my way back from the Matsuri Festival. Thank goodness we decided to walk up 1st instead of Central! It occupies the same space as Sens and PastaBar and is a very welcome addition downtown. A large space that straddles the fence between traditional pub and modern resto-bar Turf fills a void that exists in the area. Its a place that my husband can enjoy a beer (they have a decent selection on tap) and I can get a mixed drink. (Rum and cokes are cheaper than Smithwick's!) You can choose between the comfy bar stools, a high back leather chair at a table, a booth or a high top.Obviously its still finding its identity but I have high hopes for the new kid on the block. If they can figure out music it would go a long way. They don't have a full menu yet, just burgers and wraps, but the wrap our neighbors at the bar ordered looked huge. The bartender, Jonie, was very friendly and informed us they will be open full time for lunch and dinner, plus happy hour specials, starting next Friday after their soft opening.I'm a fan. Turf is what you get when you want an average Irish bar crossed with a high end urban pub with leather-backed chairs. This is nothing more and nothing less and has been delivered downtown to much success.I do like that they know me and my friends already after one week, and have handled complicated car key situations, Mayor Gordon sightings with grace and easiness. Kudos them.i'm giving turf 4 stars for now, i expect 5 stars will be on a follow up.first time here and i have to say i already love the place, its within a 7 minute walk from my apartment and that is something i have been dreaming of since i first signed a lease. my only full bar options are Portlands (meh) and carley's (good god no!!) and the bikini (way too far to stumble home, and HIPSTER) and sidebar (close, but not really stumble home close). so here i am meeting my roomie for drinks after work, i walk in and wow. i expected allot worse from the reviews from John V and Pierre. let me correct the misconceptions, its not in any way empty space, yes it's not overly crowded (yet) but i had a mental picture of the brickhouse empty. it is nothing like that. the floor plan is laid out with seating for sit down comfort..split with a bar and tall bar sit up tables. i was also expecting barren walls. but from what i can tell there wasn't a barren wall in the building.as far as pierre, i havn't trusted a review of his since i read his review of Sing High (god awful) so his interpretation of a dive bar is completely off. after reading his review i expected to walk into an updated classy newsroom..but was surprised to find a complete opposite. just a nice bar with a really friendly staff.the seating at the bar is attractive green tweed swivel stools. (tweed..what is more irish then that?) adjacent to the bar is a comfortable seating area with leather arm chairs and high back booths. the prices are far below what i expected. 8 bucks for a sandwich and fries. completely acceptable. this is certainly going to be my go to bar. i expect many years of being trashed and being sweeped out the front door at 2am. turf thank you for opening, and thank you for the quaint patio for the smokers of the downtown area. much appreciated.after i get my shit together, expect me here weekly, in fact i'll forward my calls to this place like Norm on cheers.5 star review surely in the future. bless you.oh and since i know you will read this, it was nice to meet you Melissa.come on downtown yelpers, this WILL be the bar you are at on a regular.Yay! I'm a fan!Tried out Turf last night for HH.. and even though I arrived exactly at 6pm when it was ending, I saw that the waitress still gave me $0.50 off my Strongbow.I was actually surprised at how busy it was! We were able to finagle some extra chairs for our table from the nice firemen next to us, but at one point throughout the 3 hour visit I had, the whole place was slammed!I don't think that they were expecting such a crowd, so the service was a bit slow until they had another waitress show up. She was probably at home watching sitcoms and pissed she had to come in on her day off, but whatever.I ended up selecting the garden burger, which was delicious and paired with waffle fries. I was really surprised that they had as many veggie options as they did. They also have a veggie boxty, grilled cheese, cheese quesedilla and a couple of salads!I could not resist trying a slice of the whiskey cake. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!! Check the photos for a shot of it :) I swear, it will make your night!!!I will be back, especially since the Roosevelt/Central light rail stop is like 1/4 mile away!!!!!!!!I have been to Turf twice now.. Once for breakfast .. I got your typical English breakfast, cant say it was the best ive ever had, or memorable for that matter, but it was alright. My bloody Mary was good, but I swear the second one only had half a shot of vodka in it.. and if im wrong I am sorry, but I could only taste Mary mix. As my friend put it, the bartender was a "charisma vacuum".. and yes, I didn't catch his name, but he wasn't cool at all. They had various sports teams playing on all the TV's, which is great if youre into that. Second time I came I was with a group of extremely inebriated people.. and I FELL ASLEEP at the bar. I did not get kicked out, so 2 cool points for that.. I still cannot believe myself and how I got away with that I do not know. Either way, I remember a lot of weird shit going on, and everyone I saw, for the most part, was laughing. I have nothing bad to say about Turf, but I also have nothing to rave about. If you're hungry or want a drink and are in this neighborhood, try it out for yourself, and try to stay awake. Its a little embarrassing when you don't.I'm at Turf pretty often.  I never order food there.   On more than one occasion I have ordered Pizza Hut, walked across the street to pick it up, and proceeded to eat it while sitting on the Turf patio.  This, for me, is not a culinary destination.  Its my neighborhood bar.  The fact that they allow my friends to do things like bring in outside food (we have also brought in Pasta Bar...) is one of the reasons I love this place.  They are willing to turn an eye to all of my friends' ridiculous antics.  Jonie knows us and always takes care of us, whether it be by refilling our drinks without having to ask or turning on the DBacks game for us.  (She is by FAR the best bartender there).  The drinks are cheap and the bar stools are the most comfortable of all time.During First Fridays its fun because it actually fills up with people and feels like a bar in some city with a thriving downtown.  Other Fridays you may just find my friends and I square dancing to whatever live band they have playing that week.  It all depends.  I don't think you can really go into Turf expecting it to be one way or another (Irish pub, sports bar, restaurant...) because it is whatever you want it to be.  It's a space to gather and catch up with friends, however you define that.  So if you are ever looking for me you can find me tucked into one of their bar stools drinking a rum and diet.One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry.  Went there today with Jacqui and Dave.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so.The fish fry was perfect!  Not too much batter on the fish and it was perfectly crisp.  If you've ever had fried fish with so much batter that it doesn't all get cooked and you're left with soggy batter then you know what I'm talking about.Regular steak fries.  Great atmosphere.OH and they do comedy on Mondays.  I'll be performing Monday November 9th :}* Now that the weather has cooled here in AZ, I can look back on the Roasting HeatFest that was summer and comment on some of the more enjoyable moments... *It is Saturday afternoon.  It is hot.  There is time before the Dbacks game.  Where should we go?  Hey, how 'bout the Turf!?  And so starts the afternoon/evening in Phoenix...I am an Irish girl, and have a soft spot in my heart for Irish pubs.  The first time I visited the Turf (randomly in the morning after a HUGE breakfast... too early to do any real damage) I knew I wanted to come back.First off, we were able to secure a great parking spot right around the corner and in the shade, too.  Score!  Be aware that the parking spaces are metered, so bring quarters and keep an eye on the time.  Nobody likes a parking ticket (no, I didn't get one).The Turf has two things near and dear to my heart.  Comfortable bar stools and purse hooks.  Oh, and the fact that the staff is friendly, the prices are fair and the food is good doesn't hurt, either.Boddington's on tap?  Why yes!  Those were paired with fish & chips with steak fries (to which the vinegar was liberally applied).  For some reason the bartender ended up with an 'extra' Hoegaarden that he gave to us as well (nice!).Too bad the Turf Bar isn't closer to my corner of the world - I think it would be a fun place for Happy Hour.  Well, there is always next baseball season!"AY! HAAAAYYYYYYYY!! DUUUUDE. Where arrr youuu maaan! come to Turf me an Anthoneee are draaankin!" my brother slurred into the telephone. "what? where are you?" I said confused and mildly entertained.   "TURFFFF!" he replied overly enthusiastically "We been drinkin' all morning duuude!" ensuing giggles and faint slurred speech is heard through the receiver as he and Anthony chortle with one another and assumedly forget they were on the phone. "Hello?....uhh Hello?" I respond after a few moments ignored on the opposite end.  "HEY YO BOB!!!" a sloppy sounding anthony gargles into the phone, "Wherrre arrr yoo's! gedduh fugg down heer!"   "YEAYUH GET DOWN HERE!!" Justin echoes beamingly from the background.    I exhale a deep sigh, realizing how much liquor I'm gonna need to tolerate their company, "Dude, it's like 3 in the afternoon, you guys sound trashed..." I half heartedly say, to which they respond with giggling and more entreaties for my presence, "Okay I'll be there in 15."   When I stepped foot inside the Turf Bar, after enjoying a leisurely bikeride in the winter sunshine, I spot Justin and Anthony bellied up to the bar. They were unmistakable, and belligerently drunk, after a morning spent in various Irish bars in the downtown area. I cautiously walk over to them surveying the interior- mostly deserted except for a bemused barkeep and a few disinterested patrons enjoying a beer battered brunch of some sort. I strolled up behind them removing my wayfarers and smile, as I clasped their shoulders, they greeted me with the vivacity that only an overtly imbibed brother and good friend can. I could smell the stale reek of alcohol on them from a few feet away.  What followed was far too many rounds of liquor, and beer that could've pleased Andre the giant. We were warned by the bar tender to ease up on the profanity, my brother forgot to tip him, and Anthony rode on my bike handel bars most of the way home until Justin leapt at him T-boning the bike and flinging him onto the ground, they both laughed till they were red in the face. All in all I have to thank the Turf Bar for an interesting sunday afternoon that ended in my brother and his friend passed out on my front lawn and a brand new pair of my clothes with permanent grass and mud stains on them after angrily wrestling my brother into submission.
Dessy B's Steak House=This place is great for burgers & steaks. A friendly atmosphere with great service.Add the salad & soup bar for under $4pp. Lipton Tea-nice & strong.Steak was tender & juicy cooked to perfection and baked potato was great too.Strange how I only see seniors here but they know a great meal & great deal when they see one!!This place has taught me not to judge a book by it's cover.  The first time I came here two years ago I was seated and ordered then went to wash my hands before the food came.  I was so appalled by the condition of the restrooms I cancelled my order and walked out.  It was horrendous!!  The filthiest bathroom I've *ever* seen with the most bizarre decor.  Prior to that I had never walked out of a restaurant...and I'm not even that picky really.  Ever since then this place has been an inside joke between my husband and I.  He's always teasing me and threatening to take me to Dessy B's.  Went yesterday 11-22-15 at 4PM for dinner.  The place is in bad shape, TBH.  The parking lot desperately needs to be re-paved...it's all uneven and the lines have faded from the spaces.  They have been filling the pot holes with kitty litter.  There's one right out front if you want to take a look.  The weeds out front are out of control and it looks like they fired their landscaper long ago.  The inside looks really dated, worn, and the cleanliness is questionable. I didn't go to the bathroom this time out of fear that I would lose my appetite.  I'd rather spend the night in a haunted house alone than go in that bathroom again.  $55.53 got us a filet steak dinner, a NY steak dinner, two soft drinks, and cajun cheese fries.    Both of our dinners came with one trip to the salad bar.  I thought the salad bar was going to be some wilted iceberg and a bottle of ranch by the looks of the place but I was pleasantly surprised with the salad bar.   Most things were fresh and they had some things I didn't expect like ice cream, pound cake, a taco bar, quesadillas, soup, and fried chicken.  If I ever go back I think I'll just do the bar because by itself it's $8.99 and pretty much worth it, IMO.  I fed my boy a couple pieces of cantaloupe from the bar and they didn't hassle me about it.  The cajun cheese fries were quite tasty and came out piping hot.  They dusted them with cajun seasoning and poured some neon cheesy goodness on them.  I had the 10 oz. filet steak dinner special for $28.99.  Kinda pricey but it was the third best steak I've ever had.  It was thick, cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  My potato was only partially cooked and I pulled a huge raw potato-iceberg out of the middle of it.  Didn't bother me much and wasn't worth complaining about.  Husband was truly irritated with his $18.99 New York Steak dinner.  He asked for medium rare and it came out more like medium-well.  He found it pretty tough although he really enjoyed his potato which was cooked perfectly. I'd be really surprised if this place was open in 2017.  I enjoyed it because it reminded me of places back home in Tennessee but it seems to be on its last legs.  Good luck and God speed, Dessy B's.  I hope you make it.
Tandoori Times Indian Bistro=Tandoori TimesVolume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  Dateline 7 May 2009Scottsdale, Arizona    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."I am remiss in not writing my review of our dinner Tandoori Times a little sooner.In my defense, my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the background music for the belly dancer and I was unable to concentrate on the screen long enough to write a coherent sentence (at least I think that's why I can't write a coherent sentence:)The Beautiful Carin and I met the utterly delightful Jim and Audrey W. for dinner at Tandoori Times last Friday evening.I keep saying it, but one of the things I like about Yelp is actually meeting and getting to know real people in "meat world", as opposed to only getting to know someone online.It really gets down to the art of dining...pleasant conversation with convivial company, good food and drink, in an interesting setting. We had all of those things Friday evening, and more!We also had Indian food at Tandoori Times! I love Indian and Pakistani food. I play squash and I got to know Indian and Pakistani food from the kitchens of the wives of some of my squash buddies...incredible meals and incredible hospitality...we could all take lessons:)We started with cocktails, 4 kinds of Naan (the Onion Naan was incredible...crusty and crunchy on the outside, literally filled with chunks of soft, savory/sweet roasted onion:)Appetizers included Aloo Tikki, a potato pancake with gravy (and you know how much I like gravy:)...good stuff. We passed things around, family style.We ordered dinner as we enjoyed our conversations. It was great to get to know Jim and Audrey better and I'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served (really wonderful food...Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Masala, Lamb Korma and Kahari Shrimp...everything perfectly prepared, spicy and flavorful). The service was warm and friendly:)All of the food was served family style with rice and more Naan to sop up the gravies and sauces...so good!Then came the belly dancing and music...there may also have been a fire engine parade and a Boeing 777 landing in the parking lot...it was so loud we'll never really know. The sound system was really cranked for the lovely belly dancer and it was fun to watch  her for the first 15 minutes or so. But after an hour or so, the fun of watching belly dancing kind of wore off, we wanted to get back to conversation (even though the belly dancer was brandishing swords and candles...it was a little like watching NASCAR...you don't want to see the wreck, but you don't want to miss it either. I'm happy to report that nothing was cut off or burned during the performance:)Sadly, conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the fact that someone had turned the amplifiers up to 11.Jim would ask me "what do you do for a living" and I would answer "I sold my motorcycle in 1978", with a smile, and he would look puzzled:)Audrey and Carin were having similar difficulties...it's just hard to have quiet chat when the background music is up around 107 decibels:)That said, we truly enjoyed the evening with our new friends!And we really enjoyed the food at Tandoori Times...I just recommend calling ahead to ask about the belly dancing, and bring the ear plugs if you go on belly dancing nights:)The Atlanta Yelp Empress, Kathleen M, came to town this week to help out with the Yelp Rocks event, so since she's a fan of ethnic cuisine, I decided we'd try Tandoori Times.  It is kind of hidden in the shopping center - I suggest they get some better signage.  But we're smart girls, and we found it... it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table, we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!).While our service was attentive enough, our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different.  For example, when we ordered the chicken tikka masala, he suggested we order chicken chile instead.  No thanks!  And when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish), he suggested something else too.  We stuck to our guns though.  We were girls that knew what we wanted!In addition to the dishes above, we shared a house salad, rice, and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven).  We would've ordered an appetizer of sorts (Ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that.  (Kind of odd, huh?!)  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything although I added a lot of hot sauce - it didn't have much kick without it.  Gotta love that hot sauce!I really enjoy Indian food and don't eat it as often as I'd like.  It seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating... I don't get it!  Regardless, I'd come back to Tandoori Times in a heartbeat.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service, decent ambiance, and moderate prices.  Thanks to Kathleen M for trying something new with me!I have to start with the garlic nan. My favorite part of indian cuisine is the nan. We oredered 2 orders of garlic nan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt. Completly ruined the meal.  The Tiki Masala and Vindaloo were both good but for the price...I can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else. The prices were really over the top. You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one "small plate," nan, rice, and one drink cost us. We were both just full but had I been with a guy or my step father, we would have needed more food for 2. The atmosphere is great, the place looks really clean. The nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect, I still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else. I had more reasonable meals at the best indian cuisine restaurants in San Francisco!Our server was good, however, after our "small plate" she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals. She did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask. With all the sauces on the meals, mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer.Won't be back. Just not worth the price.
Outback Steakhouse=Stopped here for a bite to eat before the Holiday weekend, had a great time! My son and I enjoyed a nice meal together, with great service and good food. I ordered the pasta with chicken and it unfortunately was different from what I remember, so I am not sure if they changed their recipe or if my taste buds have changed. It was a little dry and not as flavorful and spicy as last time, but it was decent. My son of course had the chicken fingers and french fries, he was a happy camper! Their baked potato soup and bread is very good, I was told by my 5 yr old we have to go back every day just so he can eat the bread lol! Will definitely try some of the fan favorites next time and look forward to another interaction with the polite and smiling staff. Thanks guys!
Central Grille=Sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and live jazz music some evenings. The large building that backs up to the canal was most recently home to the Calico Cow. The floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Rat Pack favorites.  Guests can now enjoy delicious house-made New England clam chowder and perfectly seasoned, slow cooked prime rib accompanied by live jazz or in a private dining room with a Western theme. When it cools off, I'm sure the patio will be a popular spot!They have been open for one week and I've been there 3 times. Here are some of the things I've tried so far:The clam chowder ($6) was a real highlight: loaded with littleneck clams, Yukon potatoes, fresh dill and double cream. This soup is not thick and corn-starchy, which usually prevents me from even considering it. The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail ($11) is poached in Riesling and served with a cocktail sauce spiked with cognac. The steak bruschetta ($12) lines crostini with thinly sliced rare filet mignon, gorgonzola and a balsamic reduction and a pairs them with a side of diced tomato, onion and basil to be applied at your own discretion.The prime rib ($18, $20 or $22 depending on the cut size) is perfectly seasoned and not too fatty.The chicken lahvosh ($16) is a generous serving of 2 breasts, pounded and encrusted in lahvosh crackers. Served with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms and tomato in a chardonnay sauce. The night I had this there was not much sauce. I hear that is not the norm. There was so much chicken, though, I took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad. It was even better the second day!!Menu items are a la carte, so if you want potatoes or veggies you'll have to add those at $5 a pop but they are served family style and there is enough for at least 3 people per serving. I've tried the whipped Yukon potato that is creamy and buttery - just like mom makes! But, watch out for the potato au gratin: the table may fight over this scrumptious blend of potato, green onion and bacon loaded with Jack cheese! At lunchtime, there are a few more salads to choose from and sandwiches, burgers and wraps averaging $7-9. Sandwiches are served with your choice of garlic scented fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, salt & vinegar chips cottage cheese or coleslaw. I had the roast beef au jus with garlic fries and would have liked to see a little more meat on my sandwich and a little more salt in the au jus. I hear great things about the blackened mahi-mahi so that's next on my list!The owners are not new to the industry, having previously owned Jackson's in Flagstaff. A perfect match for Sunnyslope: a close family team that loves community. You'll find them making the rounds in the dining room greeting patrons and striking up conversation. And, while an upscale dining experience, there's no pretension to be found here. I wish these guys the best of luck and welcome them to the neighborhood! It's so great to have yet another choice for dining out in Sunnyslope!Prior to Sunnyslope's Art Walk, I decided a drink was in order.  After all, what's the point of walking without drinking.  Otherwise, I would be driving the Art Walk and then they would have to change the name to Art Drive and no one would go.  So Central Grille with it's generous parking fit the bill.We sat on the patio which is quite nice, once the table with the screaming brat exited.  By then, I really needed that drink.  They have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of house wine, $3.50 well drinks and import or draft beer.  The house wines were not appealing to me, but all of their wine prices are quite reasonable, although the by-the-glass selection is limited.We ordered two appetizers at only $5 each.  However, they were small, so definitely order more than one unless you're the girl that never eats in front of your guy.  I'm not that girl.  We had the artisan cheese plate and the fig jam crostini.  The cheese plate included a blue cheese, a goat cheese, and a third soft cheese (some kind of cream cheese).  The cranberry-walnut bread was a nice touch, even if the cheeses were somewhat ordinary.  The fig jam crostini was so crazy delicious though with carmelized onion and melted gorgonzola as well.My husband wanted dinner, but since I didn't think there would be sofas along the art walk, we opted to have only an entree, no side dishes.  I went with the stuffed salmon.  The stuffing was made with crab meat.  Unfortunately, the salmon was undercooked around the stuffing.  Had I been resting after dinner instead of walking, I might have actually sent it back, something I rarely do.The happy hour portion of service was actually a little slow considering the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but our server was friendly.  All in all, an enjoyable time.If you are ever having a bad day and want to get treated like the president, head on over to Central Grille. Seriously. Both times I have been here (Once for Sunnyslope Art Walk and once for Happy Hour with a girlfriend) the entire staff is friendly and extremely attentive. They will sit down and chat with you, bring you extra bread and are always right there with refills. The eggplant appetizer is an absolute winner. I think there are about ten pieces of delicious fried eggplant with mozzarella and marinara sauce... all for $7..I also enjoyed the cheese plate. It is $5 on happy hour special and comes with three big slices of cheese (I believe there was a blue, Gouda and one other type) along with bread. They serve Iily Coffee and Espresso and it is a strong cup! Pair it with one of the really, REALLY tasty desserts! I cannot remember the name of what I had, but I think it was called something layered. It was similar to tiramisu and you got your own side of warmed chocolate to drizzle over it. My mouth is watering thinking about it!!The inside is kind of a tamed down version of Durant's, but the outside patio is amazing. They have cute lights up and wicker chairs with comfy seat pads. When the weather is nice you can sit out there for hours! As a bonus, you can hear the live music from the patio even though they play inside. They also have a large variety of Happy Hour appetizers for $5... My friend really enjoyed her tacos! The $5 House Wine and $3.50 well drinks are also an awesome way to compliment your tasty appetizers. I'm super stoked that Central Grille is right off of the canal because I can ride my bike there (its a 2 mile ride from my house - score!).  I love this new addition to the 'Slope!Central Grille has been slow to grow on me, but it's getting there. I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a full meal from Central Grille, but I have had many drinks and appetizers from there. The staff is always friendly even laughing at some of the rowdy subject matter from conversations with friends. I feel that they're aiming for a Rat Pack lounge  type of vibe in the bar area, but they're just a bit off when it comes to the music. One evening there was a little old lady playing the piano, another time it was a guy strumming a guitar and singing very boring music. The bar area would be a cool spot to hang all night but the music kills it at times.I have tried a few of the appetizers which were a-ok, but one thing that was ordered that was AMAZING was the au gratin potatoes. YUM! I highly suggest you try them. Try them by themselves! You won't be sorry.I hope to visit Central Grille again soon to try their other menu offerings
Sandai Sushi=OK so I made a mistake...tried a new place prior to checking out Yelp!!! Reason being as we knew there was a sushi place around the corner from our house however could not think of the name nor locate it on google. So we said what the hell, we are here let's check it out. When we walked in the place was empty, we were the only customer. Hmmmm? OK so was around two o clock so maybe the lunch rush had passed? First time dining here so I ask which is your top seller boba tea since they have a variety of flavors of boba smoothie and teas. Her response was "No "No" you order what you like??? Are you freaking kidding me? Wow...I ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll, crab, avocado, shrimp tempura, cucumber. I asked that they leave out the cucumber. What a disappointment, the amount of crab was almost non existent, did not taste or see any avocado, tasted like a plain white rice roll with crunchy flakes. No flavor and they were skimpy with the eel sauce which would have helped with flavor if I could have dunked it in some. I also ordered a strawberry splash smoothie boba, this was good! It was not a comfortable experience, we were the only customer and the two ladies working sat at a table staring at us the whole time. It was ridiculous! Beyond insane staring! Have no clue why either? Almost to the point of being offensive. I am a customer not a criminal, no need to stare me down every bite, every sip. Maybe they made a bet on which one of us would throw up the nasty specialty roll they call sushi first? lol No sushi chef on duty, was a server lady and a lady that took forever making our two rolls. This place is bad in many ways! The only savior is the boba smoothie was good. That alone is not enough to ever get me to come back. The bad: Service Food QualityPortionOffensive staring from staff while dining.The good: Boba Smoothie We could not wait to check the Yelp rating and knew it would not be good after we experienced what we did dining here. Never...Never...Never again!!! Please do not waste your time or money here, I speak the truth with no exaggeration. It is truly horrid! Pictures of our visit are attached, notice the smiles are prior to taking a bite. Looks ok, but taste bad.I will go without sex before I eat here again!!!
Hough's=I think this place was fantastic.  We went here to watch the penguin game and ended up eating, I'm glad we did.  We got the Chicken and Waffles Sandwich and the Roasted Reuben, two things I would highly recommend and get again.  The Reuben meat wasn't shaved but cured and pulled, something I've never experienced on a Reuben and wish they were always like that!  The Chicken and Waffles sandwich was solid also and the spicy syrup dip set it off.  TVs from every angle made sure no matter where I was I had a good view of the game.  For all the highlights I just gave you, they all pale in comparison to the eclectic vast collection of beer.  Ghost Pepper beer, stouts, IPAs, light, heavy you name it they got it.  You can get a 3 beer sampler they offer and try to fit in as many tastes as you can before you inevitably would need carried out.  Some beers boast a whopping 14% alcohol content so the buzz hits quick.  They are supposed to have a different themed nights every night of the week and from what I hear trivia is a must go night, I just might have to.  They had a really cool second bar that I didn't get to sit at and some beers and food I still really wanna try making this place a for sure revisit until I've had my fill. If you're in the Greenfield area of Pittsburgh I highly recommend this place for dinner and a drink.  I also gotta say the crowd and the staff are really cool and everyone just mingles and talks and hangs out, I loved it.  Will be back.The best way to describe this place is that it is a laid back neighborhood bar.  I feel bad for Hough's, I consider them being located in an underappreciated neighborhood that doesn't seem to get much love from the rest of the city.  However we not need worry about Hough's they know how to hold their own, that is for sure.When you walk in you are greeted by a wide open space that doesn't necessarily feel like a bar.  You do see a great big bar, but that is not all you see.  There are tables throughout the place that lets you know that you don't have to be seated at the bar in order to get service here.  But if you choose to do so, it is a much better experience.The bartenders are friendly and charismatic.  They greet you with a smile and ask how you are doing before going into their routine of telling you the specials.  They don't mind taking a moment and sit around and chat with you, that is when they aren't busy pouring orders which never seem to stop coming for them.I only came here to take advantage of the atmosphere and the multitude of beers they have on tap.  I can't talk to the food since I didn't order any type of bites to eat.  But I can guarantee that I will return to try a few of the items on the menu.I visited Hough's with two friends for dinner this Sat. at around 7pm.  When they wanted to get together for dinner, I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards, and Hough's stood out for having solid reviews and being close to their place.  I suggested it, and they were game, so we decided to check it out, since none of us had visited previously.As others have mentioned, they have a legitimately huge beer menu with something for everyone--including non-beer drinkers.  Each of us decided to go with a cider, with two of us trying the Mackenzie black cherry, and the other trying the Magners pear.  I originally wanted to try the Thistly Cross blackberry-pear, but they were out of it, so I tried the black cherry.  It didn't disappoint--it had a deep, rich flavor, and was on the sweeter side, but not overly so (like Woodchuck, etc.).  The price, at $5/bottle, seemed reasonable as well.For food, two of us ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich ($11), and the other ordered the monte cristo ($11).  The chicken and waffles sandwich is a unique take on this classic brunch dish, and is available at any time at Hough's.  It was extremely filling, but was a bit bland without the syrup.  However, the addition of the syrup solved the blandness issue in short order.  My friend who had the monte cristo said that while it was decent, it was a bit too homogeneously rich and fatty in taste.  Although the menu stated that it had horseradish mayo, which would have cut the richness, she told me she couldn't taste it.  Each of our sandwiches came with a side (we ordered fries, tater tots, and a salad), as well.Service was a bit on the slow side, but was friendly nonetheless.  At the time of our visit, there were only one or two other tables full, as well as some people at the bar.  Unlike other "trendier" bars, there was no loud music, so between that and the sparse crowd, the atmosphere was very conducive to carrying on a conversation, which I appreciated.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Hough's, and would recommend it if you're looking for a low-key bar environment with a great selection of beer and decent food.
Moira Sushi=I know there is a danger in going to restaurants on their first night, but all things considered I think Moira delivered. The red miso soup was incredibly flavorful, and plentiful at $6 for a crock that is easily large enough for 4 or more to share. I snuck a few bites of Christine and Myles' ika sansei squid salad which I enjoyed and would order on a future visit. We ordered several rolls and I found each to be well rolled and the fish fresh. We tried a Fuji, Philly, and Sakura and each one was great. The other rolls ordered at our table looked equally amazing and I cannot wait to try more of their specialty rolls. (That's not to say the "traditional" roll we ordered wasn't good, it was, but they have a lot of really inventive specialty rolls). The specialty rolls are reasonably priced in a range of $10-13. We did order from the hot kitchen (yaki itame) which I thought was just your basic Chinese dish, with basic flavors. With so many sushi options I'm not sure that I would order the hot dishes regularly. One thing that I do think they do well is portions, the speciality rolls, soup, and entrees were all well sized. My husband sampled a karma martini, which he really liked. They serve the martinis out of the shaker table side, which is always a nice touch, but they should think about using smaller shakers because the regular shakers are slightly cumbersome in the tight space and resulted in some inconsistent pours at our table. One of the big hits of the night were their sake bombers- for $9 you get a 22 oz Asahi and mini carafe of sake. Three drinks can easily be made of this. The atmosphere was fun, with blue and red lighting throughout and exposed brick. The space has a warehouse feel to it and executes it well in comparison to other places. There is a large sushi bar, as well as various tables in the long, skinny space. I found it to be somewhat loud, but could easily be cozy on a slower night. Although the chairs look like they may not be comfortable, I loved them! Our service was a little off, but I attribute that to first night jitters. Our party of 8 ordered a lot of sushi and when the rolls arrived they were on one large platter that was difficult for us to share at a long table. This was confounded by the fact that we had to try to figure out what each roll was since our server wasn't sure. (Granted it's the first night and the place was packed, I assume that this will come with time). Even though the service was obviously hectic because of opening night, the owner Linda was more than gracious and was running around making sure everything was running as smoothly as possible and patrons were happy.  I would love to see Moira offer a Happy Hour, I'm not sure if they do but I didn't see any information about it.  I anticipate that you will find us at Moira often! Thank goodness for sushi downtown, now all we need is a tapas place!3 stars= A-OKRed miso soup was lukewarm, ehhhh, whateverSalmon nigiri cuts were subpar- no equal veining of fat lines... but still tender!  Though I would have preferred the veining....Toro was excellent!Rolls were good, but the rice was a bit on the dry sideService was excellent, but the sushi did take awhile (I assume this is because of the new-ness of the place)I did LOVE the fact that they had fresh wasabi (extra charge and it was pureed)I did LOVE that they had Vietnamesse iced coffee and sweet green tea!!So yes, I will be back.  Hopefully the sushi chefs will have more experience.  Still a few bugs to be worked out, but the owner was awesome and I have high hopes!Rice was very grainy, fresh wasabi wasn't chopped wasabi and was charged extra for, no uni (not like one should even consider eating uni here), above average prices, all sushi came out at once, rolls with weird looking and tasting vegetables like marinated peppers, and weird tuna tataki roll.Miso soup: There is no seaweed in it.Salmon was ok but nothing spectacular. One of the rolls had lemon on top of the Salmon. For me there's nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it.Toro: Mediocre at best. I've had regular Bluefin that was superior to this over-priced Bluefin Belly (11$ for Nigiri).The Vietnamese Ice coffee, while good and flavorful, was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant."Meh" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. Miso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it. Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here. Good sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant. The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish). Wait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room). I could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the "food" review.Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! Saba...not bad...Sweet Shrimp....foul tastingToro.....couldn't even bite through itA good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..Drinks:Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restroomsAll in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!I hate to write a review of a place on the day it gets ROTD, but why not? I'll bask in your glory, Kristin S. Moira is hot. Like, super sexy. This is the kind of place you take a date to seal the deal. Sexy decor, sexy lights, sexy sushi chefs (if that's what they are called?), sexy bathrooms, sexy metal bead things that lead to the bathrooms, sexy music. Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit, so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one. It's easy to tell that the quality of ingredients are above average and super tasty. They have a delish white ale. The HH is awesome and prices in general are fabulous.Words to the single ladies out there, hit up Moira when you are looking for some sexy. Sushi is way less complicated than a man!How did I miss this? I'm the chick that bitches endlessly about the lack of sushi in the downtown/midtown area. Seriously, how.... in the hell.....did I miss this?? Anyway, I love this place. The sushi was fantastic (in my opinion) but then again I'm not some self important sushi snob, so take that for what it's worth. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great. The only complaint I have is the chairs..... who's brilliant idea were those horrible wire chairs. My bony ass was not happy after sitting there for an hour and a half. Whatever, I found a new date spot. The bf was as impressed as I was and since we live so close I'm sure Moira will be in regular rotation.Screw you ZenFirst off you must consume enough sake and beer to warrant a visit to the restroom. That way you can pass through the sexy, cold, metal chains dangling in the hallway door. Reminded me of the beads I had in my bedroom in 5th grade. Yep. Beads. Don't judge. It was the 70s you know!? And the restrooms themselves were fabulous as well. But this isn't a site on reviewing johns so let's get to the good stuff. Immediate greeting. Quick seating. And minutes later...lots of EATING! The gyoza was orgasmic. Thin, crunchy with shrimp and veggies! The mussel appetizer was good, not great, but creamy and hot. Reminds me of Taylor Lautner...muscles, creamy...well you get the picture. We dove into the sushi; tuna, yellowtail, freshwater eel...you know, the standards. All delicious...yellowtail being the best. The rolls, though I don't remember any names were all very good. One in particular was made with soy paper? Is that right? Soy paper? It was a nice break from the seaweed. Soy paper? We spent about $50 a person...worth every penny. The vibe inside on a Monday night was pretty happening I must say. Sexy lighting and great tables along the window. Our server, complete with a big poofy mohawk was fantastic! Wasn't crazy about the chairs. What? Did they recycle some shopping carts?Moira! I want moira you!First, it was that shit-show of a night: First Friday. Where all of suburbia exclaims "Oh, we do have things going on in Phoenix!" Moira was slammed, servers filling and refilling water cups of those who are too cheap to buy drinks, but want to take advantage of Happy Hour.Still, the staff was smiling. They hustled and I had 3 people ask if we'd been helped. When we were seated our sever was jovial, made light of the situation and suggested we order most of our items at once so that we'd get everything promptly. Now, while it wasn't the best sushi I'd ever had (it just wasn't). I am telling you, unequivocally, it was the servers that made my night. At the end of our meal we were approached by another server who made sure we'd had an enjoyable experience. She was extremely sincere and reminded us to come by on Thursdays where the wine is half priced, and the joint is half-filled! : )I don't know how ya'll do it, but you're fucking rockstars!Foodwise: Squid Salad: Generous portionCalamari: DeliciousAvoid:White Blossom roll. I've had a baked scallop roll before. This one...tasted quite funky : /After watching an Indie at the Film Bar, we wanted to find a place to pause for awhile and, lo and behold, Moira Sushi.  Mind you, it was past 9 PM on a Tuesday night.  And I thought it was so awesome that it was still open for those of us who despise going home right after seeing a movie.  The place is so chic, great ambiance, food and service.  It was kinda dead given it was a week day night, but still happening in a quiet sort of way. We ordered various sorts of mouth flavoring bites. Everything was MWAH! Pick something, anything.  You really can't go wrong! It's a good thing I was accompanied by sushi savvy people.
Henderson's=I came here not too long ago to get a quick take-away bite before heading to school. It took me some time to figure out what I was going to buy... I was QUITE indecisive. I wanted to get the freshest, tastiest looking wrap possible to start my studying day off right! On the shelf there werent too many options, but among them there were a couple that looked quite stale and one being out-of-date. I handed it back to the lady at the till, then proceeded to choose. I went for the spicy bean wrap. I was crossing my fingers that I'd be able to handle the amount of spice (yaneverknowright?), and opted for this. I remember it being around the region of 2.95. Took it away, and hopped on the bus. When I finally had my first opportunity to take a nice bite I found out the wrap. was. spiceless. Now when I say spiceless I mean 1. no spicyness 2. no flavour. I paid 3 pounds for essentially a wrap with black beans in it. No salsa, not much else... oh and they said there was cheese in it. WHAT CHEESE??! SO disappointed. Now I don't know whether Henderson's is one of those places that poorly represents vegan/vegetarian food to be bland and tasteless... but I was disappointed. It was a very poor wrap.  I like vegetarian food! Henderson's you gotta represent better! You're gonna give vege food a bad rep, man!
Serendipity 3=wahoo!! after wantin to fly to ny just for the damn frozen hot chocolate they opened one up @ ceasars!! this means more lv trips! =)so we parked at ceasars and walked toward lv blvd cuz serendipity is rite there u can see on the strip. its this building with lovely pink awnings! loooove it. we went in the place is pretty small but they have indoor/outdoor seating plus a togo line outside.  we got the frozen hot chocolate, a footlong hotdog (we wanted the bachelorette hotdog (FATTER AND EVEN LONGER!! but we ordered wrong....) cheddar cheese burger, and some more desserts!  everything was super yum. the 6 of us girls just dug in! the burger looked PERFECT hannah s. said it looked so perfect it looked fake! hahha hotdog was YUM im not sure if it was NORMAL but i havent had one in awhile so it was great.  it came with a side of sauerkraut, cheese, mustard, relish and onions so u can top to ur hearts content! the hotdog & burger comes with either waffle or sweetpotato fries.  the waffle fries were different...i swear they poured some sugar on them!the frozen hot chocolate is pure heaven. seriously. i took 3  lactase pills so i can enjoy it and it was all worth it! i posted pictures u can see my pills next to the weenie hahha check out my fone next to it too u can see how long the weenie really was!all in all it was a great spot but one bad crappy thing? service is soooo super slow. place is small( for vegas) but took nearly 30min for a seat when no one else was in line at the time and our server my gosh took FOREVER to take our orders and to bring us our food! patience is impossible when u are waitin for chocolate =XI came here in mind for one thing, and one thing only. Frozen Hot Chocolate!!Ordered the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=2GqvSuIZfL0RB7_fqBGcGg). The waitress stuck so many straws in it. She obviously thought that I was going to share. Hah! All mine!! The drink is basically a pre-made hot cocoa drink, blended with ice. In this case, 'double' has ice cream blended in also. Yummy! Except difficult to drink unless it has melted into a light slush.Food here may seem a bit pricey, but the portions are huge!!! And its Vegas anyway, so spend that moneyyyy!stopped by again on this trip! fine fine...i admit we stopped by TWICE!! but only ONCE did we get frozzen hot chocolate! i promise!!!!this time we walked from ballys to serendipity...that is a short walk but please remind urselves it was 115degrees this weekend ( ugh!!!!!!!!!! ) so hannah and i took the death walk here and the wait was 20minutes so we ordered from the TOGO window outside. we both got a frozen hot chocolate in a 16oz for a lil over $8 the 32oz was over $16 i think...the 1oz is good enough...it was sooooooooooooooooo yummmy. chocolatey and delish like the first time around. if ur a firsttimer/newbie i suggest u dine in though because its sooo much prettier then the togo plastic cups!!the second trip here was for us to pick up some frozen hot chocolate milk chocolate, crunch bars, and milk chocolate with almonds & the DIY frozen hot chocolate powder packages!! the chocolates for $2.50 each and the hotcoco was almost 5bucks.seriously all lactose intolerants BEWARE but MAN if im gona indulge in one extremely lactose item its gona be this one!!!!This review is only for the FROZEN CHOCOLATE! I've been to the original Serendipity in New York and I like that restaurant a lot more. There's more character to that place. The one in Vegas is way too orange and pink. I guess it fits with Vegas. I have to admit there's a lot of room here. Very different to the den-like feel of the NY location. My friends and I were at the bar and ordered the frozen hot chocolate. I barely tasted the "hot" part but it was still so good. Maybe it was the 115 degree weather outside or all the walking my friends and I did on the strip but that frozen hot chocolate hit the spot. Frozen blended goodness! It was truly refreshing! 3 of us shared it and we still didn't finish it. It was a huge portion. Love the chocolate shavings! I wish I could have another one right now. MMMM!"I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " With "Ooh La La" by Ronnie Wood & Ronnie Lane playing in the back of my mind as I am writing this review, my experience at Serendipity 3 may have been different had I ordered their frozen hot chocolate that all the other reviewers seem to have enjoyed.  Unfortunately, without yelp by our side for the weekend (I didnt feel that I needed to play $13 for wireless internet when I was on vacation), we could only rely on our waitress.  "I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " We were just there for dessert, and I was definitely not ordering their Golden Opulence Sundae, which was available for $1,000!!  Yes, $1,000!!!  The Golden Opulence Sundae actually holds the Guiness World Record for "most expensive dessert."  O____O.  Yeah, so... No, we did not order that.  We were recommended their "Can't Say 'No' Sundae," which was $14.  It seemed like a good idea at the time compared to the 1k sundae.  The sundae cup was glued down to the plate with chocolate fudge.  It had two bananas, peanut butter chocolate cake, two scoops of coffee and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream (which was 50% of the sundae) and a cherry on top. "I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. " It was definitely not worth $14.  I could have easily made myself a better sundae than the one that we had.  "I wish that I knew what I know now...."  I would have probably ordered their frozen hot chocolate and probably would have been a lot happier leaving there.  Not sure if I would return, I'll consider it.... but Meh!  There are just way too many choices in Vegas for dessert that I'm not sure Serendipity 3 deserves a second chance...."I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know nowWhen I was stronger. ""What do you want to do in Vegas Marthie?""I don't really care what we do. Well... I do want to go to Serendipity! :)"Finally, and I mean FINALLY! I've been wanting to go to Serendipity's ever since I watched that movie Serendipity and that was circa ten years ago. Now that they have  a location in Vegas, my wish finally came true. This pink/orange, girl decorated restaurant makes you feel like a little girl inside. It's decorated mostly white and pink with all these fancy plates that make you feel like you should have some tea and crumpets. Well, not all of the plates, just some of them. There was also a bar in the corner, and from the looks of it, it's a full bar? I never knew Serendipity's swung that way. Any way, luckily part of my group went there early to get us a table and they only waited 15 minutes. (If you don't want to wait, you can also order to go!) I expected it to be much longer but I'll settle with 15 minutes any day to come here. The place was packed and it took a while to get our orders in, aka the waitress took a while to get to us. A bunch of us hadn't eat all day (it was 4:30pm) and were ready to devour our own plates although the prices here are pretty hefty. I decided on the...Summer Bries. It's a sandwich, an open faced one (aka only one slice of Raisin Pumpernickel bread), with turkey, cranberry mayo, brie cheese (melted), and crunchy-fresh apples. Can I tell you something? It was DEEEE-LISH! :D It made me so full that I could barely get out of my sit (or maybe that's just me since I hadn't eaten all day). And it also came with a side of cheese potato chips that were quite cheesy.. seemed like parmesan cheese I believe. That $16 sandwich was well worth my money.And for dessert, well for the appetizer, a group of us shared the famous.. drum roll please... FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE! That sucker was so hot (not literally) that it was oozing out of the cup. Mmmm, whip cream, with a frothy, creamy, milk chocolate. It gave me some shivers, as well as a brain freeze. (I couldn't keep myself from drinking it all! Too bad I didn't have my own, because I would have devoured that sucker.)What a wonderful time we had, my frozen hot chocolate and sandwich, and me. My Serendipity wish finally came true and I'm so happy it did :D (Cue Happily Ever After Music)We were SUPER hungry after the LV Rock N' Roll Half Marathon, so we decided to make a pit stop before heading to the airport.  It was about 2:15, and there was still a 30 minute wait for indoor seating.  We opted to sit outdoors since we wouldn't have to hurry to catch our flight.  There were heat lamps, so we figured we could deal with the cold.  One of our heat lamps wasn't on at all, and when we told one of the workers, they said..."oh no..its on"...and then walked away.  Ummm...if we can touch it, its not on.  They finally came out to check it when someone else complained.I wanted their famous frozen hot chocolate, but since I was sitting outside in the cold, I figured a regular hot chocolate would be better( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/UVGh4r1nVItdL2eqcm8sXQ/l ).  And then I ordered a cheeseburger with waffle fries( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ayHA76-OUgfSRC6mHswuMA/l ) to fill up my hungry belly.  The portions here are quite large!  I ate about half my burger and then started picking it apart to eat the meat.  The bun was fluffy and fresh, and the fries were nice and crispy.  Except for the minor heat lamp incident, the service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I'll have to come back again for that famous frozen hot chocolate!From the last Yelp-Elite party in San Francisco, I was chatting with one of my favorite Yelpers and she gave me few places to go in Las Vegas. One of the places she suggested was Serendipity 3, which is located at Caesars Palace. The New York restaurant is one of my personal bookmarked businesses. Until she mentioned it, I didn't know there was also one in Las Vegas. So after I dropped off my luggage at my stay at the Platinum Hotel, which is only a "long" block away from Caesars Palace and the lively Las Vegas strip, I was excited and hurried my ass to Serendipity at Caesars Palace. The restaurant is cute and crowded, but the bar was empty and had the crazy football game between the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals showing on their huge television. Looking at the huge menu, the restaurant serves your typical American food. But my main target was definitely-the Frozen Hot Chocolate with chopped peanut butter cups and clouds of whipped cream for $10.00. Since I was at the bar, the popular frozen treat was prepared at the bar and came really fast and presented in front of my face. I was shocked on how my treat was made with the pretty design and the liquid flooded all over my dish. One sip of my first Frozen Hot Chocolate, I was blown-away on how sinful this treat was. I was enjoying my frosty treat while watching the football game and watching the agile waitresses and gifted chefs working hard in the kitchen. My treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?userid=HYQoxBC1y1DGPq6pGP09TwThe treat may contain 10,000 calories, but you'll need it after burning off all those calories walking on the overpass to get across the street and into the next casinoRemember, get the popular frozen treat at the bar. You'll get it quicker. My Visa was accepted here and picked the right time of the day to enjoy my treat. Serendipity is the "Real Deal!"Eating at Serendipity in Vegas is kind of like being in a giant's land because all the plates and cups are so big. Also everything is amazingly pink so if you don't like that color you might want to stay away.While the menu is traditional American and none too adventurous if you're looking for an easy, albeit kind of pricey, lunch I recommend their delicious waffle fries alongside a Summer Bries sandwich. This sandwich is made of turkey, apples, cranberry mayo and brie served open faced on raisin pumpernickel bread. It is as good as it sounds.Also good to know - they have sweet potato fries if you're a fan of them like me. Although here the waffle fries are better tasting I think. And of course, you can read the rest of the reviews to find out about desserts. As for me I went for the 25 cent gumball on my way out. ;-)On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. So, we ordered: - Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA - ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. - Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.FOOD: i ordered the blue cheese and bacon hamburger...sorry yelpers i'm not sure what the exact name is.  The burger was pretty tasty, the hamburger was juicy and all the flavors mixed in perfectly.  The bun looked really cool, but i thought it was a tad too dry. I also enjoyed their sweet potato fries..these are a must try!  the burger was 16.50.  i wouldnt say it was worth the price, but then again it's vegas, so u can't expect cheap prices. Frozen Hot chocolate: we ordered the smallest one.. it was around 9.75.  let me tell u, this taste MUCH better when u order it in the restaurant.  Last time, I ordered it from their To Go area and it wasn't as tasty.  I love how it taste more like REAL chocolate and not filled with the heavy milk flavor.Service: SUPER SLOW!!! our waitress was pretty lame.  she never checked up on us and passed our table at least 5 times before she took our order.  all in all, the food was pretty good but didn't outweigh the high prices and slow service to be given 4 starsThis is a review for the To-Go menu of Serendipity. For those that are too cheap to pay a $15-20 dollar tab for Serendipity's dine in menu, there is an alternative, somewhat inexpensive To Go menu. Here you will find hot dogs, pizzas, among other things, including their famous "Frozen Hot Chocolate."For $8.50, the Frozen Hot Chocolate was rather unimpressive. Although the price isn't too bad upon comparing it with other places on the strip, it just doesn't make sense to order a cup of chocolate powder, whole milk, and ice for that high of a price. Knowing that I could have refilled my Fat Tuesday margarita for $9.00 made buying a Frozen Hot Chocolate without splitting it impossible. With this in mind, it's my recommendation that you split this drink with a friend or boo. This way you'll get the chance to try this famous drink without feeling too jipped. Happy drinking in Vegas! (of Frozen Hot Chocolate, OF COURSE.)People know the BF and I are very respectful and appreciative of restaurant staff so it will probably come to a surprise that our experience was so upsetting that I will make sure they lose more business than just mine.  I will pay for my friends to have a dessert on us somewhere else if they promise not to set foot at a Serendipity. Sure, I'm treated like you didn't need my patronage, but you sure as fuck don't know if I would have been treated with respect I would come back every year and bought myself a stupid Gold Opulence or wanted to throw a Serendipity party....even if I didn't throw mad money around, every customer is a valuable person and valuable advertising.So I have out of town visitors from Seattle here who had Serendipity on their list. I call to inquire about closing time and they said they close at midnight....then she adds, but that depends on how much wait there is. I asked what she meant and all she did was repeat herself. Whatever, we had plenty of time so hung up and walked over there. We got through one of the side doors and standing in the dining hall was a bit confused...we stood there and no one greeted us. So we figured maybe the hostess was on the other side and walked there to inquire about where to sit because I don't want to mess up their zoning system and sit myself where I'm not supposed to. She said dining room seating was closed but that the to-go station was still open for frozen hot chocolate so she said to go ahead and go to that line. At this point it was 11:28pm....they said they close at midnight.As soon as we got in line there was a guy who decides to give the couple in front of us a sign that says its end of the line. He said "oh sorry, but they're the last people". We were already standing there before hand.  I explained how we've been standing there and that the hostess told us to line up and that it was okay to still order to go. He then goes "No, it's closed and I already told them that they're the last people and they're gonna get free frozen hot chocolate". Seriously? You can't let 3 more ( paying ) customers get chocolate? I really didn't care about the asshole giving the people in front of us free. I just wanted my guests to be able to get all they want out of their vacation. I was willing to pay and still hold the fucking sign.  "The line has to end somewhere and it ends with them". He was very high and mighty about it. He looked like he ENJOYED turning us away. The hostess told us to come order since we were standing for quite a while waiting for table service. We didn't want to argue with someone who wouldn't budge from being the way they are. No one else around us looking remotely like they wanted to line up, we were already there and were just 3 people looking to pay for some premade fucking drink 30 minutes before closing...it's not like it's much trouble.  My BF is non violent, but he wanted to punch this guy in the nuts. I told him it's too kind. Now that might seem like an exaggeration to go punch someone over chocolate, but it's the principle of being treated like dirt. It's about customer service and holding a standard to where your reputation upholds expectations of an great experience. It's rare you meet someone that hell bent on "winning" battles because of their positions to make themselves feel better....Yes, you ruined my day so you got what you wanted and hope that one day this attitude will reap you some rewards and get you royally fucked. Just because this place is famous doesn't mean it'll hold up for long. Sure some folks will come for the name, the signature dessert  but with more and more people doing reviews and spreading the word- you're going to tank if you don't know how to treat people. A bad reputation exceeds the good and seems like I'm not alone here in the reviews. A woman scorned from her desserts has a fire like no other. You already lost 4 customers plus the hundreds of tourist I know. Believe me and my texting powers- I'm fucking viral with a nickname as "The Yelp Ambassador".  My goal is to let people  have the best experience possible in Vegas. I can't ever let them step foot here simply even for the fact that how can I guarantee them a good experience? I can't and that looks bad on ME if I didn't tell them about my time here. Dessert is supposed to be fun....where is the JOY in this place? PLEASE- walk over to MAX BRENNER in the Forum Shops. It saved my night! (see review) And you know what? Their chocolate granita shit on the frozen hot chocolate here. It was definitely higher quality chocolate at MB's.  I'm already planning my trip back there.Dessert fans unite!I am not one but the wifey definitely is...  She dragged me to the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and we've been to this one in Vegas quite a few times.   It's almost always a dessert trip here so I don't have any advice on the food.  I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert's I've eaten from a restaurant.  They don't do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they "bread it" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  My wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn't feel like a complete sugar overload.  The apples had a perfect tart contrast with the cobbler and ice cream and it created a nice addition to the mix.I'm a fan... are you?It was so disappointing to see that the Serendipity 3 in Vegas looks nothing like the Serendipity 3 in NYC. The decor has been Vegas-ified; it's the cheap knock off version of the real thing. We came in right before closing & the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our waiter wasn't completely unfriendly but it was obviously the end if a very long, busy shift. Our order was small & simple but still completely gluttonous:--  nachos: a humongous portion of chips (yellow corn & red-colored ones) covered with cheese, beans, tomatoes, onions & chicken. Tasty comfort food, but I can't say I'd ever get it again. We ordered it b/c you have to eat *something* before you can have dessert. -- banana split: even shared amongst three people, this was a sickeningly gigantic portion of vanilla, strawberry & chocolate ice cream topped with traditional toppings & 2 bananas. If you don't control yourself, this dessert has the potential to give you a serious tummy ache. Been there, ate that. I only needed to experience Sependipity 3 in Vegas once. The food is average, which can be said for the NYC location as well, but at least they've got the ambiance & quirky atmosphere to justify the visit.Ugh. I was made to go here because I have family in town and they really don't understand my values are a big deal to me. If I boycott a place I don't care if I'm starving I won't do it. But the louder of opinions in the group won and I have no say since it isn't my vacation. So the BF and I kept them company while they ate their over priced and over rated items. There wasn't anything that was gonna get us to order something or even taste what people are ordering so I have nothing much to say on food and will just quote what people said at the table. My one brother who's definitely a foodie wasn't happy with his frozen chocolate what he said was "a melted milkshake" and he would have been better off "with a In N Out milkshake". Then I found out he wanted to come with me instead to Max Brenner. *sigh* (And we did go the next day while family shopped). Another brother got coffee and it was nothing special. The kids liked their desserts, but they're KIDS. I can put sugar on roaches and they'd think it's a crunchy goodtime. My sister had a sundae and it was fairly standard. My cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftovers but he said it was good. Service wasn't rude this time, but it wasn't really hitting service standards. It was more like- take the order, bring it, and if you need the check go find them. Desserts took about 35 minutes to come. One person came late and ordered after everyone else. They got a slice of cake and that didn't come around until way later when most people had their desserts done....Cake doesn't even need to be prepared so it shouldnt take 50 minutes to receive it! Just put it on a fucking plate and add whip cream and a strawberry.Well, just confirms to me- I wasn't just "hating" in my first review, this place isn't that great with service nor expediting orders.  Dessert shouldn't take almost 2 hours specially since we're one of the last reservations of the night. Stop buying into brand names. Serendipity lost the charm that made it sucessful in the first location decades ago. Serendipity doesn't live to its name and is just bad misfortune with each visit. AVOID.Colorful, one-of-a-kind dining is an exact description of Serendipity.They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their humungous desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes, deep fried oreos, and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's a paradox, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. I haven't figured out a good time to come here without having to wait over 30 minutes for a table. If you're in a hurry, they have this grab-n-go service, which is on the side of the restaurant. There is a smaller menu of their most popular items for take-out.I am a sucker for sweets and Serendipity has established it's own little place in my heart; especially when one of my all-time favorite movies is Serendipity!Out of the 3 times I have come, each time was one-star for me! The purpose for each time was to try a different sundae (although I'm not so much into ice cream).WHERE: It's part of Caesar's Palace, but it is it's on building right outside of the casino itself. You must park at the garage/valet, walk through the casino, and out to it.Each of the sundaes I got to try were all large servings!! I shared with friend, and still didn't get to finish it =(. Such a bummer!-Deep fried orea sundae: TOO MUCH DEEP FRIED OREOS!! I couldn't do it anymore after just one!!-Banana Split (coward portion): If you are also here for dessert, I recommend this sundae! The coward portion was pretty decent sized too, I miss homemade banana splits back in the day! =)I did get to try the onion rings! They were actually pretty good, and I loved the presentation!! The little cafe is cute & really PINK, but the food is over priced - that's for sure! OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE WORTH.*NOTE: Proceed with caution!!I had the same exact thoughts as Claire L., I'd rather get a frosty from Wendy's.Not worth the wait. I don't even get this whole waiting thing when there's clearly enough space to sit everyone! Maybe their huge menus are taking up space? Haha!We ordered a regular, which was meant for one person but my friend and I couldn't even finished it. Felt like a $12 punishment. UGH! There goes my six bucks...Two words my wife and I said to each other as we were walking out."Never again"$14 for a sundae that was just ok while Max Brenner is just a walk away!  I knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews.  I'd rather buy 3 different pints of Ben and Jerry's from the supermarket.First off, the frozen Hot Chocolate is overrated, so don't go in expecting to be blown away. I found the other selections to taste better overall. I ordered the NY steak sandwich, and saw that this bad boy was $21. $21 for a sandwich?! This better be ginormous. It was. I had to tilt my plate to be able to give my friends room to eat. It contains a whole 10 ounce steak, with fried egg, bacon on a whole loaf of bread. This place is packed also during lunch hours so you may want to try and hit it up during off hours so u can avoid the crowd.Dear Serendipity, You suck. Craig R. I had wanted to try their famous frozen chocolate drinks and massive sundaes for a long, long time. When I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, my group of four went to the restaurant at about 10:15pm on a Friday night. When I walked in there were many tables open in the main dining room and on the outdoor patio. When I asked how long the wait was for my party I was told forty minutes. I wasn't sure I heard the hostess correctly so I asked "I'm sorry, did you say forty minutes?" To my question the hostess rudely replied "YES, I DID. Just wait outside and we'll call you when we have a table available". Once outside we encountered a couple also waiting for a table and they said they had already been there twenty minutes and they had seen many diners leaving but they still had not been seated. After waiting about ten minutes (the couple still had not been called in) my group and I decided to just go to their walk up window. We ordered one large frozen peanut butter hot chocolate, one regular frozen hot chocolate and a chocolate cake sundae. The large frozen PBHC was huge and pretty damn tasty but I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it in one of their big glass mugs topped with mounds of whipped cream. The regular frozen HC was decent sized too and equally as tasty. Honestly though, I felt they charged too much for their to-go drinks. The price for the to-go drinks are the same as if you were to get them in the restaurant. Since you're not getting the true Serendipity experience I thought they'd at least cut back the $13 price tag for the large drink ($10 for the regular). The sundae wasn't very good. The piece of cake in the sundae seemed like it had been setting out a while. The cake itself was a tad stale and slightly crunchy. At least the guys running the to-go window were friendly. I'm still not sure why the wait was so long when they had so many open tables. I saw a bunch of servers when I was putting my name in so I don't think they were understaffed or anything like that. After looking over the many reviews on Yelp I see a lot of people complaining about the bad service they received. Maybe Serendipity thinks because they are so popular they can treat people like garbage because they will never be hurting for business. If that's the case, which I'm assuming it is, then they can take their big frozen hot chocolates and shove it up their behinds. Besides, Max Brenner is only five minutes away from here and I know from experience that they truly care about their customers and that their products, especially their shakes, are top notch. I wouldn't return to Serendipity's now if you paid me. They suck.Been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I'm glad I finally got the chance to!A group of friends and I came here because we were so undecided about what to do on a friday night since we were not clubbing. I keep hearing about the frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 sundae and $69 hot dog! ( which I hope to try soon! ) Since I didn't have $1,000 to splurge and I didn't hear about the hot dog until recently, I got the crab cakes which was good. It had a good amount of crabs and the sauce complimented the crab cakes very well. From the looks of it, a spoonful of salad with two good size of crab cakes didn't look like it would fill me up at all, but it did! I also got to try a proscuitto sandwich and that was also pretty good! The bread had a nice and soft texture, and the veggies were fresh. Their alfredo is also pretty good too!The one thing I didn't care too much for was their frozen hot chocolate. We got the popular flavor which was the peanut butter one with a shot of alcohol. ( I forgot what alcohol ) It was good, but I just feel like I was eating reese's peanut butter ice cream with alcohol and I could get that for 4 bucks a carton at albertsons and just add a shot of baileys to it. Overall, I had a nice experience and I would make my trip back here just to try the hot dog and the golden opulence sundae if I was ever ballin.***Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is pretty good (and is topped off with some nice whipped cream), but it is quite overpriced at $11***I have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.The frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.They top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.Service was quick on my one visit.Prices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.Now that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).Serendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Overpriced for some okay quality food. I came here on my last night in vegas for some late dessert with some friends. Nothing special. They sell hot dogs, nachos, sweet tooth dessert and more. I ordered the nachos and chips wasn't fresh and cheese was already COLD. Gross. My husband and friends all got the frozen hot chocolate and it was too sweet for my taste. I like it here because when it's 100+ degrees outside in Vegas I can sit in their patio with the water sprinkling on me while I eat. It's refreshing. But I don't see myself coming back here.This is a spot I take non-local friends/family.  It's right outside Caesars Palace next to the Absinthe tent.  They always have crazy lines for to-go and dine-in so reserve a table. The place is cute if you're into girly stuff: pink, beanie babies, totes, chocolate, desserts, etc.  They have indoor and patio seating.  I'd rather sit inside because the view from the patio isn't all that wonderful: ruins of Bill's Gambling Saloon, Flamingo and Hot Babes Direct to You mobile billboard passing by every few minutes.I like their desserts (Deep Fried Oreos and Ice Cream, Black and White Sundae, Banana Split, Red Velvet Sundae)  only if I'm with a group because their portions are huuuuge and I don't feel like spending 5 hours at the gym trying to burn the calories from their desserts! Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is a must-have though - but again, it's meant to be shared.For their savory items, I've tried their Ahi Tuna Salad (wishing it had negative calories to lower my caloric intake from the hot chocolate! Ha!), ABC Burger (avocado, brie and caramelized onions), Foot Long, Egg White Frittata, Chicken and Waffles and their High Heel Pump (prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, pesto and balsamic Glaze).  I've always wanted to try their Foot Long Haute Dog with gold leaf, truffles and foie gras but they only have it their New York shop (which was closed due to rat infestation the last time I went).With Serendipity, I'm guilty of my willingness to pay for cute, the name (which the movie was named after and a portion was filmed) but mediocre food. I still like them for their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.My friends have always talked about the frozen hot chocoloate at Serendipity in Vegas, but I'm not much of a sweets person so always just thought "meh." However, while in vegas the past couple of visits, my sweet tooth kicked in and I decided to see what the hype was aboutNormally it gets packed late night and the hostess will get your # down on an ipad which will text you when your table is ready. You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.Everything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.Frozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn't overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the "for 2 size" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it's cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It's fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it's icy and not too thick (for those that think it's a milkshake)Hangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.Crab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn't too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. Mint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10/18/13, we decided to order this 'cause I'm a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he's not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it's their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candyMake sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points! A lot of the reviews here say the service isn't good, but we've always had great friendly service the past couple times we've been here. Food comes out pretty quick. One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)BTW if it's your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you'd like. I saw a couple of tables get the can't say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyesPink, orange, pink, orange!  I love the color theme here!!  Yes, it's kinda girly, but hunny came with me anyway & we had a great time! We came by for late night desserts & sat in the patio area.   It was perfect as we got to people watch over the Strip.  There are some crazy people out there. Oh ladies, you shouldn't wear heels to walk around the Strip.  Too many people are walking around in pain!We got the famous Frrrozen hot chocolate for 2 ($15).  That thing is huge!  And they know my style, lots of whipped cream!   :D  The famous drink is pretty good & chocolatey but wasn't blow my mind good.   I would like to try the other flavors (there are a few if 'em) eventually. Inside the restaurant,  they love Hello Kitty as much as me!  They had a bunch of HK items.  They also sell the Frrrozen hot chocolate mix to make at home!   ;)I really liked the ambiance in the patio,  but not so much in the restaurant. Oh, when you give your name to the host,  they take your cell phone & text you when your table is ready!   Love that! They offer traditional American food & have menus posted on the front of the restaurant.The line is ridiculous most of the time. I hate lines, but I'm willing to wait for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate or their Deep Fried Oreos & Ice CreamSerendipity 3 isn't some place to visit while on a diet, but who the crap is gonna go to Vegas and diet? ...Seriously. Frrrozen Hot ChocolateA guilty pleasure. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it is a sure thing. It's definitely something that makes me feel good from the inside out.Deep Fried Oreos & Ice CreamDeep Fried Oreos, Cookies 'N Cream Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, & Marshmallow SauceI die. Deep fried Oreos are like mini orgasms waiting to be had. No. Joke. Oreos are so freakin' delish as is.. Then deep fried?!!! That's just asking for it. And then with ice cream and marshmallow sauce (I can deal without the fudge) ?!!!!! Excuse me while I go change the panty. LOL. #forrealdoeAs far as reg food goes, it's just ..."meh."The sweet treats are where they at.VERDICTThese kinds of treats make more sense in a tropical-24/7 climate like HI. Hey, hello, HI. #justsaying #isthatagoodenoughexcuseHaha. But I'm glad I know where to go when I'm in need of some cheering up while in Vegas!After being forced to watch the movie, I knew I wanted to try out this ice cream shop!  I've been avoiding stopping by since this place is always busy.  I mean lines wrapping around and everything!  That means it must be good, right? So on one of my recent trips, I decided to brave the sun and the long line and tried me some Serendipity.I only tried one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one.  I had the much talked about Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It was decent, the serving size was overkill, and it was a truly decadent and rich treat.  It was just a little too sweet and powdery for my liking and I think it had more whipped cream than actual frozen hot chocolate.  I think I would much rather spend my money inside Caesar's Palace at a delicious dessert shop with the best macarons ever.  For a frozen hot chocolate though, I think I'll stick with San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.This ice cream shop is sickeningly cute.  Like every other place on The Strip, the theme is rampant and the atmosphere is worth a few selfies for Instagram.  Stop by if you're an ice cream fanatic.  I hope you don't mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that makes up Serendipity.Meh... My experience here back in June with friends wasn't that pleasant. We got seated a few minutes after I checked in since I made reservations for me and friends. I ordered the Mint Frozen Hot Chocolate and it was okay. Our food twas taking forever to arrive and we've noticed that the tables surrounding us that were seated maybe 20 minutes after us got their food before we did. We found out that our server didn't even put our order in so we sat on our table literally waiting for nothing. We all got irritated and told our server to cancel our order and left. I guess at least I got to taste the frozen hot chocolate but whatevs.Before coming here I was warned not to eat inside as Service was really slow. Well, seeing that I'm from England (renowned for slow crappy service) that didn't bother me but I do have to agree it was a little slow, nothing bad enough to irritate me yet took around 15 minutes from us being ready to order for someone to come over and then roughly 20 minutes once we were done to get our check.With that said, I was really excited to come and eat here and came at just after 8am. Hubby and I decided to order just one entree as I planned to have the Mint Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate - $13 as my Breakfast. Yes, Really.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#TRbbI2waOPt8MckXWqWCuQ) He choose the Crescentwich which I had a small amount of and where the place is cute we both came to the conclusion that it is severely overpriced. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serendipity-3-las-vegas?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#ONQT8eOiIEaClhkXjN9Dnw)The Crescentwich was really not worth $16. It was good but not to the point I would pay that much for it again and the Potatoes that came with it were cold and hard. Server didn't even check back to make sure everything was ok so we didn't have the chance to have it corrected.As for the Chocolate... meh. I expected something amazing seeing that the Server bragged that it was ''made with a blend of 11 different types of Chocolate''. It tasted watery with little Mint flavor and very icy, I was so bummed as I was expecting this delicious rich Chocolate. That didn't happen. I won't be back.I see RED.  RED Velvet, that is.After missing a chance to visit the original location in NYC last year, I was thankful I had some time to to drop by the Vegas location for dessert.NOTE:  Seating is indoor or outdoor.  There is actually a takeout window that offers some selections from their regular menu.  Not sure if the full menu is available at the takeout window though.We arrived slightly past 1pm,  and much to my surprise we were seated immediately despite the restaurant being very crowded.  Since we had just finished a very filling lunch, our agenda for this visit was strictly dessert.I was almost tempted to order the popular frozen hot chocolate, but since it was a chilly Vegas day, I decided on the regular hot chocolate instead.  In the end, my friend and I shared a red velvet sundae.  And indeed it was a true sweet treat.  The chunk of red velvet cake was surrounded by vanilla ice cream, whip cream, hot fudge, and rainbow sprinkles.  Needless to say, we lost the battle in our attempt to finish it, but it was more than we could manage.  The sundae was a generous portion, and quite possibly four people would have finished entirely.BOTTOM LINE:  A sweet treat in Sin City.  I hope to (eventually) try the frozen hot chocolate on a future visit.The desserts here are delicious!!! We ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the red velvet sundae! I think I'm obsessed with the red velvet sundae!the reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the food wasn't up to par. We got the the pulled pork sandwich, portobello mushroom burger and onion rings. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But I just expected better!!! Enjoy the sweets!!!!Xo, Naomi!Our friends wanted to meet here to have lunch. When my husband and I arrived to this gigantic, pink restaurant that said Serendipity 3 on top, we knew we were at the right place. Not sure if I was so hungry, but the 40 min wait seemed like hours! We couldn't go far or else we would lose our table after 5 mins after they texted you to tell us our table is ready. And everywhere in Vegas is a far walk so we just stayed put. When our table was finally called, we sat on a long table at the back end of the restaurant. They handed us our menus and holy moly prices were so high! A fricken hot dog was $18!! Macaroni and cheese for $19!! Ugh! I was craving a hot dog too! So even though I didn't agree with the price of the $18 hot dog, I still got it!.. My husband got the Sliders for $18. We paid $1 extra for bacon, but they didn't put the bacon! My husband said the sliders were really good and flavorful, but so small! My hotdog was a 12" hotdog that came naked with a little plate of sauerkraut on the end. Where's the ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions? $18 for a hotdog, I would assume it came with all of that!I was already thinking of my "make-up" meal. This place is sooo over rated!!Talk about dessert full of craziness, but lets just get to the point.  Once again, I didn't know what to expect.  I knew of the original location in New York, only never had the chance to visit it.  We had reservations here, and I was open about giving it a try.  Yes the dining seemed all white, pink, and cutesy, but to me it just felt another big name restaurant with too much to offer at a high price.  Service was good, which pretty much guaranteed a second star.Here's what we ordered:~ Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for two ($18):  Yes, eighteen bucks!  Meh, a lot for whipped cream and coffee beans.  It was good, but personally too sweet to me.  Nothing spectacular as advertised.~ Deep Fried Twinkie Sundae ($16):  Now this was heavenly!  The ice cream and crunchiness of that twinkie, mmm mmm mmm!  You've got to try it for yourself.  Okay share it, because you won't finish it alone.  But still, ice cream and twinkies... eh!~ Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ($19):  Toasty, buttery, and a cheese lover's dream!  One bite into this and you'll feel the fat go straight to your butt.  Well, for men, it'll be your gut.  But $19 for cheese and bread, ha!  They could at least put tuna in it.  Or maybe they have a tuna melt that I'm unaware of.  ~ Ahi Tuna Salad ($23):  My friend had this.  She loved it, but bit her lip not once but twice while eating it.  I guess that's what happens with you eat something healthy here.  Anyways, I'll probably give this place a second chance, but not anytime soon.  Definitely a place for dessert, but only if you're in the ice cream mood.  Check out the prices and judge for yourself.  Even with a rewards card, you're only saving a dollar.  Big whoop!  OK, nevermind, I'll pass next time around.Ehhh....only come here if you're desperate to try their restaurant staple; the frozen hot chocolate. It's basically just taste like a chocolate milkshake. You can add extra fixins/toppings to your hearts content. Personally, I'm not a fan of sweets so I can definitely forego this item.Food-wise.....this is really below average. They serve your typical American food; hotdogs, onion rings, burgers and sandwiches, small bite tacos, pizza, a couple of pasta dishes and appetizers like nachos. I ordered the Three Amigos Tacos with my choice of crispy fried fish. It was bland...even if I added pico de gallo, squeezed the hell outta the lime. My friend's Chicago hot dog was hugeeeeeee!!!!! This will definitely fill you up. This place is definitely a tourist trap. Especially to those who've seen the movie. Restaurant was dirty too. Stains on the tables and chairs. Yuck! I came here once in 2011...thought the restaurant was A-OK. 4 years later....it's still the same.We were walking out of Caesars Palace and trying to get back on the strip. As luck would have it, we were on the back side of Serendipity 3. Yes, the ever famous Serendipity from the movies, and the place that the celebrities go to. They are known for their frozen hot chocolate.I wasn't feeling the wait and nothing on the menu really interested me. However, I had to try the frozen hot chocolate. On the back side of Serendipity 3, where I was at, they had a take out window. Yay, I was finally going to get to try the frozen hot chocolate! They had a lot of tables and seats back there, so it was take your pick. Be careful to look before you sit though, because a lot of the seats had bird poop.I went up to the window and ordered my frozen hot chocolate. It was $10 and served in one of those plastic drink cups. I was actually watching the woman make it. She had chocolate syrup and threw it into the blender with some ice. Then, she added whip cream on the top with chocolate shavings. Was it worth the $10, probably not. I'm going to have to agree with all the other reviews that said it tasted like Swiss Miss blended with ice. You could probably make this at home for 40 cents. At least I can say that I actually tried it. Another food item crossed off my list.This place is soooo overrated!!! I have been wanting to try this place for the longestttttt time and finally I had the opportunity to try it. We went in and waited 5 minutes just to get seated. We were seated and ready to order but no one even came by after 10mins we just walked out and I decided that I would just order to the to go line. Got the frozen hot chocolate and had a sip I was sooo not impressed. I actually didn't even enjoy it one bit. It's totally a waste of money and I wouldn't even come back.  At least it's off my bookmarks of places to try. Should've listened to the other Yelpers who said the same thing.Overpriced...Overrated and Bleh!
Loving Hut=See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!! Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!! Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green! We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future. Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with "SuperiorMaster"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan. The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage. We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table "Cha Cha Chicken"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.   Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of rice ..wimp. We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!Time for a review update... My initial "oh-my-god-there's-a-vegan-restaurant-a-mile-from-my-house" infatuation is now over. I live very close to LH, so I go there a lot.Loving Hut is pretty good, they have some very tasty dishes (Spicy Cha Cha, BBQ Bagutte are some of my favs) and they have some not so great dishes.The real reason for my drop-down in stars is that it's always a pain in the arse to order what you want at Loving Hut. You would think that a vegan restaurant would be totally okay with substitutions, omissions, etc (as that's what vegans must do at most restaurants), but no, it's always a royal pain at loving hut.The other day my wife wanted to try the "Tuno" (faux tuna) sandwich on the baguette roll instead of sliced bread. I called in to place a phone order and tried to order it. I made it clear that I would be happy to pay a bit extra for the baguette bread if necessary. Didn't matter. They would not do it. No way, no how. I tried to bargain with the phone employee who blamed it on someone else and said she had to go "check with the cook" if it was possible. How would it not be possible to use a different type of bread that they already have? Either way, they would not budge at all. So I couldn't get what I wanted, very annoying and frustrating.I've also tried other substitutions and dish modifications and it's always a pain.They no longer give free refills on Iced Tea (citing costs), which is disappointing.One day I asked about the complementary appetizer soups that they give in store, asking if I could get it for to go orders. The employee I spoke with explained that they don't give it out on to go orders because of soup container costs, but if I brought in my own soup container they'd be happy to give me some. So the next time I placed a to go order, I brought in a little plastic soup bowl and requested some. They barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it.Bottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching, as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back.Changing up the menu by offering unique, limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place, as much of the menu seems to be very similar (the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything).Hoping they can improve...Came here with my brother on a recent trip to Phoenix.  This is a medium sized restaurant.  You order at the counter and your food/drinks are brought to you by servers.  We arrived to find quite a long line of patrons.  The staff was definitely on it but getting our order placed and then served took longer than I would have expected.  We did get a free order of spring rolls while we waited since the staff knew that it would be awhile till we got our food.  I ordered the pho, which the attendant at the counter said was her mother's recipe.  The chunks of veggies were pretty large, like a whole stalk of bok choy, but I felt that it was a relatively small serving with a scant amount of veggies and tofu.  I am used to being served a plate of fresh basil and sprouts with pho, but there were none of the traditional condiments served as extra.  It was good, but some sriracha sauce and some basil and sprouts would have made this dish much better.  My brother had the Loving Hut Burger. He said it was OK but could have been more flavorful. The service was wonderful, the whole restaurant is very clean and bright and I liked the fact that it is healthy food, but I would have enjoyed more flavor from the vegan options that we chose.  I would come back to try different menu selections to see if something catches my fancy.
Green Tomato Buffet=Buffets aren't uncommon these days - they cater to people who don't want to wait, which as you know is also not uncommon in our world.  But the most common type of buffet is probably the Chinese Buffet.  Strangely, that variety of restaurant has the most trouble staying in business on the East Side of Charlotte - the China House (three times, once for relocation purposes) has gone out of business, as has the Super Buffet.The King Buffet also folded, followed by the Jamaican restaurant Pop A Top, and I'm not sure if they even opened for business.  Now the Green Tomato has decided to open in its space.  Their theme?  Buffet.  But with a twist.  It's Southern Cooking - fried chicken, meatloaf, mac and cheese and of course fried green tomatoes.I'm not really sure what took them so long to open the place, because the interior doesn't look that different from when King Buffet was there.  Maybe Pop A Top had done something and they had to clean it up.  But the place is light and airy, while well-staffed.  They kept glasses full to the point of almost overflowing.  Just take a sip and they will be there to top it off.The food, while not outstanding, isn't bad - and since it's Southern-style, you probably won't go back for more than a plate or two.  This is likely a good choice for a buffet, as they aren't going to lose too many bets on people who like to pack it on, just because it's so heavy.  This isn't your gradnmother's cooking, but it isn't a horrible substitute.You'll find a couple of buffet lines for the real food, as well as one for salads and one for desserts, so there are plenty of choices.  Each day has veggies and sides, while you get different specials for the day of the week (fish on Fridays, for instance).  Probably worth checking out if you like to get some Southern cooking and don't want to go through the trouble yourself.
Pete's Fish And Chips=You know what I like?I like cocktail sauce with my fish and my chip. And , I like cocktail sauce on my fish sandwich:)Pete's Fish and Chip's (a wholly owned subsidiary of Montgomery Burns Enterprises) takes a page from their bosses handbook when they say "let the masses have their tar-tar sauce".That's right they put cocktail sauce on their fish sandwiches. That is, in fact, the sole (pun intended...it's definitely not sole in their fish sandwiches) reason to visit Pete's (Phoenix institution, I know).Try to get them to do that at your MickieD's, or your Wendy's!I know that Pete's makes other things...burgers, chicken, hot dogs, etc. For all I know, they make filet mignon on a skewer...I've never ordered any of it. The sign says Pete's fish and Chips...I think I'm skating close to edge by having them put the fish slab on a bun:)Pete's makes a pretty decent fish sandwich...not much better than the aforementioned McD's or Burger King, but certainly no worse...in fact, it just may be the same fish sandwich...unidentifiable, generic as to type of fish...possibly even a soy based fish like food substance...I couldn't tell you...if this thing was ever swimming, it was months ago:)But, you put cheese on it and add a little cocktail sauce, and I'll swing through drive through every 6 months or so.If you want to re-create this much-revered Phoenician favorite at home, here is a very simple recipe: 1) don't buy fish  2) find stale old breadcrumbs in your "cupboard" - form crumbs into a flat, oblong shape and insert into recycled oil from the last batch of fries you made (perhaps last year)  3) slowly bring oil to a boil, cook until a soggy golden brown 4) remove from oil and place onto an entire roll of Brawny® 5) open food-service grade can of tartar slop. dunk fried oblong into slop, bite, chew, cry. repeat.If you're a real seafood aficionado, throw some crusty horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there.I've yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of Pete's Fish n' Chips. The name is a lie.R.I.P. Pete's fish and chips... I've been coming to Pete's for 42 years, since I was old enough to drive and was in high school. What happened in the last month or two??? The new recipe for breading of the shrimp is nothing like it was. My wife and I were so disappointed tonight and won't be back. We'll miss it. We drive from Ahwatukee foothills to Indian School and 44th St, roughly 35 miles, to get our fix every couple of months but, I'm sorry to say, this has been our final trip.  Whoever decided this was a good idea did Pete (RIP) a serious disservice and he would be sorely disappointed to see what's become of his business as a result of this poor business decision. They should have tested this move with long time customers before screwing up the food. If this is a money making decision, charge more, don't screw with 60 years of tradition....For those of you who've lived in Tucson, Pete's Fish and Chips is probably the closest thing to Lucky Wishbone that you can find in Phoenix. Every once in a while I stop in and get myself some scallops, shrimp, or crabettes with fries. Yes it's all deep fried and probably not very healthy, but sometimes that hits the spot.Oh and remember, it's cash only but they don't take anything bigger than a $20!
Qing Hua=I was a bit disheartened to see that some of the dumplings are served from frozen. Others are made fresh to order, which is what I expected (and hoped for). The dumplings at Qing Hua are also 15-25% more expensive than at Restaurant Mai Xiang Yuan in Chinatown, where I normally go and love (and where EVERY order is made fresh.)I was also disturbed that Qing Hua is a cash-only business and that I had to ask for a receipt because the cashier was making my change without having entered my order in the POS system. I find it incredibly dishonest (not to mention illegal!!) to charge a customer the sales tax and pocket it rather than remit it to the government like every business is supposed to.The dumplings might be good, but I won't be back.
Tamari=Oh Tamari, how do I love thee... let me count the ways!I can't believe I've taken this long to write a review for my most favorite Pittsburgh eatery.  I guess I always thought words wouldn't do justice for this restaurant.  Each and every time the DH and I come here we are blown away.  We've come here with huge groups of friends, romantic dinners, happy hour, and even the chef tasting.  The chef tasting is by far my most favorite experience.  Chef Roger actually gives you a call before your dinner to see what you expectations are.  He pays particular attention to what you do and do not like.  He hit the nail on the head with our dinner.  To start off with the portion sizes were very large for a tasting, but it was so amazing we had to finish each and every last bite.  We even thought of giving up eating out all together and just saving our money to do a chef tasting there once a month, it was that good!  In addition, the owner Allen is so sweet!  He's always walking around to make sure everyone is satisfied with their meal, and remembers his patrons quite well.  This is by far the best restaurant in the burgh, and one that I recommend to everyone when they want to try something new & different.  Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed.
Sura BBQ Buffet=Sula BBQ Buffet in the Macy's Home Shopping Center right on Spring Mountain has joined the AYCE Korean BBQ craze.  We've watched for months as the sign illuminated their existence, but waited for the doors to actually open. Last weekend, The Husband, a friend, and I finally decided to see what the fuss was all about.  We sat down a little after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread before us.There seemed to be a good amount of banchan to choose from, including white rice and purple rice.  Quite a selection of meats to choose from as well.  Their cooked items were okay - ranging from dumplings, fish, and tempura.  Their dessert selection though is something to cry about - jello, canned peaches, fresh watermelon and honeydew, old sesame balls, and deep-fried pineapple chunks.Price for adults on weekends: $19.95I do have to agree with other comments regarding the staff hounding you.  The managers would come by our table all the time (we were seated close to the register), and take a survey of the restaurant.  It made me wonder if they were watching how much we were eating.  At one point, the waitress put the bill on our table and I was a bit shocked.  I said "Is there a time limit?" under my breath, but she then told us to take our time.  (Take our time eating or take our time paying the bill?)  Either way, getting your bill during our meal is a bad sign.  Don't do it.  And yes, we also experience the older Korean owner too.  I guess I said something out loud about not having any lettuce, and a little green salad showed up at my table.  Weird.  Service is okay - drinks come immediately, and they also help with cooking your meat too.  Our grill got cleaned once while we ate, which looked super easy because she just wiped it with a paper towel.Overall, Sula BBQ Buffet was okay, I think there's a bigger selection over at Woo Che, and it's cheaper there too.Sula is a BBQ buffet. If your preference is to buffet style, versus having to  put in an order every time you want some kimchi or a more kalbi, this place is a great all you can eat Korean BBQ in Vegas.  You are able to cook your own meat (whether it be beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, squid, or octopus).Chefs slice out many different kind of fresh meats, poultry, seafood, etc. You pick what you like and barbecue it at the table. It is a great set up allowing you to cook your meats as much or as little as you like.There is a variety of choices for meats, side items and sauces so you are not limited. In fact, I found this a great way to try items I had never tried on a regular korean menu (i.e. I didnt want to risk paying for something I didnt like). Servers are surprisingly very attentive and friendly. If you do not feel like cooking, or do not know how to, the employees will come around and help you. Be warned, they will charge you $5 for wasting. I didn't have this happen to me... but there is a BIG sign in front of the buffet that says so. =)It's very hard for me to ever not like Korean BBQ. I love it so. My favorite in town is probably still Woo Che, but Sura is pretty good as well. I'd rate is a solid 3 1/2 (so I rounded up despite the lack of sides). The restaurant is large and well maintained. They have a pretty large selection of proteins to bbq. Their banchaan selection isn't great, but it'll do in a pinch. The salad and other sides were just fillers. Not really necessary and not particulary appetizing. I adore kalbi, so I usually fill up on that and their marinade was ok.The service was pretty good. They came by to refill our drinks and check on us pretty regularly and changed out our grill when necessary. All in all, I enjoy this place for what it is. I can't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's good and it satiates my late night KBBQ cravings. I wouldn't object to coming back again. Good food, good service, happy me. Yum.Several people have told me so much about this place, so I decided I wanted to try it for myself! It happened to be midnight & on a whim.  Firstly, if you claim yourself to be a carnivore, then you are heading towards the right path walking into this restaurant!WHAT:  Sura BBQ is a buffet-style korean bbq spot! I believe it has been one of the Las Vegas hot spots as of recently!  Instead of ordering the type of meat that you'd like, you get just just get up out of your seat whenever need be & pick out the meat yourself!  (FYI: the meat is raw when you pick it  up). You then take it back to your table and cook it to your liking (there is a hot-pot/stove top in the center of each table). Besides meat, there are additional sides you can also enjoy such as rice, salads, appetizers, & even sushi rolls!WHEN:  This spot is open from 10am-3am! Saturdays & Sundays all-you-can eat price is a standard $19.99 for everyone!  During the weekdays, I believe it is still $19.99 for adults, but $13.99 for children.WHERE:  Located on Spring Mountain, between Arville & Decatur!!WHY:  If you want meat, just came from the bar/clubs & have been drinking, or if you want to try something new!SIDE NOTE: Do NOT, I repeat, Do NOT get too excited about cooking everything up! Please make sure you finish the food you do decide to cook because they charge $5 or more depending on how much food you waste! So please portion your food wisely! =DThis is where meat and kimchi lovers explode. I belong here. As I was getting my kimchi craving satiated, I overheard a couple talking. Obviously, it was the bf's first time.Dude: "So, this is a restaurant where you have to like, cook your own meat?"Girl: "Yup! You bring the meat to the table and cook!" Looks at him with the biggest smile, ever.Dude: Looks lost and kinda grossed out. Holds up meat. "Oh. So, what is this?" Looks at the meat suspiciously.Girl: "That's chicken"Dude: "Are you sure? I bet it's cat."Girl: "No! It's chicken."Dude: Looks disgusted. "I bet it's cat. This whole buffet is cat. Cat!"This exchange embodies cross-cultural clashes. I love it. A great and clean cook-it-yourself Korean bbq restaurant. It's so much better than rival Woo Che BBQ a few blocks west. The concept is straight forward: server heats up the grill; you choose from a buffet of uncooked meats, salads, appetizers, soups and bring it your table;  start grilling your meats, eat, and enjoy. Repeat. I loved it. The combination of fresh flavorful cooked meat and spicy fermented cabbage is deliciously intoxicating to my soul. I also enjoyed the cucumber salad, noodles, and pumpkin soup. I frequented so many times with the meat that a gentlemen next to our booth remarked, "I like your appetite!". Guilty. At $20+ per person (during dinner), I wanted my moneys worth, duh. My only gripe is that I wish they had more veggies to grill (i.e. eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers) and dessert options. Strawberries would've been a perfect ending. Service was friendly and our waitress helped clean the grill frequently. The blend of fresh ingredients, friendly service, and a funny overheard exchange permits a recommendation.Best Bang for your Buck All you can eat Korean BBQMeat: 5/5 The quality of the meat is pretty good, I'm not much of a great meat critic but it was good to me. The seasoning on the bulgogi was yummmm that's my favorite dish there. Also the short ribs I can't get enough of their recipe. You can also grill Shrimp and squid which is also tasty Sides: 5/5 They have a great variety of sides from kimchi to cold noodles to fish cakes. Depending on what day or time you go it changes. I love the kimchi square radish, spicy/tangy/crunchy Sushi: ?? They have a small variety of sushi rolls pre-made just your simple California rolls or tuna rolls. I've never tried them because I'm there for the Korean BBQ meat not sushi. Soups: 5/5 The soup changes but they usually have 2-3 big pots of soup you just serve yourself. My favorite was the kimchi tofu soup its a great starter before the meal. Value: 5/5 All you can eat Korean BBQ for $20 per person. WOW I remember when Korean BBQ used to be $20 a plate. Their lunch is $15 a person WOW & if your craving Korean BBQ late they're open till 3AMParking: 4/5 Pretty decent lot, it shares a parking lot with a reflexology office and I believe a sears home furniture store. During peak dinner hours it can get a little packed in the parking lot but as long as you don't mind walking a bit it shouldn't be a problemVerbatim: "People NEED to know about this place!"I recently re-introduced my brother to the food of our people and he was more than enthusiastic over the taste and value of the Sura BBQ Buffet. You're charged a flat rate of $23 for dinner (they're open for lunch too.) And as long as you don't mind the bad service, you'll leave not only stuffed, but satisfied.Korean BBQ is all about one thing--meat. Many times have I wandered into this red-meat cal-fest and I've never questioned the cuts or quality. From the beef to the chicken to the seafood, every dead animal cooked up at the table has been delicious. The sweet soy marinade used for the kalbi and bulgogi are going to be the crowd favorites. But for the odd-balls that don't eat red meat, there's chicken, shrimp, octopus, and squid.  If you don't eat red meat, pork is probably on the list to avoid. But  for those of us in the "I HEART BACON" club, there's chunks of pork belly to be enjoyed. Put them on the grill first. Once all the fat has rendered and has cooked down, a delicious piece of pig fat is yours for the eating.Las Vegans take their buffets seriously. Without variety, the over-eaters won't see value. There are two types of rice (red & white), lots of soups/stews, and a variety of korean and chinese appetizers. Odd ball, they've got California Rolls too. Taking into consideration that a plate of kalbi alone would cost around $25 at any normal Korean resturant, Sura is my #1 stop for Korean BBQ. Its cheap, delicious, and great for groups. Introduce a friend to Sura's Korean BBQ and go eat like a hippo.The cleanest and biggest AYCE KBBQ in town.  Grab plates of raw rib eye, brisket, kalbi, bulgogi, squid or chicken - but get only what you can finish so you don't have to pay extra.  While you wait for your food to cook, you can grab some shrimp/vegetable tempura, noodles and sushi.  I skip that part since I don't want to waste stomach space.Grab a small saucer of salt with sesame oil to dip meat in and chopsticks.  My favorites are rib eye, pork belly and brisket.  You'll probably want to go here towards the end of the day/ when you have no plans to go somewhere afterwards because you'll end up smelling like smoke/ BBQ.Sometimes you'll get a friendly server, other times you'll get the grumpy/impatient one who'll grab the tongs/ scissors from you and make you feel like you don't know what the heck you're doing.  Nevertheless, I do like this spot.I went to Sura tonight.  I usually come here every other week.  For the record, I am the Duke #1 regular here on Yelp.  I've checked in 23 times throughout 2-3  years.  Unfortunately this will be my last.  I bring a lot of friends and family here and recommend it to everyone.  This will also not happen anymore.  So what happened?  I was doing what I do every time I come here which was cooking Kalbi beef on the grill.  There seemed to have been a very irritable waiter who did not like the way I was cookng the meat.  He told me I can't cut the bones out.  I replied with, "do you want me to eat the bones?"  He then leaves the table and says it's ok.  I proceed to cut the meat the way I want.  I basically just cut the bones and chunks of fat out and eat the lean meat.  5  minutes go by and this overzealous waiter comes back and says the Owner said I can't cut the meat like that because the price of beef is going up and they will charge me extra..... I personally think this waiter guy instigated the whole thing and don't think the Owner had a problem with anything.   I politely asked him how he would like me to cut the meat and that I have been cutting it this way for years.  He didn't really show me how he would have liked me to cut it.  At this point, my buddy got annoyed and suggested we just leave.  So we did.  Honestly, who wants some punk waiter hovering over you and telling you how to cook your meat?  It's not even his meat ! I want to add this is the same clown that I dealt with last week that throws the bill on the table in the middle of the meal and says there is a "shift change" and to pay the bill right then and there.  But after further observation, my table was the only one that got hit with this "shift change" tactic.  The other tables around me didn't get this premature bill.  Did he think I was going to run out without paying?  Very bizarre individual.  I ended up going to Via Brasil in Summerlin where the wait staff was superior to Sura.  It was like night and day difference.  That Sura guy with the purple shirt and the glasses needs to apologize AND offer me a comp for me to come back and lift the boycott.  Otherwise, you will be seeing a new Duke here very shortly.Yelpers all know by now that I'm a 4th generation Japanese-American. But, what many of you don't know is that my Mom is actually Korean.  A significant reason I choose to identify as  Japanese over Korean was because since my childhood the Korean community has always rejected me. I just turned out way too Japanese looking, and my Korean features are philosophically just an non-observable genotype.  No matter how hard I tried to reach out to the Korean community, I was always pushed away.  I've probably only gotten along with 5-6 Korean people in my lifetime, and most of them were Zainichi Koreans or Koreans from South America. Because the Korean community pushed me away my whole life, I grew up not knowing anything about Korean cuisine. So I don't know if SURA is considered "good Korean food" by Korean people, but what matters is that I enjoyed every second of it. Of course my favorite Korean BBQ joint is and always will be Mr. Jake Lee's Honey Pig, but SURA has some advantages. The main advantage(and maybe the only advantage) is that SURA is a buffet style restaurant and you don't have to wait for a server to bring you more meat. Personally, I like Honey Pig better because they accommodate Japanese people and will give you Yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.  Also at Honey Pig they cook the meat for you, so you can just sit back and relax. The first time I came to SURA, I badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area. The server ran over.... and she looked really really pissed. I really liked the Kalbi here. I also really liked the pork bulgogi. You can tell it's been marinated over night because of the intense flavor. Even the California rolls were pretty good, and I don't even like California rolls. I'm actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because I've noticed that most Korean yelpers tend to give out a lot of 1-star ratings to Korean owned businesses.  They always complain about how the food is not as good as it is in Korea or "Ellie"(note- "Ellie" is how a lot of FOB Koreans pronounce L.A.).  I'm giving this place 5-stars because unlike full-Koreans, I actually support Korean business. btw... why is it that every Korean person has an Iphone 5? Shouldn't you guys support Korea and buy the Samsung Galaxy? How unpatriotic!my reviews are weirdNOT A KOREAN JUNK FOOD BUFFETIt's our first time and  the other couple had dined here ten times or more. One of them is also a Yelper (dormant).  I made mention that the reviews were either stellar or abysmal. They are the fussiest when it comes to comfort, service, food quality and value. I am also cognizant that at $25 per person they will be even more critical. Let's just say they want their money's worth and at this price level it's their threshold for dollars spent on a meal.We started at 5:30 pm and dined here for two and half hours.  Plenty of table service which included changing out the griddle five times and constantly removing dishes from our table.  Sometimes they were too vigilant trying to keeping our table clean and uncluttered. Yu-go had fun people watching too. Most interesting attires were being modeled by patrons. Glad the smoke from the griddle didn't obscure his vision.  LoLYu-go did most of the cooking which was our big advantage.  He doesn't mind all the work and in fact enjoys it. Besides he gets to jazz up the meats the way he wants it. Fortunately everyone at the table is adept to spicy and garlicky.There's nothing like a Korean bbq buffet to socialize and dine. Just remember that if you stay long enough, you'll eventually smell like a walking Korean bbq buffet. Pets at home will cling to you with affection as they think they are about to be feed Korean style.  LoL.I love korean BBQ and I love Sura's style concept.  The restaurant is buffet style. You pick the meats and dishes that you wish to have and bring it back to your table to grill. A server will bring you drinks and clean your grill ever so often. The food isn't bad but it isn't great. You might find some pieces of meet that are still frozen if you pick from the middle of the tray. I went to the restroom while eating here and witnessed an employee leaving the stalls without washing their hands only to later see her behind the buffet line serving meat.  True story. I was so disgusted I wanted to return back to the stall and puke. Since Sura's AYCE menu is around the same price of the others in town...I'd go elsewhere especially after using their restrooms.Been here at least 4 times already so yeah, a review should be done so here it is. First off, if you are a carnivore like I am, then this is the place for your All You Can Eat (AYCE) meat cravings. They have plenty of options like Beef Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Belly, thinly sliced Brisket and Cow Tongue. For dinner they have the good stuff like Short Ribs and small thick cuts of Ribeye. Not a meat lover? Well they do have Sushi, a Salad Bar, and a separate section of hot items like Fried Rice, Tempura, and Steamed Fish just to mention a few.If this is your first time, the rules are simple. Get food that you like whether its already cooked or not and sit down. Start eating cooked items while you are waiting for raw items to get done cooking. The servers take away your dirty dishes and refill your drinks. That's it. If you dont like how your the items you cooked tastes, then you have nobody to blame but yourself!This is my rule of thumb, always try to sample some of everything and then decide what you like the best and knock yourself out! Always get your money's worth! Even better when you have been here before because you should already know what you like.Service is hit or miss. One visit I barely saw my server so I did not get much refills and we had dishes all piled up at the edge of the table which was obvious our server was lacking. Another visit our server was checking up on us like every minute which was awesome! The hours here are pretty good. They are open from 11 am to 3 am every day! Also take note of the prices. Lunch is usually a little bit cheaper because there are some items that are only available during dinner which in turn means that the dinner prices are more expensive. Refer to my pic for full details on pricing.Some random info: Dont wear nice clothes when eating here. You will get grease that splatters from the grill on to your clothing not to mention the barbeque smell. Try going to any semi formal event after eating here and you will get people craving Korean barbeque as soon as they smell you. Lol. They have several flat panel LCD's so if the big game is going on they are more than likely will have it playing. Make sure to eat most of the food you brought to your table or they will charge you extra!Lastly, the 3 stars is mainly for the price and quality. Several years ago I remember dinner prices used to be around 20 bucks. They also used to have raw mussels and shrimp as well but now those are gone. This last time I went it was about 27 bucks a person without drinks. I can understand the price hike so that they can make money but taking stuff away while increasing prices is no bueno if you ask me.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #147 "Vegetarians need not apply"
Mafia Mike's=02/07/10Ordered take-out, Whitey's White (white cheese pizza, alfredo sauce, and garlic.  Crust was too thick for mel- no crispy bits ANYWHERE.  Taste was OK, but not good enough for me to order again; I also had allergy issues after, but it's to be expected at chain locations such as this.  Tried reheating a couple of slices the next day, but they weren't any good (didn't crisp up, flavors gone), so I had to trash the rest.  Too bad- it would've been a great take-out place to hit up after visiting w/ friends in the area...
Fugu=I think I may have just found the one.It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as "a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef." So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... Alright then, moving on...As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison.The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)
Sapori D'Italia=We came here after going to Casavino Winery and reading all the great Yelp reviews.  Typically I'm in agreement with fellow Yelpers, but this time I feel like they lead me astray.  The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the terrible service.  They were fairly busy, although not in a crazy way.  When we walked in the owner seemed more annoyed that she had another table to deal with than excited to have our business.  We asked for water when we sat down, which never came.  The food and wine was very slow to come out, and our server didn't come to check on us that often.  There were a few times that it felt like they forgot us!  There are a ton of great Italian restaurants out there, you may want to skip this one.
David's Hamburgers=I'm sitting here emitting small, burgery burps of pure delight as I write this...no, sorry, there are just some things that you can't unread:)I walked over to David's for lunch today and found a Texas Burger, fries and a vanilla malt sitting on the counter in front of me...what was I supposed to do...ignore them?No...you can't ignore destiny and destiny was calling to me, in the form a 1/3 lb's burger, with an onion ring, crispy applewood smoked bacon, Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese and barbecue/ranch dressing/sauce (you read that right...they mix them together for the burger and damned if it doesn't work!) with a platter-full of fries:)This thing was everything you want from a diner burger, wrapped in wax paper and served still popping and sizzling from the grill.I was tempted to hoover that thing down in about 3 bites, but reason took over and I sat there at the counter and savored the burger and the experience of finding a new burger joint, sipping my malt (pretty decent malt, BTW), having a few fries and just letting a feeling of well being wash over me, like grease from a great burger down the front of the white dress shirt of my lunch hour (it's a metaphor:)This place is right off Scottsdale Rd., and in an era of flash and dazzle, this place won't win any interior decoration awards, but it's clean and relatively modern, they do have a big HDTV (doesn't everybody these days?), and a fireplace at one end of the place...the fireplace wasn't getting much of a workout today.David's menu aligns almost perfectly with the name of the joint...there are burgers and mexican food, and not much else. It's family owned and operated and nowhere near as busy as it should be!I haven't seen the pairing of burritos and malts anywhere else recently and that will be an interesting combo to try out one of these days.I'm gonna need to stock up on Pepcid AC:)The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)So I thought, "OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...You're Welcome!David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, "Delilah", She's a Lady" and, interestingly enough, his version of "Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)After our Farm Session and Old Town Farmer's Market tour, we walked around Old Town for a bit.  By now my daughter was hungry and everyone else in our party said, they could have a "snack".  We had coupons that Kevin N. had picked up so we were good to give David's a shot.  I was kinda torn between nachos and a Texas Burger.  I waffled but when it came time to order I went with the burger.  My daughter had a hot dog.  The Texas Burger is like the Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheese Burger which is one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Except this was a real pattie that looked like it had been shaped by human hands.....not shaped by a round or square cookie cutter.  And it tasted like a real burger should.  The bacon was crispy, cheese was melty, and the onion rings were crisp.  This was a good burger in my book.  The fries were crispy on the outside...just the way I like them and fluffly on the inside.  My daughter gave the thumbs up to her hot dog and devoured the whole thing.  My companions enjoyed their food as well.  The one drawback I would say is that the service was slow.  We waited for our drink order to be taken and the waited for our drinks.  Our drinks were not refilled very quickly.  It was not super busy when we were there so maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Will I go back...yes, because the value was there.  It was a good burger for the price, with or without the coupon.Found this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:Texas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizwHot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0QThe food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAgI went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.Next up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-QCooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.Fries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.Return Factor - 90%3.5While I'm almost a fan, I should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering.  Had it been Julio's Mexican Food & Other Stuff, my order would have been a wise choice.  But instead I ordered a carne asada quesadilla made by David who specializes in hamburgers.In all fairness to David, it was not bad.  I'm not a big quesadilla person, but the Mexican plates seemed to large for me to consume and expect to walk around the arts festival afterward.  And if I can't take it home, I'm inclined to stuff it down.  I didn't care for the meat in the quesadilla (not the seasoning, but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd), but it was perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggies as well.  My husband's hamburger, however, looked great and I was full of envy as I watched him finish it in record time.  That envy quickly turned to resentment as he sampled my quesadilla and remarked "yep, mine's better."  He would pay for his insensitivity later that afternoon.  I like that they will add flavorings to your soft drink, but my Cherry Coke needed more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice.I do love that this restaurant has not be redesigned to fit into the trend of turning "Old Town" into North Scottsdale, from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booths on the other.  I just think I'll still with burgers and shakes.  Well, who am I kidding?  I'll order David's Mexican food again.  I can't turn down anything in a tortilla.Apparently I'm the Duke on @Yelp or the Mayor on @FourSquare or something so I should probably write a review huh?So I've been in probably four times and liked it four times, in particular the guacomole burger with bacon and grilled onions.  They make a good, straightforward guac here, no tomato to adulterate it, no bastardization with mayo or some other foreign spread.  Just avacados, peppers, maybe some lime or lemon juice and some salt.  That's all guac needs really.Service has been great every time, the prices are reasonable...people, why aren't more of you eating here?  This is a great local spot for burgers, BLT's and the like.
Jade House=Ok, if you want real Chinese food, this is the best one in town. As real as it can be--please don't order orange chicken, lemon chicken, or hot and sour soup...ect here, not saying they are not good in Jade house, these are American food, get them somewhere else. So talking about real Chinese food, you don't even need a Chinese menu to order, try anything that shown in the pictures along the wall, they are all good!! I live in north Phoenix cave creek area, I drive to there for dinner twice a week. Yes, more than 60 miles every time, totally worth it.
Carrabba's Italian Grill=Three point six seven nine stars.I have some gift cards from Carrabba's and I must say that even though I am fairly anti-chain and pro-independent...Carrabba's ain't half bad.  As a matter of fact it's better than half good.The service here was outstanding and the food was well beyond just ok - better than I was expecting from a chain.We ordered several things to share amongst the family - spaghetti with meatballs, chicken caeser salad, mozzarella sticks.  I particularly enjoyed the chicken caesar salad.I still prefer independents but Carrabba's is a safe chain apparently.  I think.
Burger Studio=So The wife and kids are out skating and I have zero coordination so I eat instead. I drove to one place, closed! I drove to another, closed! So at this point I will just have another freakin drive through or something. I see a place called Burger Studio, there are several people walking around and the place looks busy. I walk over and realize it is friends of the owners and their kids, 2 owners and 3 workers. Not exactly clients ya know. The place is brand spankin new. They opened last week. The decor is a modern, decor. (hence STUDIO) There are about 5-7 tables that seat about 4 at each. It looks really cool. The owners are really nice, they can fill you in about the type of beef they prefer and why it is better then the rest. They are really enthusiastic about the place. It is certified Angus beef and a full 1/2lb, cooked to order on a flat grill, not a fire type grill. The beef is specially made for them by a company in Colorado. They are frozen but the owners said you still can taste the difference. They season the meat and toast the buns. The bun is a torta sized bun and is excellent! OK, so I am a huge burger fan, but I like a flame grilled burger, this one was good but not my style. I also can pick a frozen burger out of a line up, no matter how good the beef is. There is no substitute for fresh beef. I hope in time the grill will be better seasoned and give the burger a little more crispy burntness. I liked the fact they only had burgers, not like all the rest of the burger, dogs, chicken etc. places. If you are going to do one thing do it the best you can. I will be back and I will send people their way.The husband and I came here after work because I was starving.  Upon walking in, I was really excited and I felt like this was going to be a 5 star place.  The decor was simple and clean, and it kind of reminded me of my house.  Then it became a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollars.  A little pricey for me.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that touted applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tots.  Yum!Our food arrived, and well, I subtracted another star because it was sloppy looking and frankly, a tad unappetizing.  My tots were pretty dark but I happen to like mine overcooked so they are really crispy.  Other people may be very disappointed with this.  The burger was very large, but the patty was very commercial.  My bacon was the biggest disappointment.  It was translucent!  I expected nice thick cut bacon when ordering an expensive burger.  The taste was no better than appearance.  It was incredibly grease laden, so much so that it made the bun soggy.  Additionally, I am 99.4% sure that everything they used comes from Costco.  The patties were definitely the same ones that come in a big stack with sheets of paper between them.  The bacon was definitely the kind that comes in the big giant reseable Kirkland bag.  Yikes.  Not good.  We're down to two stars.After I didn't finish eating my burger, I felt pretty gross.  It took a few minutes to sink in, but I realized I just put an immense amount of grease into my tummy.  I am not one to shy away from greasy diner breakfasts and the like, but holy crap, this was a new level.  I didn't feel well.  An hour later, I am definitely sick  Now we are down to one star.  I have a wicked stomach ache as I write this review.  Ugh.  I want to vomit so I can just get this crap out and pretend it never happened.  What a disappointment.We were not greeted when we walked in the door.  The lady running the counter gave us a surly look and went back to restocking the counter items.  Then, after she changed the small garbage bucket, while wringing garbage juice off her hand, she asked what we wanted.We just stopped in for a snack and I had wanted to try their food, so we ordered the sliders to share along with some sweet potato fries and a tea.  No thank you or smile or anything, we were obviously just in her way.Our sliders arrived with sweet potato fries that were obviously sitting out for the day.  Cold, lifeless and disgusting.  I went back inside and asked for a fresh batch and got dirty looks from everyone.  While waiting for the fresh fries, we ate the sliders, which were pretty good.  The burger, bun, onions and cheese were tasty, something I'd be happy having again.  But not with service like this and I also noticed that mid afternoon while the staff stood behind the grill eating (2 people observed eating while working, one was garbage juice hand girl), the main garbage remained overflowing with disgusting refuse spattered on the white garbage stand.  Ick.While the sliders were fine and the fresh fries were pretty decent, the service, attitude, people eating during their shift and lack of clean up were not something I'd like to plan my meal around.  I predict an upcoming health code violation.  No gold or silver stars in their future...
Familia Pizzeria=I'm another New Yorker reviewing the pizza here.I can't tell you how many pizza places I've tried before I happened in here one night. And I am SO glad that I did. I figured I'd leave disappointed - like usual - but holy shit.This pizza reminds me of the place that I used to go to around the block from my house in New York. It's literally perfect New York pizza. I am SO thankful that I found this place, because I couldn't stomach choking down another slice from another stupid NY pizza knockoff place.I mean it, no other pizza place in Las Vegas will have my business from now on. If you're from New York and you're really craving a slice, I don't care if you're driving here from Nellis Air Force base. Get your ass over here, splurge on your gas bill, and enjoy a mouth watering slice of authentic New York pizza.I started to write a 4-star review on this place and thinking about the food made me hungry, especially seeing that they offer pizza by the slice,so for the first time I drove down there (I have only used their delivery service) and decided pick up lunch.My first impression was the place is incredibly clean.  I would trust them with my food based on this alone.  The staff was very friendly, quick, professional.  I was amazed by the enormous menu.  This is not a pizza joint; much more a restaurant.  I sat gazing at all of the choices on their menu for the entire time I was waiting for my order and will probably be calling them for dinner.  It does not seem that their online menu does justice to all of the options they offer.The pizza is always stellar, the baked ziti flavorful and .... screw the adjectives... its just good.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Hands down it is the best pizza establishment in my area.  I would probably even call these guys over Rosati's if they were still around here.It is nice seeing a family run business with good food and friendly staff.  I would give them my business for that reason alone.... it is a huge bonus that the food is phenomenal.
Akaihana Sushi & Grill=After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.We rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.We sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.I ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.As the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.Those who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of "scene."  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!
Promenade Cafe=Depending when or if you eat here, service is really night and day. That being said, I'm breaking this review down to food/service in AM and PMNight:  4 StarsAt night, I noticed that there was only a handful of servers working.  But this wasn't an issue since our food was prepared and delivered pretty quick. The servers are also very attentive and at the same time in no rush to get your out of the restaurant.  For dinner, I had their special, which is their half chicken for $7.99.  Starving like a madman, I ended up getting 2 orders making that one full chicken for me.  Yes, I finished it. Yes, I was stuffed. This was pretty and cheap considering how much I got.  The rest of the menu actually looked pretty good and there's enough of a selection for everybody.Morning: 2 StarsIt's actually busier in the morning and they know this. My issue, service really lags here.  With 8 servers working, you would think that water and our orders would be quicker than 15 minutes. Food comes out quick once you finally get someone to take your order.  It's the pre-order part where you need some patience.  What's worse, once you get your food, your check is also handed to you. It's almost like they can't wait for you to leave unlike at night where our server told is to take our time.  For breakfast, I got their 3 egg white omelet w/spinach and mushrooms. This was so delicious that I almost moved the stars up to 3.I had a good experience at night and a poor one in the morning.  I think that my overall rating of 3 stars is fair.The Promenade Cafe is the cafe of the J.W. Marriott Resort at Summerlin / The Rampart Casino. It is the go to restaurant for casual dining in this Summerlin property.  In the last couple of months when I was in the area I had dinner here. What strikes me about Promenade  Cafe is that it is inside an attractive casino resort that is surrounded by golf courses and upmarket homes, yet charges prices similar to a Boulder Highway casino. On both visits, I'd enjoy a taste of Boulder Highway in the heart of Summerlin.   The two meals that I enjoyed here have been the chicken fettuccine and spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccine is one of three $9.99 deals where you pick a soup or salad, a listed entrée, and choice of a listed dessert. Of course the beverage and tip accelerate the bill to around $15 which is worth it. The food was good. The strawberry cheesecake was puny. On this visit the tone of the service was Allright with the exception of a major restaurant etiquette no! no! When a guest is still working on the entrée, you never ever place the dessert on the table. Talk about being hurried. And why? I was one of the few guests in the restaurant. On Saturday, I stopped here after Dessert Shores where I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs that included soup or salad. It costed $7.99 comparable to an old school casino. Spaghetti with meatballs is also one of the few $9.99 dinners. The $2 difference is the puny dessert. The chicken noodle soup was in a bowl in lieu of a cup that is the standard in many resorts. I appreciated the larger portion. The spaghetti with meatballs was okay. To be honest this is fool proof course that is impossible to mess up. But it fell short of the spaghetti & meatballs that I am a fan of in the Railroad Pass Casino. Three meatballs accompanyed the spaghettis. It would of been nice if Promenade Cafe offered Grated to put on the spaghetti as most places do. Maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor.   Spending some time here, I observed that the Starbuck's down the hall closes around 9 P.M. In the later hours of the evening this is the spot for coffee.  In conclusion, Promenade Cafe is a decent restaurant  to enjoy an old school casino style dinner in the heart of Summerlin. Compared to the cafe in the Sun Coast  a traffic signal south on Rampart Boulevard, I prefer it over the Promenade Cafe. My final verdict: Promenade Cafe 3 Stars.
BlueMoon Vietnamese Kitchen=My daughter and her boyfriend had spotted a "Grand Opening" sign on this little restaurant in a local strip mall recently and wanted to try it so all three of us went here on Monday April 18.  Wow--great place!  The server couldn't have been sweeter, more informative or more attentive.  They have all the usual dishes, plus more unusual ones like Alligator, Snails, Anti-oxident drinks.  I ordered the Quail, fried (or you can get it rotisserie-style), daughter got a chicken dish and shared her delicious rice with me (mine only came with accompanying greens but no noodles or rice), her boyfriend got a combination Pho soup that included pork, liver, quail egg, squid, crab, shrimp, rice noodles and we shared some crispy egg rolls for a starter.Everything was top quality and fresh and very reasonably priced (about $6-8 ea).  We were very happy we went here and the server gave us a coupon for 10% off our next visit.  I will definitely put this one on my go-to list for future trips.Since October, I have had an obsession with the Pho at Blue Moon. Since discovering this little Pho jewel, I've probably come for dinner 14 times - 3 times by myself (I can't believe I'm admitting this to you..). So, clearly I'm a Pho-lover, and as far as Pho goes in the Valley, this place serves some of the best. It's run by a very nice Vietnamese family - always friendly and smiling. The location itself is small and modestly decorated, but it's bright and clean and usually full of people! Most of the times I've come, the majority of the other patrons have been Vietnamese families, which I'd say is a good sign for the authenticity of Blue Moon. Soup has to be one of the most comfortable meals around. At Blue Moon, they serve traditional Pho with rare steak, tripe, and tendon, and also have brisket and meatballs. Don't be shy, get the large! I alternate between rare steak and meatballs, the chicken pho, and then the pho with veggies, and I load each one with a healthy squirt of sriracha hot sauce, sprouts and basil. The veggies usually include carrots, bok choy, and broccoli - colorful, crispy, and plentiful. Love it. If I am very hungry, I start with the egg rolls - shrimp and pork goodness in a crispy wrapper. Although I only ever order the Pho (they have a 50% off special - $3.50 for a great meal!), the rest of their menu looks delicious. They have family dinner specials (for 2 to 6 people) with several different dishes that are a great deal. They have other noodles and soups, as well as meat, chicken or tofu dishes served with rice. They also have seafood appetizers and main courses, like sauteed clams or salted catfish. One day I'll branch out from the Pho and try the other Vietnamese delicacies, but for now, I am hooked on Pho!
Verona Chophouse=Best... Steak... EVER!!That's it. Those three simple words sum up my experience this evening. Oh, you want more?! Okay!!Upon entering the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino on my rez.. the Gila River Indian Community, one can find new slot machines, a lounge with waterfalls that can make someone drunk just from staring at it, fresh clean(ish) air... and my favorite amenity... the Verona Steakhouse!!Entering the nice clean and dare I say it... swanky Chophouse Steakhouse... is both casual and fine dining. Grandma's in their Blue Light special tunics and oxygen tanks sit enjoying enormous Cesar salads that was made table side (!) by well trained servers. I looooove the decor! I small found small touches that reminded me of home, the tortoise shell ceiling that melded traditional Pima basket designs with Italian decals, interesting. There's a nice mural and huge windows that with Cafe 24/7 encircle a very beautiful fountain. (I'm assuming this is to recreate a whirlwind design, which is a well known symbol to my tribe, "all crazy times are a whirlwind" - Pima proverb) If you're dining indoors, especially in the day time its very nice to have these huge windows, I kinda wished we were sitting by one of them! Our server Jessica presented us with some bread and made a dipping sauce made with Bellagio olive oil, balsamic vinegar, freshly grated parm and cracked pepper. Lovely. I couldn't get enough!I ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!! Never, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward. My mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH! I know I know... ugh, some ppl! :P) But it was very good... even if they ruined it to her specifications! We ate to our hearts content and walked away very happy with our meal. I ran into my biological mom (long story) and her husband celebrating their wedding anniversary, I told the waiter and he hooked them up with a free dessert! How awesome is that?! The manager walked the front of the house asking everyone (including us) how our meals were going. They pay attention to the small details, which is something I notice and appreciate. I may not be able to afford it ALL the time... but I will DEFINATLY be back with MANY more in tow!! I wish they were open 24 hours like the other restaurant at the Casino, but alas - they have lunch and dinner service only. To my yelpers, I say... GO, GO NOW!! What are you waiting for?! I don't care if you're not in the area... GO! Its not THAT expensive... quit crying! :P Go and enjoy yourself!! Try some wine and give the Cesar salad that's prepared table side! And don't forget the cannoli! I hear it's yummy! And be sure to play a few slots on your way out! ;)Verona is a welcome addition to the valley.  I don't care for casinos and the smarminess that seems to infuse them.  But once you pass through the smoky crowds and in to Verona, you are in a different place.  For new construction, they managed to pull off some old school steakhouse atmosphere.As for the food:  Let's start with the premise that I don't like steak.  I never order steak.  I ordered a pasta dish and my fabulous wife ordered a surf' n 'turf special with a lobster tail and an 8 oz filet mignon.Next time I'm getting that.  I told our waiter Anthony that I don't really like steak but I would come back for that steak.  Since I would order it medium well, how would they prepare it?  Anthony told me that in that case they would butterfly the cut so that it could be done to my satisfaction yet retain its tender juiciness.  And the lobstah?  I lived in New England for about 3 years before arriving in Phoenix...I've had lobstah that is moments from the boat.  Verona served up a pretty good lobstah tail, particularly considering we are in the middle of the desert.  The roasted new potatoes and asparagus that came with this dinner were delicious as well.My pasta consisted of penne pasta with a rather sweet tomato and cream reduction sort of sauce with Italian sausage and panchetta.  Very tasty but not fabulous.  In true form, this place is all about the steak.We also shared a caesar salad which had a nice and authentic caesar dressing.  By authentic I mean that the anchovy flavor came through nicely.  Oh and it comes in a bowl made of fried cheese.  Seriously.  Take a bite of that bowl.They have a nice wine list and I recommend the listed table red.  Good stuff.  We shared tiramisu for dessert.  Again, very tasty and made authentic with mascarpone cheese, not custard.Service was very good throughout.  My one small complaint was that my water glass went empty several times and it took a few minutes to get a refill.  In fairness, many restaurants miss this mark because I am one of those diners that puts down about a 1/2 gallon of water with a meal.  Just leave the a pitcher after the second or third refill.The Better Half and I had dinner here recently.  We were excited to give it a try.  We ordered:Fried Ravioli, $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Cb5qWTxGOT-CTNHRd_Cuowhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=8SLMGwC5pH0GiMsjM-pT9wSalad, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=jhtp-tVJy5UzPsx55WUs2QOnion Soup, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=5Dyslao6BSIQ0VxV1_Z9pQRigatoni Al Forno (Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Peppers, Red Onions, $16)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=US3FGoiG1caGrHhaFRgZTwFilet, $24http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=ajrFcMCfbTBkt_A-qPCoHQSide of Spaghetti, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Q7bhq4rZOvCuZuvQdHrcPwCheesecake, $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=u4L7008Zsgwss-u8uvih9wThe Fried Ravioli was just OK.  It was very oily and was a little bland.  Not what I expected from this dish....looked a little undercooked or the fryer's temperature was too low.The Salad and Onion Soup was pretty good.  Onion Soup was full of flavor.I had the Filet and thought it was a little tough....the flavor was good, but the Filet was not tender like I'm use to.  The Better Half had the Rigatoni and gave me a little to sample.  It was just OK too....the Sausage tasted more like a Kielbasa rather than an Italian Sausage....not what I expected.  The side of Spaghetti was decent, but again nothing spectacular.The Cheesecake was very good....nice and fluffy.The service was a little spotty.  Our server disappeared for long stretches....which was odd because there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant with people dining.....what he was doing was beyond me.Overall, it was an average experience.  Not what we were expecting from a joint like this.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day?Return Factor - 40%
Delucias Pizzeria=Ok so the first time I tried these guys I gave them 2 stars. I don't know why it took me over a year to try them out again but I should of done it earlier! I remember the pizza was just ok. This time I tried their wings because it was 40 cent wing Tuesday. 60 Wings for 25 bucks is not a bad deal at all. They have some good choices for your sauces. The 6 flavors I got were Spicy Bbq, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Medium Hot, Tangy Carolina, and Honey Barbeque. All were good. I also had two orders of the garlic knots. Man they are addicting! You cant eat just one! Comes with marinara sauce to dip it in. They have all other sorts of food items, like chicken fingers, wraps, and calzones just to name a few. Their large menu has all these and more so if you cant make up your mind, just pick something and come back another time to try the other stuff.These guys have all sorts of specials. If you check in you can get 5 dollars off any 18 inch pizza. They also have a 10 for 20 dollar offer. If you look on their in store to go menu and website, (www.deluciaspizzeria.com) All the daily and weekly specials are on there. My favorites are the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 5 dollars lunch deal and 40 cent wing Tuesdays.Service is good. They are a family owned restaurant so you know they are always trying to work hard to earn your business. Some random info: Hours are Mon thru Thurs 11 am to 9 pm, Fri and Sat 11 am to 10 pm. Closed Sundays. They have a flat screen HD tv so you can watch your favorite sporting event while eating or waiting for your food.So Delucia's im glad I checked you out again and I will be back for sure!I have never been so disappointed in my life after waiting for 40 minutes , I received my order went home and opened the pizza boxes and BURNT BURNT to a crisp , I called and explained to them that the pizzas are burnt they said to come back and I could get a new one . However I live 10 minuets away and the kids were hungry and couldn't waste any more time to on driving back and waiting another 40 minuets to get pizza , so I told them I wasn't able to come back today then she said she could give me 10% off my next pizza really not coming back NOPE not for a 1.50 off 1 pizza after I sent $40.00 bucks .. SO DISAPPOINTEDI've been here twice now and that will be enough for me. The first visit I stopped in on a lunch break around 11:20 am. I noticed a sign outside promoting a 2 slice and drink deal for $5.99, so I asked the lady at the register for that. She rolled her eyes and said they had only opened at 11, so I'd have to wait for the pizza to be made. The lady made me feel like I was bothering her by coming inside and ordering during regular business hours. If they open at 11 then why not have pizza ready or close to ready at 11? I arrived almost a half hour after they were opened she should have been prepared to serve customers and with a friendlier tone. I had planned to eat inside, but asked for it to-go since I felt uncomfortable eating inside because of the vibe I got from the employee. Whens she handed me the food she never said thanks just "here you go" and then went back behind the counter. I often eat at Cugino's on Decatur near the 215 (walmart parking lot) and they also sell pizza by the slice and sometimes run out because they get busy and the older guy there always takes the time to make fresh pizzas and first warn customers how long it will be for the pizza to be ready. I never mind waiting there and wouldn't have minded waiting here at Delucia's if the service and food were worth it. The pizza I had was not cooked all the way. The crust was raw in a lot of spots and I couldn't even eat it. Complete wast of time and money.I met hubby for lunch earlier this week and he picked the spot, being this place, blah. He knows I love pizza and thought we could try this place. He didn't remember this was the spot I told him about not that long ago that served me somewhat raw pizza and that I didn't want to go back. Since he took the time to search the place out I figured I'd give it another try. This visit there were 2 different ladies working behind the counter and they were very friendly and a big change from what I experienced a few months prior. I decided this time to try the pizza again, but this time priced at $6.99 I chose a special that included 2 cheese slices and a side salad. When I opened the box and saw the burnt spots on the 2 cheese slices, it just didn't look appetizing. I bit into the first slice and the crust was stale tasting and burnt. I looked underneath the slices and sure enough it was burnt. I couldn't eat much of it because the flavor was just terrible. I moved next to the side salad. When I first opened the container and saw the salad, I thought it looked very good. The lettuce looked very fresh, but when I mixed up the salad, I found rotten veggies under a big pile of black olives. Gross! Hubby had the same problem with his pizza being burnt and he called a bit later to let them know and they did offer him 10 percent off the next order, but really that's it? The proper thing to do would be to refund the order or better yet, remake the order and try to keep a customer. I noticed in other reviews and pictures that other customers have been having the same issues with burnt pizza and the business responds, so clearly they are aware that this isn't just a random issue, but an issue that keeps happening. I know darn well that the person making my food saw what she boxed up and should have never served it to a customer in the condition it was in. They are fully aware of the type of food they are really putting out. No 3 strikes for me, it's 2 and you're out!Terrible terrible terrible!!! My pizza was burnt and tasted stale and old. I don't know if they heat up pizzas from the day before but it tasted that way. I ordered my food for take out and when I saw how burnt and not edible the pizza was I called to let them know I wasn't happy and they only offered a small discount on my next visit. Pfffft like I will visit here again! The lady on the phone could have cared less and she I'm sure saw the pizza she boxed up and knew it was burnt. I want to see this lady feed her family food just like I got but I'm sure they get fed better. She should have offered a free meal on another visit or that day offered to correct the burnt one. Clearly by other yelp reviews and pictures of burnt pizza that others have posted you can see this place is not a legit pizza place but not even edible. The prices on their menu, website and take out menus all have different prices too which makes the place not look honest. A response from the owner filled with excuses like I see she's done on other reviews means nothing to me you'll never win me back.
Dragon Express=I love this place! My kids love this place! My friends live this place!Dragon Express the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. When we lived in Chandler, we ordered from Dragon Express delivery at least once or twice a month. The food was always fresh and delicious. The manager was super sweet and was always the driver when we ordered. Now that we live in Mesa, we are out of their delivery area so we eat in the dining room when we venture over in that area. It's such an awesome feeling being remembered by the staff since visits are few and far between these days. Hot n Sour Soup, Crab Rangoon, Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian Beef.... Honestly, I don't think we've tried one thing that we haven't loved!Nom nom nom nom... Oh, what's that? That's the sound of me stuffing my face full of food from Dragon Express. The food here is super fresh, perfectly cook (that zucchini - flawless) and has fabulous flavor! Service was friendly and patient as we hummed and hawed deciding what to order and the food came out fast in under 10 minutes. Couldn't be happier with the experience!
Hakkasan Restaurant=This review is for the restaurant only. Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. Hostess: Can I help you?Me: Yes, reservation for David.Hostess: What time?Me: 9:15Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. Me: OK, can we be seated still?Hostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.At this point my wife says to me "let's go".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.I had a really fun dinner here on Saturday night with four girlfriends. This is the perfect spot for dinner before a night out. We shared several things but the highlights were the seabass, the vegetarian dim sum, the sweet and spicy lobster and the chive noodles. Skip the truffle duck. It was a huge disappointment. Cocktails were sweet and strong and the wine we ordered was great. Our server, Brian, was excellent. The macaroons were surprisingly good, albeit a bit random for a Chinese restaurant. After dinner head to the lounge and then the club. Sure to make for a great Vegas evening!3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:OUTSTANDING DISHES:Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included "Try a Little Tenderness" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  DECENT:Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.DON'T EVEN BOTHER:To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.This is a damn good restaurant, I can see where all the hype comes from.  Multiple people in past months have told me that Hakkasan serves some of the best food they have ever had, I had a hard time believing that until yesterday.  The food is exceptional.  My fear was that the plates were going to be small and that I would have to order a lot to get full, but quite honestly, as long as you order one small and one large entree, you should be fine.Highlights for me (carnivore) were the duck salad and the rib eye entree.  Good lord, the duck salad does not look very appetizing when it first comes out, but oh my it was good.  It almost looks like the duck is on a bed of dry grass (looks strange), but do not worry, for a party is about to start in your mouth!!  Clean pieces of crispy duck accompanied with those greens (not really sure what kind they were) with fruit like pomegranate.  The salad was lightly dressed, didn't need help with much of a heavy dressing.  Simple, clean flavors, wow!The rib eye, I have never had rib eye this tender in my whole life.  I need to learn how they prepare it, very exceptional dish.  Cocktails done right!  I suggest the Broken Promise if you are into bourbon.Happy dining!!Having heard about Hakkasan from friends in London and Hong Kong, I was excited to dine at the restaurant with my friends. As a vegetarian, I was impressed not only by the large variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant, but also by the relative authentic flavor of the dishes. Without doubt, Hakkasan is a restaurant that is friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores. All my friends agreed the soup in Hakkasan are authentic and well executed, and they highly recommend the soup to Yelpers. Their favorites are chicken soup and the lobster soup. The former composes of red dates, black chicken and several Chinese medicine ingredients. According to one of my friends, she never had this soup outside of China, and was impressed by Hakkasan's effort in creating this dish. Another friend of mine also greatly enjoyed the lobster soup, which had lobster, tofu and mushroom. In her perspective, the mushroom enhances the flavor, while the tofu complexes the textures. For vegetarian Yelpers, I recommend the mushroom lettuce wrap, which is a refreshing alternative to the tofu lettuce wrap. While the pine nuts increases the texture of the dish, I suggest the chef increasing the ratio of mushroom to pine nuts in order to further enhance the flavor. I appreciate the waitress promptly refiling the lettuce for me. The vegetarian dim sum platter is a beautifully decorated dish that I would suggest sharing amongst friends. Although each dim sum was well executed, it tasted very similar to each other. All the dim sum were mainly composed of mushroom and used similar sauce. I recommend the chef increasing the variety of ingredients and sauce for the dim sum platter. While my friends and I greatly enjoyed the food at Hakkasan, we recommend the manager to provide more training to the waitresses. Our waitress was attentive, but she did not seem to know the menu well and asked my friend repeatedly where she saw fresh lemonade as a drink. As the lemonade was advertised as fresh, I hope Hakkasan will provide fresh juice instead of the sparkling lemonade in the future. I recommend Hakkasan to friends and couples, who are looking for a Chinese restaurant with well-executed food and a hip vibe.Tip for Yelpers:You can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.Ummm ...seriously it will probably take me a few hours just to start this review as I am still in a food coma from Friday night when we all dined at Hakkasan.We made a reservation and were seated immediately, cha-ching. We were all overwhelmed with the menu as honestly EVERYTHING looked spectacular. At the recommendation of our waiter as well as a friend, we ordered:* duck salad - umm yeah so when our friend said "oh you guys should try this" we were all like mmm yeah...duck...about that.... None were interested to try this at all. I am NOT a fan of duck...not just like the polite "oh no thank you" but the like "get that away from me". When it arrived, I was looking over like "should I try it? What do I do?" Everyone else was eating it. I'm supposed to be the foodie over here...Ahh. So I caved. I went for it. Wait for it...wait for it...Hi, I'm Melanie and I now like duck. The flavors all blended together so smoothly that no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. It's scrumptious! A must order. All of us enjoyed it (rare, but then again, it was in a salad, and my friends on the trip only ate salads...women!). I was all like "let's get the fried dumplings" and they're all like "mmm what about a salad?" NO! We are on a vacation and so dumplings we ate...with the salad of course.* hakka steamed dim sum platter - MMMM especially the one with the scallop! AHHH I wanted to order 100 of these. * shanghai dumpling (which I asked them to make steamed rather than fried and they honored this request) - the dipping sauce was out of this world as were the dumplings themselves. I LOVE dumplings...like if there was a word that described love multiplied by 564376724724 to infinity and beyond, I would use that to describe my feelings toward dumplings. It's a sick obsession. Therefore, I have very strict standards of what a dumpling should taste like. Trust me on this one, these dumplings passed the test. I am still dreaming of them.* stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce (I switched the duck for shrimp which again they honored) this thing was like 12 buck$. If anyone can complain in a Yelp review on here about price and portion size, please don't ever dine at a fine dining restaurant ever again. This portion was bigger than a regular full-size dinner portion and yet was listed on the "sides" menu. It was more than satisfying and honestly if I just had this in itself, I would have probably been full. So it honestly ALL depends what you order and you have to pretty much get a sense of the menu to see what the bigger portions will be (or simply just ask). * steamed red snapper in spicy assam sauce - holy moly. Flavor order-load. You just have to experience it for yourself. Seriously. Do it.* cod...yeah I'm just going to put cod because I can't remember which damn one we got (ugh, what a Yelper I am). Take a gamble on this one folks, you have a 50/50 chance of eating what we ate (although I'm sure the other cod dish is equally as good).* fruit plate....yes as we were adjusting our belts (from all the food) and getting ready for a night filled with laughter and cocktails and all that heartfelt butterfly crap (aka a night on the town in Vegas), then the fruit plate came. It was like a scene out of jaws, you know the "dun dun, dun dun" music was playing in our ears and there it was...almost half the size of my entire body. Ok no, but you get the point. It was huge and SO well presented. I seriously did not want to eat it!!! But we did...and it was like we were so full we were about to burst and just couldn't stop eating it...I don't know what else they put in this fruit place besides, well fruit, but yuuuuuuuum! Fruit never tasted so good.With such an extensive menu, of course you are going to have a huge range of things to order and various prices that go along with the various dishes. If you want to dine on a budget, order one main course and maybe 2 sides. There ya go and now stop complaining, geez. You can find things on the menu that are EXTREMELY expensive...if you are on a budget, here's a tip, don't order it. There are reasonable things as well. However, I wouldn't suggest dining at Hakkasan on a strict budget as you really should order many dishes to get the full experience (but it can be done). AMBIANCE. You just have to check it out for yourself...let's just say: amazing. This was definitely a meal to remember and definitely the next time we come back, our first stop will be Hakkasan.3.5 stars so I'm rounding up. I went with a group of beautiful friends. I had a hard time finding this place since I lost my glasses. But if I would've known to look for a big blue wall, I wouldn't have ended up outside MGM! We were still waiting for a few people so we had drinks at the bar. I got The Hakka.We ordered from the $118 prix fixe menu but they also have prix fixe menus starting at $66 as well as a la carte. We had a vegetarian in the group and their vegetarian options actually seemed promising enough for me to want to try it. But no, I'm a carnivore - who am I kidding? From the signature menu, we got a lot of dishes.The Hakka:Vodka, sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice.SMALL EAT:Hakka Fried Dim Sum Platter (roasted duck pumpkin puff, XO seafood puff and crispy prawn dumpling).Jasmine Tea Smoked Beef Short Rib: Seared Scallop with Fresh Mango and Chili Sauce:MAIN:Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey:Crispy Roasted Duck with Kumquat and Mustard Sauce:Braised Tiger Prawn Claypot with Taro in Mandarin Sauce:Stir-fry Rib Eye Beef with Black Pepper and Merlot:Stir-fry Sugar Snaps and Cloud Ear:Egg and Scallion Fried Rice:DESSERT:Coconut Pudding:Coconut pearl pudding, lime financier topped with caramelized spiced pineapple.Chocolate and Black Sesame Cremeux:Black sesame Florentine and yuzu ice cream.Although one might argue that you can get Chinese food for much less in Chinatown, do understand that their version is a bit more sophisticated. They use wagyu, truffles, abalone, etc. which aren't cheap. You're also paying for the location and ambiance.I've been to other Asian restaurants on the strip, and they have one or more of the following issues: low quality food, sad excuses for portions, and/or overpriced dishes.  It's odd to say, but fortunately Hakkasan only suffers from that third one.The interior is really one gigantic space, but seems like a big labyrinth with multiple rooms and halls due to the tall partitions set up throughout.  There are many dining tables and a bar tucked away in the back.  Some drinks were creative, others were easily available elsewhere, but they'll all run you $15-$20 each.The menu has many appetizers, sides, and entrees to choose from, as well as a few tasting menus available, which require four people in your party to order.  For a party of six, we ordered four tasting menus and a few other dishes to round out our meal.  For a set menu that is meant for four, it comes with a surprising amount of food that easily filled up the six of us.  Nothing was disappointing, but the standouts for me were the crispy duck salad (they do not skimp on the portions here, if you enjoy duck, get this dish), duck with truffle oil (again, good portions), and the wagyu beef stir fry.The food was well prepared, in generous portions, and left all of us feeling satisfied.  The part that makes Hakkasan hard to recommend is the pricing.  The tasting menu we ordered was $118 per person, and most dishes are $30 each.  Total for our meal was over $1,000, which is ridiculous for six people eating Chinese food.  Fortunately, and the main reason we came, we were able to enjoy a promotion that got us 50% off our entire bill.  In the end it was around $80 per person, which is much more reasonable, but arguably still a lot.The pricing at Hakkasan makes it hard place to wholeheartedly recommend, but unlike other Asian restaurants on the Strip you'll actually end up with a good meal if you decide to spend the money here.Swanky Anglicised Cantonese served in a modern, chic Asian inspired dining space.  The food; the dog's bollocks.  Excellent.  Unfortunately combine it's Michelin one star status in London with the typical markup on anything Asian on the Strip, the prices will make you ask if they are taking the piss and leave you gobsmacked. (OK enough British slang).Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices. So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***This was a late addition to my Restaurant Week lineup.  I'm so glad I made the change.  I was warmly greeted at reception and asked to wait until one of the people who seat you arrived.  A short time later, I was taken to my table through what appeared to be a maze of small hallways and dining spaces.  I was seated at a table in a section near the bar that was L shaped.Soon, the server, Carmen, arrived and she asked me about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea and that was brought quickly with a small container of simple syrup.  I had studied the menu online and I knew what I wanted except for the main course.  I asked Carmen for her advice.For the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.For the main course, I went with the stir fried venison with spicy yellow bean sauce.  There were three thin slices of venison in a great spicy sauce.  With the venison, I was served two sides--a small container of fried pak choi with garlic and a small bowl of vegetable fried rice.  Carmen brought me a knife and fork for this course knowing it would be easier to deal with the meat.  I had requested wooden chopsticks (they don't have them) because I am very poor at using plastic chopsticks.  Things slip off plastic chopsticks very easily even when I'm just looking at them.  I'll have to bring in my own wooden ones or my screw together metal chopsticks that were a gift.  Again, the dish was spicy but it was not overpowering spicy.  It was quite enjoyable.There is no choice for dessert.  You get a passion fruit panna cotta with, as the menu says, citrus supremes, guava gelato, and blood orange sorbet.  Carmen had me listen to a crackling sound when she first brought the dessert.  She wouldn't tell me what it was but said I should try it and we'd talk about it when I was done.  I had two things in mind for what it was.  I was correct with the second idea.  They put some pop rocks on the panna cotta to make a bit of a texture play.  The panna cotta was very good.To sum up, the food really is the "dog's bollocks!" (Thanks R).  Portion size was just right and they downsized the sides because I was dining alone.  The room is delightful--not one large room but made up of many smaller areas.  The restaurant really isn't all they big in the great scheme of things.  Service was excellent.Before bringing the bill, Carmen brought me a coupon good for $50 on my next visit as long as it's used before April 10.  She said, "It's like having your dinner tonight for $.14."  I will be back and use the coupon.  I have to do the sea bass which she said was their most popular dish and is excellent.  One short aside:  I can hike in the desert where there's no trail.  Leaving last night without an escort, I ended up almost in the kitchen.  Then I realized I had almost made a complete trek around the outside ring of the place.  I did make it to the door and was somewhat embarrassed getting lost in the small space.  It's a like a maze!I'm glad that Restaurant Week gives me the chance to try some new places that I normally wouldn't.Amateur hour as far as management and staff.We had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly.  The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine.  That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered.  Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.Hakkasan's Restaurant Week menu looked like a winner, and after sampling its offerings, my dining experience here proved to be that and more.  First off, the place is quite classy and elegant.  It has an upscale ambiance with seating divided into small cloistered sections by iron and wood partitions.  Cushioned half-booth seating features different colorful Chinese dragons embroidered on off-white expensive-looking fabric.For the appetizer course, a Steamed Dim Sum Platter featured a woven basket holding big bite-size morsels of Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Chinese Chive Dumpling, and a Black Pepper Duck Dumpling.  The fat dumplings were all very well made by hand, and delicious.  I liked each one, as well as my bite of Diane's Crispy Fried Prawn Dumpling that was rich with prawn meat, enhanced by fruity and sweet but not overpowering Plum Sauce, and decorated with Fried Rice Paper Noodles sprouting out of the prawn's top.An add-on of Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, suitably spicy, and filled with delicate thin noodles.  But in retrospect, I wish I had instead ordered the Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken because I was later informed that it was identical to the vegetarian variety with chicken added, and both soups were priced the same.  To help wash everything down, I enjoyed excellent house-brewed Mint Decaf Hot Tea, with the tea leaves blocked by a tiny strainer. My entree of Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey, alongside a few fried Enoki Mushrooms, was very tasty.  Sections of well-cooked moist white fish burnished by the honey flaked off nicely onto a fork.  Fine, generously portioned sides of glistening, stir-fried Pak Choy with Garlic and Egg Fried Rice rounded out and embellished this portion of the meal.Inventive Summer Exotic Cold Watermelon Soup with assorted berries and Lychee Sorbet brought our memorable dinner to a refreshing close.  Service was exemplary throughout the night, and wet towels were produced at meal's end for a nice final touch.  It was a great Restaurant Week meal.In sum, Hakkasan offers a very refined Cantonese dining experience that is expensive, but worth it!  Now that I have had a taste of its stellar cuisine, I will surely be back to enjoy more.A friend and I came here last night to have their Golden Week prix fixe menu offered during two weeks coinciding with the Golden Week in China.  Except for a service glitch, the meal was excellent!My dining companion and I decided we'd like to try the crab and sweet corn soup as well.  This was brought first and even though we were sharing, we were not brought smaller, separate bowls so we just ate out of our communal soup bowl.  The soup was not exceptional in any way.  In fact, I tasted just like egg drop soup.  We were not finished with this extra soup when servers brought out our small eats--the Peking duck and the steamed dim sum platter.  This was the first of two times when we were rushed by bringing out dishes when we weren't ready.  It didn't happen again when it was made clear that they should hold up on more main dishes.The Peking duck was fantastic.  Small pieces of duck with a small amount of breast with crispy skin, a thin rectangular pancake, and some crispy cucumber.  The duck was topped by Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar.  The flavors of the caviar with the duck and the crispy cucumber was great.  The dim sum platter consisted of har gau, scallop shumai, a perch dumpling, and a black pepper duck dumpling.  The flavors were again wonderful!The mains started arriving a bit too quickly and this is where we asked them to wait until we were finished with these first ones.  The three mains brought out were the braised whole sea bass in claypot, the crispy prawn, and the fried rice with diced abalone.  The crispy prawn was a spicy dish.  It had three green peppers with heat and it was served with dried chili and cashew nuts.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and there were nice pieces of tofu with the bass.  The fried rice was very good!After a break, we got the last two mains--spicy Szechuan rib-eye beef and the roasted crispy chicken.  The beef was a star of the meal.  The beef was in a rich sauce, not very spicy at all despite its name, and served on a bed on enoki mushrooms.  The chicken was fairly moist and the crispy skin was a delight.  The mushrooms with the chicken were wild mushrooms and the chicken was in an oyster sauce.  For dessert, we got black sesame and chocolate dumplings with ginger/yuzu tea.  There were some small boba like lime balls on the dumplings and the dumplings were filled with a semi-sweet chocolate.  Wow!  What a way to end the meal.We were each given a large Hakkasan bag--a takeaway gift--of two yuzu macarons with a chocolate cream filling.  They did make it home, but I ate them later.  The chocolate cream and the macarons were perfect!This was a special meal and it's not a 5 star review for me this time because of the service.  With a meal like this, pacing should have been better and dishes not brought out before others were finished.  Our server, Leigh, was very knowledgable and very pleasant and she answered questions when we posed them.Hakkasan remains high on my list.  It is Las Vegas Strip pricing plus, but I think it's worth the splurge now and then.On a Sunday, our first night in town, the wife and I and a couple of friends went to dinner at Hakkasan.  We started off with drinks.  The wife's Smoky Negroni, while pricey at $18, was well made with top shelf ingredients (barrel aged Ransom Old Tom gin, Carpano Antica vermouth, Campari, and Grand Marnier all infused with smoke in a decanter) and possessed the expected traits of the classic original with bold, but pleasant smoky notes.  My Manhattan ($17) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, atomized Oloroso sherry, and Angostura bitters was no less successful possessing nice nutty notes on the nose from the sherry.  Sadly, Hakkasan's cocktails were the highlight of our night. Rather than pick items from the dinner menu, we decided to leave it in Hakkasan's hands and ordered its $88 Signature Tasting Menu figuring it would be a well thought out sampling of its signature items.  Our meal started off with the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter consisting of har gau, scallop shumai, perch dumplings, and black pepper duck dumplings.  The selection of dim sum was beautifully presented, flavorful, but not much different and certainly no better than what you can find being pushed on a cart in a traditional Chinese restaurant.  With the exception of the Roasted Mala Chicken with Cucumber and Cloud Ear Mushrooms, the Stir-fry Asparagus with Dried Shrimp and Preserved Vegetables and the desserts, the remaining dishes we were served were surprisingly one note in their preparation and/or flavor profiles as they were either fried (Salt and Pepper Squid, Crispy Silver Cod with Superior Soy Sauce, Crispy fried Red Snapper) or topped with a sweet and sour style sauce (Sweet and Sour Pork with Pomegranate) or a combination of both.  Taken as a whole, the tasting menu was inexplicably strange and disappointing.  Nothing tasted off or bad and it all seemed properly prepared, but the food was not appreciably better than what you could get at PF Chang's or your neighborhood Chinese take-out joint and the food definitely never came close to meriting its $88/person price tag. The only things that saved this from being a one-star review were the solid (albeit pricey) cocktails and the attentive service we received throughout our meal.  However, for an acclaimed restaurant brand and a Michelin-starred chef, Hakkasan and its tasting menu was easily the most disappointing and worst value meal I've ever experienced.  Save your money and skip.
Soul Gastrolounge=I came to the incredible realization last night that I haven't written a review for Soul yet?! Since I've eaten here, oh, I don't know seven or eight times, you think I would have gotten around to it by now. Nope. So, here we are. Months later and I've had many a dish at Soul. The interior is cozy and dark, the staff has always been friendly and helpful while choosing from their extensive menu. Yes indeed it can get crowded, so plan your evening accordingly! Here's the low down on the dishes I've tried:White Bean & Goat Cheese Dip: 3/5: Tasty white beans mixed into a (cool) creamy goat cheese. Served with snappy little pita chips. I kind of wish it was warm, but the flavors make me come back to it often. Goat Cheese Crostini: 4/5: Toasty balls of goat cheese atop a lovely crostini piled with tomato and onion. Yum.Shrimp Ceviche: 5/5: Bangin'. Just damn good. Perfectly prepared and full of flava. Guacamole Stack: 2/5: Meh. Not bursting with flavor and I'm always searching for some type of carb to pair with this lovely stack of avocado. Tuna Tacos: 3/5: I love the fresh tuna & the sauce but I dislike the overly fried flavor of the encompassing taco shell. Soul Roll: 5/5: DELISH. One of my favorite sushi rolls in Charlotte - 'tis flavorful, punchy and super fresh.Gyro: 2/5: I prefer Showmars, frankly. The meat or mix within the meat tasted sweet?! A bit strange. Cupcakes: 3.5/5: I've tried two types and had two different reactions. My first was a cookies & cream - it was tasty but dry. Sad face. Then, last night I tried the snickerdoodle cupcake - delicious, not dry whatsoever. Mouth watering cinnamony sugary goodness topped with buttery frosting. Nom. I know I'll be back to this eclectic eatery soon - there is truly a dish for every bud and tastebud!I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.I have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who "greeted" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word "greeted" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a "Hello" or a "Welcome", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a "How many?"  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was "obviously very small" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.A bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, "Well did you settle your bar tab?"  I've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.The waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.Food was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.I think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.I will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone.This place has got soul! Too cheesy? It's okay just keep reading it gets better I promise. I just had to! Originally this was going to be a 5 star review but after a prompt return visit the hostess's bitchiness and ineptitude caused me to take away a star. More on that later. Buckle up kids this is going to be a long review.I probably have to give Soul the award for some of the most creative and tastiest cuisine I've ever had in Charlotte. Yes it's that good. Even when you order something that sounds fairly normal, they managed to give it a creative twist. I'm so appreciative of that! The interior is very small, crowded and very loud. So be prepared for a long wait sometimes, especially since they don't take reservations. But the staff is nice without being over the top, and water refills are kept up. I especially like that they serve it with cucumber instead of the usual lemon. I never like the taste of lemon in water, but I do love the flavor a slice of cucumber can infuse!My first trip here I went with tuna sashimi tacos, an amazing duck confit pasta topped with crispy sweetbreads and foie gras, and grilled toast topped with wild mushrooms and a fried egg with a Dijon vinaigrette. Finished with last but not least goat cheese ice cream. This meal contained probably some of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere in Charlotte. Lets start with the tuna tacos, I've had something similar to this dish while I was in Cali, it was a deconstructed fish taco and so I was excited to find it here! It did not disappoint at all! The guacamole was flavorful and added dimension and fattiness to the tuna while the fried wonton wrapper gave it a lovely crunch, yum.Next up came the duck confit pasta, now if the last dish was awesome this would qualify as a masterpiece. The duck confit paired with the delivered such amazing flavors that this dish could have easily fit into a high class restaurant. The foie gras' earthiness and richness complemented the pasta and gave it amazing depth of flavor, while the crispy sweetbreads brought the whole dish together some much needed texture. This dish is best eaten in small amounts though because it had such a rich, luxurious mouthfeel I felt quite sated after finishing half of the plate.The last savory course of the evening was grilled wild mushrooms with a dijon vinaigrette over charred toast and topped with a fried egg. I wasn't even going to get this dish because I was quite full but I saw the table next to us get it and I had to have it. I thought this dish was the most balanced of the night with complex flavors and textures melding together in glorious harmony. Just get the thing and you'll be singing it's praises too.Feeling like an overstuffed plush at this point, I decided to go all in and order the goat cheese ice cream. You could taste the grassiness of the goat cheese and the ice cream felt surprisingly low fat which surprised me. I think I'd prefer it if the flavor kicked me in the face next time like *WHAM* that's goat cheese alright! and maybe make the ice cream a bit more decadent? I just feel like you want to go all out for dessert and this let me down a bit.The music here is very very very loud. I couldn't hear what my dining partner about a foot away was saying, I almost contemplated just texting each other across the table. The hostess the first time was perfectly nice, but my second time was so rude, unfriendly, and nasty that I just took my business elsewhere. For such excellent food though I'll brave all these missteps and take my chances.Goodness, Soul. You make Tapas and Gastronoms fall in love so easily. There are quite a few things worth trying: Brunch: On Sundays. Best Greek Yogurt with honey I've ever had. Perfect and pretty sure its made in house? Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepeño give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin. LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time. Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic. FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing. Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch. Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting. The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night. Love Soul. Places like this make Charlotte more unique. The dining experience is different every time and there always seems to be something new to try. Culinarily daring, busy as all get out and worth every penny.So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch. I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits. Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too. _________________*Depending on your perspective, I suppose you could say that I bothered a lot of strangers.Soul has made a lot of changes since I've last visited when they first opened. I've recently gone back to meet star bartender Andy Maurer. If you're looking for a great, fun and creative cocktail experience...this is where you need to be. None of that crazy "mixology" stuff, just great drinks for real cocktailers. Also great food! The Korean BBQ wings, amazing! Friendly staff and great music. Most Monday's are old school night. And, I mean real old school. Marvin, Teddy, The Spinners, real deal music. Even if you just go for brunch, make sure you get there!This place is amazing. By far the best food and drinks I've ever had. And it's in Charlotte! And so close to my house. The food here is seriously like sex in your mouth. Everything is delicious. This night I got to taste a friends lobster soup and I swear I wanted to jump in the bowl and live in it. I haven't had anything here is didn't like. Example cold meat plate. I would never order that but it's amazing. And of course the lamb skewers are incredible. Better than a filet. Truffle fries, well yes please! This place need to never close down. And don't get discouraged by your long wait. It's totally worth it. In fact order as much as you can with a friend or many friends and share. Taste as much as you can. I haven't had the brunch but that's hopefully going to be my next visit.People ask me all the time for suggestions on where to go to eat. This is easily one of the places in Charlotte I mention the most.No, they don't take reservations. Just go ahead and get over it. Sure, it would be nice. You know what would also be nice? If they gave me free cocktails, but they don't do that either. See, it sounds pretty ridiculous now doesn't it? Expect a wait. There's a wait for a reason. Go early and put your name on the list, then walk downstairs to Twenty-Two or over to Workman's Friend for a drink. They'll text you when your table is ready.If you looked through the user pictures on here, you've probably figured out that the pork belly tacos are the most popular item. I agree, they're my number #1 at Soul. I also like the tuna tacos, soul roll, and hamachi with jalapeno. My most recent adventure here was with the lovely Sarah C and we felt it was our duty to order the giant shells and cheese stuffed with pork belly. I can't think of anything on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. My roommate and her bestie love the shrimp ceviche. Cocktail menu is also great. I usually always start with a Tito's Cucumber Mule. Price-wise, this is a place where you can very easily spend a lot of money. It's easy to get caught up in the delicousness and order a bunch of plates. Sarah and I split four small plates and three cocktails... $87 before tip. Only other thing you really need to know: parking blows. The JLC WearHouse across the street closes at 7pm, so I'll park there or the breakfast place next door to it. Just make sure to pay attention to all the signs in this area before you park.
Poke Express=THE SASHIMI DEAL OF THE CENTURY!!!I hang out with a couple of Enlightened dudes (and yes, they are the real deal) and the other day as we were chewing on the Dharma one of them said, "I'm going to show you a place that is going to blow your mind, and I mean, really blow your mind." When an Enlightened being tells you that, you better hold onto your ego (if you wanna keep it, that is) 'cause mind-blowing is their forte. But how many times have I heard "I've got the BEST sushi place in the city!" only to have it be a decent but standard restaurant?Once we got to Poke Express, however, my mind WAS blown. Poke Express is not your typical sushi restaurant. Hell, it's not even a restaurant, it's more like a sushi deli. Scratch that, like a SASHIMI DELI! This place is run by a bunch of laid back Hawiians and they sling some of the best damn raw fish that I've ever put in my mouth. Poke is basically sashmi cut up into bitesized pieces and then dressed in various sauces. The Salmon was awesome (although I love it best when I squeeze a bunch of fresh lemon on it). The Ahi is incredible and can be prepared several different ways. I highly recommend Wasabi style and Hawiian style, but I can't imagine that any of the styles would be anything but lip-smacking GREAT.You buy it in 1/2 lb and 1 lb containers. A half pound is great for lunch, but if you're a glutton, you can get 1/2 lb of one and 1/2 lb of the other and really pig out. "But wait," you say, "A POUND of sashimi? That's gonna break the bank!" Au contraire, mon fraire! This uncooked sea dwelling yumminess goes for only $9.00 PER POUND. Yeah, I said PER POUND! Holy Hamachi, Batmansan, one could get THREE POUNDS OF SASHIMI for the price of an All You Can Eat sushi deal, and it's SASHIMI, not the rice laden sushi that we AYCE suchi buffs have to tolerate to get our little fishy friends down our gullet.Friggin MAKE THE DRIVE to Craig and Revere and check this place out. Buy some for today and buy another container for lunch tomorrow. I'm going to be finding excuses to make it over to this part of town every chance I get. If Can, Can. If No Can, No Can!Yes, Poke Express is all that and a bag of chips!  Bringing the Husband here earned me some definite brownie points - we liked it so much that we returned twice within a week, despite us living all the way across town!They have a generous selection of tuna poke, salmon poke, dried fish, and a bunch of other edible goodies that one would expect from a place like this.  Upon entering, we were warmly greeted and took our time perusing they offerings.  When they learned it was our first time, they insisted we try their fish selection.  They wanted us to be sure we liked what we ordered and we happily obliged. Our first visit, we finally walked out with: * Ahi Poke Chile Water Style ($10.49/lb) - Tuna poke that is fresh, tasty, and with a bit of spice.  * Spicy Salmon Poke ($9.99/lb) - I love spicy sauce that is mayonnaise-based with masago mixed in and they do this right! Yum!* Ahi Poke Limu ($10.49/lb) - I slight mix-up in my order since I wanted the Spicy Tuna Poke, but decided to keep it nonetheless since we had already left.  Still tasty and fresh! * Raw Kim Chee Tako ($16.99/lb) - An acquired taste for those not too sure about raw octopus.  The Husband and I like this slimy concoction and they offer it two ways here.Our return visit, we also added an order of:* Top Shell Poke Kim Chee Style ($17.99) - These sea snails aren't for everyone with a slight rubbery texture.  They will mix up the raw fish with whatever sauce they have, so it's pretty much mixed to order!Poke Express is a deli of sorts, unfortunately there's no tables inside or out for eating right then and there.  But I'm sure you'll find a bunch of customers chowing down in their cars right in the parking lot, like us! Be sure to call ahead to find out when they close.  We came the week before Christmas, so the hours varied. They are also CLOSED on Wednesdays!  Also, they ran out of salmon poke during our order so ask to be sure about they have left if it's near the end of the day. They are located in the shopping center where Big Lots is!Thank you yelpers for bringing me here! We'd probably be here everyday if it was closer...thank goodness it's not then!So, we found out that most of their poke is from the islands.  No wonder it taste so freakin' awesoooome!  It tasted like the real deal.  Worth every bit of a detour in Vegas if you're Hawaiian or if you just love eating poke.  They're in North Las Vegas though so it's impossible to get there without a car or forking out some cheddar for a taxi.  Thankfully, we had a car handy, but I wouldn't mind paying a taxi fare to go there though...yeah, it's that good!The people at Poke Express are cool too.  They allow you to get some samples if you're unfamiliar with a certain item they sell.  The customer service at Poke Express is incredibly good.  True Hawaiian kind.  We left the young dude that helped us with a pretty good tip...it's Vegas baby, Vegas!  Gotta reward good customer service.Anyways, check out my pics to see what I got.  I liked everything but my favorites are the Raw Crab Poke Kim Chee Style and the Wasabi Raw Tako.  You can't go wrong when you're there.  Just ask for a sample and let the poke take control of your senses.  Peace out, brothas and sistahs.I won't lie, I was hesitant to pop in here because of the location-I mean who gets quality, fresh fish in North Las Vegas? Really? Really?Poke Express is a refreshing change from the below average chain establishments that litter Craig Rd. from east to west, offering not only the freshest catches but Hawaiian products and customer service that is really unparalleled.North Las Vegas. I KNOW. Hear me out.I've stopped in here a couple of times and I believe the owners are a husband/wife team and I've been helped by both individuals while there. Maybe being a lifetime Las Vegan has conditioned me to not expect good customer service....anywhere. I don't know why I'm always surprised to be treated well when I patronize an establishment, but I was really caught off guard by how genuinely nice, helpful and friendly the owners of Poke Express were. Samples. Check. Thorough explanation of daily offers. Check. Recommends of nearby eateries, including what they might consider competitors. Check.But let's get down to what really matters: the fish. You'll have to dig deep in these parts to find ahi this fresh, but I'd dare say that you'd have to do some serious digging around town period to find ahi of this caliber. Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. They have different kinds of poke which I didn't know was an option (my knowledge of poke is minimal, so thought that poke was just another name for tuna)-shrimp, octopus, other kinds of fish-raw and cooked all available in a variety of flavors. I've ordered the spicy ahi and wasabi ahi and recommend both, but the spicy ahi was my favorite. If you come earlier in the day you can get samples and all available varieties are out on display. The first time I went was later in the afternoon and the glass case was mostly empty, but one of the owners explained to me that when it's that late in the day, they make it to order. Prices are market price and they charge by the pound. I found the prices to be pretty reasonable as again you are paying for top notch seafood in the middle of the desert. And their top-notchedness (yup, just made that up), isn't relative to surrounding crappy food establishment-Poke Express sets the bar city-wide for quality. Simply amazing. I would have left here pleased even if the customer service was just so-so, but the owners are quality which made the experience really count for me. I hope they liked me as much as I liked them. Because they're going to be seeing a lot more of me. Soon.I went here since I was craving some fresh tuna and it's close to home. They have a lot of options: spicy, Hawaiian, wasabi, octopus (tako), crab, imitation crab, shrimp, salmon. There also also garlic bulbs, edamame and kimchi. They have Hawaiian goodies such as Hawaiian popcorn, chocolate covered macadamia nuts, lihing powder, crackers, guava jelly, etc.I got a pound each of their wasabi ahi, spicy salmon and Hawaiian ahi - per the boyfriend's request. They gave me a free tub of wasabi ahi! The ahi and salmon were so fresh (not mushy and gross) and packed with flavor.  A pound of fish is about $14.  The wasabi ahi can clear your sinuses without a problem.  The spicy salmon isn't spicy at all - it has a mildly spicy mayo and masago.  Everything was soooo delicious!I had to make rice for the boyfriend since they don't serve rice at Poke Express - which isn't a big deal to me since rice is easy to make and I don't even eat rice.  They don't have tables and chairs - it's mainly a to-go place.The owners (husband and wife) were nice and very friendly. We were talking about baskteball and that sealed the deal for me! Good conversation + excellent food = happy customer who definitely will be coming back for more.Came here because of Nelson Q. and his wonderful UYEs.  Their poke is wonderfully good!  I love both their traditional style pokes as well as some of their explorative variations.  I don't think you can go wrong here with what you order, but even better than that is the fact that you can taste anything before you buy it!...I'm told you need to come earlier do that consistently though since they run out of some of the prepared items.  If you need a place to start though, check out their   Ahi Shoyu, Spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu,and Limu Tako Poke.Some have complained that they are a little expensive...I still think it's worth it though and don't know of any better poke around...so if it's poke you want Poke Express is a must.They are a counter style small business without any seats.  Nelson brought us a few doors down to 808 Mixed Plate since they're owned by the same family and allow you to eat Poke Express items in their...plus 808 is tasty enough to check out while you're there as well.Some of the best things come in small packages. Case in point. Just like the "Hole In The Wall" and "Mom and Pop" places, if you are not paying attention, you can drive right by this place. Ironically, this place is also family owned, so both clichés apply.With that said, the 100+ 5 star review average is a definite eye catcher.  As soon as I saw that, I knew I had to check it out hoping I wouldn't get disappointed. Well I am happy to report that the 5 star average is legit.As soon as you come in, you are greeted warmly. When you look around, they have all sorts of Hawaiian themed merchandise. They have drinks, hats, seasonings, and even poi.As for the main products. Just stroll on over to the big glass case where they have all the good stuff. Tip: Come right when they open so you can sample all the products because as soon as the afternoon comes around, most of the good stuff cant be sampled any more.I ended up sampling the Crab Combo. After that first bite, we knew were getting at least a pound of that stuff. It has imitation crab meat and vegetables mixed with some kind of spicy chipotle mayo sauce. A pound of it came up to about 8 bucks and some change. If you ask me, I think they put some kind of drug in it because I couldn't stop eating it! As for the different kinds of Ahi, we went with the Kim Chee Ahi, promising to come back to try the other mouth watering options just based off the pics alone. We got a pound of it which came out to about 14 and  some change.So in closing, probably the only thing that might subtract a star would be their hours. They are open Mon thru Tues, Thurs thru Sat 10 am to 6 pm. Sun 10 am to 5 pm. CLOSED WEDNESDAYS! Remember, this is a market/store type of place so the hours are not as weird as it seems. Their food and service more than make up for a potential subtraction of one star. So a "Mahalo" seems fitting for these guys and an "Aloha" from me since its the end of the review.Freshest poke I've had in Las Vegas!   No reason to go into too much detail about Poke Express since it's been done with all these reviews on here. If you love fresh poke and never been to Poke Express, then you're missing out.  All the 5 star reviews for Poke Express isn't hype.  If you crave fresh "as good as it gets" poke, then Poke Express needs to be on your list.

It's been a long time since my previous visit and they still treated me like they know me.  They definitely know their regulars by name. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (054/366)I'm not going to pretend I am an Ahi Poke expert. I'm not going to claim I know what Poke is suppose to taste like. But I will say this-- BEST POKE I HAVE EVER HAD thus far. I've been wanting to try this place out for years but for some reason Poke Express always loses the argument when it comes to other places to eat. Today I wanted something small & not a big meal so I opt for poke! Definitely not what I had imagined. It's a very small store. You can't sit anywhere to eat, not a restaurant. You just tell them what you like and you gotta get outta there. The Pokes weren't out because we came around 4 & they make it to order at this time of the day. If you come when they open, 10am, all the Pokes will be out so you can actually try them all out before you decide which one you want. The staff were very helpful to us first timers. I decided on the Spicy Ahi & the crab combo. & they were sooooooo good! The crab combo had a good kick to it. The ahi wasn't spicy at all but nonetheless still really good! Only bad thing about it was, I didn't order more! Next time I want to try the Kim Chi Ahi & the wasabi ahi! Definitely coming back!If there is ONE thing that I love, its raw fish!! People think it's weird that I only like my fish raw, not cooked..but damn, I feel like that's the way to GO! Poke Express is a Hawaiian Poke Deli shop. It almost has an Asian mart feel with lots of choices for those seafood lovers, baby! There IS more food than just poke, but I haven't tried them yet!! Still trying to cover the whole poke area of the store. ;P They have quite the selection!It is located kind of in the corner of a shopping area, so you -really- have to look to see it! AND ya can't eat there because they don't have seats, so please just don't stand there and eat..that's weird! Go home!The owner gives out great customer service! He tells everyone to come in at 10 AM to try free samples! He was also super friendly, patient, and helpful in explaining all of the food to my boyfriend, who had never eaten poke before :) Also, they do give a military discount here, which was pretty cool of them. The only two poke flavors that I have tried are the Hawaiian and Garlic poke, but I really loved both of them. The quality of the fish is excellent~ It's as fresh as it gets and delicious, too! The prices are pretty reasonable as well!So if you want a taste of the Island, stop by Poke Express--it's a place to be!!!My Yelp buddies deserve all the credit for pointing me and my wife in the right direction for a terrific lunch in North Las Vegas. Poke Express is a no-frills eatery; actually, it's more of a market with a few shelves of food products and two refrigerated cases of their sublime poke. Although traditionally served raw, there are many varieties of poke offered here: on your left are the cooked and on your right are the uncooked versions. These include different types of seafood, but I still prefer the standard tuna.  What makes Poke Express five-star worthy is not only the seafood, but the stellar service. Our server was thoughtful and friendly, and he encouraged us to try the various poki while explaining each. Even after a few samples he persuaded us to try others and we happily obliged. Finally, we settled on two uncooked selections: the poke with oyster sauce and the spicy ahi poke. Both were amazing: the tuna in each was fresh, meaty, and flavorful. We enjoyed each one, but gave a slight nod to the spicy ahi poke, with the spicy sauce being an excellent blend of heat and flavor. You pay by the pound here, with most in the $14.99/lb range, and they have plastic containers to show how much you'll receive. For our two half-pounds, the final total was just over $15 with tax. Again, nothing fancy, just our containers of fresh and delectable poke (and two pairs of chopsticks). My wife and I could not wait to eat our lunch, and we devoured both containers in the car, A/C keeping us cool as we stuffed ourselves to the gills.PHONE YOUR ORDER AHEAD OF TIME!!!! The tuna poke goes FAST. I was already warned to do this, but I didn't because my schedule was very loosely planned. *shrugs*.I was still able to sample some stuff and enjoyed my order thoroughly. \LOVE that they do tako wasabi here. The kimchi octopus is tasty as hell too. I usually get this at sushi boat places but they sell it here by the lb! In the end I wound up with tako wasabi and spicy salmon poke. SO GOOD. Wish I had some chips to eat it with..They also sell Hurricane popcorn by the bag. Service is prompt and they've very friendly. P.S. This place is way out in the boonies.. like, the hood. If you don't have a car, don't cab it.Oh yes, POKE!!!!!!!  Real Hawaiian POKE!!  I bookmarked this place for months and finally went last year as it was a little out of the way.  Lots of variety of poke and they even had salmon poke!  (not many place do salmon besides lomi lomi).  Well I just moved and I'm way closer to Poke Express and I've gone twice in the last 2 weeks already!  heheI've been going close to closing time so I'm not sure if it's different during the day - but they make all my ahi poke fresh from scratch.  I love that since I know it wasn't sitting out all day and getting dried out.  They also have freezers filled with mochi ice cream, icees, frozen salmon parts, and other "Hawaiian" staple foods like noodles, buns and even pasteles.  They also have dried goods available for sale.I met one of the owners the other day and he was really cool to chat with.  I miss local people (I lived on O'ahu for the last 8 years) so it was nice.  The other guys running the store have all been really cool and nice as well.  This is definitely a must try for anyone wanting some poke on the mainland.When my friends told me that the best Poke on the mainland comes from the desert of Las Vegas, I thought they were kidding.  How could it be?  Surely they were messing with me, I thought as my GPS took me through an industrial area of North Las Vegas.  Then like a mirage in the middle of the desert, I see a shopping center appear out of no where.  Located in the midst of the shopping center was Poke Express.  As I entered, I was greeted by the workers working there.  When it was my turn, the girl helping me was great.  They had different flavors of Ahi and Salmon poke.  If fish isn't your thing, they also had octopus, mussels and seaweed salad.  As usual, with so many choices, there was no way that I would be able to pick.  But, it was okay, Just like Costco, they let me sample all of them.  They even offered me more when I couldn't make up my mind.  I ended up getting the Spicy Ahi Combo with avocado, cucumber and crab, and the Ahi Poke with sweet Chili sauce.  They had just ran out of rice when it was my turn, but, that was okay because I ordered more poke.  The Poke, both the samples, and the two I ordered were great.  The fish was fresh.  The flavor was better than anything that I have ever had.  In Southern California, Pokinometry is the measuring stick for good poke.  The wrong standard is being used.  Poke Express is much better and should be the standard that all other Poke should be compared to when outside of Hawaii.  Poke Express is better than all other Poke places I have been to.  Their friendliness and service is better than any of the places I've been to.  They may be a little far from the strip, but, it is worth the drive.  Believe it when someone tells you that the best Poke is found in Vegas.  Even though you might think that you are headed into some industrial area, you won't go wrong coming here.
Cici's Pizza=All-you-can eat pizza buffet & drink for $7. It is just buffet pizza lots of different variations and you can request any you can imagine-mac n chz,hot dog, pepperoni & jalapeno,hawaiian & more. There's about 10-12 varieties on the buffet at a time. There's lots of people here so there's usually something new every time back to the buffet. They also have 2 salads, soup & bread sticks plus 2 desserts and they serve Coca-Cola products. It's cafeteria-style seat yourself and there is a small arcade and several flat screen TVs. For buffet pizza this place is OK. BUT for pizza it's crap-No flavor, sauce was weak, thin flavorless crust or thick & doughy, all the toppings were over processed and the cheese was invisible. Worst yet less than 5 minutes after leaving this place I had the uncontrollable feeling that everything needed to exit my body from one end or the other.I recently discovered Cici's Pizza over the Summer thanks to a friend of mine that lives near one in the Northwest part of Vegas.  Since then, I've visited 3 locations in the Valley.  This was the third one.My Son and his friend wanted to get some Pizza before the UNLV Football game on Saturday.  Since this location was on the way to the Stadium, we stopped here for lunch.  AYCE Pizza Buffet priced at $3.99 per person is pretty good....don't you think?This Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!Overall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!Will I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably.
Z-Grill=Ohhhh when it comes to Pakistani / Indian cuisine in the Valley, Z-Grill has my heart and taste buds.  For those of you who don't do dive-y joints quit reading now and move on.  For those more adventurous you will be pleased.  Located inside Zam-Zam World Market on 40th St, North of McDowell, you can blink and miss it.  Wander in to the back past the butcher and you order at the window.  They may not have everything listed on the menu so you may have to ask or reorder. It is a small but flavorful selection, they don't skimp on the seasoning or the spice here.  Thus making it an even more euphoric experience.  I stick with the Naan and the poori for your side options...the last time i tried the rice it tasted like it was steamed in the burlap sack....unless you mixed it with the curry...But this was not enough to deter me from going back every 4 days for about a month...Which reminds me I need to get back there soon!Only in town for the evening on business, I hopped on the trusty ol' Yelp app to see what the locals were saying.   My ego was fragile and my belly empty, so I skipped the Yelp Talk and went right to the "nearby" button. Imagine my surprise when a Pakistani / Indian / Afghani place popped up a mere mile from my hotel!  This restaurant sits inside the Zam-Zam World Market, and boasts a solid lineup of dishes from three countries, all at very reasonable prices.  I could write nothing about the food here and still give it 5 stars because of the service we got here.  Our server was genuinely excited for us to be there, and happy to recommend what he believed to be great dishes to match our relative tastes (mine being super spicy, and my companions being the opposite).  I love it when I get actual recommendations, not the typical, "everything is good."  When he learned I wanted something he would traditionally eat, and also super spicy, he easily sold me on the Goat Karahi with the chili naan.  Having never tried Goat, I was super excited.  My buddy went with the kabobs per his recommendation, with one being mild, and the other with a little spice.  Great recommendations all around.We started with the samosas $1:50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#tno1avQ14jhuMNrXANswow), and they were executed perfectly, with a cilantro chili sauce that had a great kick.  5 StarsGoat Karahi $10  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#bHaip3hWpni9l_SB9pB3pwThis was basically a short rib dish with garlic, onion, and lots of spice (your cumin, turmeric, red pepper blend being very pronounced).  It was fire hot, and the meat was like a pulled pork consistency, and almost creamy.  I wish I would have ordered regular naan, because every time I went for the naan to balance out the fire, I was met with thai chili on top of naan.  Needless to say I was smoking out my ears by the time I finished. 5 StarsThe kabobs were great, and with the Tandoor oven banging out quality naan, this was a meal I easily could have eaten when I was in the region.  Fantastic service, fair prices, and great tastes.  If I'm in Phoenix again, I'm here.5 Stars.
Sinatra=Definitely 5 stars. My review here is of the vegan menu at Sinatra. However, I should note that many dishes on the vegan menu are also found on the regular menu with slight alterations so I'm assuming taste and quality wise, we're all on the same page. When Chef Theo Schoenegger was given the task of creating a vegan menu, he didn't choose to treat that as a chore and create a menu chock full of salads and dishes a 2 year old could whip up. He obviously rose to the challenge and created a passionate menu with hearty vegan dishes. As a vegetarian, I avoid vegan entrees at Italian restaurants as I'm not a fan of vegan cheese and cream-less soups/pastas. Sinatra really wowed me with what they created within these boundaries. The vegan menu here is astonishing. There are 3 starters (a Caesar salad, a beet salad and a butternut squash soup). 2 pasta dishes and 3 main courses and 3 desserts. Some dishes use Gardein protein. We ordered the soup to share. A smooth, creamy (?) soup with a kick in it. Marinating in the soup were vegan ricotta cheese dumplings. Neither me nor my husband are fans of butternut squash but this soup hit the ball out of the park. For our second course (yes we did the Italian thing and had pasta and a main), we each ordered a pasta dish. My husband ordered the vegan ricotta cheese dumplings in an asparagus cream sauce. Divine. I didn't even realize the cheese was vegan. The asparagus cream sauce was light yet robust in flavors and when scooped up with the dumpling, it was the perfect explosion in my mouth. I ordered the Pennette. This is also on the regular menu. Tomato sauce and penne mixed with sweet peppers onions and Gardien Sausage. Yes....talk about comfort in a bowl. The generous helping was delicious and was definitely what I expected (if not better!). For our main, we shared a "Chicken" Marsala. A Gardein chicken breast that was baked and spiced was the main attraction on the plate. On top of it was a creamy, woody, mushroom (oyster) sauce that covered the chicken. Surrounding the "chicken" were billowy gnocchi that were smooth, simple and complemented the bold flavors of the sauce and chicken. Considering I've never had the opportunity to have a Marsala sauce since it's usually served with chicken, I take this first taste as being an exquisite experience. For the finale to the meal, we shared a Campari and citrus sorbet. Presented beautifully, it was a light ending to a perfect meal.I don't really have to elaborate much about the ambiance and the service. This is the Encore and there was perfection executed all over. My favorite Italian experience thus far, has been at Aranciata Blu in Rome. Sinatra came so close to that experience that it was scary. I never thought I could enjoy such an ethereal experience just 20 minutes away from home.  Vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore or whatever palate you have, Sinatra is a well worth-it experience. Oh, and the wine list here is also very impressive. Sinatra...keep yourself Just The Way You Are....Sinatra inside the Wynn, I love you.I was taken here for a surprise birthday dinner and it was the highlight of my birthday weekend. The decor is beautiful and our table was against the large windows with a view of the outside garden area. The menus are cute too, each has a picture inside of Steven Wynn and Frank himself.The service was impeccable beginning at the entrance of the restaurant. When I arrived the hostess handed me a handwritten birthday card, and throughout the entire dinner all the staff went out of their way to wish me a happy birthday.The food was so delicious. Our party ordered nearly everything on the menu, including several bottles of chianti. One of the specials for the night was a black truffle pasta which was heavy but delicious. I had little bites of everything. The entree item I ordered was the pennette. Italian sausage ragu over pasta, amazing.Desserts (panna cotta and tiramisu) came out with candles on them and "happy birthday" written in chocolate. I will post a pic here on Yelp. It was a fantastic ending to a wonderful meal.I'm very much looking forward to my next experience at Sinatra.
Cuban Foods Bakery & Restaurant=It's a shame this great tiny Cuban Place didn't remove the former Mexican Restaurant's sign with the name Bisteces. Also the old Mexican Food Bisteces Sign is still on one side of the shopping center too so if your looking for this place the Bisteces sign might still be up. This very casual place is very tiny and only has 5 or 6 tables.We started with the Papa Rellenas (fried mashed potatoes with a tangy seasoned beef center) I didn't know that they would be so large and the size of grapefruits since they were only $3.45 and they gave us two of them. This variation wasn't breaded and seemed lighter than others. The beef inside was very flavorful but not hot with spice.I had the Pollo de la Plancha that is basically pounded chicken breast seasoned with lime  garlic and onions. The plate didn't look very attractive but the chicken was moist and very flavorful. They gave me an extra generous portion of rice with it and the plate was garnished with a light salad. ($6.99)My companion had the Ropa Vieja. The beef was very flavorful but not hot with spice.  He found some bay leaves in his Rice and Beans. We've seen at some other Cuban Restaurants that when you find a bay leaf in your Rice and Beans it's like a prize and you get a free drink. I doubt they do that here as I didn't ask but it might be a fun thing to know. ($7.99)The only thing I didn't like was if you need a restroom you have to walk threw a work area.Someone from Yelp needs to remove the Mexican food reviews from Bisteces from this place. I think the food from here will appeal to most people.Que Rico! Brush up on your spanish, because the real Cuban foodies know where to come! This little hole in the wall Cuban restaurant is seriously as authentic as it gets.  I grew up in Puerto Rico, and  I'm telling you, this food is like no other.  Don't try to compare it to the likes of Havana Cafe in Phoenix . This super casual, obscure 5 or 6 table Cuban Cafe and Bakery, is tucked away in a strip mall.   Please believe me, they serve THE best tostones, croquetas de jamon, pan con bistec, ropa vieja, empanada de carne and crazy delicious flan. I'm sure everything else is tasty too, but I get stuck on my faves. This probably doesn't mean a lot to some, but they serve coca cola in tall glass bottles. This is the way the serve it in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Cuba. It just tastes so much better and it goes great with a cubano (cuban sandwich). There is usually one girl serving the tables, and working the bakery, the owner and one or two other people in the kitchen...so service isn't what you would expect at a 5 star restaurant, but it is what you would expect at a Cuban neighbors or friends house, and that is exactly what you get.  And if you venture into this cafe a few times, the people working there will remember you and you will automatically feel like family.  Prices are great, portions are good and the food is excellent!Buen Provecho!Muy Rica! The food brings back memories of Little Havana from our trip in 2013.The HUGE Cubano is easily enough for 2 people. Syaked on crust bread with of course traditional pork , cheese and taa daw pickle this sandwich is the  real deal.  We were more than please with our food. Extra bonus is the generous pieces of postres , desserts such as flan , tres gracias cake, eclairs and more. We shared and were satisfied with the rich but not fake tasting flan and tres gracias cake. I look forward to going back. My one wish is  that they would put in a soda fountain instead of cans but I can deal,  no problema.If you're looking for authentic Cuban food, go here!! It's a ways away from my house, but whenever I'm in the area I make sure to always stop for a Media Noche and coffee. It really doesn't get anymore authentic than this place. Family owned. I've only tried their sandwiches. Maybe one day I'll try their other options.
Takeda Thai=So the first thing that strikes you when you walk in is that this is a beautiful restaurant. You can't help but be seduced.We were greeted warmly at the door, seated immediately and given water and menus promptly. Each of the staff came through and introduced themselves, our server Rebecca tells us this is a family operation and apparently so because her mother and step-father (guessing here but probably got enough info to make this accurate) eventually come through, introduce themselves, offer to help with menu selections and we all feel welcome and well attended.Food was very solid...rib appetizers, awesome. Green papaya salad was entirely tasty, but not spicy. Pad Thai and Thai Basil were not my choices but I certainly wasn't complaining either. Food was well prepared, pacing was perfect, rice was perfect.If I had one complaint, it's simply the prices which just seem to be more than I would have to spend elsewhere in a good Thai restaurant (though I'm not going to name any names for comparison). Price setting is a marketing decision that they have made and perhaps given their location, decor, quality of food, many will think their pricing is reasonable but I don't.Food, staff, experience all say 5 stars, pricing says no and that's my opinion.Had to jump in for beauty supplies next door w me mum so the outside of this place really caught my eye! We decided to stop for a bite. It was a late lunch maybe 4 tables were occupied the place felt a tad small inside so we opted to have the patio all to ourselves. Waiter was nice and helpful. I ordered the Pad Thai w shrimp and my mom did the red curry. The shrimp were a nice plump size they were cooked perfectly, I wish there would have been more shrimp on the plate but ce est lavie. The veggies were nice and fresh I thought it was very flavorful compared to other places I've tried Thai food. Not too many places have even left an impression on me the food is usually pretty bland. I tried my moms red curry and it was delicous. The Thai Tea was awesome I wish I had one right now. It was good I will return!
Jack In The Box=Was in the area to meet someone and thought I would be able to find a quick bite to eat.....little did I know that this area is like BFE and that there's not much to choose from.  Luckily, I saw the good ol' standby when in a pinch....JITB.  I ordered:Turkey Bacon Cheddar Sandwich, $4.19http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=USHwj6fMp951mItyKyn0mAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=yNz93hcyNATY5XLlNlQcXQBig Cheeseburger, $1.29http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=B9ffEfEnx60oWFPx80_uKwThis was my 1st time trying the Turkey Bacon Cheddar.....thought I would try something "healthier" for a change....umm, not!  The Sandwich was pretty tasty, but damn was it greasy or buttery.....whatever, I felt really guilty after eating that thing.The Big Cheeseburger was ok....it's my staple grub at JITB.Overall, the joint was fast and food was cheap.  Not bad.Return Factor - 50%
Sunset Soul Food=I'm a huge fan of Sunset Soul Food, I usually try to stop in at least every two weeks.  For some reason, I just can't get enough of their desserts.  The chocolate cake, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie are all to die for.I'm not a huge fried seafood eater; so I can't really comment on their seafood, but to date I haven't been disappointed with anything I've eaten here.  I was even brave enough to give their chitterlings a try and I was pleasantly surprised :)  To my knowledge most of the fried items are cooked to order; so if you're getting something fried, I would plan on around a 20+ minute wait.The overall restaurant is rather small; if memory serves me correctly they only have about 4 tables and a few seats along the wall near a pub shelf.  I typically get take out, and I wouldn't recommend taking a large group (5+) to dine in.One interesting thing about this place, is that they also cook Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey dinners.  I've had them do my Thanksgiving dinner for 2 years in a row now and my friends have always been impressed with the meal.  The pricing is fairly reasonable to, if I remember correctly a turkey, with 3 sides, rolls, gravy and a pie run around $69.Customer service wise, the staff is friendly and fairly attentive.At Sunset Soul Food (SSF) they serve up some really good, down-home, southern style Soul Food.  I've had the chance to try a few different things from Sunset - the Crab Cakes are what I usually run, and I have to say, they are better than you might expect.  I mean they aren't Baltimore Inner Harbor good, but they are Beatties Ford Road GREAT!  I've also tried the scallops, and the wings and would order both again without question.  But listen people, this place is worth going to for the SIDES alone.  You simply will not find Candied Yams any better in this city.  The Mac-n-Cheese?  What?!?!  Out of this world!  Cheesy, greasy and horrible for you, just as good mac-n-cheese should be!Can't give this place 5-STARS however bc of the ordering process.  There are all sorts of rules and stipulations such as $5 delivery charges, minimum orders for delivery,  and you can't even place a pick-up order over the phone, I believe you have to do it all online now.  Then if you go and order in person, you are usually waiting due to the fact that business is always steady and that each meal is made to order.  Despite the quirks about the ordering process, SSF is a solid 4-stars and a must-try if you're in the area (or even if you're not).  Don't play with this spot, you won't find better soul food in the Charlotte area.
Buono's=My first visit to Buono's I walked up to the door sporting my Red Sox hat (purchased on Yawkey Way in the heart of Chowdah Nation) and stopped dead in my tracks at the huge Yankees logo on the door.  A couple people looked up from behind the counter.  I gave a huge shrug and threw my hands in the air as if to say "WTF!"  A tall gentleman behind the counter laughed and beckoned me in.  He informed me that they could help Boston fans as well and that if I just kept right on walking there was another door on the other side that I could leave through.This was Dave.  We have since chatted a bit about baseball, the abomination that is the new stadium in New York, pizza, people from the east coast, etc.I have had pizza from here twice now.  Once I picked up a couple pies to share at the office, yesterday the family and I went for dinner and shared a couple pies.  We actually had enough to have it for lunch today.  Great NY style pizza.  We will be going back to try the subs (grinders for Chowdah nation).Dave is a good sport and takes merciless ribbing pretty well.  When we arrived last night the Yankees had just gotten spanked at Fenway for the second time in a row.  My daughter wanted to walk in singing "Sweet Caroline".  So we did.  Walked in to the crowded restaurant surrounded by NY memorabilia belting out "Sweet Caroline."  (If you're not familiar with Fenway, it's a recent and odd tradition during the 8th inning, more on that here: http://www.bostonspastime.com/sweetcaroline.html)  We certainly got a lot of looks from the patrons and a big laugh from Dave.  I met another Red Sox fan (from Fall Rivuh) that enjoys Buono's pizza to much to stay away.Buono's pizza compares with Grimaldi's but they are cheaper and more down to earth.  So we'll see you for a pie at Buono's from now on.  We miss the NY style pizza and that great east coast attitude.
Wok On In=Great food. Owner is very pleasant
Big Earl's Greasy Eats=I went to Big Earl's yesterday because, unfortunately, Bryan's BBQ across the street was closed. My daughter ordered the kid's meal chicken fingers with fries and a drink. I ordered the kid's meal grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and a drink.The girl behind the counter is very friendly, yes. But that doesn't change the fact that they use styrofoam cups (step it up for the environment!), or that the sweet potato fries were dry and stale, or that the grilled cheese had maybe one slice of cheese for the whole sandwich and was a bit burned. My daughter could not eat because she was so appalled at all the different types of flies crawling on the windows (inside). She is 8 years old, and said "Mom, this place is disgusting. They don't even clean the floors, and there are crumbs inbetween the seats here". I think that says it all when a child can see how filthy a place is. One fly landed on her little cup of ketchup...ON the ketchup. (Shuddering at the memory).For me to like a place, it has to be free of insects crawling inches from my food, or even ON my food. I have had better fries at fast food joints, which is sad. And, furthermore, my daughter refuses to go back.Not good.I am on the fence with this one.  While the atmosphere is relaxed and fun (who wouldn't like that retro gas station ambiance?) and the service was quick and friendly, the food is not enough to keep me coming back for more.The outdoor seating is casual, with picnic benches and tables surrounding two 70's style gas pumps.  The setting offers a perfect view of the world going by on Cave Creek Road.  Dogs are welcome (yay!), and you will see plenty of furry friends enjoying the day.  The interior is small, but the space is used well with a few tables, and a small bar which also serves as the counter where orders are placed.  Looking forward to big juicy burgers, we chose:Big Earl Burger ($5.75)Bleu Burger ($6.99)Side of Onion Rings ($3.75)Vanilla Milkshake ($5.75)The milkshake was by far the best item - thick and creamy.  However, at a price of $5.75 I was disappointed to see it came from a machine.  The burgers were OK - I enjoyed the ample bleu cheese on mine, but the beef patties were thinner than I expected.  The onion rings, while indeed greasy, were not the best I have tried.  That award hands-down goes to Rocket Burger.  On this visit, we had a 20% off coupon.  The woman who took our order seemed a bit confused by the math, and we ended up only receiving a 10% discount.  Shame on me for not catching it earlier, as the line when we left was very long and I did not want to wait to request a correction.All in all, Big Earl's is a good place to sit outside and enjoy the view.  Maybe with a beer or two but not for the food.Well they may live up to its "greasy" name but they also have some surprises up their sleeves. For example, they also have salads and chicken sandwiches besides tasty looking burgers and milkshakes! On my first visit, I enjoyed the Big Kahuna Chicken Sandwich which is their take on the teriyaki chicken sandwich and I used all the will power I had to not order the fries to go with it. Instead I went with the side salad. I sat on the funky patio and enjoyed taking in the old gas station scenery such as gas pumps. I also noticed a sand volleyball court in the back and it looks like they do volleyball games and activities on occasion. The meal came out fast, by the server with a huge smile on her face. The chicken sandwich was juicy and tender and the sauce on it was pretty flavorful. I was surprised that it was a creamy-based teriyaki sauce which turned out to be pretty tasty and the grilled pineapples were the perfect touch. The food was decent but nothing that I'd say is a "must-try" but the atmosphere and decor has a lot of character. All in all, it's a nice spot to visit for a casual meal during a day in Cave Creek. Next time I visit, I'll try the Kobe burger and a milkshake, but for my first visit, I can definitely confirm that I'd visit this greasy eatery again.
Tariq Restaurant=It's like going to East Africa without getting on a plane.I just went there for lunch today, and let me say that for 1/2 an hour I sure wasn't in America any more - it was an immersive and tasty experience that I'm sure to do again, soon. For a start, they didn't have a menu, so I asked what the lunch special was and he started saying a few things in a strong (Somali/Ethiopian) Arabic accent that included goat, so I said - "Sure I'll try it" without really knowing what was going to happen.  And now to the experience. He brought me a can of Pepsi (no diet drinks here and I didn't wan't to risk the ice cubes in the water) and gives me a fork, a spoon and a banana. Whatever, I think "well this is different" as I wonder when to eat my banana. As I'm drinking my Pepsi I started looking around and realize that the only other people are male east african taxi drivers eating injera and curry with just their RIGHT hand.  Well it's a good thing I know how to do that too! (because I didn't want to stand out even more than is possible as the lone white guy speaking english in a restaurant full of genuine Africans speaking Arabic).Then the food arrives - a huge plate of buttered rice seasoned with green herby flecks of stuff and smelling delightful. And the guy says - "you wanted goat - yes? Because it's grilling and will be out soon" So I said yes and started on the rice. A minute later a huge plate of cubed goat and a side salad with Italian dressing comes out and lands in front of me.  I say cubed goat because that's was happened to this poor beastie.  The meat consisted of apparently random 2-3 inch cubed chunks of goat ribs and legs complete with attached tendons, a couple of arteries, some fat, muscle meat (steak) and so on. It tasted GREAT! Seasoned well, and grilled with seasoned onions too.The other customers - As I was eating my rice, salad and goat with just my right hand, more of the regular clientele came in and looked universally stunned to see me there. When they looked down, saw that I was eating with just my right hand in the same Arab manner as them, in mere seconds they accepted me as just another diner at lunchtime. It was actually really cool to see the waryness and prejudice on their faces evaporate in seconds to be replaced by acceptance.Would I go there again - heck yeah! But, and here's a BIG but. I wouldn't ever go with that person at the office that we all know, you know - the one who makes loud and snarky (sometimes racist) comments when they feel uncomfortable in a new situation.  At lunchtime the Tariq Restaurant is a working (East African Arab) man's lunch place.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a women-only group to go for lunch and feel comfortable.  If you're a woman and want great East African food, then this is the place, but from the vibe in there I reckon you'll enjoy it more if you go in with a man, or in a mixed group.Understated, huge portions, and delicious!  Love Gavin F's first comment - it's so true!  The whole East African Center around the restuarant only adds to the authentic feel.  I headed there on a lazy Saturday to check out this place I've driven by 248 times and my expectations were definitely exceeded.  First glance over the menu shows literally everything listed at $9.  There's a kicker to that which I'll touch on in a moment.  The atmosphere was definitely strange, but didn't detract from the experience.  It was a little weird watching Gladiator on TNT and dining on Northeast themed table coverings (lobster and lighthouses? What the heck??).  I grabbed the curry chicken, which was listed at $9, and did not expect the sheer size of the plate that was to come out.  It was about the size of a Domino's medium pizza and was packed with really good chicken, a small salad, and plenty of rice.  It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, and ended up leaving the place with that classic American, uncomfortably-full feeling.  The icing on the cake was when I went to ring up my chicken and a bottled water - the total was $7!  I must've hit a lunch special on the weekends or something but needless to say I left happy.  Definitely worth a try even if you've never had African food before.
Dormont Dogs=Oh man. This place is a triple threat!The hot dog. Check. The toppings. Double check. The Bun. HOLY CRAP IT'S AMAZING!Why am I so excited about the bun? Because it was incredible. It was fresh, it was tasty and it was toasted. That combination is lethally good. I ALMOST want to say it made the whole thing, but I think the toppings combined with the bun did it in for me. The funny thing is I used to not even really like dogs. I've always had them served to me very blandly. The only way I'd eat them later on in life is if they were straight off the grill. But now that there's all these gourmet offerings, I've tried my fair share of dogs around tahn. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this has probably taken over as my favorite. There's over 20 different choices of dogs, which is hard to believe. I kinda wanted to try them all, but ended up choosing the Illinois and the special of the day, the Arkansas dog. The Illinois (tomato, banana peppers, celery salt) had a bountiful amount of banana peppers and not too much bacon (which surprisingly, I liked). But I really liked the Arkansas dog (bacon, cheddar and scallions, horseradish) because of the horsey sauce on top and the. The prices aren't bad at all. Around $2.50-$3 for what I call a "gourment dog" is great!I also tried the potato salad which had the right amount of mayo in it. It's hard to get that nice balance. But I will say, I enjoy a lot of it! Throw in fresh squeezed lemonade and I'm a believer!I can't wait to work my way through the menu, because... it. is. happening!
Gil's Taste of Taos=Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. The place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.A little patio with a little waterfall and little birds flitting about.A little bit different than your average local mexican, since it's NEW mexican style.A little bit of $ for a little more food than I could eat at once.A lot is how much I like Gil's food and service.A lot is how much effort the proprietor seems to have put into creating a unique, quaint, homey, and comforting menu and atmosphere.A lot is how much effort you should put into finding this little gem.
P.F. Chang's=Thank goodness this meal was paid for with the expense account because it was basically a sit down Panda Express with fancy cocktails. You know that taste you get in your mouth when you've eaten too much sweets... yeah, expect to get that after dinner here.My facorite location, after a few days non stop drinking in Vegas, I really need salty food to absorb leftover alcohol in me to feel slightly better...I've always liked the decor and seatings here.The hangover cure food I usually like to order: Chang's vegetarian lettuce wraps, made with tofu: so yummy, no matter how hangover I am, I still need veggies ;p Hot & Sour soup, chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms, balanced with hot white pepper and vinegar: this is a MUST for hangover! Always makes me much better.... Very deliciousPepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favoriteHunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover! I like all those dishes with Taingtao beer, service is always good. Funny I like Americanized Chinese food much better than authentic Chinese food, I like salty sometime for some reasons, but never greasy and oily, P.F.Chang food is salty without greasy, just what I need & love sometime! ;pGREAT WALL OF SALTWe came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. We decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. Our waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.I started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.We then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.For dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. Everything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.I would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. To recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me.
T.G.I. Friday's=Another afternoon in the Summerlin area, we decided to trek over to the Suncoast Casino for some grub.  I'm so happy we encountered this place that serves happy hour deals all day everyday!   Appetizers are half price in their large bar area.  The Tuscan Spinach Dip was served with fresh (warm) tortilla chips.  Their $1.50 bucket of fries weren't really served in a bucket, but were way worth it.  A high point of our dining experience was the sliders, each for $1.50 on the happy hour menu.  With a nice charbroiled taste and caramelized onions, we ended up ordering more.  A low point was my incomplete house salad.  This order usually comes with croutons, cucumber slices, and a garlic breadstick.  I pretty much had a small plate of just lettuce.  They did bring me a garlic breadstick later though.Speaking of bringing it...all the waiters work as a team, tending to all patrons.  I must've dealt with six different waiters after we were seated.  Service was with a smile and diligence!  The drinks weren't bad either during happy hour.  I tried their Electric Lemonade which was like kool-aid with a little kick.  Their $5 Margarita, with 1800 Silver Tequila, was flawless.  The next time I visit, I will partake in their Endless Soup, Salad and Bread Lunch Deal.  From 10am to 4pm, $4.99 will get you all you can eat soup, salad, and bread.  What a freakin deal.  Hell...I might just have to get a slider or two while I'm at it.
Buffalo Wild Wings=So Ive been on a low carb "lifestyle" as of the first of the year so options aren't all that plentiful when visiting my friends out in the 'burbs. Fortunately the wings at BWW are fried and not breaded. So for about 3 carbs for every six (less the sauce) you can have a pretty good and satisfying meal. The garlic parmesan (2 carbs per oz of sauce) wings are pretty good with a side of ranch and some celery, perfect! The service was really friendly but for a bar type place the dining room was packed with kids. Not that I cant stand kids just that with all the beer served it just doesn't seem like a family kind of place, talk about a bad example. Do you really want your kids hanging out in a bar?Im just glad that there are more low carb options out this way.. though leave the kids at home or take them to Olive Garden!So I typically check into a place, and maybe leave a quick tip.  My experience tonight has inspired me to FINALLY write a review.  This is not a good thing.  For me to take the time to write a full review takes some serious impression upon me from the restaurant.  In this case, the impression was so piss poor I couldn't help but come home and sit down directly to cyber-lambast our evening's activity.  This Buffalo Wild Wings has been closed for over a year, and I honestly think they should either A) hire a competent staff with a great manager or B) close their doors again because they clearly have no idea what they are doing as a team.  To begin, we are a party of 6, well 5 1/2 since the baby doesn't count as fully human yet.  We were told that a booth that seats 6 would open up momentarily and would we mind a brief wait.  No sweat.  I like sitting on my husband's lap, but NOT at dinner in a restaurant.  After sitting for a few we were told to follow the host.  He sat us down at a small booth that literally squished me up against my husband and the baby's car seat.  When I questioned "Is this the booth for 6?  It's awfully small." The host said, "No this seats 4, but you could wait if you want for the large booth."  I thought we had made that choice already, but I suppose ignoring your customer's preference is ok. The host said he could bring a car seat sling since we were squashed.  Having 3 older hungry children I acquiesced to his offer.Our server appeared promptly, and she was very upbeat.  OK, things were getting better.  She took our drink orders and gave individualized attention to the children which was great.  My husband ordered a beer, we all ordered sodas.  She returned with the sodas and said the beer was on the way.  She took our appetizer order and the meal order.  She asked if we would like the appetizer before the entree and we said yes. The beer still hadn't arrived.  When she checked in a few mins later the beer STILL hadn't found it's way to the table.  She personally grabbed it from the bar.  As my husband took the first sip he noted that the beer was skunked.  (bad flavor, sat out and got warm and then was re-chilled).  he mentioned this to the server and she stated "Oh yea we have some issues with beer at the bar getting bad.  Happens a lot."  Really????So at this point the entrees come to the table.  Where is the appetizer??  No one knows.  Also the carrot/celery order magically changed into 4 orders of celery.  The server says she will check with the kitchen about the status of the appetizer and grab some carrots as well.  We just started eating our food because we were hungry.Now the food was good.  I can't complain about the wings at all.  The kids liked their kids meals.  The portions were good.  This was the ONLY saving grace of the evening.The server comes back with carrots and says the appetizer is coming.  We keep eating and notice there are no extra napkins.  With chicken wings you sorta need napkins...wings are messy.  We are messy. Our fingers and faces are messy.  It's hard to feed a squirmy 9 month old and try not to get the hot sauces on our fingers mixed with the not hot food she's eating.  The appetizer still is MIA.At this point all the kids are done eating.  I am full.  I am requesting a box.  My husband is done eating.  He asks for a non-skunked beer.  The beer comes and the appetizer is STILL not there.  The server says "Do you want the kitchen to just box up the appetizer?"  The nice lady I am says outloud "Yea I guess so."  The furious b***h inside me says silently "You can tell the kitchen to shove the appetizer up their A$$"  So we get an appetizer in a box well after the entree to go home with.  We ordered a sampler platter (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, nachos, and some wings) none of which is too tasty after getting cold and spending a night in a fridge.  We pay our full bill...not even a sorry was offered.  I honestly didn't even feel like paying the $12 for the platter but I was just too disappointed to say anything.  We rarely go out to eat since we are a large family.  Spending $100 for dinner just isn't always in our budget.  I didn't want to mar the evening for the kids by complaining.  They thought everything was terrific, so I let them maintain that belief.  When I got home I opened the sampler platter just to see what was in there....the three sauces were in the box with no lids and the sauces had managed to spill on everything and mix together.  I now have a bunch of snacks swimming in a melange of ranch, cheese sauce, and marinara....not my idea of a flavor explosion.  We don't eat out often, and it's experiences like these that keep me from wanting to go dine out.  I know it's a chain and not Chez Robertfancypants, but I expect my appetizers at the table before the meal and most certainly not in a box after the meal has been eaten.  Sorry Wild Wings.....we gave you a shot, but I don't think I want to drop $100 again.  Ever.
Denny's=How could I pass this up. FREE Grand Slam breakfast to anyone showing up from 6am-2pm.This is Vegas so anytime there FREE food to be found people crawl out from under their rocks and show up.Knowing this I went early at 6am to this location across from the College of Southern Nevada in the Wal-mart shopping center.When I arrived it was fairly busy but no line or wait.Service was fast & friendly they were very excited about the big promotion.We ordered coffee & water-we both got scrambled eggs,2 bacon,2sausage linkss and 2 pancakes.They food was pretty good. Fresh and hot but still just fast food. I like my bacon crispier and I like hashbrowns instead of pancakes but what they hell it's FREE,right?The service was really good so we tipped $5 and spent $5 on coffee for 2 people NOT Bad. By the time we ate & paid there was a line out the door and past the first 3 stores in the shopping center. I drove by again around Noon and the line was still out the door.I did not let that deter me...........read my other reviewDenny's is crap most of time anymore but this location is hit and miss and when you hit it, it's good. My last meal the manager was very cool and checked on us often making sure we liked the food and all. My soda was never left unfilled. On other visits the manager has been lousy, doesn't check on tables and customer after customer complains resulting in some sort of compensation with the bill. If only the lousy manager could learn something from the good one. IHOP tastes better to me but a few times a year I get a late night craving for breakfast and with the $2, $4, $6 and $8 meals it's usually worth it. Parking can be cramped during the however late at night it's better.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #302 - #365.                We were staying at Encore just a 2 minute walk north of our hotel and wanted a budget friendly breakfast. So we decide to eat at America's favorite diner, "Denny's!"The restaurant was packed and we only waited for 10 minutes before getting called. Our server was friendly as well as the rest of the staff. I ordered the Grand Slam and orange juice, the food was just ok in my book. We were always checked on for refills and if the food was cooked perfectly. I like how the staff goes out of their way to please the customer. If I'm staying at the Encore again, I'll be sure to come back to this Denny's location for an affordable breakfast and good service. I know the food in Encore will cost an arm and a leg!This is probably my second time at a Denny's ever. A friend and I came here for food after having a late night adventure around town. People always tell me that Denny's is just cheap diner food, but nothing was really open in the area that sparked our interest so we decided that Denny's will do. I know I shouldn't expect much because it's not fine dining, but here it goes...When we first arrived, we weren't even greeted and two employees glanced right at us and continued their conversation. I don't like interrupting people (and I know they acknowledged our presence because they glanced at us) so we just waited until they stopped. We were seated shortly after their conversation ended and were greeted by what seemed to be the only person working the front end. This guy was friendly, but service was slow for a night that wasn't busy (there were a total of two tables dining in, including our table). I ordered the fish & chips.The fish & chips are white fish fillets fried to a crispy golden brown served with fries and a side order of your choice (I went with their steamed broccoli). It was good for something from a chain diner, but it wasn't anything that I would rave about.Service was basically non-existent because our waiter didn't show up through our whole meal except when we were almost done. He made a snarky comment  after he noticed we grabbed a ketchup bottle from the empty table next to us, since the one on our table ran out and we were almost done with our meal. Like I said, the service wasn't there and it wasn't until we were getting ready to leave and pay for our food that the waiter starts having these long conversations about his past, and at the end of the night we just wanted to go home (we wouldn't have minded if he talked to us during our meal, but we literally were done and paid for and it was kinda awkward for us to end the conversation). Here's the bottom line: come here at 1 in the morning if you want to hear oldies music while Law & Order SVU is playing on their TVs on mute, and at the same time you can hear the employees having inappropriate conversations in the kitchen. I'm not gonna lie, it definitely was a unique experience to say the least but I don't think I'll go back. Maybe it would've been a better experience during the day, but then again it's just a Denny's...
India's Grill=I may bump this place up to 4 stars on my next visit.  The presentation was very good, the food smelled great, the service was very good.My criticisms are that the mixed grill was mostly overdone.  Not so much that it was bad, it was very flavorful.  But the shrimp was chewy and the lamb was overdone as well.The garlic naan was awesome.  The chicken tikka was very flavorful and was very different than other places I've had it.The portion on the naan was great, less so on the tikka and the mixed grill.The place has a nice, open layout and features accents of broken plates worked into the columns and other areas.
Mr. Mamas=Just another new breakfast / lunch spot in the Vegas Valley. Of course, it's close to my old condo so i had to give it a try. Ate there twice for breakfast while i was making the move - place was hoppin' ( it's in an industrial park area - most of the customers were workers in the area ) decent $2.95 breakfast - the usual 2 eggs, potatoes toast, bacon/sausage/ham. Also tried their version of the grand slam - cost $5.95. if in the area and need a quick bite at reasonable prices, i recommend. Go out of your way for a special breakfast/lunch ? not the place. happy eating !We were tipped off by a local about this place after working a freelance job in the area. It's really a great hole-in-the-wall. We arrived for lunch seconds before they closed (they serve breakfast and lunch only). The kitchen seemed less than pleased (turn off that "open" sign!) but we were warmly welcomed by both our waitress and the owner. I ordered a pastrami on rye.It was a very good sandwich, although the pastrami wasn't stacked high like a deli would do it. After my first bite I thought it lacked something. Seeing a bottle of mustard on the table it clicked that this was the missing condiment. After spreading some mustard on the marble rye I was quite satisfied.The owner spent some time with us, telling the stories behind some of the pictures on the wall.  He was a very congenial fellow and we enjoyed the tales of his family history.Prices were fantastic. The food and service was great. But...uh-oh..the bathroom was rather messy with garbage overflowing and toilet paper all over the floor (yelp removed my photo - see below). Mr. Mama's is not conveniently located to the Strip but worth the short drive if you want inexpensive delicious food.***Hi there,We wanted to let you know that we have removed one of your photos of Mr. Mama's. We encourage users to post business photos that are broadly representative of the business, while sharing their personal experience with that business in a review. In this case we thought that your photo looked more like it captured your personal experience. Thanks for understanding, and we'll see you on Yelp! Regards,ClarenceYelp User SupportSan Francisco, CaliforniaI tried out Mr. Mama's the other day while I was waiting for my car to get tinted.  I was stuck for a few hours in a neighborhood that I wasn't familiar with, so I Yelped for a good lunch place to head to in the neighborhood.  I found Mr. Mama's and was quite pleased!My hubby came to pick me up for lunch and we headed over to Mr. Mama's.  We walked in and stood at the front for a few minutes before we were greeted.  We were then told to sit anywhere we wanted too.  We grabbed a table and were greeted by our server pretty quickly.  We ordered and our food came out fast.  My hubby got a Reuben and it was delicious!  I had the chili cheese burger and it was ok.  The burger was awesome but the chili was weird.  I am a chili con carne style chili girl and the chili here was more of the Midwest style of a more tomato-y style.  If I had just gotten a regular cheese burger I think I would have been much happier.  Oh well.  It wasn't bad, just not the style I really like.  Don't get me wrong, I still chowed down on the burger though.We finished up our meal with a cinnamon roll that our server recommended.  It was one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  It was a big one and we decided to split it.  Once we started eating it though, I think we both wished we had ordered two so we wouldn't have had to share.  Ha ha!Overall Mr. Mama's was a good place to eat.  Good solid food, ok service, and a pretty decent menu.  Yum.Mr Mama? Sorry, that just doesn't sound right. Do they have a lunch/dinner place called Miss Daddy? Am I the only one that thinks this is weird? Anyways, how's that for an intro to this review?Now that I got your attention, Mr Mama's sure got mine after having lunch there the other day. I was impressed in a lot of ways.For starters, from the outside, the place looks like a nice little hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place. But when I opened the door and walked in, I had to do a double take. It's kind of like that one closet from that Narnia movie. Yeah, that closet. So I am directed by one of the many servers to any table that's available. The menu's are all ready to go on all the tables. What a concept. You come in, grab any available table, go over the menu, order, eat, and you're out. These guys definitely got a system down. I would say I was helped out by at least 3 different servers. That's why their service is very good. They are constantly running around. As for the food, I noticed a lot of good choices. But that day, I was really hungry and I was not gonna settle just for any burger. No sir. So I got their biggest burger called Mama's Burger. Damn. This was a case of my eyes being hungrier than my stomach. Two half pound patties, slices of avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and an onion ring. At first glance, I didn't know how to attack it. I kid you not, I was rotating my plate just looking for a chink in the armor. In the end, I ended up trying to smash it down with the palm of my hand in hopes of getting it down to the size of my mouth. Needless to say, I could only eat half of it. At that point I felt like running away crying to Mr. Mama himself (or is it herself? I don't wanna assume anything you know?). Ok, so I had dinner covered.The only thing that might be a disappointment is their hours. 6 am to 3 pm. What if I wanna redeem myself for that burger and it just happens to be dinner time? *flashback to that lunch moment* Ok, I take it back, that's not really a disappointment.So, umm, yeah go check this place out. Don't forget to redeem your free beverage when you check in.Today was a multiple stop day and I included breakfast on the list of things I had to do.  I've been going to try Mr. Mama's for several months and today was it.As soon as I entered, a server told me to sit anywhere I was comfortable.  That's what they said to everyone entering the restaurant and it's really a nice way of saying, "Come on in.  You're welcome here.  make yourself comfortable."I had coffee quickly and the server gave me the password for the wifi which was quite zippy.  I like when it works the way it should.  I ordered the Cali omelette which is Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Topped with Avocado.  With it came hash brown potatoes and two slices of swirled rye toast.  The menu says all omelettes are made with 4 eggs. The breakfast was really very good.  My coffee was refilled and I had a good time watching the cooks do their thing behind the counter.  They do a fair amount of take out and it was interesting to watch them get the boxes and bags ready.Mr. Mama's is in the commercial area in the Valley View/Decatur area and there are a number of car repair places there.Besides the good taste of the food, the thing I most take away from my visit is the genial nature of the staff.  You are welcome there and they let you know your business is appreciated.  Thank you Mr. Mama!Had breakfast here yesterday~Thanks Vegas yelpers for the great reviews!My gf and I shared the breakfast burrito and popular french toast.Pocket friendly prices, great customer service, lots of seating, clean bathroom and no problems with parking. Love the hours!!!Will come back to try more things of the menu!-Miss Yelp 2013Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama! Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!Having passed by Mr Mama's on numerous occasions over the years, I was finally able to stop by to try them out. We were greeted warmly by Mr Mama himself and were seated quickly. As we perused our menus, our drink orders were take and Mr Mama chatted with us a while. He told us they have been open for two years now and 80% of their business was tourists, which I found pretty surprising seeing as they are in a relatively industrial and local area. The place was packed but service was hospitable and quick. Refills were on point and the food came out quickly. My ham and cheese omelet was solid and so was the albacore tuna melt. Very tasty and reasonably priced. Everything we had was fresh as well. Definitely sad that it took me so long to give Mr Mama's a chance.With service and food as fabulous as it was, I anticipate returning to Mr Mama's often.Bottomless CoffeeButtermilk BiscuitJumbo Cinnamon RollDouble Chocolate Chip Pancakes with Two Eggs and Bottomless Coffee (Daily Special)Single Serving of French ToastOne of the longest standing members on my breakfast 'to-do' list and a place to which I'd purchased a $20 discounted gift-certificate some six months prior it was finally on Saturday that I drove down to Mr. Mama's and although the small breakfast and lunch spot is unlikely to win any awards for innovation it can only be said that this truly is a place committed to putting a smile on each patron's face.  Undoubtedly a locals institution in which nearly every other customer was a regular with orders frequently anticipated by staff it was just past 7:15 that I was invited to seat myself and with no less than three servers offering to get me coffee as I perused the menu it became immediately apparent as to why the restaurant was filled to capacity by eight o'clock.  Focused mostly on diner staples with a whiteboard of specials just left of entry while prices trend far lower than almost anywhere else in the 702 my meal began with Mr. Mama's oft-raved $3.50 cinnamon roll and with a soft, yeasty base rife with cinnamon and butter beneath sweet frosting the hype proved justified, a smallish biscuit proving less worthy its $2.75 tab, though still quite good.  Preceding next to plates more hearty it was with a thin slice of French Toast that my meal moved on and opting this time to bring my own maple syrup from home the result was improved, though still nothing to write home about, particularly when compared to fluffy flapjacks studded with dark and white chocolate, a daily special matched with two eggs and at least six cups of coffee for less than $9.Likely generating its fan base more through low prices and friendly service rather than by location or particularly excellent food I cannot say I'll be rushing back to Mr. Mama's soon, but for locals on a budget or those with little one's looking for a good breakfast at a great price the restaurant definitely fills a niche - the open-kitchen of blazing-fast line cooks and televisions tuned to college football providing a bit of entertainment for those interested in such things, as well.Stopped at Mr. Mamma's for brunch today, which is almost hidden in a small strip mall.  The owner (who happens to live a couple of developments down from me in Henderson) greeted us as we walked through the door, added us to the wait list, and gave us a menu to peruse while we waited.  He advised that there would be a 15 minute wait, but it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.  While we waited I noticed that he interacted warmly with everyone who came in and kept a keen eye on the food coming out of the open kitchen as well as on the service.  This is an owner who takes great pride in his restaurant (IMO) and I appreciate that.  Once seated our waitress was quick to take our order and bring our drinks.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and I am told the coffee was very good ($2.50 each).We started with the cinnamon roll to share.  This thing is huge!  It came out hot and fresh.  The icing was too sweet for my taste, but I ate around the icing without issue. $3.50I had the short stack pancakes (2 cakes) & eggs with extra crispy bacon.  The pancakes were also huge, but they were fluffy and had a nice traditional flavor.  I almost got through one!  The scrambled eggs were good and the bacon was thick cut.  $7.45My dining companion had the steak and eggs w/ hashbrowns.  He advised that the hashbrowns were fantastic, and that the steak was okay, but he would likely order something different in the future. $9.95We felt that the pricing was reasonable, the staff fast and friendly, and the food was good.  I like that you can order breakfast all day, but the burgers and some of the other lunch orders coming out of the kitchen also looked appetizing, so I may try one of those next time.As we were leaving, the owner shook our hands and asked about our experience.  Nice to see he cares this much.  We will be back.On this trip to Vegas we made it a point to venture off the strip and find some awesome eating establishments that were considered "local gems". Then I found Mr. Mama on Yelp. We headed over for breakfast before heading to Red Canyon...there was a 30 minute wait, but if this place is THAT packed and people are waiting with no problem (and they have over 1,000 reviews...) we knew it'd be worth the wait.I'm still pretty blown away by how good it actually was. You know the feeling...you read the reviews...you see the photos...you over hype a place in your mind so much so that when you actually eat there it's a let down. Well, not here. Mr. Mama delivered! First, we have to start with the hostess - who is Mr. Mama's daughter. She greeted everyone with a smile. Handled the list like a pro. Bussed tables. Sat people. Even helped bring out plates. We had to tell her at the end of the meal how awesome she was - I really meant it. That place runs like clockwork mainly because of her. She made it a point to say her dad taught her - love family run businesses!Ok, so on to the food.Giant Cinnamon Roll - fluffy, gooey, sweet, delicious. WHOA! Get this. Mind you it really IS MASSIVE...so share it. But man, this was hands down the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. *come to think of it, it was the only homemade cinnamon roll I have ever had, but still....get it!Choice of meat and eggs - 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. $6.75. WHAT? First of all, it was delicious - BUT THAT PRICE THOUGH!?!?! It's crazy they can make a profit on it. The hashbrowns were great. Eggs are eggs...and the bacon was thick and crispy! It was quality food...at a super discounted price!The wife had the Cali omelet (minus the sausage) - I took a bite and it was delicious as well.The coffee they serve was also really good. They bring little french vanilla creamers which might not impress most people, but I thought it was a super nice touch.Overall, we left stuffed and only spent ~$25. If we lived in Vegas I'd be the DUKE of this place, I have no doubt about it. If you're in town visiting and looking for a great meal on the cheap...hit it up! As for you locals....I envy you.Standard breakfast offerings with low prices and great service- this place frequently makes the list of top restaurants on Vegas' Yelp homepage and even made the list of top 100 restaurants on Yelp for 2014. But I'm not sure they live up to the hype.I'm not much of a breakfast person but I love a good breakfast burrito- opted for one here and the tortilla was soaked in so much grease that I went through several napkins wiping down my hands after each bite. The tortilla was so soaked that it was transparent in parts. The filling had a limited amount of flavorless cheese, plus peppers and onions, but was virtually void of salt and pepper. Bacon was requested well-done but seemed undercooked and added no texture to the dish.I did not eat or save the second half of my burrito as I'd originally planned. For $7 I wasn't particularly bothered.This may be a great place for an omelet, but it's pretty hard to screw up an omelet. Portions are decent and service is friendly, but the breakfast burrito shouldn't be on the menu if it isn't done well.Came in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Located in a strip center parking was no issue what so ever.I saw the chicken fried steak was popular but instead ordered the ham & eggs with hash browns and wheat toast. The price was reasonable and the portion was generous. The ham was tasty, hash browns crispy and even the coffee was yummy!The service from all the waitresses was spot on and I would return here in a heartbeat, no wonder this place  is popular with locals!#77 on the list of "Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the U.S. for 2015" (printed 1-22-15)The best thing about Yelp is meeting a fellow Yelper in real life, going somewhere that you've both Bookmarked, and having a new friend!  This is what happened on my most recent trip to Las Vegas, the 9th Hawaiian Island.Terri R. & I agreed to meet here because of the great reviews from Nadine J., Russ C., Mike O., Lilian N., Norm K., and other friends.  I arrived first and was greeted warmly by the owner who welcomed me in from the gray, overcast, cold, rainy morning.  Terri was right on time and we both got to choose where we wanted to sit!  We shared the fluffy Short Stack Pancakes and I got the deliciously light Greek Omelet with the crisp but moist hash browns and wheat toast - everything was perfect!  The serving was so large that I had to take the leftovers to go!  The prompt and friendly service, the yummy food, and the "blue" environment was excellent!I will for sure return for more breakfast!  They should be opening soon at their new, larger location on Jones Boulevard.  Can't wait to return and dine again with Terri R.!
Grand Café=We were looking for a quick bite to eat and didn't feel like venturing too far from where we were. After texting friends where we were (they were gambling) they said they'd join us later but to go ahead and start without them. The restaurant wasn't busy when we walked in, in fact there was only 1 table occupied. This probably should've been a clue. I wasn't impressed with the food nor the service. It took awhile for anyone to realize we were waiting to be seated. There were no servers nor was anyone standing in the front. A server walked out of the kitchen area toward us, didn't greet us, probably did a mental head count and told us to follow her. She plucked the menus on the table and walked off. I wasn't impressed with my chicken Cobb salad. It tasted bitter. Don't know why and couldn't figure it out. The chicken was dry and not seasoned. On the plus side it had lots of avocado and I love avocado. I ended up picking through my salad and eating only the avocado. My friend had the prime rib and it looked pretty sorry and very unappetizing. He said it had mostly gristle, and had no flavor even after dumping the sauce on it. Maybe we came here on an off day. We ended up not finishing our meal.Our waitress didn't check on us or ask us how our meal was. Overall the meal was meh and the service was blah. I guess they'd rather have you in the casino gambling than eating. While we were walking out, my friends had finally pried themselves away from gambling to join us. Sorry you guys missed the boat but that's probably a good thing.Skip this place unless you're really desperate and dying of starvation.
Blue 32 Sports Grill=I came here with a friend a few days ago for dinner and drinks. I found it on Yelp of course. =)I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the chicken tenders and my friend ordered the fish and chips. The chicken tenders were ok. I wish they were a little bit crispier. For drinks I ordered the Fresh Strawberry martini. I loveddddd it. Not only was it well worth the $9 but it was made with fresh strawberries which I loved. My friend ordered the Appletini which was also quite tasty. I would definitely come back for their drinks. They do have a happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7 which I'd like to come back for the drinks again and to try their appetizers.The only thing that got me was we got charged for sides of ranch. I ordered chicken tenders so I felt that it should've already come with the meal not be charged extra. The service was really good. Our waitress was really friendly. It's a really good place to just hang out and watch a game for all you sports lovers. =)When we rolled in to Blue 32 last Saturday I was such a grouch.  I hate leaving the house on Saturdays, especially this close to Christmas.  But I wanted to take Mr. M to Fox Cigar Bar because we always have a good time there, so we were in the area.  I had a few coupons burning a hole in my pocket for some stores in the San Tan Village area, but it was so crowded I couldn't bring myself to get out of the car.  No way, Jose.  Saving 15% is not worth my sanity.Beer.  That's what I need.  A nice cold beer.Based on some friends' recommendations we decided to try Blue 32 and as soon as we walked in we were greeted with 2 screaming kids.  Give me a freakin' break.  I almost left, but we were seated in a corner table up by the window, so the screaming was off in the distance a little.  Started out with a couple of Sierra Nevada ales and the shrimp and bacon quesadilla.  Both disappeared in about 2 minutes.  We ate that quesadilla like it owed us money.  Great flavors and grilled nice and crisp.  Not floppy like a lot of places who are in a hurry to get the food out.  Then I had a house salad and a cup of the potato soup.  Mr. M had the wings and rib entrée.  We proceeded to have a little feast of our own.  GREAT wings and ribs!  Nice fresh little salad, and PERFECT potato soup!  I used to make 2 soups/day from scratch for a couple of restaurants a hundred years ago, and I love soup.  This baked potato soup was the best I've ever had and I'm craving it again.  They need to build a Blue 32 in that dying plaza near me at Alma School and Queen Creek.  I'd be over there every day eating soup and drinking beer.Our server was Marysa and she was the best.  When we were talking about soup she said we should try their chili and brought us a sample.  No beans, and perfect as well.  GREAT chili.  A customer sitting behind us said they have the best chili in town.  I'm inclined to agree with him.  They have plenty of TVs for all the games going on.  Personally, I'm just killing time until baseball season starts again.  Hockey will do for now.  Overall, I would happily go back to Blue 32.  When we left I was no longer a grouch.  Great visit!
In-N-Out Burger=I cant believe it. An In-N-Out only 3 miles from my place. This is bad... Very bad...This place just opened... and it showed. Well, in a good way I mean. I drive by and the dining room seems empty. Its a Friday night around 10pm and I figure this place would be somewhat busy.I roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there. She proceeds to take my order and I drive up to the cashier window. The cashier then proceeds to confirm my full order. Finally I pull up to pick up window and my food near ready. A brief 2 minute wait and our food is ready to go. Here's a list of what we ordered:- Cheeseburger, Protein style.- Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion. - Fries, Animal style- Regular fries- Chocolate ShakeWhen we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.On a side note: While I was waiting, I did notice they had a lot of workers standing around waiting to make food... The problem is that it was slow so there was no orders to make!Of course, pictures included!!I woke up bleary eyed from after the second night of my Vegas bender and thought "TODAY is THE DAY for my first In-n-Out burger." So, without shower or makeup touch up, I walked to the convention I was supposed to be attending for about 5 seconds, turned around, walked to the front of the Venetian, hailed a cab and said "To the closest In-n-Out burger please!" Then I let the cabbie work his magic while I sat in the back trying not to throw up on his seats. Good start to the day! We make it there and sit in the drive through. There was an employee in the parking lot with a computerized handheld thing taking orders. I told him I'd never been before so he explained what they have...burgers, burgers, burgers. I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds! I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar. I wish they would put one of these on the strip somewhere so that I could go without spending $20 on a cab ride and $6 on food but I think for my first experience it was SO worth the money and I'd do it again in a second!If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I'm not that bright. So it shouldn't surprise you that I embarked on a 4.5 hour hike up a desert mountain with minimal supplies and only a few grapes for food. Or that I got lost on the way down. When I finally made my way back to civilization, I was what I like to call "Angry Hungry," Or, "hangry." Meaning, if I didn't eat anything soon I would have to hurt someone.* And even though I had reservations at a lovely French bistro later that evening, I knew what I needed, right then and there: a Double-Double, Animal Style. It was served with a genuine smile, which I rudely ignored in favor of immediately tearing into that burger like it had called me Stuart.** It was animalistic, indeed. And this thing was not only the best fast-food burger I'd ever tasted, but also a damn good deal at $3 and change. I don't always eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer In-N-Out.__________*Or more likely, weep uncontrollably until my mommy made me a snack.**I hate being called Stuart.Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, "What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -"If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now."Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand.1st to Review? @IN_N_OUT_Burger! Located near Sunset station & Galleria Mall this place is hopping!15 cars in the drive-thru @ 2 pm. BUT anyone who's eaten at In & Out KNOWS -It's always worth the wait.One of these days I'm gonna order a 10x10 and see how long it takes to finish it!Today however I went for the Double-Double Extra Pickles & Onion with sauce. My Usual!Fantastic down to the last crumb of bun!I hear there are now 7 locations throughout the valley-we could do with 10 more or the nice catering truck they have at In-N-Out!Attended the Coffee Crisp UYE here hosted by Jennifer C & Elle C.  I brought my Son along to enjoy the grub and Yelp fun.We were first to arrive and since it was packed, we ordered before everyone.  We ordered:2 Double Doubles Animal Style ($3.05)1 Cheeseburger Animal Style ($2.05)2 French Fries Animal Style ($3.25)We brought our own bottled Water.After a 15 minute wait, our food was ready.....it was already 1 pm and we didn't see any other Yelpers, so we started to eat our food.  The Double Double Animal Style was juicy & sloppy....just how I like it!  (see pics)  There's something about the spongy, toasted Bread, gooey Cheese, fresh Tomato & Lettuce, Special Sauce, and Grilled Onions that makes me want to never stop eating this stuff.  The Animal Style Fries were fantastic as well.About 1/2 way through our meal, I spotted Paolo D & Jennifer C at the door waiting for everyone.  I went over to introduce myself and let them know that we had room at our table and that we'd also keep an eye out for nearby tables to open up so we could all sit together.  We were eventually able to get everyone together.  We all enjoyed a nice meal plus we shared in some Coffee Crisps & Caramilk Bars for dessert courtesy of Elle C from Calgary! (see pics)What a great day & meal.  Great Food & Great People = Good TimesWill I return?  This location is very far away from where I live, but if there's another UYE here, I will try my best to make it.FRESH BEEF THAT'S NEVER FROZEN2013 INOB celebrated its' 65th anniversary. Yu-go chauffeur even got a t-shirt to commemorate the occasion. I think he has a dozen of their cool t-shirts representing different years.Their beef burgers are never frozen. Buns made without preservatives. Hand leaf their lettuce everyday. Fries are peeled and diced daily from fresh Kennebec potatoes. And, the fries are cooked in 100% cholesterol free oil since 1948.Extra thousand island dressing and grilled onions and it's burger time for us. Tough to beat the quality, price and service. Been coming to this location for ten years and it never fails to deliver my burger as I want it.Love the fact that you can get filled up at one of these Burger joints and not let it break the bank. The food is always freshly made and the service is very friendly.This particular location is in the Fiesta Mall parking lot and it can get pretty busy during peak hours. Usually get here before the lunch rush and eat quickly so I can get back to work in a hurry.3X3 with Onions, add Pickles and Chili Peppers, please. Sometime I'll treat myself to an order of their tasty and freshly sliced French Fries. Definitely can't resist a giant pile of the spicy complementary Chili Peppers. Oh Yeah!They have several ways that you can order your burger here. Just do a quick google for their Top Secret ordering instruction and you will be amazed. Animal style is a typical favorite and you will probably see a few during your visit.See ya there next time and remember to enjoy the moment. Life is Good. SAY CHEESE!3.75 STARS
A&W All-American Food=This is an A&W/LJS-so everything taste fishy & fried-jkReally its a pretty good fast food burger & hotdog but the fried stuff is just too greasy & heavy for me.I jumped on the $.90 papa burgers on Fathers Day & this is one of the best bargains you will ever find at a fast food joint.I still hang on to the memories of yesteryear when A&W was just like Sonic with the roller waitresses and drive-up ordering unfortunately the food is no where near the same as it used to be.Just too damn FAST!Mmmmmm soooo good, I was sucking my spoon silly!***2011 Entertainment guide, buy one get one coupons***Yummy! My sister and I had a craving for a refreshing root beer float, also had a two for one coupon.The service is awesome for a fast food type of chain!We got our Yummy RB floats and were so happy just moaning and enjoying every sip and spoonful.The combination of the almost buttery tasting golden soft serve along with the A&W root beer is just amazing, the perfect blend!We will be back for sure! I want to experience this sensation again and again and again!!!It made me feel so darn good! The taste is out of this world!Mmmmmmmm yummy baby :)I like it a lot!
Baja Bar & Grill=Right, so I had the fish tacos there, and I seriously had to search for the fish. I mean I am sure there were some itty bitty teeny tiny pieces of fish, more like they waved a fish over those tacos.. Humph.. bummer, I wanted to like this place, but that was a major disappointment.. Pass...
Miko's Izakaya=What a pleasant surprise!  Found Miko's tonight.  Story is, MIko and her husband Greg lived in SF, never operated a restaurant before -- moved to Vegas and after 5 years here, decided that their search for good tempura was futile.  They should do it themselves -- so Miko's was born.  And their tempura is yummy -- but so are the kalbi -- the sushi rolls we tried (Caliente and Fire Roll were our favs) -- oh and the agedashi tofu was amazing.  We shared some unfiltered sake and both got kirin (which is now on tap).  UNLV students -- please note - they serve 1/2 off beer and hot sake after 10.  Greg informed me that their karaoke machine is on the fritz at the moment, but they tend to have 3 separate demand generators:  lunch -- for the I've only got 30 minutes, gimme my tempura chcken crowd; familiy dinner with the kids crowd, and then the industry folk who begin to arrive around 10.  They're open late -- the food's good, the service is lovely.  Chi (probably not spelled right) has the energy and spunk for which she's named.  Miko is lovely and hospitable and very very interested in getting to know her customers.  The chefs are accommodating and friendly as well.  The interior  - despite the bright yellow walls -- is pretty sterile and simple, but the counter is fun and interesting and you can watch the full line.  They're not super crowded like Ichiza -- but that's location, too.  Off the 215 going southbound, they're in a new strip mall on the right hand side.  I'll definitely go back -Driving down E. Windmill Lane, we couldn't ignore the "izakaya" sign.  Spectacular reviews on yelp gave us the final push to check out this restaurant we've been so curious about. Weekday evening and happy hour has just ended (5 pm to 7 pm), so we're seeing an 'interesting' mix of people hanging out at the sushi bar.Upon seating, it's hard to ignore the menu because there is just so much to go through.  There's the Sushi and Sashimi menu, the "You Pick" Menu that includes Side Orders, the regular a la carte menu, the dinner combination menu, the Vegetarian menu, and the beverage menus.After some careful perusing, we decided to go with items from the You "Pick" Menu, Pick 3 - $15.95; Pick 4 - $19.95; Pick 5 - $24.95.  The waiter suggested we do the Pick 4 since we planned on ordering other things as well.* Wafu Yakiniku "Tender sliced beef with Miko's special sauce." - Steaming plate of tender and juicy pieces of beef.  Pretty good.* Shishamo "Grilled roe capelin" - Four pieces of smelt in this order.* Sashimi "Chef's choice of sliced raw fish" - A nice selection of raw fish, about five large slices.* Oyako-Don "Topped with simmered chicken and egg" - This dish arrived last.  It was a steaming bowl of chicken, onions, and scrambled egg on rice with sauce.  We were too full to enjoy this, so we packed it for home.* Tonkotsu Ramen "Ramen noodles and pork flavored soup.  Served with Miko's Gyoza" ($9.50) - Looking quite pretty with it's hard-boiled egg, fish cake, and vegetable greens floating on top, the soup looked pretty authentic.  However, the tonkatsu wasn't quite what we expected.  We're used to pork cutlet that's been breaded and fried, and this wasn't the case.  There was pork in the soup, but not what we know as tonkatsu.  (Maybe they got the order wrong?)  The gyoza was also a bit different - it's completely deep-fried and looks more like a flattened eggroll than a gyoza. (Update!  Candace C. was so nice to point out that tonkotsu ramen is actually a pork bone broth ramen, so that was our mistake that we were expecting tonkatsu - the deep fried pork cutlets!  See how one letter can change what you're expecting! At least now we know!)* Agedashi Tofu "Fried tofu in special broth" ($3) - The lone block of tofu was more fried than I hoped, and there wasn't much of a broth.  It was more like a light sauce on the bottom.Beyond the food, we couldn't help but notice the dynamics of the staff.  Sure, it definitely seemed like it was bit understaffed as the owner's husband was the waiter and busboy for the evening.  We also noticed one lone sushi chef and a prep cook behind the sushi bar.  The latter two were not the most professional using language like "asshole", etc. from behind the sushi bar and hollering up to the front.  I also found it weird that the girl who was hanging out at the sushi bar when we arrived eventually went behind the sushi bar to help out.  (Maybe she works there?  Her purse and phone were still by her seat.)Service was a bit slacking, only because Miko's husband was responsible for front of the house and he was alone.  We did have to ask for plates, refills, etc.  He did bring us complimentary miso soup though before our meal, which was a nice touch.  Before we left though, he chatted with us a bit and told us more about his wife's restaurant.  Having opened in September of 2008, they were doing quite well.  Then with the struggling economy, they have since expanded their menu to accommodate more diners and their various likings. A 65 year old Japanese chef overseas the kitchen and the recipes are authentic Japanese ones.  However, with the younger staff up front, they do maintain a different image for the younger crowd and dominates this restaurant and has pretty much taken over the sushi bar.I'm torn, I want to like this place for what it stands for and where it came from.  But I was turned off by the antics of the kitchen staff.  When I'm looking for more authentic Japanese home cooked food, this place would be a good consideration.  I think they need to work on getting the food out at the proper times too.Sake-To-Me!Literally! So I should have called Sangeetha to tell her I was coming here, but I just stopped by after a visit to Tokyo Discount...Greg and Miko warmly welcomed me, and when they learned I was engaged, I got cold unfiltered sake on the house!  yum.  My meal consisted of the long-awaited spicy tuna bowl with soft shell crab on top, nimono, and saba sashimi, plus matcha iced tea (surprise, surprise).The bowl: soooo good, fulfilled my cravings.  The soft shell crab was very crispy and tasty, but not greasy at all.  This was served beautifully with cucumbers, masago, lemon slices, and daikon.The nimono: This is basically Japanese comfort food.  Daikon, carrot, potato, taro, fish cake, and maybe burdock cooked in dashi-esque broth.  Warm, soft, delish...The saba: Cured to perfection, delicate but flavorful, cut by the master.  I ate the daikon and the perilla leaf too.The tea and sake: satisfying counterbalances :)and yes, it was packed in there fairly late on a Thursday!Look for an upcoming UYE one of these days, super-vegetarian-friendly!I love how vegan-friendly this place is!! REAL sushi roll options (not just boring old cucumber or avocado).  Agedashi tofu without those pesky bonito flakes.  Yakisoba, mmm.  And egg-free tempura.  Kimpira! My problem when I go here is that I want to order EVERYTHING.  Everything is so good and reasonably priced.  I am partial to the age tofu roll, and I will swoon over the tempura.  You really can't go wrong.  Check for the veggie special of the day!How could anyone of Japanese lineage give this place more than 3 stars?This place is completely marketed and designed for Westerners. When you walk inside all you see are: White folks, Hawaiians, and a random Korean guy sitting in back.  There were absolutely  no one of Japanese descent eating here.Before I write my review, let me tell you a personal story about my Dad. Everyone from Hawaii will tell you stories about that one Japanese family who lived on their street who absolutely refused to assimilate to Hawaiian culture. They didn't speak in that "Wakki Lakki talk", hated saying Aloha, refused to call their brothers: "brah-duh", and thought surfing was the sport of idiots. These Japanese men raised their kids in a traditional Japanese style. And, that was how my Dad was raised. So, he knows good Japanese food when he sees it. My Dad came to Miko's about 2 years ago and hated it so much that he called me and told me never to come here. I didn't believe him back then because my Dad literally hates everything for no reason. He even hated Urusawa(the most famous sushi bar in LA), and got into a fight with the chef. So, when I walked in Miko's today, I had totally forgotten everything he had told me about this place. For the first time in my life, I actually agree with my Dad on something. This place wasn't a Japanese restaurant.  When I first walked in, I stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before anyone even said "hi" to me. The man working here(who looked like he was half white and half Hawaiian-Japanese) was too busy kissing the asses of the regular customers to even bother seating me. The regular customers here get all the priority. Even if they order 15 minutes after you order, they will get their food before you do. When I was finally sat, it took him another 5 minutes to come back over and take my order. And after he dropped my bowl of Ramen off, he never came back over again. This whole time I was here, he was acting lazy and having fun with all his regular customers.Some places use a Tonkotsu base for their Miso Ramen, while  most places use a chicken bone base. Miko's Izakaya uses water mixed with a powder. The 2 slices of Narutomaki were nothing more than generic prepackaged "swirl" fish cakes you buy at Greenland Market. It's a product of South Korea.The hanjuku egg was nothing more than just a hard boiled egg with no soy sauce. And the egg was VERY hard boiled. The Charsiu tasted like it was made days in advance. It didn't even taste like pork. It tasted like an oven roasted piece of dried out turkey. The Miso Ramen's broth tasted 100% identical to Nissan Ramen's Instant Miso Flavor, which you can buy at both Greenland Market and Japan Creek.If you want good Ramen in Las Vegas, go to places like Ramen Sora, Shuseki, Yagyu Yakinku. Anime Ramen has not been the same since Ryosuke went back to Japan, but it's still far superior to the instant cup of noodles you get at Miko's. This was a 1-star experience. The food was 1-star, and the service was 1-star. The only reason I am giving this place another star is because when I was leaving, the Sushi Chef(a true full-blooded Japanese man) tried to get my attention.  He then gave me a certain unique look which I remembered from my youth with my Dad. While I was eating, I did notice the look of concern that the traditional Japanese Chef had on his face when he noticed I was being ignored. Traditional Japanese men do not have to use words to express their feelings of regret. When I was walking out the door, he let me know with facial expressions and body language that he felt it was wrong that I was treated so badly. I thought it was a kind gesture.
L'Orignal=L'Orignal has done me and my friends so wrong.  I don't know where I can get the same quality and delicious of a meal back home.  The restaurant is on a cellar level, hidden yet present on the streets of Montreal.  The inside is cozy and romantic, with a great emphasis on game-to-table type of food.  This was no doubt the best meal of our weekend.To start, our table ordered the Bison Tartare (game is game, right?).  This appetizer comes with a touch of Middle Eastern style - the way they separate the different ingredients - onions, cheese, pickles, meat, sauce with a fried pita bread.  We all enjoyed the game meat, just a tad different from what we normally eat.  Next, we ordered their special appetizer - salmon salad.  Raw salmon, with cucumbers, peppers, capers, and acidic goodness.  It was a salad not to be missed.  After that, they sent us a "complimentary salad".  What came out was two huge plates of salad, with kale, carrots, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, and more.  The dressing was good, making the salad amazing!  The appetizers didn't stop there.  Next, we ordered the beet risotto with walnut pesto.  Another creamy creation.  Moving on, everyone settled down to their own plate of entree.  My friend and I shared the special entree - I can't remember the specifics, but it was a trout or some kind of white fish.  Steamed fresh, took a while to cook, and decorated with tons of delicious greens.  The fish was meaty and tender.  If they keep this special entree up, you've got to try it!4.5Pricey... but the meal is worth it. For my first meal in Montreal, I had the good fortune to share it with the reigning reine of the City of Saints, Risa D. As I wandered through the narrow streets and alleyways, I wondered what she had in store. As soon as I opened the door, heard the strains of an awesome Spotify playlist and smelled what was going on in the kitchen, I knew I was in for a good night.Set in what looks like a hip hunting lodge basement, L'Orignal is original. Behind us was a Montreal version of the Sex & The City ladies. To our right was an older man and his young, buff male escort. Further in the dining room was a rowdy table of Canadian bros. Never would I think to put all these disparate types together, but it works. All this observing and judging made me thirsty, so I began the evening with a Grape Escape cocktail. For a time, I was on a muddled grape kick so this vodka concoction really fit the bill. Not only that, but it was a nice pairing with my soupe courge (that's butternut squash to you non-francophones). Warmed up and feeling good, I ordered the pasta of the day (rabbit cavatelli) and a robust Bordeaux to accompany it (Château Puy-Landry). The pasta was a revelation. Living in New Orleans for a few years, I'd had rabbit more than a few times and I was never that big a fan. Going with the dish based upon the recommendation of our waitress, I held some skepticism. It was for naught. The cavatelli was delicious and the rabbit bore none of the nasty gaminess I remembered. In fact, the meal was positively decadent and spot-on for a chilly night in Old Montreal/Old Port. Be aware that taxes run high and tip isn't included in the meal (I'm used to getting gouged with auto-gratuity in Miami).
Willows Restaurant=Tried the seafood pasta special here a year or so ago and was underwhelmed- too much crayfish and not much flavor, as I recall.  Desserts here are much better, though; Warning: those with a sweettooth should be extra careful dining at The Eagles Buffet next door, especially on Mother's Day... unless you have the discipline to put extra time at the gym!Had lunch here today (3/10)- turkey club (smoked turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and mayo on fresh croissant) and crispy sweet potato fries as my choice of side.  Yes, I chose this spot only bec. I had a craving for SPF!  I only had 30 minutes' time alloted for lunch (which explains the lack of photos), but I thought a simple sandwich and fries wouldn't take much time.  Was I wrong!  First of all, it took 5 minutes from the moment I was seated at the table for my server to take my order.  Second, my order took more than 15 minutes to arrive, but I had to send the fries back as they were very soggy.  After a few minutes, however, these fries were perfect!  The sandwich included processed turkey slices (circular slices straight from the bag) and a lettuce leaf that was just large enough to span the length and width of the croissant.  I did appreciate the fact that the slices of bacon were pretty lean- I am one to trim off cooked fat from bacon before placing them back in my sammies.  (I know I'm NOT the only one that does this!)  I wouldn't recommend the turkey club or other sandwiches where processed meats might be used.  Perhaps the entrees would be your best bet (pun intended!).  I DO suggest you try the desserts (I spied small glasses of milkshakes being delivered to their lucky owners) and the extra-crispy sweet potato fries.  Neighbors ooh'ed and ahh'ed over their lovely slices of strawberries and cream cake with coffee.
Good Food on Montford=I have visited GFOM four times.  I love the food, I think it is a little expensive.  Our check average was $66 without tip.  So, be prepared if you are one of those people that love to graze and order everything your heart desires!  Tonight I tried the pork bun and it was delicious.  I sometimes get hooked on an item in a restaurant and this is one of those times.  The pork bun was dripping with natural juices from the pork and hoisin sauce and then you would get a crisp bite from pickled veggies.  It was served on a cute little square cutting board, I would lift the cutting board to my mouth so it wouldn't drip down my chin.  YUMMY!One complaint is they do not do separate checks, which in this day and time with computers, it's so much easier.  If you haven't been to GFOM, strap your wallet on and go have a great meal!Third time's a charm for Good Food! Yes, we've tried to eat here twice before and both times the wait was astronomical (2 hours, 1 hr 45 min). So, that's the first tip for everyone - the folks at Good Food do not take reservations, um, ever, I think?But onto the evening, inside GFOM is simple, understated yet elegant. There's a pretty and low key bar, a fair number of tables and wonderful staff. Hubs and I were seated within minutes and tried a sampling of dishes. Before I get to the eats, I will concur with others - I think the plates (small and large) are a bit on the pricey side. So, perhaps it's not the most fiscally responsible move to head here when you're super hungry as the portions are small. Food time...Mixed green salad: 4/5: A lovely salad, delicious and light with baby parsnips, cranberries and hazelnuts. Super light and a perfect way to start the feeding.Smoked Salmon: 5/5: I don't even really like (or order) smoked salmon and I loved this dish. The fresh, smoked salmon with egg, potato & capers with dill creme fraiche was a perfect blend of flavors. The little chippers were great! Seared Scallop w/risotto: 3/5: My lease favorite of the dishes as I was expecting more complex flavor. While the items reads beautifully, butternut squash risotto, shaved fennel & bacon, my scallop (there were 2 on the plate) was quite undercooked and lacked depth. Steamed Bun: 4/5: Nom worthy. It's been a long time since I've had a steamed pork bun of this caliber. The five spice rubbed pork belly was perfectly tender yet crispy on the edges and I loved the hoisin & pickled vegetables.Baked Cavatappi: 3/5: A good baked pasta dish w/fresh, gooey mozzarella. Coming from a family of very talented Italian cooks, I wasn't wowed by the sauce but I did really love the Italian sausage mixed in. Pork tenderloin (the only large plate we ordered): 3/5: The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and intense with smokey flavor yet the fried mac 'n cheese triangles were underwhelming. I didn't taste much cheese! Pumpkin Bread Pudding: 5/5: Drool. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order bread pudding because I get so disappointed when it turns out all French toast like. But this bread pudding was moist, bursting with delectable pumpkin flavor and topped with a gorgeous sliver of pumpkin seed brittle and some of the most delicious cheesecake ice cream I've had. Get it. Since the menu is eclectic and certainly inspired, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more good food from GFOM!Why was I so stubborn?  When i first saw this place it looked a little shabby from the outside and its name, well was not so imaginative. I saw the yelp reviews and couldn't believe this place was that good. I was completely wrong.The inside of the place is so much more appealing than the outside.  Tapas style american cuisine is how I would describe this place. My friend and I asked the waitress what we should start with.  She told us the mussels were the best in Charlotte.  She wasn't far off.  Drenched in a nice smooth curry sauce the combination was unbeatable.  From there, I moved onto the scallops.  The scallops were pretty good, but the cous cous underneath was some of the best I had. Since the food was good and I'm fat I decided to order the pork tenderloin as well.  This portion was considerabley bigger and was just amazing.  The pork was cooked to perfection and the chorizo hash & chili demi really set this dish off.  I will be back and my friend has been telling me that he will be taking his girl here when she comes down.  Bottom line, looks are decieving and this place is a diamond in the rough.Finally made it out for an early dinner at Good Food. Can't believe it has taken me this long to check it out so I can write this review. Seeing as how this is one of Crown Town's more popular spots, the time was nigh to get in and sample the fare. A small, and plain building. Not too much going on inside. Just tables, booths, high-tops, and bar seating. Such close quarters that the aromas from the kitchen fill the dining area and inhabit your clothes. Not a bad characteristic. First off, I have to express my love for these guys having Northcoast's Scrimshaw Pilsner on draught. Not a common tale for most places in town. This alone sets the bar apart from the rest. I can recognize that tap handle from anywhere....5/5 for this. Ordered a smattering from the menu. Cheese plate: 4/5. Camembert, bleu, honeycomb, fig spread and two others I can't recall. Served with grilled bread. No combination that was undesirable. Falafel: 3/5. Rather plain, and the greek yogurt on top seemed to add to the plainness. 5/5 for presentation, though. Pork Bun: Unreal. 5/5. Perfect texture, flavor and presentation. I was absolutely thrilled. Corn Rissotto: 4/5 Sweet, and wholesome. Nothing over the top, but just right. A rather large portion, too. Gnocchi: 5/5. Just perfect. Amazing flavor and all of the mushrooms were wonderful. I didn't want it end. The addition of the chicken was fine, but could have gone without. Dessert: Apple cobbler with seasonal ice cream 3/5. Just nothing groundbreaking here. Presentation was fine, flavors were fine, but just didn't seem to have that special element. We made it in at 5:40, right after they opened. I would emulate this again. Nice having an early dinner and missing most of the crowd. Service was incredible and so fast. Very knowledgeable about the menu. Very much looking forward to returning!Just had one of the best dinning experiences of my life and it only lasted 35 minutes because I was running late, but I can not wait  to go back to Good Food.  At first glance Good Food is very inviting, with cork block walls and wood ceilings, a nicely stocked bar and an open kitchen, but what really gives it a nice fealing is its warm and inviting staff and of course the food. Our waiter Jeffrey was amazing we didn't tell him we were in a hurry, but our food moved out of the kitchen quickly throughout our meal and we never felt rushed. We did not order alchohol that night and he still treated us as if we were his only customers. Oh and did I mention our food?   We indulged ourselves in perfect portions of pea risotto, Korean beef stir fry, heirloom tomato  homemade mozzarella salad, and a cheese plate. When we went to leave our waiter said no dessert and we explained we were in a rush. He said no problem and quickly brought out our check and thanked us for coming, Another waiter saw us get up and asked if  everything was ok? He was truly concerned we were unhappy and we could not be more delighted with the service or our meal. Loved it!  Never have I seen a staff take so much pride in a restaurant. Can't wait to come back!Many of my area foodie-cronies oft-hail Good Food as "the best restaurant in Charlotte". Though it's located but a stone's throw from my office, I had never taken the opportunity to dine there. Perhaps because of the heavy, universal praise it receives I had relegated it to some mythic status worthy only of an extremely special occasion. Through the birthday wishes of my esteemed friend Katherine, however, my hand was forced, and on a breezy Tuesday evening in October I finally cracked Good Food's threshold. We had on this night a crew of seven, which pushes the limits of Good Food's per-table capacity - but though they take no reservations, they easily and quickly accommodated our party (just by glancing through the restaurant's open front glass as I walked up past the posh little stuffed-sofa lounging area on the patio out front, I had taken note of the bustling little bar and seemingly cramped dining space and pessimistically doomed-and-gloomed us to not getting a table any time soon - way to prove me wrong, Good Food!). We were seated in the back near rear the rear exit and greeted promptly by our server...If I may break from my review narrative for a moment and go on a not-colorful tangent: Our waitress was extraordinarily pregnant. I'm not sure why I found this so troubling, but it vexed me greatly. While I completely understand an expectant mother's need and desire to continue working and earning money while gestating a child, that somehow doesn't gel well with a dining experience. In my mind, very-pregnant women should not be on their feet serving me food and drinks. It's odd. It makes me feel like a jerk. I wanted so badly to offer her my chair and maybe even go so far as to extend to her the courtesy of foot massage. Yet, circumstantially, most would argue that that would have been an odd thing to do. I felt like I was in a weird social trap with no chivalrous outlet. So, ultimately, I just sat up really straight and tried not to curse too much. Back to the review: Good Food's dining area is nothing short of "adorable" - the quotes are for implying a sort of quaint/artsy/charming/small aspect to that adorability. It is dim and loud, with various eras of exposed brick lending their geometry to the perimeter, browns and yellows and old bronze colors filling the whole of the palette, and ornate crossworks of fused forks and spoons and knives creating the lightshades and wall-art. There's nothing exceptional about the decorations of the space itself, but it all coalesces into being very successful at establishing what it means to. Drinks here trend toward wine and fancy cocktails, not surprisingly, but there are a handful of well-selected local beers available as well. I tried the elderflower martini - it burned soft and was cleverly earthy, but somehow felt unbalanced. On subsequent rounds I just ordered NoDa brewing's Hop Drop n Roll. The beer felt uncouth for the situation, but it's what I wanted.  Katherine, being the expert on Good Food's multi-round-small-plates ordering methodology, got us started with some pomme frites, a couple hot little dishes of steamed broccoli and battered cheddar, and a rather fancy cheese plate. All served quickly, all tasty, and all presented cleanly without pretense - I appreciate a subtle plating. Yet, I was not quite impressed.For a "main course", my ladyfriend and I went splitsies on the seared scallops and a daily special of grouper served atop mixed veggies. Others at our table opted for the gnocchi or the garganelli pasta - which we all bandied about and sampled from incautiously, which seems to be the way of Good Food. Again, each dish was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, and promptly served... but I was still not quite impressed. Katherine, now five martinis in and guffawing heartily at AJ's even silliest quips, was ready for more and so we commenced desserts. We all shared spoonsful of a decadent chocolate-and-peanut butter brownie cake type thing as well as a so-sweet-it-hurt strawberry cheesecake. With these I was nearly impressed - but I'm hardpressed to qualify desserts as a reason to elevate a restaurant's food-status. After paying our three-hundred-dollar tab, we left feeling happy, not too full, and a little bit buzzed. Which I supposed is a very grown-up alternative to the stuffed-and-wasted condition through which my friends and I usually stumble our way out of a restaurant. In the end my assessment is that while good, Good Food is not great. There are a dozen restaurants in Charlotte that, in my mind, are just as tasty for half the price and twice the fun. But I also accept that perhaps, gluttonous and ravenous that I am, I might not be Good Food's ideal patron. If you're sophisticated, overpaid, and perpetually on a diet... this is probably the best restaurant in Charlotte.I would eat here every weekend, if possible. I love Good Food on Montford. Love.Looks are deceiving, but I think that is what they were going for when they picked this location. From the outside, it's nothing flashy but a solid frame with floor to ceiling glass front windows. The interior is modern, contemporary and very tasteful. They nailed the minimalist and cozy ambiance. They have each table set and ready for your arrival.I really like the small tapas plate concept. You can pick and choose various dishes to share with your partner. Awww, romantic. Tip: Get 2 steamed buns so you won't end up fighting over it; it is that delicious you each want your own. I'm going to make it my mission to try each item...the quail wraps and Korean beef were very flavorful. They focus on seasonal dishes using local and/or organic options. Fab. The wine selection was very good and the servers make great recommendations. Last, but not least was the dessert. They had the most fantastic blackberry ice cream (yes, it was a few seasons ago) paired with a cake or cobbler dish. Mmmm.The service was fantastic! Just the perfect amount of attention balanced with privacy. The most perfect dining experiences are when you lose track of time, deep in conversation, eating fantastically prepared food, and dishes are each a work of art. You will get all of that at Good Food. My favorite. Just wish they would accept reservations.I live in New York City, and a client of mine took me here for dinner one night. I have to say, this is one of the best restaurants that I have been to-- ANYWHERE. The drinks (I got some sort of Gin drink with egg white in it?) and wine list area great. But the food is the star. I can't remember EVERYTHING we got, but I cannot think of one thing that we got where I wasn't saying, "Oh my GOSHHHH!" every time I tried it. Here are the things I can remember: Cheese plate-- deliciousPomme Frites-- OH. MY. GAWD.Steamed Bun-- Delicious... very very good.However, the stand out dish for me was the mussels dish  (Green Curry, Coconut Milk & Cilantro). This is last meal of your life good. Like "you are thinking about it when you leave contemplating how fat you'd appear to be if you went back after your work function and got 7 orders of it to go to your hotel room" good.The dessert, cappuccino, service, everything was top top notch and I've been to some of the best restaurants in NYC. To top it all off, the place is not even remotely pretentious. Friendly bar tenders, servers, even the manager/owner who knew the client I brought was talking us up the whole time. It's both laid back and upscale at the same time so you can put your elbows on the table and enjoy a good conversation while getting a great, upscale meal. That is, if you can fit anything else on the table along with all of the plates filled with delicious food.I cannot WAIT to go back.Pro tip: Sit in the back bar!! *Person in back of crowd screams* "There's seating in the back? I thought it was just cramped tables??"Yes. There is seating in the back. And it's spacious, intimate, and wonderful, and on a weekday, it means you can probably skip the wait 100%. And now you know.The Lady and I went out for a nicer dinner, put our name on the list, and was told about 25-30 minutes, if that. And guys, that was fine with us. We tried to find a place at the bar where we could squeeze in and order a drink, and lo and behold there were 2 seats for us in the back. Score. Plus, that station is the dessert station, so you get to see the dessert prep throughout your meal. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.Drinks: Wine for the Lady and Dark n' Stormy for myself.Food: Parmesan Gnocchi. Fantastic flavor, super rich, good consistency for the gnocchi. Loved the mushrooms in it.Battered Broccoli: Wish that there was more salt, I suppose the vinegar in the jalepenos was supposed to provide that, but I didn't get that in a majority of bites. Solid flavors though, just lacked a bit of seasoning. Steamed Bun: This is what I came for. Awesome. Much satisfaction. Go get one now. Shrimp: These were surprisingly stellar!! I actually asked the chef about the cooking method for these and got a mini recipe, so I'm very thankful that they were willing to share that. The combination of the apple, sweet potato, and shrimp together made a fantastic dish that I want to try to replicate. Great night. Great restaurant. And I feel it's a bit underwhelming to say that it's just *Good* Food. Yelp, it's GREAT food.
The Landings=I'm a sucker for a random breakfast place. It gets me right in the feels.Landings is a prime example of this; small, a tad outdated, and the aroma of hash browns hangs heavy in the air. I chose this place based strictly on the randomness of it, not the food pictures or reviews. This place could of had a 2 star average rating and I still would have eaten here. I sat on the outdoor patio hoping to catch a glance of a few planes landing and maybe Danny Zuko himself, John Travolta, walking out and joining me for a cup of coffee. This didn't happen, but some food did. I went crazy and got the Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and hash browns. Pretty basic carb filled breakfast. Steak was cooked right, the eggs were fluffy and the hash browns to seared to a crispy perfection. I really can't complain about anything. Landings is a greasy spoon, but disguised as a nicer and cleaner eating venue. Great place for a low key meal and view of the strip. PRO TIP: Sunday is the only day they serve Eggs Benedict. Nummers!
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse=I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for, but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's ! Some updated reasons why I love this place:*Happy Hour pricing during all football games*They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck*Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain.*They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast . *Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching.*No gaming, no smoking*Huge menu Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !I have to admit BJ's is probably one of my least favorite chain restaurants, so I'm never too excited to go to any location. I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist. We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy. As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless. I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit.
Zoës Kitchen=I love Zoe's! But don't try to go here in the middle of lunch hour. By 12:30 all the tables inside and out are filled and there's a line out the door.But should you be one of those lucky ones who can go to lunch at 11:30 then it's a perfect place for lunch. The food is good, reasonably priced and fresh. There is low calorie fare as well as some items that have a little more than you would like but who cares it's your day off counting calories anyway.The Steak roll-ups and chicken roll-ups are my favorite but having just tried the kabobs I think that's about to change.One thing to remember is that if you have a smart phone, join the club, take a picture of every receipt you have from a meal there and they will e-mail you a coupon for something. Usually it's a soda or chips or a side salad, but the other day it was for 1 free entree . . . and that steak kabob was mine.
AZ Wine Co=I went to a wine tasting event here and I have to say I was impressed with the selection, prices and hospitality of the owners.  This is a great local business.They have a nice casual seating area and a size able bar.  Nifty!I scored a nice 92 point Port for $8.95.  $8.95!
OTB Bicycle Café=I stopped by last night (Thurs.) at 7pm for a casual dinner date with CM.  OTB was recommended to me by my table mate from brunch at the Zenith, who is the manager at REI and a friend of OTB's owner.  Since I had a City Dining Card and was intrigued by the idea of burgers incorporating peanut butter, I'm a cyclist and found the theme interesting, and the location was somewhat convenient for a Waterfront run, we braved the frigid weather and craziness of the South Side to check it out.Since our waitress informed us that Thurs. night is quarter seitan wing night, we ordered six wings ($0.25) dressed in buffalo sauce with blue cheese, along with some soft pita pieces ($1) for our appetizer.  Although it bears mentioning that the "wings" were more like oblong chunks (see photo), they had a great coating and texture, and the buffalo sauce added a nice zing to them.  Additionally, we each ordered a bowl of soup ($3.99 each): tomato-based vegetable for CM and tomato soup for me.  My tomato soup was nothing too special, but was nice and thick, though I would have preferred if it had been made with milk instead of water (I can always tell).  Because he was feeling a bit under the weather, CM really enjoyed his soup--although I didn't sample it due to concerns about his contagiousness.For my entree, per the recommendation of my table mate at the Zenith, I ordered the dirt rag delight: A burger topped with Wholey's peanut butter, American cheese, and dill pickle slices ($9.49).  Because I don't eat beef, I went with a chicken patty, and of course, I just had to add bacon ($1 upcharge).  This burger was definitely one of the most unique burgers I've ever eaten, and it didn't disappoint!  The peanut butter had a wonderfully gritty, homemade texture and just the right hint of sweetness, complementing the savoriness of the pickles, cheese, and bacon perfectly.  Despite the copious number of components, the burger didn't fall apart as I was eating it, which is the hallmark of a good quality bun.  Because he was trying to eat on the healthy side due to feeling under the weather, CM went with the roadie panini ($7.99), adding chicken for an upcharge of $3.  Again, I didn't try it due to a desire to avoid contamination, but he enjoyed it, and ended up taking half home.  Both sandwiches came with a generous side of fries, which were coated with a nice, crispy batter with a hint of ranch flavor.Service was about what I'd expect at a place like OTB: Generally pretty quick, if not super attentive, with slight awkwardnesses at times (e.g., we weren't greeted upon entering, and had to seek out a waitress to ask if we could seat ourselves).  Likewise, the atmosphere was about what I expected: Fairly quiet (for a bar, at least), with a TV playing college basketball and bike themed paraphernalia.  We sat in the back dining room, which only had a few other parties at the time of our visit.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is a non-smoking establishment.Overall, CM and I were pleased with the quality and quantity of food that we received, especially with the City Dining Card and seitan wing discounts (our total check: $22 + change).  As such, I'd recommend OTB as a casual spot to grab a few drinks and some dinner or late night snacks, regardless of whether you're a cyclist or not.  Just don't forget to check out their daily specials, and take advantage of them accordingly!One thing I'm a fan of is good ol' bar food! Throwing it in the fryer, putting it on a bun -- all sounds delicious to me. OTB definitely meets to my standard of bar food and more. All of their items are carefully designed to satisfy the greasy spoon (like myself) while still allowing me to challenge my taste buds with a taste elegance.My boyfriend and I both ordered the Pittsburgh Burger. Amazing! Not only cooked to perfection, but dressed with just the right toppings and seasonings to turn bar food into a fine(r) dining experience. They both came with a side of potato fries which is always a win. The stand-out item that we both died over was the soft pretzels. I don't know how they made them or what they used to perfect such a mouthwatering menu item, but it was darn good. It reminded me of the breading of a corn dog. Light, soft and oh so yummy. Of course, the bier cheese was a great addition for dipping.The atmosphere here is really cool. It's definitely much different than the typical South Side bar. You don't encounter too much of the the usual "doucheness," and everybody is there to enjoy themselves. There is lots of interesting artwork and bike memorabilia on the wall which adds to the ambience. I'm not sure what I'd call them theme of the place, but I do know that it is working!Katie is a great bartender and will make you fabulous drinks. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a vodka drinker anymore and the drinks she made us lasted all night (I guess that's not a bad thing for my wallet). They were delicious, but homeboy is getting old! I can't do these vodka dranks anymore. Definitely will be returning soon. Decent prices (though drinks can be a little cheaper), great food and not overcrowded like some South Side bars.This place is awesome in so many ways.  I've been here during a biking session to refuel, to casually drink and to bring a friend for a burger and all 3 times have been consistent.I ate the Dirty Rag (a burger with pickle and peanut butter) from their large varieties of burgers and its the fuel you need to recover or to start going.  This place makes me want peanut butter on all my burgers.  The fries have that crispy potato dust flavor you dirt find many places that make them extra good and the drink selection is always fresh with lots of specials.The environment is very unique and friendly and the bartenders are always on top of things.  I would highly recommend visiting this place and getting bacon wrapped bananas on a burger.  Trust me, it's worth it.
Arriba Mexican Grill=I have been to three Arriba's locations. The original in Phoenix on Camelback, the one in Scottsdale near FLW and this one in Gilbert. The Phoenix location has always been GREAT in all areas, food, service, etc! I have been there so many times I couldn't even guess as to how many, in fact they should give me a life time supply of roasted chilies. When they opened the Scottsdale location I was surprised that the quality and flavor was the same, and really I have no complaints there either. However the Gilbert location is just bad, and I have given them a fair number of chances and it just seems to get worse.  General repeating themes...1.  The hostesses are not welcoming, Granted I don't expect them to wash my feet or anything, but at least act like i'm not interrupting your day.  2. I won't say all, but at least a good portion of the wait staff seem to have real issues getting orders correct. Not sure what is going on there maybe it's the kitchen, either way it is frustrating. Especially when they act like it's you...On one of my last visits the manager was actually arguing with another customer about the fact that her drink glass was soapy. Why argue? Apologize and make it right.3. The quality of the food here is definitely not on par with the other locations I have been to. Since the Chili Verde has always been one of my favorites I will pick on it...There is just something wrong with the way they make it at this location...Personally I think it is too much thickener, flour or cornstarch. The second time I encountered this I tried to fix it on my own by asking for a side of Hatch chili's instead of the default Jalapeño topper. That helped a bit, but the pasty undertone was still there. In the end what finally killed it for me going to this location was the last couple of times I was there the rice was just the worst. It was just mushy flavorless paste colored with a little tomato sauce. When I mentioned it I was told this is how it has always been??? Uh NO it has not!4. The last item is admittedly nit picky and that is they don't bring out the hot salsa by default. They just bring the bean dip and mild salsa. Well I can excuse this as long as when I ask you bring it...No sense in wasting salsa that the local folks don't want. Bottom line...If you have a successful restaurant and start opening more locations, the first thing you better accept is that food consistency between locations is a must. Even the little things like what salsa to expect with your chips makes a difference, and when you have bigger problems the little things just add fuel to the fire. I hope Arriba's head office sees these posts and cracks the whip at this location! I love the other locations and would really like to be able to visit one close to home...
CiCi's Pizza=Finally!  After watching all those damn commercials...and being deprived of this chain in NorCal, I had an opportunity to visit this fairly new restaurant in Las Vegas.  Right when I walked in, and throughout my whole dining experience, there were a few things that really stood out.  For an all day buffet...this restaurant was surprisingly clean.  From the buffet bar to the tables, I noticed that the staff was attentive and quick in creating a presentable and sanitary dining environment.  And they were so darn friendly and full of life!  I wish I had that much energy at my work!All-you-can-eat pizza was shockingly impressive!  I was fortunate to always get fresh, hot, crispy-crusted pizzas.  I enjoyed most of their specialty pizzas:  Spinach Alfredo, BBQ Buffalo Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Zesty Pepperoni (also in deep dish), Alfredo, and Mexican Style Ole (taco).  The regular one/two topping pizzas weren't bad either.  One of my favorite items was the Flip, a seasoned pocket style pizza with pepperoni and cheese.  Their tossed signature salads were okay.  I thought that the BLT Ranch was better than the Classic Italian.  I didn't have room for their soup or pasta...since I was eyeing their freshly baked brownies and cinnamon rolls.  Brownies were too moist for me, but their hot cinnamon rolls may be the reason why I'm coming back!So I've been here twice within 3 days and not because I wanted to.  I'm not a fan of buffets for my lack of self control.  LOL  Monday I brought my daughter and her friend for lunch.  Immediately you are greeted by all the employees "Welcome to Cici's!".  Pretty nice little greeting I must say. The girl at the cashier asked "how many" and I said 3.  As I started to ask about the child rate she handed me a receipt that said 3 adults.  I simply asked her what was the age for the child rate.  She in turn asked me how old the girls were.  I replied that both of them are 11 and in passing asked "oh is the age 10 and under" and she replied back "no its 11 and under".  She proceeded to look past me to help the next customer and I shook my head and decided to just dismiss that whole convo.  Challenging stupidity doesn't make for a good lunch with my girls.We quickly found our seats and the girls were up and at em.  We each grabbed a tray.  A couple of the dishes I picked up were dirty so I just set them to the side. The pasta is one of my favorite simple things however when I got up there the pasta needed refilled.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they knew their pasta needed refilled.  She replied "yes" and continued with her pizzas not even headed to the pasta to see what I was referring to.  Instead she addressed some "regular" customers behind me-hence the immediate dismissal of the question.  Kinda awkward to say the least. Finally 10 minutes later it was refilled. Sigh.They serve pasta salad, salad, soup, corkscrew pasta with red and white sauce, breadsticks & garlic knots, a plethora of pizza and a few dessert options.  Their  food is what it is....a really cheap family buffet.  With that said the pizzas leave a lot to be desired, don't have much cheese or meat, have a lot of dough but is all good for the carb-evore in you!  This place really should be named CiCi's CARB Buffet! Its a bread lovers dream! You seriously need to put in some cardio time after eating here.The place is pretty beat up.  The walls, floors and tables are scuffed up and chipped.  Its definitely a place to bring all the children and your neighbors children.  You can tell they all have been here! LOL  There are TVs mounted up high that had children shows on them.  You cant hear the sound so I'm always not sure why restaurants even bother.  There is a small arcade in the back that the kids love.  There's a community board that has a few things posted but looks all greasy from little hands touching it.  Another dirty detail.Now while the girls were spending their couple dollars on the arcade I was checking in on my handy dandy YELP app on my phone.  While I sit there and observe the chaos around me, my eyes found there way up the wall in slow motion....  Eeek! The Health Department grade!  Like an elephant in the room-how did I miss it when it was right in front of me the whole time I was eating!  I can say I'm not surprised however at the same time I'm not even sure if I had ever seen a C Grade in person.  Hm. That's right Graded a C!  Thank goodness it was after we ate because that is a sure turn off to me regardless of the details.  I do watch Restaurant Impossible! LOLOn a side note, at the end of our meal the manager came over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction.  I decided not to bother to inform him of the awkward and lazy service from his employees.  I think the place is run with super young people with lack of guidance possibly.  He was just a baby himself-or I'm just old.  I beg to differ.  LOL  Needless to say, I will not be back anytime soon.  This is only a "when I have to" place to eat - category of Chuck E Cheese. LOL.  I will for sure be checking the grade next time though with curiosity of an upgrade! ;)
Avalon=The best thing about this place was the bathrooms! They were great, I would pee in them any day of the week. The food (lobster, fillet mignon) was nothing special and for the price I would have expected a little more food then what I got, that's for sure. The food came almost too fast which gave me the impression that the food was pre-made and just microwaved, and most of it was almost cold - so if I was them I would invest in a better microwave. They did have good shrimp but you only get 3. I have definitely had better and paid less for it.My husband came home and announced we were going to a chocolate and wine class at Avalon in a few weeks.  I don't know that I need to take a class to eat chocolate and drink wine, but I was amazed he actually set something like this up!  I later learned it was his buddy's idea, so thank you Derek for bromancing my husband!I decided we should check out Avalon beforehand as a possibility for dinner the same night.  Situated across the street from a strip mall on McDowell, I wasn't expecting much.  But the gorgeous fountain out front gave me hope.  When we walked in, I was in love with my surroundings.  This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been in lately.  Dark wood, glass tiles in shades of blue, beautiful lighting...this is exactly how I want to design my home...not that anyone should really care about that.  I ordered a breakfast quesadilla which included cheddar and smoked gouda cheeses and was topped with an avocado pico de gallo.  It was far too much for one person, even when said person is me.  I also ordered a side of rosemary herb potatoes which were really flavorful, but a little on the salty side.  My husband had the farmer's market frittata which included artichoke, grilled asparagus, and havarti.  He really enjoyed it as well.  The best deal of brunch was the mimosa.  A split  of champagne and a small carafe of fresh orange juice for $9 yielded nearly 3 drinks!Since I'm not a huge fan of breakfast/brunch, I will definitely return for dinner soon.  As it stands, I completely agree with Andrew F in that it must be the location that has kept Avalon under the radar.  Although this may not have been the best brunch I have had, it was certainly better than many places that seem to be much busier.I can't believe I never reviewed Avalon! I'm very glad it's my 500th review though, so let's begin:I happened upon Avalon during CRAVE Arizona's week of festivities October 21 - 24. My shop was the retail partner for the wine events and I was required to attend one of the luncheons on Friday, Oct 23. What a tough life I lead. Avalon is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but they excel at what they are doing so it's a destination worth finding. My lunch was exquisitely paired with two WA wineries, Milbrant and Gordon Brothers. It's actually pretty hard to make a perfect pairing with very specific wines so kudos to Executive Chef Travis Watson for his masterful menu. I'm going to ruin your whole day right now and tell you what I ate:First Course Smoked mussel soup with crispy leeks and crusty garlic bread - I love mussels but the idea of mussels out of the shell kind of creeps me out. This soup was so smoky and spicy everyone at our luncheon asked for more. It was served in a demitasse which was tragic, but a great way to start an amazing meal.Second Course Organic petite green salad with Granny Smith apples and walnut streusel - Chef Travis came out to talk to us about how his goal with Avalon is to source local, biodynamic and organic produce and meats across the board. This salad was fresh with just that hint of sweetness from the streusel. It wasn't overwhelming at all and I thought the Riesling we had with it was an inspired match.Third Course Grilled rib eye steak with black truffle risotto, foie butter and baby heirloom beets - I'm not a vegetarian anymore. I'm not even going to pretend. I chowed on this steak and it was delightful, very pink in the middle and deliciously moist. The risotto was a little dry and not very hot; my only critique of the day. The heirloom beets were orange and tiny and I actually ate them (not a beet fan). Fourth Course Milk chocolate and salted caramel torte with espresso essence and tangerine pearls - aaaaaa! This was ridiculously good, and waaaay too big after all we'd eaten. I'm a dark chocolate fan myself, but this worked in every way imaginable. The milk chocolate and the salty caramel? puhleese it was amazing. I saw three of my clients heading out after their own lunch in another half of the restaurant and they told me this is their go to place for high quality eats. They sang me the praises of the lobster bisque, though they told me the wine selection was seriously lacking. Aww they are so loyal! I met two couples at the lunch who were also voracious fans of Avalon and hysterically shouted across the table that we all need to support this place and tell our friends. I'm with them; do yourself a favor and dine at Avalon.
The Brookside II Sports Bar & Grill=OK, I would like to first start off by saying if a business is going to put fake reviews up for themselves, at least say something different each time. I do not think a GM has been mentioned this much, ever, within the same day by people with stock Microsoft photo gallery images. Secondly, I gave Brookside II a chance and it made me miss Brookside I- big time. My beer was still cold (a plus) but the menu is severely limited (compared to the novel and diverse menu of the first Brookside) to whatever they can purchase in bulk and deep fry. I could understand this choice if our food was served quickly and it tasted decent, but they failed in both of those areas. For fried mushrooms, chips and salsa, and chicken tenders the members in my party waited probably about 30 minutes. The advertise fresh made tortillas chips but serve it with pace picante. Their nachos were cheese sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and jalapenos, served almost 30 minutes after ordered) for $6.99. My friend ordered the fried cod (see the fried theme) and took two bites and decided to be done. I am not saying that the food at a sports bar should be top notch, but at least good enough to satisfy the need/craving for bar food. Also I think if your menu is going to be largely deep fried based then the food should at least be prompt. Our waitress was the only one on the floor and she was spread too thin and it was obvious. I might go back to grab a beer if I had to meet someone, but as for making an appearance on my own initiative, probably not.
Fernando's Cafe=I opted to come into Fernando's on a Thursday, when they have a lunch special of a 12" wrap or sandwich, fountain drink, and bag of chips for $7.50.  I opted for the lasagna wrap, which was mostly just intriguing.  The wrap contained meatballs, pepperoni, spices, and ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese on the outside.  The actual wrap was really dried out and kind of eh, but the ingredients inside were pretty good.  They have standard fountain drinks and iced tea, and there were lots of different chips to choose from.  The food was nothing special, but it fills a void.Fernando's is basically a local version of Subway, with some slightly different sandwich options.  The set up is the same, and the cleanliness is about the same as a Subway.  So if you are looking to help local business instead of the chains, check this place out.
Carolina's Mexican Food=3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience. I love you Carolina, will you marry me?Compared to the similarly set up Caramba's, this place almost rocked my world. The price, the vibe, the food-all of the above.I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average. This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town.
Corner Bakery Cafe=I have a bad feeling about the longevity of this one. I went in wanting to be impressed.It looks super cute and just my style from the outside ..how can you go wrong with the word Bakery in the title? But  after eating there I can say the food was just meh... my kids both commented it was just okay  and they even  had some of the baked goods. The decor is  part bistro/ part old time feel .. looks cute with baked goods in covered glass tiers on the counter.  The service is just like Paradise or Wildflower Bread ..but the food is not as good or creative in my book. My chopped salad was chopped so small that I couldn't quite eat  it and wished I had a spoon.  Flavor in the salad was uninspired and got old quick . As my oldest said " I can't quite see us going back".Panera?  Paradise?  Wildflower?  Corner Bakery?  I would rank them:1. Wildflower2. ?3. ?4. Panera5. Corner Bakery6. Paradise BakeryThis is of course only a ranking of these upscale concept sort of places where you can order things like soup or salad & half a sandwich and a muffin or cookie.And you can pull out your laptop and use free wifi (often what brings me in).I am backlogged on review writing so many will be out of order. I have been to Phoenix 3x's this year already and will be going another 2 times before years end. This past April, when I was in town I met my mom and an old co-worker of hers that I hadn't seen since my baby shower almost 17 years ago now. I had never been to a CB before and since Wildflower hadn't opened yet and Paradise (aka-more options Panera) had already been tried, I was excited to see what this place was about.Like Panera, it is an order at the counter and they bring you your food. They have tons of options for breakfast, lunches and dinners from sandwiches, baked goods and salads. Since I arrived late my mom and her friend Bev were already mid-way through their lunches (this wasn't a planned meeting). I ordered the smaller portion of the Asian Edamame salad adding avocado and water. The young man taking my order was seriously one of the sweetest "kids" I have encountered in a very long time. He explained menu options, we talked about how hard it was working so close to Sun City dealing with all the personality types and so on. They do not have tip jars but he was so sweet that I inquired if they were allowed to take tips. He looked at me as if I was speaking a foreign language. I tipped him and he came from around the corner and gave me a hug. I joined my mom and Bev at the table and the "kid" brought me a piece of cake (not ordered) along with my salad. So sweet. My salad was pretty tasty-the dressing was a bit spicy but tolerable and I liked the food options much better than expected. When we were all done, I gave Bev a hug, and told my mom I was going to get more water to go. The "kid" was on his break having lunch with his GF who then introduced me to her and gave me yet another hug to say thank you. I have never been thanked so much for a $5.00 tip-and it just went to show me how much a little niceness and appreciation can mean to another person. Since this time a I noticed a CB opened locally (review to come) and definitely would go to this location again when in town (after I fulfill my Wildflower Bread Company craving).
The Tailend=The chips. Oh the chips. Crispy, crunchy, perfectly cooked but with a flavour I hadn't tasted since I was a wee lass getting a poke o' chips with my grandparents in their wee Scottish village. I forgot chips could have a flavour like this at all.And that's because everything here, including the batter, is fried in animal fat.I was aware of this before we came, so purposely ordered the grilled fish rather than battered as I knew I'd pay for my sins after. And I had planned on only eating one or two chips. But with the massive bowl in front of me I did pick away and the flavour was just...dreamy.However, for the vegetarian members of our large party of 13 it wasn't as enjoyable. It was only when I tried the first chip that I remembered they were cooked in fat, the moment I could taste it, and it was just at that  moment that Catriona C's fried dish arrived. Being a pesci but absolute no-no meat eater otherwise she couldn't have anything that had been fried. So had to forgo the chips and reorder a grilled piece of meat. The fact they cook things in animal fat isn't explicitly stated anywhere obvious. I think it's a reason a lot of people rave about their food, and the chips were sooooo good. But for veggies it really would be good to have a notice at least. And I do agree with Catriona that the grilled fish offerings were nice but not quite the same as a fried fish supper. I went with cod, and whilst it was a very ample serving and was completely cooked, it came a little cold and not quite grilled as high as I'd like. The red pepper sauce to go with it was really nice (a side order). The salad was quite measly though. So my idea of eating grilled fish and salad as a healthy meal left me still hungry, hence picking on the chips.It is a traditional Scottish fish and chip shop, and a good quality and higher standard one. If you're visiting Scotland and want to experience 'real Scottish food' and want fish and chips, I'd highly recommend The Tailend over the many, many, many others you'll stumble across on the main streets where they deep-fry burgers, pizzas and mars bars.But for a dine in meal I have to say it wasn't what I would normally choose and I was a little bit underwhelmed. The great company of other yelpers, chat, and the chips did leave me feeling satisfied but my fish was quite forgettable and I thought it would taste more...just more.If I wanted fish n' chips, which is very rare, but If I did I would probably come here. But if I wanted dine-in fish restaurant I wouldn't.Also, veggies be warned!
Las Pupusas=Las Pupusas offers one of the best values in food: $1.75 per pupusa, with filling options that include chicken, cheese & herb, bean and cheese, and mixed.  Order two of these, which get served with a shredded lettuce salad and red sauce, and you have a really, really good meal for less than $5!  I haven't tried anything else on the menu (the pupusas are such a good deal it's hard to pass them up!), but I'm sure they will be just as delicious.  The kitchen has a big window that allows you to see all the prep and cooking taking place.  Food is made to order, so be patient as it's worth the wait.  For value and quality, I can't recommend this place enough if you're in North Las Vegas.I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.I ordered some food to go and wasn't impressed at all. Inside is kind of chaotic they need to set things up better so customers know where to go if they want to eat inside or get food to go. The lady who took the order was pushy which made so sense they weren't busy and it's just rude. I ended up getting a burrito with cheese and sour cream to go. the tortilla tasted funky and the meat was not only flavorless but it was so fatty. The burrito looked good in size when I first opened it and then after I started eating it there was an obscene amount of sour cream inside. I mean way more sour cream than the meat. I also noticed there wasn't much cheese but in one spot. I had a bean and cheese pupusas and if this is the way they are supposed to be then why so people like them? I figured there would be more filling but maybe that's how these are made. The fried banana things were the only thing that tasted good.
Pasta Pirate=Arrr, ravioli! The Pasta Pirate is a cozy dark restaurant in the California Hotel, in Downtown Vegas.  It serves pasta (duh!), steak, salads, and a bunch of other stuff.  The service was friendly and it's cool watching the chefs in glass booth make the food for you.  The best part of the meal was the calamari--it was not oily at all and came with a tasty sauce.  Or was it the free wine that comes with every meal? Oh no wait, the BEST part of the meal was that it was FREE! Yay for comped meals! :)*See pics*
Chipotle Mexican Grill=Fills me up!If you're hungry this place will definitely fill you up with the large burritos and my pick the naked bowl. I like choosing my own toppings and the food is fresh. The lines seem to go by quickly as well. I gave it a 3 because the food isn't always consistent and a chain like this should be. Sometimes the chicken is on the dry side or the rice has been overcooked. I hope these things can be worked out because the fresh concept is a great one.This is a convenient location with decent service, but there were a few glitches during my visit. The first girl who helped me was very nice and I put my order in with her but then another girl stepped in. She seemed to be attempting to expedite the orders but all she succeeded in doing is confusing everyone and making it take longer. Since I had already made my requests with the first girl it was a little annoying that she required me to reiterate my order with her. She misheard me and ended up putting the wrong proteins in my order. When I told her about the mistake she seemed annoyed and then the whole line got discombobulated as they had to redo my order and couldn't figure out how to expedite that while handling all the orders behind me. Once they got everything back on track things went smoothly but I was a little perturbed about her attitude. Food was decent once I got it home and everyone but that one particular employ was fine.This place just opened up in the Bermuda Triangle that is Sahara Pavilion(sahara/decatur)Grand Opening is May 8th in the old Spirit of Cuba location. Today they had a fundraiser to benefit Caring 4 Kids Foundation from 5-8 pm. $5 donation you can get ANY & Everything you want off the menu & a drink!My son & I each got a burrito & chips/salsa-we got a barbacoa & chicken. They were huge with rice & choice of beans plus pico,guac & more. The meats were fantastic-real spicy.The service was outstanding , the place was clean & inviting with music pumped in.There are about 10 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables. Probably under 40 people seating indoors, but they have outdoor patio seating too.The only missing is a salsa bar.I'd rather go here anytime over Roberto's & Baja Fresh in this neighborhood.
Rainbow Donuts Bakery and Cafe=I was driving the other day to get on the I-17 and noticed the closed cafe was reopening as a Rainbow Donuts. Cool except I really could care less about the donuts. I drove by today to see that they have opened and they have lunch. That is a good sign. I pop in and see the guy who ran the last deli and his co-worker, ?maybe he reinvented himself? No He was brought in with the new owners. That is cool! I ask for a suggestion and he tells me the Italian Job is good. It has ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, lettuce, tomato, olives, and peppercini's with an Italian dressing on a sourdough. Served with a side of chips, potato salad, pickle or donut. lol I opt for the 1/2 sand and chili with the donut as the side. lol The sand was great and I don't like olives, the chili was homemade and meaty. The donut was superb. They have donuts, pastries, pancakes, scrambles, omelette's, combos, sandwiches, and create your own breakfasts. For lunch they have 7 cold, 5 hot, 4 wraps and a create your own. They also have salads, soups, and burgers. For kids they have PB&J or Grilled Cheese and several snack things like pretzel, quesidilla, nachos, hotdogs etc. They also have coffee and teas of course. I am looking forward to trying more of their creations. Maybe I can get them to cook a real burger.....hmmmI had a egg, and sausage sandwhich the other day. It was very good. Served with donut holes.Imagine this... grilled pastrami, on golden grilled whole grain with spicy mustard and slice of Swiss cheese. YUMMYLil donut holes for dessert....Good place, good food, killer prices, small inside, New England Coffee (Heritage of Taste, i believe?) reasonably quick, GREAT DONUTS.OK Rainbow Donuts has now become Rainbow Donuts and Ninja Bowl. They are changing the "deli style" lunches to rice bowl, wraps types. NO I AM NOT JOKING I had the Ninja bowl with Chicken Spicy. It was grilled chicken and Jalapenos over rice with teriyaki sauce. It was great. They still have the donuts, coffee and great service.Rainbow donut/Ninja Bowl/Bobbys cafe this place gets better and better. Sam the owner of Rainbow and Ninja sold to Claudia and Bobby, who in addition to keeping the donuts and rice bowls are going to do cafe style food too. I had BBQ pork on a toasted hoagie roll. The meat was smoked and tender, served with chips and a drink for $7.95 NOT BAD AT ALL.I am told they will have Broasted Chicken...never had it, but heard good things. I know some yelpers were asking about it awhile ago. She also piqued my interest with a homemade green chili.... mmmmBobby C's is gaining some clients. They were OUT of donuts today around 12:30. Good thing they are open tomorrow. LOLI forget to take pictures but I had a great Philly here 2x already. It is a large soft hoagie roll loaded with chopped ribeye and onion, red and green pepers and swiss. I top mine with sriracha. Hits the spot!I have tried to get Yelp to group all the names of this place into one but still have no response. Rainbow Donuts, Ninja Bowl, is actually Bobby C's. Also they no longer serve the Broasted chicken, there was not enough demand. :(
Regions Bistro & Bar=The menu only exists in order to know what the restaurant doesn't have.  I understand it's only been open a little over a month, but running out of just about everything means they are very poorly managed and have a very poor business model.I was here twice in April, "New England" month.  Unfortunately for them, I lived in Boston for 5 years.  Let's hope they don't try to do New England ever again in the future.  The chowder was terrible.  The RI style calamari was a joke.  There were literally 5 pieces of squid on the plate (and no lemon).  After those, I was too scared to order any of the other regional dishes.On my first visit, very shortly after they had opened, a friend ordered a Mai Tai right off the specialty drink menu.  It was served to her and she immediately noticed it was the wrong color.  "Where's the dark rum?"  "Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it."  Note to bartender - if someone orders a drink and you don't have the right ingredients, ask if they would mind a substitution.  My bet is that they might order something different.Later in the month on the second trip, we tried to order the crab mac and cheese.  Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.  So instead I ordered the Chop Salad.  Amazingly, it didn't have pine nuts and the smoked salmon somehow turned into grilled salmon.  By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.  Rather than attempt to fix the situation, the bartenders and servers all started to ignore us.  Finally the manager came over and I explained to him that what I had received in the Chop Salad wasn't anywhere close to what was described on the menu.  He literally asked me, "Oh, are you in the business?"  No, I just happen to be able to read, and I just happen to know what I'm eating.  He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.  Note to manager - smoked salmon, pine nuts, crab mac and cheese, and dark rum are not rare, exotic ingredients.  You run out of something, you go buy more.  Or you explain to customers that what they ordered isn't what they will get.  Apparently he didn't like hearing that there are some people that know the difference, and he started to treat us in a very condescending manner.  I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.  Clearly, YOU are the douchebag.  If you don't know how to run a restaurant, don't become a restaurant manager.  Simple.Oh, lest I forget.  We had actually ordered 2 chop salads after being told that they counted under the 2-for-1 entrees grand opening special.  When we got the check, we had to have the bartender remove one of the salads as we were charged for both.  Almost got us, Regions.  Almost got us.Since my group was in a small rush to get to the La Bocca Yelp event, the manager - Keith? Kyle? Kevin? - offered to buy us a round if we came back later.  Not ones to ever refuse free alcohol, we did return later in the night after the yelp event.  And we brought lots of friends - our group of 5 turned into 11, all ready and willing to give Regions our business.  Lo and behold, the manager didn't comp us a round of drinks, even though we made it clear that's why we had returned and we were wiling to stay there if shown some love.  All he had to do was take the 5 kamikaze shots off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night.  Guess not.  Well done.  Love the honesty.In conclusion:  food sucks, service sucks, management SUCKS.  But it benefits from a great location, so I'll probably wind up giving it another chance when in Tempe/Mill Ave.
The Bakery Cafe=Bomb ass lemon danish. What makes something so ordinary sounding SOOO good you ask?? The strong flavor of lemon, the fresh bursting blueberries, the flaketastic crispy buttery danish pastry. Having made puff pastry croissants a week ago, I know how hard it is to get just the right consistency on your pastry. I took one bite of this thing on a hot afternoon, intending to split it with my better half. NO SUCH LUCK for him. It was gone in 60 seconds, down the hatch...as I wore a finger lickin' good smile.My mission is now clear. Perfect that puff pastry dough and make a little army of these fruity lovelies to pepper all over my belly and thighs. Heaven.Oh yeah, they serve breakfast here too, as in egg and cheese croissants, and you can charge it to your room since the hotel owns this cute little shop. Bonus.
The Outsider=Absolutely lovely. The CHL (Chunky Healthy Lines) are where its at. The name (at first) threw me a bit. Chunky and Healthy? In a line? I do not understand. But with a bit of explanation I came to learn these were juicy, tender skewers of multiple varieties (I had the monkfish), accompanied by lovely sides (think sweet potato, pita with cabbage slaw, etc). Delightful, filling and...indeed, healthy! Sides: roasted kale (with a kick, whew!) and the walnut apple salad (really nice). The foggy mist created a "ghost castle" effect -- very beautiful view from the back of the restaurant's windows. The lighting and ambience are subtle, yet...perfect. Candlelit, clean rustic feel that is both contemporary and classic feeling at once. Comfortable. The din never too loud, but always cheerful. Tables turned all evening. The staff is gorgeous and competent. Dessert: a fresh plum tart with spicy ginger ice cream. Heavenly Not a missed step all evening, perhaps they could've upsold me another glass of Forge Mill rose (light and frivolous was the description -- indeed!) had they asked --- but this only allowed me to save room for an espresso martini, which propelled me through the rest of the evening, night and into the morning...as it turns out! Will surely return when in the area -- a real treat.
El Patio Mexico=Walking into an empty restaurant is always disconcerting.  But I figured it was a weekday evening and the area was a bit dead beyond people at the nearby laundry mat.Immediately upon seating, our friendly waiter got our beverage orders.  He returned also with chips and salsa.  We soon devoured it all and he asked if we wanted more, which we gladly accepted.  For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Fajitas ($12.50), which is served with rice, beans, and tortillas (corn or flour).  I was quite surprised with how generous they were with the shrimp.  There was plenty and I definitely had leftovers.The Husband ordered the Steak & Enchilada (your choice of what kind), and it also came with rice, beans, and tortillas.  He was also surprised with how tasty the steak was, they used a good marination.  The real surprise winner was the refried beans.  The Husband was loving their version.  It was good too, but I guess I'm a fan of refried beans in general (especially with a little cheese swirled in there).We also caught up on music videos while we had dinner.  (You don't get to see music videos anymore!)Overall, pretty good Mexican food without breaking the budget.  And of course, it helps when there's a coupon in the Entertainment Book.  (They also have other coupons available since they mention that there will be a 20%(?) tip added to the bill before any coupon is applied.  We didn't mind actually because the waiter was very attentive.)3.5 starsSidenote: They also have a menu for their cakes by the sheet, so maybe they get a lot of business that way too.(Pics posted!)
Tuvalu Coffehouse & Gallery=Wow, reading the other reviews here, I can't understand how I had such a horrible experience at Tuvalu. It almost makes me want to give them another shot. Almost, because the place was so obviously mismanaged resulting is such abysmal value and customer service that I can't imagine ever leaving another dollar there. We were really expecting a decent lunch after reading reviews, checking out the menu online, and walking in to see such a nice, welcoming space. It was about 1:30 on a beautiful sunday afternoon. It seemed like everything was in our favor. Right until we started ordering. The first thing I tried to order they couldn't make because they'd run out of tabouleh. Okay, places run out of things, no sweat. While I was re-deciding, I heard the clerk tell another customer they were out of tuna. I settled on the Tuvalu salad, at which point the clerk yelled over her shoulder, "Hey, do we have enough greens to make a salad?" After considering a head of leaf lettuce in a grocery store bag, they decided that yes, they could make me a salad.  We also ordered iced tea, which they were out of, and told us it would be 10 minutes for them to make more. We decided that would be fine. We felt bad for them. So, we took our seats at a table, perused the gift shop area, which seemed to have nice things, and waited. And waited, and waited. There seemed to be an insane amount of activity going on in the kitchen area considering that there were about 5 people in the whole place and zero food coming out. Eventually our drinks came. About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our sandwich and salad, which were quite frankly pathetic. First, I could have prepared these things in about 90 seconds in my home kitchen. The salad wasn't even tossed! It was, for $8, a small plate of green leaf lettuce (not what I think of when I read "organic greens" on a menu), 4 giant unpeeled cucumber slices, a few slices of feta, and a pile of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. On the side was a plastic cup of some kind of creamy dressing from a bottle that was certainly not the advertised balsamic vinegarette. My husband's sandwich was basically as advertised, besides missing the tomato that was supposed to be on it. Maybe they were out of tomatoes too and didn't feel like admitting that THEY JUST WEREN'T PREPARED TO MAKE FOOD THAT DAY. It came with a pile of lettuce similar to mine with the same silly dressing. We grimly ate and got out of there as fast as we could. What a waste. Whoever runs this place clearly has no idea what they're doing. They were out of everything and it took so long to prepare our food that there can't have been any prep work done ahead of time. I hate to see  small business fail, but I just can't see clear to tell anyone to spend money here. $25 for essentially a side salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, and 2 iced teas. Ugh.Great vibe and atmosphere, locally owned/operated, uses fair trade and (in most cases) organic ingredients - all wins.However... as Julia noted, the service has dropped quite a bit as of late.  I was in this morning to purchase a single cup of coffee to go.  The person behind the counter didn't acknowledge my entry (there were 2 people in the place), and I honestly waited more than 10 minutes for her to complete everything else she was doing before she asked what she could get for me... 10 minutes may not seem like a long time, but when you swing-in while on your way to work, those ten minutes seem like an eternity.  Especially when it's for a $2 cup of to-go coffee... she could've rang-me-up and handed me a cup in a minute or less.  And, the cookies have gone downhill big time - hard and crispy rather than soft and chewy... ick.  Not sure if I'll be back - I can buy a whole pound of Just Coffee from Willy Street for $8, and if I have to wait 10 minutes for a single cup, I can spend that time brewing it at home just as easily...Sorry, Tuvalu - it's "toot-a-loo" for me.  Best wishes.
Cosmos Cafe=I had 8:30 PM reservations for New Years Eve and of course they required a credit card to secure the reservation. We arrived at 8:00 PM and were told that we had the next table. After 2 and 1/2 hours at 10:30 I was told that we may not get to eat. There were at least 50 other people left standing at the door that night. They acted as if they didn't care that they had ruined everyone's New Years Eve. It was pure greed that they simply over-booked so that they could be assured a full house. Never again!!!!
Pier 54=i had no idea this place existed! cute little place on a great patio over looking a lake. you feel like you've left AZ. their food is mediocre and it's nothing fancy. literally, their calamari is basically just fish sticks if that gives you any idea. we ordered chips and queso (decent), chicken strips w fries (delicious), quesadilla (good) and few other items. But the casual setting with the great view makes it a super nice spot to come for lunch and hang out for a bit. they also had a great bar area so even if you don't want to eat, this is a great drinking spoti would totally go back!
Cafe Paris French Bistro & Catering=This place is both adorable AND affordable... I can't (and I won't) believe it's actually located in Scottsdale. Cookies for $0.40. Fresh salad topped with a giant salmon fillet for $7.40. Paninis galore for $7.80. I know, this all sounds far too reasonable to be true, but it's the real deal. The Gardener (aka ratatouille panini) was a major hit amongst everyone, and it's meat and dairy-free! Health and French food in the same place? This place just gets more and more unbelievable. Between the atmosphere, pricing, and food, Cafe Paris seems like it's in a location far from, "somewhere near where I take my car in for maintenance." Cheaper than France, more authentic than Scottsdale, and tastier than anything else I can get for less than eight bucks.J'adore ce petit café!I've come to Cafe Paris a multitude of times now, and I've come to the realization that it's hard to say no to this place. The space in comfy, the service is friendly, the prices are nominal, and the food is always great.My favorite thing on their menu is their French onion soup! It's delicious, and definitely some of the best I've had in the valley. You won't find a brown water recipe here...they make it from scratch! It's served with a clear broth that's loaded with soft onions. Traditionally topped with toasted bread and melted cheese, it's a winner in the flavor department.. And by the way, I've ordered it roughly a dozen times by now, and it has always been consistently scrumptious!Other great menu items (in no particular order) include any panini, the Eiffel Tower, croque-madame, and butter cookies. The paninis all come with a tasty pesto sauce that should please any pesto fan, while the Eiffel Tower is one ginormous club sandwich that will satiate the biggest of appetites. As for the croque-madame, just imagine one of the best grilled cheeses ever, stuffed with ham, and topped with an egg; it's awesome.I make it a point to go to Cafe Paris several times a month because I know I can get a good meal for fairly cheap. That said, keeping this place all to myself sounds wonderful, but it's time to let the cat out of the bag on this somewhat hidden gem. Bon Appétit!09/05/12Was hoping to make it in for breakfast, but was too late.  The only breakfast items left were almondine shells and a couple of strawberry fruit tarts.  I opted to try a cappuccino and an almond shell, while I waited for my Chef panino ($7.80 for a full order, with side salad) to arrive.  I believe the shells went for 50 or 75 cents each.  It was a very nice way to begin (or end!) a meal.  The panino was very delightful!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the pressed ciabatta, and the combination of thick-cut ham, brie, caramelized onions, and pesto made my mouth (and brain!) very happy!  Eating half of the leftovers a few hours later proved to be almost as good, even without reheating the sandwich in the toaster oven, and I polished the rest of the panino for breakfast the next day.  I recall that the salad dressing (on the side) was nothing to write home about, but I appreciated the added greens to round out the meal.I docked a star for the cafe's mediocre decor.  I didn't feel like I was in a French cafe.  I can't even recall if the music playing was French.  Additionally, the only other people there, besides the server (also owner?) and cook, was a table of elderly women playing an actual game of mahjong- a Chinese tile game (with many variations possible) played on a table with three or four people, not the computer memory game.  (I wonder- in France, do French people play mahjong in American restaurants?)  Was tickled to see that my receipt tray had the Mona Lisa on it- cute!  Another star docked for having weak coffee.  Yes, great coffee service deserves a full star in my book...  The cappuccino was the worst I'd ever shelled $4 for, and no wonder-- the drip coffee I replaced the caloric cup with tasted almost like water.  I've wanted to come back a few times since, to try breakfast here, but if I can't look forward to a great cup of cafe avec un bon petit dejeuner, then why even bother?  Perhaps it was an off-day for coffee?  I will visit again very soon and see if breakfast is just as fun!
Clockwork Pizza=It's definitely not our favorite, but Clockwork sure beats those nasty chains (think Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars) when we're thinking, "Yeah, it's pizza and wine night!" And for about the same price! Discovered this place when we moved to Chandler last year. Someone stuffed coupons in our door.Haven't tried delivery, but it's close enough to our house to drive down the street and pick up. Everyone we've encountered in the store has been incredibly friendly. Love the Greek Gyro Pizza. Plenty of Gyro meat and fresh vegetables for toppings.   It even comes with a side of tzatziki sauce! The Godfather Clock Pizza is also good; just your classic combination pizza. Glad to have Clockwork nearby!
Salsitas=Okay, soI am not really sure if this is the same Salsitas I am accustomed to, But it is in Mesa so that is close enough. Salsitas is unassuming enough, if you were to pass it going along your way minding your own buisness you might not even realize what a gem this tasty little place is. I sure didnt.One day at lunch break my buddy Jose and I are out on the search for a good burrito, we'd been burned previously by a competing little Taquería, Senor Taco- now La Palapa, but i digress. So wondering where to go for our measly 30 minute break, and running short on time I was getting desperate. Then Jose opines, "oh man they have a salsitas here!"So I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot.We climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint.Straight up authentico feel to the place, not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away, there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer, from Carnitas to Pastor, I was in hog heaven. We order two burritos de pastor, I get mine w/ guac, pico, and refriend pintos free of charge. As we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket, and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really, probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish, pickled carrot, shredded cabbage, lime, salsa verde, and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro.By the time we're done w/ the salsa bar, our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work. As I'm typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat, my stomach is full, and my eyelids heavy. Although the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied. For under $5 you can grab a monster of a meal, that frankly isnt nearly as greasy or fatty as say Filly B's or that shit hole taco bell.I love salsitas and will continue to make my weekly pilgrimage.
Indian Curry Bowl=I had to try this place after hearing so many good things about it and it certainly did not disappoint! I'm not really an Indian foodie but here goes:The Chicken Korma with rice was absolutely amazing. The creaminess of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sauce made for a perfect combination of flavors! The garlic naan was light, fresh and equally flavorful. Warning: If you get this takeout, your car will smell like garlic for days! The curry chicken bowl lunch special (extra spicy) was tasty and full of spices. It was the perfect portion for lunch! I have only ordered take out on the 2 visits I have made. The place seems to be really slow, so I hope it picks up soon! I know I will be going back soon! I've heard that the samosas are the best!
La Parrilla Suiza=I was in the area and craving some Mexican food since it's getting cooler outside. I will admit I went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ...........but you know what......I wasn't!!! It was very clean, friendly and attentive staff, a window opened to the kitchen area to see the cooks in action. I was served chips with a salsa trio, there was chunky pico de gallo, smooth red and the tomatillo green. (see pics) All tasted OK, none were very spicy at all but that was fine with me. My favorite was the green, although I added some salt and lemon juice to it to make more flavorful it still was a great fresh sauce, I could have eaten it with a spoon!I ordered from the lunch menu, where all items were $6.99. I chose the chicken melt it was a grilled tortilla topped with melted cheese ,grilled chicken, tomato and avocado, served with rice and beans (see pics) Wow! A perfect light lunch that I didn't feel guilty eating, it was so good! I have to give 4 stars based on my experience today, I will go back and hopefully thing will be as good next time too.3.5 stars.After we went to the movies it was dinner time so we went across the street to La Parilla Suiza.  We were greeted and seated and then about 10 mins went by before our server came to take a drink order.  Chips and salsa had been placed on the table but no water or drink orders taken.  Our server did not seem all that enthusiastic.  She seemed as though she was just going through the motions.  I told her it was our fist time there so she pointed out some house specialties and then went to get out drinks.  I saw they had chilequiles on the menu and I love them and not many places serve them.  When I placed my order our server seemed a bit suprised I didn't order one of the higher priced specialties.  Our food arrived and it was hot and the chilequiles were good.  We were never offered more chips and only checked on once during the meal.  The food was fine but the service was lacking, in my opinion.  If I was in the area again I would go back and give them another chance.  Everyone is entitled to a bad day.
Botero=Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.Thumbs Up:-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.Thumbs Down:-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.I am STILL kicking myself for not getting the rib eye!!  My wife and I went w/ a good friend.  My wife got the filet as usual, I opted for the bone in filet which was surprisingly different tasting than hers.  My buddy got the bone in ribeye which tasted so good despite being cooked medium which says a lot!!Appetizers:  mushroom pastry and the buffalo mozzarella w/ sundried tomatoes.  Both were excellent and very flavorful.  I can still taste those tomatoes.Sides:  We all thought the sides were pretty damn creative here.  The creamed spinach w/ a deep fried, breaded poached egg in the middle is pure genius!!  Watch out for yolk splatter when the server breaks it :P  French onion potato gratin was really good too!  I thought the mac and cheese was just ok..a little too watery for me but still good.Dessert: Can't turn down chocolate souffle and we got the peanut butter and chocolate donuts with it which were tremendous.  I didn't think the donuts at Fix could be topped but they were.  I'll bump this up to 5 stars when I go back and have the rib eye.The other reviewer said he was still kicking himself for not getting the rib eye. Well, if he's still kicking himself, then I'm punching myself in the face for not getting the filet. I got the whole fish stuffed with artichokes and onions done up with the crispy skin. It was good but it didn't blow my mind. Now that filet mignon that my other half ordered, I practically had to punch him to get another bite, it was that good. Here's what we ordered:Crudo appetizer 2 starsAhi Tartare          4 stars Lobster Ravioli   5 stars Lychee Martini   whoa nelly. It was delicious.Mojito Martini      BOO. Tasted like Sour juice.Botero is beautiful, reminds me of the Delano in South Beach. It was good but it didn't leave me wanting to return  any time soon.  I expected much more in their service department. We had reservations at 8:30 but we weren't seated till after 9. We never saw our server between taking our order and dropping the check. Also,  you think they'd get the positions right when placing the entrees. And lastly it would be nice if they'd tell you what the different appetizers or entrees are with a little explanation. Most finer restaurants do this. Botero definitely failed on this level. 4 stars even with the minor hiccups. They were able to get us done in time for our reservations at XS.The logo could use some work, but the interior is quite cool. Chairs are super comfy and the open layout allows you to survey the whole place. My steak was excellent (took a respite from my mostly veggie ways) and everyone in our group was similarly pleased with their meal. Service was great too. It's a bit hushed inside, so probably not the best if you've got a really rowdy group, but we were on good behavior ;).5 stars for service and 3 stars for food. I was here last night with about 20 other girls in our group for a promotional dinner thing that they called a Princess Party for Very Important Princesses. Lol. It was really cute because we all had tiaras waiting for us as we sat at our table. I was just there for the food because the whole princess thing is so not me, but I thought it was fun nonetheless.The promotional dinner included a whole list of appetizers and a huge fish bowl of this delicious drink for all ten of us to share. It wasn't a very potent drink but it was really good. I have to find out what they put in it and try to make my own version at home.The appetizers we tried included some sushi rolls, meatball and Kobe sliders, salad, fries and a few other things. The food was not bad, it was just okay. My favorite were the Kobe sliders, cooked perfectly with a pink center topped with cheese and caramelized onion on a sweet roll.The service was excellent, they did a great job of making us ladies feel special and we all received a rose at the end of our dinner. It was kind of like one big bachelorette party. The whole restaurant was filled with ladies all decked out in their clubbing attire. I guess they do this on Wednesday nights and they take the girls to Surrender nightclub for some after dinner drinking and dancing. I'm not sure how they make money from these things but hey, I get to enjoy it so I don't think about it too much. Maybe its because of the fact that guys will show up anywhere theres a lot of hot young women.All in all, everybody had a wonderful time. The restaurant is very beautiful and elegant with a lot of Botero's artwork throughout. To be honest with you, I didn't know anything about the namesake of the restaurant until I Yelped about it. Turns out I took a picture in front of a Botero piece once before, at the FS Hotel in Miami. I thought the sculpture in the middle of this restaurant looked familiar. Sculptures of plump, nekked women is definitely a Botero thing.This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!Lately I've been choosing Botero when I get to Vegas. However before coming to Vegas I usually have a list of places I want to conquer but somehow....I end up here and what's great about  Botero is that it does not disappoint and I don't regret not going to the other places!! Botero is located in the Wynn, in between Wynn and Encore. Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by the hosts and their bar. The bar itself is small with a traditional bar setting and a few tables with oversized chairs to sit in while sipping your favorite drink before they call to seat you. The restaurant is set to a sexy low dim light level with the help of a fountain in the middle. You can see the nightclub Surrender from almost every angle when sitting down. I am always greeted promptly and served with their selection of amazing breads. On the last few occasions that I've gone, their selection of bread were always different. It is served with a lemon infused ricotta cheese spread and it is flavorful. I don't think I ever want butter on my bread ever again. It is light with a hint of lemon taste to it. For starters, we've ordered the crudo tasting and although small, it is one of my favorite. You get to sample a little bit of everything. The fish are sliced perfectly. Delicate yet still deliver big on flavor. It is fresh and melt in your mouth. The selection of fish on the plate are easy on the palate for a starter. On one other occasion, the special of the night was a tomahawk steak. Not only was this beefy awesome to goodness amazing but it was huge. All of our mouth dropped open when we saw the size of it. Two guys gobbled down on it and there was still meat left. The tomahawk was the highlight of their meal. It was cooked to perfection. Perfectly pink in the center and tender. The flavor of the meat was marinated perfectly. No condiments were required. On my most recent trip, I ordered the brioche crusted salmon. I thought it was weird at first but after the first bite, I was sold. The buttery flavor from the brioche crust on the salmon played very well into the flavor of the salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I ate it happily and finished it without stopping. Feeling already bad....we ordered the truffle Mac and cheese to add more onto our mouth. Yes, it is creamy, cheesy, dense, and rich. You get a good taste of the cheese and then the truffle plays in the background without overwhelming anything else. I can honestly sit and eat the entire Mac and cheese. The desserts here fills me with delight!! There is something about simple desserts that satisfy the soul after having a fulfilling meal. The selections are seasonal and I always feel like it compliments the entire experience. Some desserts are very rich (dark chocolate) and some are light (seasonal sorbets). The service is pretty attentive and the waiters and waitress ensure that our fluids are topped off and clean plates are always there.There was only a single time when service lacked attention and the food took longer than their usual wait time but other than that one misfortune, service and quality of our meals have been great.
Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant=Today was Father's Day & my Mom's Birthday, so we decided to grab some lunch here.  Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.This place never disappoints!Happy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!¿Voy a volver? ¡Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)The Details:-Sunday Brunch 10:00am - 3:00pm-Bottomless flavored margaritas and mimosas-Mimosas use fruit puree, not syrups-AYCE brunch buffet; items seem to mostly stay the same week to week-Fresh tortillas!-Accommodates large parties-No auto gratuityThe food is decent, but you get fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole!  The margaritas may been a bit weaker than you're used to, but they're bottomless!  Service has been great, as the groups I've been with have been known to stay for three hours or longer, and the staff never gives us a hard time.  It's a fun little place to start your Sunday mornings with a little alcohol.
Jacky Chan=I'm always amazed at how MEAN people can be on yelp.  They took no exception to this little place that is obviously a family owned establishment and the members are very hard working:  The place is immaculately clean and with a very attentive staff.  Reviewers should take notice that you are talking about REAL PEOPLE when reviewing a small place.  It is not some huge emotionless corporation.  Have some decency.I've only been once, and had the Pad Thai.  I enjoyed it very much. It was served with a slice of lemon (YES!) which I squeezed over the dish and it brought out beautifully subtle and well balanced flavors.The bottom line is this: Is this place going to revolutionize the way you view Asian Cuisine?  No.  But is that what they are trying to do?  NOPE.  They want to provide a decent meal at a reasonable price and try to make a living along the way.  For those of you that want to support Ma and Pa restaurants in the community and have a GOOD meal,  this is the place for you.  You might even introduce yourself and possibly make friends with the owners.  Can you do that at Panda Express?I will definitely go back for as long as I live in the neighborhood.I was craving some Tom Kha (with chicken) the other day cause I wasn't feeling good and thought soup would make me feel better so I decided to give this place a try and order for delivery since its so close to my house. The lady that I talked to didn't speak any good English at all, I had to tell her my address so many times and i told her what I ordered I made it so clearly. Anyways, the delivery was really fast but when I started to check my food and was about to take a big ass sip on my soup I see a freakin shrimp umm I'm allergic to shrimp like I almost ate that thing! I called them back and this time it was a guy and I told him that they messed up my order and he wasn't really nice about it and I told him to get it right and send me the right one. After 45 minutes later of waiting he finally came and got the order right but I felt very skeptic to even eat my soup cause they seem very shady but I ate it anyway and now I'm sick. Thanks a lot for the bad service,workers there cant even speak english, your food sucks and won't be ordering at this shady place ever again!***Highlights***: CHEAP EATS UNDER $10, DELIVERY, Clean, Leave the makeup at home: your never going to run into anyone.Negatives: Not Authentic Chinese, Plastic Plates & Cups, Small, Not somewhere you take a date (Somewhere you take your spouse after you have lived together forever and have seen them burp at the dinner table).This is my late night: Go-to, I'm too lazy to leave the house, I'm broke, or I just need variety, go-to place. The food is obviously not authentic Chinese food, but they offer a lot of variety in a single plate and they deliver. If your sick, this a great way to get a big container of some basic won ton soup for about $6.00 delivered to your home. The minimum is $10 for delivery. So when I'm sick I just forget the money, buy 2 containers of soup. One for now, one for later, and call it a day. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this establishment. This is what you expect for hole in the wall, under $10 meal.Price/Food: Under $10. Their lunch special is around $6, dinner special is $9.50. Each comes with sweet sour chicken, one choice of entree, crab ragoon, fried rice, and choice of soup. Add a Boba drink for $3.50! There are 24 different flavors, on ice or blended as a slushy. Lots of food for the price, it takes me about 2 sittings to finish. Because there is so much variety, I don't get sick of it by the second day. I always have left overs. Enough food for a guy though. This is as healthy as Chinese food is going to get. Yes, the food is smothered in sauces like panda express, but its not as greasy. They use lean white chicken breasts for all their chicken dishes and they cook with crisp fresh vegetables. When I'm hunting for delivery yet attempting to be healthy, I order Shrimp & Snow peas off the regular menu. Not as much variety as the Lunch/Dinner Special. But its the same price, clean, simple, plain, Low-carb, Less-sodium.Service/Ambiance: Small hole in the wall eatery, about 6 tables that each seat 4, so service and food are quick. Get in- Get out. I've never had to wait in line. One of the major reasons I keep coming back is that they are so clean. There is definitely nothing fancy about this place, but you can see that the kitchen and seating area is clean. They are always wiping their counters, tables, chairs. Wet towel, dry towel. I've NEVER sat at a wet table or chair. No drips on their soy sauce ramekins. I've seen there employees wash their hands multiple times. They get a extra star from me just for that. I'm all about hole in the wall places that are clean.
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=oh well we had waited several months before trying this place. An early dinner yesterday at about 4:30 pm. Not busy so we were seated straight away. A booth, yuck I hate booths. This one was hot for some reason so we moved to a table with two chairs, I guess a half booth. It was much cooler. I guy I forget his name was the server and he said at least three times I am going to take care of you real good and or well. Well the first thing we order is our drink, me water Gus iced tea. Well the guy waiter took only a few moments to get this to us, but of course placed the drinks opposite to who ordered. One appetizer, that being calamari. MY meal was the Tour of Italy Being Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo. Gus ordered Pork Milanese Pan-seared pork scaloppini crusted with Italian herb breadcrumbs, served with asiago cheese-filled tortelloni pasta tossed in a garlic-butter sauce with fresh spinach. We had the salad too. So we get the salad, but the waiter wants to give a one soup and one salad. The salad was not really great. Appetizer is set down and about three minutes later the entrees. First off learn to pace the meal dude and try to remember who ordered what. Not once did he get it right even though he claimed it would be good service. I won't go in to each meal other than to say it sucked. Oh well another 53 bucks down the drain.
Cornish Pasty Company=yes, it is 5 star blow your knickers off good. In fact, read Brian S.'s review because he lays it all out as to why this is such a heavenly spot. All I will add - lamb and mint pasty with a kroenenberg beer...Tuck in!After a long hike, my group of 6 was starving and I decided that we should check out the Cornish Pasty Co, in Mesa. We ordered a variety of pasties: the Royale w/ cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben.Now, you may wonder...what the HELL is a pasty? First of all, it's pronounced 'pass-tee', which is a meat pie. Not to be mistaken for 'pace-tee', used to describes a person's pale complexion or those nipplage stickers burlesques dancers use. It's the British version of a Spanish empanada. And, IT IS HUGE!! I like huge....food... ;o)I ended up ordering the Shepherd's Pie. The flaky shell crust hides the meat and potatoes, on the inside.  The meat was well seasoned, super yummy and blended well, with the mashed potatoes. I was craving for more, after my first bite. Actually, it was so good, I can still imagine the taste of the pasty, in my mouth. Hello, drool!A single pasty will cost you about $8. It's enough to fill up a single adult. We didn't get sides, this time around.  But, we will next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!The church pews are a nice touch.  The service super friendly and helpful.  I got no complaints and I will come here, again. Oh, why don't we have one like this in San Diego?!? Why? Why? WHY?!?Until the next time Cornish Pasty Company..... *le sigh*Been meaning to try Cornish Pasty Company for I don't even know how long. Just hadn't gotten to it.Today we got to the Mesa location and it was killer. Started off great just walking through the door. The decor is killer. They have done some neat things with the bar (tiling, industrial purse hooks - the Mrs. loves those so they stood out to me). The church pews for seating and the glassed over doors for tables are super cool. The melted candle bottles on the table and the black & white photos also help to give it a nice vibe.Next looked at the menu and they have a great beer selection (mix of on tap & bottles). I did get a bit overwhelmed with the number of pasty choices (which is good). They also have quite a large number of vegetarian pasties which is nice - for the rest of the family. : )Whittled it down to the chicken tikka, shepherd's pie and royale with cheese. The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that. The pasty itself was excellent. Great flavor, little bit of heat, great pastry. As the Mrs. is from Australia, we're big into pastry and things like pasties, meat pies, sausage rolls, etc. I definitely need to get her here soon!The service was great as well. Everybody was super nice and quite efficient. Food and drink came quickly. All in all, a great experience. Quite happy with the entire meal.With so many pasty choices, I think it's trouble once you break the seal. I foresee many, many visits in our future.Okay I went here on recommendation from some Yelpers and I have to admit a personal flaw...I add letters into words and flip things around when I'm reading sometimes, so this whole time I'm thinking Cornish Pasty is a Pastry (notice the 'r') joint...I know, I know, "didn't I read the reviews??" Yes, of course I read the reviews; but I'm like the ship Titanic...once I get an idea in my head it's really hard to 'turn the ship around' as it were...Once I got over the initial shock that this was, in fact not a pastry place, but a pasty place; I was pleasantly surprised! This place is great! Our server was friendly, talkative and attentive. The music was a little loud, but for the setting, I think it was at an appropriate level.I got the Philly Steak pasty and savored the flavors of the meat and man, that pasty crust was dang good too!! Yummy! Even though I had some personal problems in the beginning, it turned out to be a FABULOUS experience and I would recommend it to other Yelpers looking for some good eats.A bit of a "nip" in the air this morning...and when I think "nip", I think "pasties" and when I think "pasties", well, I just naturally think "pasty's" :-)So there you have it...that's how my mind works...I've said it before and I will say it again...linear thinking is the best thinking:)I get so lonely working away in my plush private office with nothing to keep me company but a steady stream of information and diversions from across the universe...and my chowchow, DeeDee...sometimes I need to get out of my gilded cage:)Today was one of those days, and fortunately for me, my cardiologist buddy, Jim, was in a position to prescribe a bangers and mash pasty at CPC, for my continued good heart health :-)Stat - (Latin for "with a side of broccoli and cauliflower"...he says they are chock full of "beta blocker's"...I didn't even know I needed my beta blocked!)We met for lunch with his longtime friend (and my new friend) Gary (who is, among other things, a novelist...I want to see how he works me and CPC into a book:)I was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at CPC wasted no time in getting the retox going for me...I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent!Neither Jim or Gary had ever been to CPC before, but they both handled their pasty's like pro's and the three of us all joined the CPC - "CPC" ("Clean Plate Club"...I think there's an award ceremony at the end of the year:)Jim had an Oggie and Gary tried a Greek Something Pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of Friday afternoon (Jim had some sort of "human heart thingy" he had to do, and I had to come back to my office and type on my computer...who has the more stressful job...really? :-).Finally, the people at CPC all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant...I so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there (and probably do) that it's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their  faces and in their voices.It's probably from eating all those pasty's...they're approved by all of my cardiologist buddies, so you know they must be good for you:)hmmmm. idk. is it a gourmet hot pocket? i had the bangers and mash. i probably would have liked it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style. the gravy was great. there wasn't a lot of sausage and i love the grilled onionswe also split the pb&j and that was alright. i liked the rasberry jam. but idk, the whole wrapping everything in a dough sorta turned me off. not sure if i will go back.A big ole' double handful of bangers and mash with red wine gravy!  That's what was in my pasty!  First time here and I can't wait to go back!  Man was that good!I am looking forward to working my way through the menu at this place.  I met fellow Yelper Donald S here for lunch and we sat at the bar where we could watch the kitchen.  As I watched the busy bees busily going about making pasties and other delicious looking things I noticed the ingredients sitting around on shelves...nothing prefab.  No bags from Sysco or some other purveyor of pre-made restaurant ingredients.  Nope, just fresh veggies, fresh meats, lots of big cans and bottles of spices and seasonings.  I am getting hungry right now thinking about the food.  Yum.Update (I've been there again since I started my review):Now that I have gone a second time and tried a salmon pasty, the royale pasty (sort of like a bacon cheeseburger) and shared a dessert I can unequivocally state that Cornish Pasty is one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix.Service has been great and my last visit I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the folks as they were cooking.  Nice people here!I love this place! I've been to the other location, but not to this one since it opened.  I finally came for dinner, and am glad that I did.  Serice was great, friendly as always.  I had the Shepards Pie Pasty and it was delicious!  Very filling, and its a nice sized portion, so you walk away full.I will be back, and always enjoy eating here!And now for my 300th review...........What is a pasty?  It's a lovely piece of pastry filled with yummy stuff.  You can fill a pasty with almost everything.  Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, meat and cheese or something akin to a Chicken Pot Pie.  It's all delicious!  Sounds like a Hot Pocket you say?  Oh no, no, no, this is much more and infinetly better than an item you find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.  A pasty is fresh, not frozen, and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket.  This location is bigger than the Tempe location.  There are several longer tables in the front, several tables on a patio outside, as well as tables along the corridor and, if you choose, there is the bar where you can watch them prepare your food.  The servers are friendly and knowledgable.  It is a causual atmosphere.  I have been here many times and always had great service.  The have many beers on tap but sadly, nothing local.  I would bump it up one more star if they added a couple of local brews.  And they know how to pour a pint of Guiness!  It's a great spot to hang out and have a pint or two and when you get hungry take a look at the 3 page menu.  You will have a hard time choosing so you'll have to come back again and again.....If you like the English Pub feel, this is the place for you.  This would be my "local" if I lived closer but it is close enough to lure me here frequently. And if you've had a long day and would like some take out, you can do that too.  They will do a half bake on a pasty for you then you take it home and bake it for about 20 minutes and viola! dinner!   And even though I was just there yesterday, I am craving another!  Maybe it's because I'm part Welch and Irish.  Thank you Cornish Pasty Company!!From the bar, I watched my food being prepared by dudes who look like they're from Seattle. And then served by chicks who look like they're from Seattle. And now I'm enjoying my Cottage Pie Pasty amongst other diners who all look like they're from Seattle. Except the guy over there with no neck wearing the Affliction shirt which is two sizes too small, rocking the Bluetooth earpiece; he's clearly from the Jersey Shore. Or North Scottsdale.I've been to both Cornish Pasty locations, and I gotta say that they do a great job with the space(s) they occupy. This haunt in Mesa - like the one in Tempe - occupies a strip mall (as do 98.5% of the restaurants in the East Valley), but it sure doesn't feel like it once you're inside. And I dig that.As for the dough these things come in ... It's, like, equal parts flour, Jesus, and butter! From this point forward, I'm dedicating my life to reverse engineering these mofos and then opening a Cornish Pasty. In Seattle.Let's just say I'm a fan.Woke up on Saturday and decided I needed to try something new that I have never had before. So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had "British" food. I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best "chips" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!Cornish Pasty food & service:  5/5  The Romper Room Effect 0/5We had a late lunch around 1:30 on Easter Sunday and our server was great!  The receipt said his name was Johnny Cakes.  Somehow I doubt that's totally accurate, but hey....if it is, you go Johnny!  He was friendly and laid-back and took great care of us.  The pasties were great, as usual, and we also tried a side of their curry potatoes which were delicious!  If you like curry, these are cubed, perfectly roasted potatoes with a few roasted tomato bits as well.  They complimented the pasties and beer perfectly and I would definitely order them again.I know it was a Sunday.  I know it was Easter Sunday, but the amount of kids screaming and running around was appalling.   Take them to the park.  Take them home.  One inconsiderate mommy was wandering around carrying her beer, half-heartedly trying to corral Screamy and Sticky and if I heard her say one of the kid's names once, I heard her say it 400 times.  (Names changed to protect the inconsiderate).  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Ad nauseam.  He's obviously not listening, but hey, get your buzz on.  Who cares.  Several children were crying loudly and the ones that were running around were frequently in the way of the entrance and patrons coming and going.  Ridiculous.When I'm managing my own restaurant I will politely pack their food up to go and give them clearly printed directions to the two or three nearest parks.   Letting your kids run around like wild animals is rude and inconsiderate and it's dangerous.  These are the same asshats who will sue you when their sweaty, foaming at the mouth kid falls and hurts themselves.  Send them to the park.Who has been hiding this place from me. Right in my old old neighborhood. Down the street from my high school. Obviously this place wasn't here when I lived in this area way back in the day. Otherwise I would really have kicked myself.My girlfriend introduced me to this place and she is the best for bring me here. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere is great. A little dark but it works. The whole place is lit with real candles. They actually come around and replace them when they get low. Very cool.Great beer selection too. Some I have never even heard of but want to try. I didn't know what to get so the waitress got me a sample of a Scottish ale it was good so I got a pint. I want to come back and try the rest.We also got the oven baked chips with garlic and jalapeno. Chips = fries people come on get with it. They were awesome. Some of the best fries I have ever had. Although I will say the jalapenos didn't quite make sense. I like jalapenos don't get me wrong but they were just chopped up on top. When you picked up a fry they fell off. If you managed to get a few to stick they would come off when you dipped it in the sauce. You can bypass the sauce and just eat one but they didn't really add anything. If they were baked into to the chips that might be better. Still very good regardless.Now on to the Pasties. The reason you came here and the name of the place. I have never had a pasty before but from looking at the menu you can put pretty much anything you want inside of one. They have an Italian one, cheesesteak one, Greek one, a few Mexican flavored ones and so on and so on. You name it it was in a pasty. I finally decided on the spicy chicken asagio one with some advice from my girlfriend who has been here before. Sure it takes awhile for the food to come out but they are making it when you order it. By the time you sip on your drinks and munch on those fantastic chips your food comes out so it works out. So good. Flavor was perfect. Everything all crammed in there but all working together. The dipping sauces they give you with it work perfectly. They vary depending on which pasty you order. Don't be shy pick it up with your hand and munch away. No shame in it. That is really how you are supposed to eat them anyway.I can't wait to come back and try the other great pasties. I have to say I might be addicted. So good and such a great place.Oh my Gaaawwwd. Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner! This is a Mesa (or Tempe) "Must-Try"! My Dude and I have been here twice now. Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here. There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing. We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles. Another great touch to the great ambiance. The first time we went, we got a table up front. Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients. Also, be prepared to wait a while. Good food takes time! Just grab a beer and enjoy your company. Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties. Both were absolutely delicious! Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets. Which my Mexican thought was hilarious. Damn you, Dude. Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes. We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic. Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked. Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)! Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made. We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time. Again, both great. Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check. Downside to the Bar? You can come across groups of people telling you to "move over" so they can fit their group together. Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order. Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!For those who are not familiar with this british speciality, a cornish pasty is a sandwich baked into a pie-like crust.  It's a lot of like a hot pocket, except it's good.  And this restaurant serves up an amazing cornish pasty.  It also doesn't hurt that Cornish Pasty Company has an authentic british pub ambiance.I had the Oggie, which is a pretty traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes and onion.  Give it a minute before taking your first bite.  Trust me when I say it comes to the table piping hot.  For just $8.50, it's a pretty good little meal.  Need more?  There are some good sides and salads for about $2 to $5.  The beer selection (tap and draft) is awesome.  I did not partake in dessert, but what I saw at other tables looked amazing.When my son and his boyfriend caught wind that I went to Cornish Pasty without them, they insisted we go stat! So off we went!I wasn't really hungry, but at this point I was in the mood for dessert and had already been tipped off that Cornish Pasty had some great tasting desserts.Somehow I was persuaded into getting some garlic roasted fries, and I have to say, those fries were delsih! Glad the boys were there to share though, they made a perfect side to any pasty!I was thrilled to see they had Banoffee Pie, so I knew I had to order it! It had a crisp graham cracker crust, nice creamy caramel, whipped cream topped with fresh banana slices, this right here is comfort dessert! Keep it simple and sweet! LOVED IT, want more!So after my review from Easter Sunday over 2 years ago, we've gotten food from Cornish Pasty, but have not dined in.  For some reason, this place attracts an inordinate amount of jagoff parents and their out-of-control offspring.  I just don't want to deal with it, so we'd get the food to go.  In a way, it had two benefits.  It helped to preserve my sanity, and it saved us money because we'd bring the pasties home and drink our own booze.  But, then I got the idea one night after we both had taken a nap after work, to go out and hit this place at 8:00 p.m.  I thought, well, maybe all the sticky-fingered crumbsnatchers and their oblivious parents might be home by now.  That strategy has worked out very well.  In the past month we've been back a few times, all around 8:00 p.m. and the crowd has really thinned out and we haven't had to tolerate any maniac kids.  The only aftereffect to the dinner hour we've felt was one evening we had to wait for a booth to be cleaned because a large family with a bunch of kids had made a huge mess.  It looked like a couple of pasties exploded.  Who does that?  Seriously!  Animals.I've started trying their soups and I love the cream of leek soup with the fresh-baked bread.  I'm pretty sure they should call that bread "crackdough", it's just that good.We sit at the bar frequently, and Megan takes great care of us.  A pint of Rogue Hazelnut Brown and the Royale with cheese pasty and I am one happy girl.
Feast Buffet=This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their "Hawaiian" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. But the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon "the best pork" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.So we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.They have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.So yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all.
Rowdy BBQ=I adore this place. I've had  variety of sandwiches from them and they are always huge, delicious and reasonably priced. Their hot pepper cheese balls and Mac and cheese are also amazing. It is an outside place on the side of route 51 which I suppose is a small downfall but it doesn't keep me from giving it 5 stars. They have a few picnic tables you can sit at but otherwise it's more of a take out type place. You can also have them cater larger events which I've only experienced once but it was just as good as it is when I get a single sandwich. The food only takes them about 10 min to have ready for you as well or you can always call ahead and order too!I've had their chicken bacon ranch and buffalo chicken sandwiches and both are sooo good. I've also had their regular Philly cheesesteak and their chicken Philly cheesesteak and neither of those have disappointed either. Their pulled pork is equally amazing. The big pig sandwich is one of my absolute go to items on their menu, being that they are obviously a BBQ place as you can see from the name, you know their BBQ sandwiches have to be amazing. Go here asap! You're welcome in advance. :)
Moe's Southwest Grill=I went to Moe's in Market Square in Pittsburgh PA on Friday 2-21-2014 as part of a promotional dinner event called The Winter Warm Up. I understand that each place has a set menu for this, but I feel the way I was treated by the manager Robert, was just plain shitty. We paid $50 for tickets and there were 9 restaurants, so I assumed $5.50 worth of food at each. They had rice, bean, and chicken bowls for us. That were a little small. I asked if I could have one without chicken, as I am a vegetarian and have been for 15 years. I thought with Moe's "make it your way" attitude, that this would be no problem. I was given a flat "No" as an answer. So, then I ask if I can take the chicken out myself and then they can put the other toppings on. "No" I explain that I paid to come here and I do not eat meat and they ignore me, explaining that the bowls are "pre-made." So, I just take one anyways, and throw away the chicken and proceed out of the line. At this point, one of the younger staff comes over and asks if I am a vegetarian. When I say yes, he apologizes, and makes me one without chicken, Great!, right???? No, Asshole manager Robert comes over and reams the kid for making mine Veg saying that "We ain't got time for this shit!" Well, excuse me?!? First of all, is it really appropriate to 1. talk like this in front of customers, children, and elderly??? 2. talk like this to employees??? 3. be this much of a jerk in general??? Also, there was no one else in line, and everyone in the restaurant had already been served... So what exactly did they not have time for??? NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING ANYTHING!?! What a jerk. Seriously!
Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro=CASHIER: How was everything?COREY: Delicious.CASHIER: Looks like you're new to the area?COREY: (internally...) Really? CASHIER: I mean that's the Chicago skyline on your credit card.COREY: Oh right. Yeah, I'm from Chicago originally and I've been living in Tucson the past 6 years. I just made the move to Madison and I'm looking for an apartment. CASHIER: Oh yeah? Which area... this one is great.COREY: I've noticed, I'm actually looking around here. CASHIER: If you lived close you'd never be far away from Ha Long Bay.Truth. And I won't be. The spring roll sare enough to get me back, as are the mega lunch specials, all of them reasonably priced and served until 3. The staff is super friendly and they rhyme. Common.I'll happily wait (nearly) an indefinite amount of time for a table at a great restaurant. I'll tolerate poor service, to an extent. I realize people get busy, get distracted, and generally have bad days. I understand all of that, within reason. But let's paint the scene for Ha Long Bay tonight (and quite honestly, most other nights, albeit with slight variances)...8pm, slammed busy. Zero waiting space. Loud. Cramped. Hectic. People bumping into one another; servers bumping into people. Names are given with the hope of getting a table. Hostess could care less. Grumbles something about a wait. No drinks offered while waiting, although it's not like they have a vast selection or offer any room to imbibe while suffering through the wait.Table becomes ready, but don't get your hopes up... It'll be another 10+ minutes before a "server" shows up. Our server on this particular night was a bearded gentleman with a chip on his shoulder that was bigger and more full than his Duck Dynasty wannabe scraggly beard could ever hope to be. He literally slammed waters on the table and asked if we wanted anything else. I ordered a single hopalicious, while extending a smile and a sincere thank you. Nothing. Just a quick turn and departure.That would be ok if he were on a mission to fill the requested beer. But it was another 10 minutes before he returned. He had the beer, and then asked what we wanted for food. We ordered two appetizers, which he struggled with - the notion of getting the "pork AND shrimp spring roll" apparently too much to handle... He wrapped up the order with a, "so, just appetizers?" and an eye roll upon our confirmation.20 minutes later, we had our appetizers and more attitude when we requested a refill on the beer. We never saw said server again, save for a fling of the check at us. So... Crappy service, cramped interior, slow kitchen, and mediocre food... I will order takeout, but I'll be hard pressed to dine in again. It's just not worth the frustration.The squash curry at Ha Long Bay is delightful. Once you've had a taste of this red curry sauce, there's no turning back. It's been known to convert non-curry fans into true curry addicts. This is truly a feel-good dish that's packed with flavors that will warm the soul. The gentle medley of spices will have you hooked at first bite and will leave you craving that flavor like no other. Within the curry is a great blend of zucchini, Thai eggplant, bamboo, basil and, of course, squash. Ha Long Bay incorporates both acorn and butternut squash into this dish, and these components are the star of the show. They retain their lovely flavor while also absorbing a good amount of the spices from the curry, which makes for a hearty yet healthy meal. Addicts beware.Yup, this place does it for me.I was in Madison for just a day visiting the infamous Corey D, and we were absolutely starving for lunch. We stopped in with only about 45 minutes to spare, and Ha Long Bay ended up being a really excellent choice! Thai heaven happening here (as well as Vietnamese and Laotian.)First of all, the menu is huge. You're going to need a good few minutes to decide what you're going to order. For the sake of time (and because it's my absolute favorite), I quickly decided on the yellow curry lunch special with a cucumber salad on the side. While we were waiting, there was a pair next to us that got their food extra spicy... we were coughing all the way from our table! That's really the only negative thing I have to say here... it was so, so smoky in there and my hair even smelled like curry for a while after I left. They definitely need to do something to improve ventilation! Regardless, our lunch happily went on.My lunch was everything I wanted it to be -- the cucumber salad was excellent, and my yellow curry with chicken was perfectly spicy and full of flavor. I seriously didn't want to stop eating.We paid our bill (which was so cheap - $16 and change for two lunch specials) and were on our way. This place is so good, and I'll be stopping in during my next visit to Madison!
Sushi Kaya=I have been to Kaya three times within the past month.  And I can give them a solid 4.5 stars each and every time.First visit:* Steamed Pork Belly (Marinated and steamed Pork Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with leaves, thinly sliced radish, sliced jalapenos, sliced garlic, kimchee, etc.  Place it altogether with a slice of pork belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people!* Korean Seafood Pancake - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.* Spicy Sashimi - Generous portion, but perhaps a bit too much. * Something Wrong Roll - Whatever was in there, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.Our waitress was super helpful and we didn't know what else to order beyond the seafood pancake.  She made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with her suggestions.    Second visit: New addition to the menu is AYCE sushi for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri, rolls, and appetizers, we also had:* Bulgogi (steamed beef) - Generous for one, so go with one order first to see if it's something you like.* Skewers: bacon & shrimp, gingko, garlic, chicken gizzard, shrimp, beefCame for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a special dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks.  Our waiter, Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good time.Third visit: AYCE sushi again!* Steamed black mussel* Ahi poki* Fried jabchae* Spicy Korean ramen* Skewers: bacon & scallop, mushroomService was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free beer.  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our meal more. Their nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of fish and not a whole lot of rice.  That's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE menu is also what we enjoyed - especially the chicken gizzards, the garlic, bacon & scallop, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their steamed black mussels came with a creamy sauce that was good.  Soft shell crab appetizers are also available, including tempura.  Noodle dishes included are udon and ramen.  Rice dishes include fried rice, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls.Dessert is limited to vanilla, strawberry or green tea ice cream, limit one.For a relatively new restaurant, they are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two times we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  AYCE sushi with some Korean thrown in there?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave.They also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!(Pics posted!)HAIR IN MY SUSHI!So disgusting and my bf and I didn't even finish our AYCE. We still had so much food on the table, but we were so disgusted. In addition to that, I got baked green mussels, and there was shell cracks IN THE MUSSELS! None of the shells were even broken so I don't even know where they came from, but it definitely hurt my teeth when I ate them.I used to go here all the time, but not any more. Even though the servers recognized me, they still didn't discount my meal. $45 for two lunch AYCE (more like 2.5 rolls that we were able to order) and they couldn't even comp my drink. I paid it though + $0 tip.DON'T GO HERE! Believe me, I like supporting small restaurants and not corporate chains, but this place does not deserve your patronage!Pardon me, but I did come and eat here twice in a week :P Yes I enjoyed it that much to have an AYCE again and eat like a queen, king, the whole kingdom of Suki Land. I have to say this is my favorite AYCE restaurant from all the others in Las Vegas. It's simple, fresh quality nigiri, rice perfectly formed ( not overly packed ), and everything I ate was GOOD, not mediocre... Tasty and satisfying good!!! Parking could be a hassle on weekends and holidays. Be forewarned.. parking was full in this complex, so I parked in the Chinatown complex nearby Seafood Palace restaurant and minding my own business.. then slap right on my driver side window.. a warning note that my car will be towed next time I park in this area. Damn serious?! This lot is empty late at night, I'm doing this lonely lot a favor by parking here kiddin' me?!!??!! I guess the security guard saw me skipping happily away to Sushi Kaya and he got jelly.. I don't blame him.. I would be so jelly too, knowing I'll be chowing down some real good eats in a few minutes. Sushi Kaya is tucked in the corner right next to Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbecue restaurant. If you're not the type that reads signs and banners.. you might as well missed this place and gone to Anime Ramen. I lived here all my life and never even knew about this place until a few of my lovely coworkers decided to eat here after a crazy night at work. Fell in love that night with Kaya.. Sushi Kaya that is. Then came here again a few days after with my Family for my Brother's going away get together. The owner is extremely kind and welcoming. Took our names and in matter of minutes, we were seated and our server, Juno, that's another story was attentive, patient, and sound in service. Almost like he had sixth sense of when we wanted to order more, to taking finished plates, drinks refilled, to just anything we needed he came around every time to see how we were doing and if we would like to order more. Couldn't have asked for a better server, yet alone a very handsome one :D We didn't order any rolls, but only nigiri... Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Scallop, Uni, and Sweet Shrimp. All were fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Salmon... never had it like this before.. melts just melts so smoothly in my mouth. We ordered ten orders of Salmon and Tuna. The cuts from the Salmon was the best quality I ever tasted.. Both my parents mentioned about it too. Unfortunately, it was so good that I forgot to take pic of it. Once I saw the dish, I devoured it.. I mean my Family and I killed the nigiri. We were like synchronized machines.. one by one.. nonstop. Finishing everything... Clean. Raw oysters were fresh & ended with a reviving bite. I insisted that my brother's gf and my mother to eat it all, since I'm single.. know what I mean :P Eh anyways so much more food to enjoy, I just wanted everybody to eat a lot & be happy. Bacon/asparagus and bacon/scallop... do I need to say more.. flavor madness.. must try!!Shrimp and calamari tempura had such a light, crisp crunch. Not too oily or salty. The batter they make this in had to be fresh every time. I seriously enjoyed every bite! Cucumber, Seaweed, and Salmon Skin salad.. sum it up with one word.. Refreshing!!!My two favorites... Ginkgo nuts and sweet potato diced skewers. I'm not shy to order 20 each and cheerfully finished every single piece. I'm the killa of these two and don't tempt me to strike again, because I will! *chomp chomp chompWe ordered desserts consisting of: five orders of mini cheesecakes, mocha almond/green tea/red bean ice cream, and green tea/red bean mochi. In waiting.. I completely forgot I ordered  three orders of baked green mussels and the food runner goes.. ooooh are you done with dinner?!!? We all said Yeeeees. Then she goes oooh, but I have your last order of these mussels? Then my whole family looked at me haha I go... it's okay... no problem.. I'll still take it :P Done. It had a caramel finish in taste and cheese topping. Very yummy for my tummy. No problem...Desserts all came and I ended up finishing all the mini cheesecakes, since my family warned me they couldn't hang anymore.. what I say... No problem.. I'll eat them for you. My Brother keeps saying out loud.. Damn my sister can eat!! Damn right. Weak sauces... nah just kidding. We all did a great job in finishing all our dishes. From start to finish.. it was a great experience in dining here. Food and service were on point and never at any given moment was it a disappointment. Food came out promptly and never once were we just sitting there without anything to munch on. Always busy eating away!!! Ha! :P The price is so reasonable and exceptionally affordable compared to other AYCE places. Don't forget to ask for a punch card to redeem after 10 visits :) And best of all.. it's open late hours.. last call I believe is 2:30 in the mooorning, seven days a week. Even the interior design of this place is cozy, love the bird cage looking lamp!Visiting LV from LA, gf since HS and fellow Yelper took me to this quaint little establishment off the strip. It's not much from the outside, situated in a strip mall, as you walk in it's as if you walk into a little Japan. Inside is contemporary design, with cozy booths and tables. Friend and I had the AYCE sushi, of course. Service was spot on, the food just kept coming and coming for a good part of 2 1/2 hours. And was all so wonderful on the palette. I think we ate just about everything on the menu. I have been to several other AYCE sushi establishments and have accepted that "it is what it is"...limited menu items, limited time to eat, and green tea ice cream for dessert. UGH!!!! There was none of that at Sushi Kaya. The AYCE includes a plethora of menu choices; appetizers, soups, noodles, sashimi, of course a wide range of sushi, AND desserts. When I say desserts, I don't mean just green tea ice cream, I mean you've got options. That was really surprising to me and I was very happy to be able to order several different desserts. Thinking back, we weren't rushed out like so many restaurants typically do for the purposes of turnover. Sitting relaxing catching up over AYCE sushi, now that's a day well spent.When traveling I prefer to go where the locals go, and this is definitely a local place and I will definitely return the next time I'm in LV.Soo, this sushi place has been my go to for the last 7 years and have been here maybe 40 times. But after last night's visit I probably won't be coming as much anymore and mainly sticking to Goyemon. First, their parking has always been a pain but I would still come because it was worth it. Also service is a hit or miss, sometimes the server you get is awesome, and sometimes extremely slow.The last few times I've come their cuts and grade of sushi have been getting worse especially this last time. Super chunky weird cuts especially the super white tuna. Gross. The sauce they still put on it is still the same and still really good though. Now the special rolls. My absolute favorites have been the Cinderella, French Kiss, Mango Style, and Dancing Eel so when I ordered them again last night, all of them except the French Kiss was wrong. All of them were skimpy looking to start, looked like they shrunk half in size from last year. Dancing Eel had one baby piece of eel on ONE piece, the rest were covered with spicy tuna! No Eel on dancing eel roll really? Mango style had no avocado on top like it says on the menu and the inside was also wrong, all I saw was imitation crab. That's all. Cinderella had no kiwi sauce or the other sauce that it's supposed to have and mainly imitation crab as well. The baked green mussels have saved them a few more chances and are still my ultimate favorite from any sushi place. Warm and gooey and flavorful, thank you for not changing. But seriously, what happened to you Kaya??  You were sooo good up until 1 year ago when I first started reaaally noticing a change. Thank goodness my stamp card was filled out so I got one person free last night because it was definitely not worth it. I will give you 3 more chances since we've had a long marriage. But just warning you, we might have to get a divorce :(Worst customer service i have ever got in my life ,I ordered sushi baked roll , I eat kosher fish  only , they brought me sushi with crab meat , when I asked to replaced it the manager asked me not to come to the restaurant any more !!!! Cuz they are tired of making a custom order for Jewish people .The staff don't know how to talk with customers , They insulted me and made me feel very bad .I will never get back to that restaurant .What a racist attitude ...Shame on you guys .I really was looking forward to trying this place and although the food was decent the experience made me never want to come back.A group of us from work have a soccer league that we play in every Sunday night and after our game this Sunday we decided we wanted to grab some food and like I  said before I was really wanting to try this place so we went.Now I understand that some of the guys I was with were in shorts and t-shirts because we had just come from a game but I have never felt more judged in my 23 years of life. I feel like they took one look at the guys because of the way they looked and didn't want to help them.We probably went through five different servers, and I understand that these guys can be jokers but you should never judge a group of people by the way they're dressed. They wear suits and ties everyday make 6 figure salaries and because of they way were dressed we had some of the worst customer service. I'm still in shock.The manager came around to every table while we were there, except ours. Our servers were very rude, our food took forever to get to us and the manager completely snubbed our group. We didn't even get a chance to let him know what was going on.The food may have been decent but we would much rather go somewhere who treated us with respect no matter what were wearing then bring our business back here.I love sushi, but my body doesn't really like all of the rice- so I try to find AYCE spots that offer riceless rolls. Unfortunately, Kaya is not one of them. However, they balance this out by offering one (5 piece) order of sashimi per person, and a grill/skewer portion of their menu, in addition to the usual apps, nigiri, and rolls. For those who love carbs, there's also a soup/noodle section available. Pricing is a bit higher, but you have quite a bit to pick from.APPS: The sashimi plate and sashimi poke were both pretty solid, with generous portions of fish. The "lettuce wraps" app isn't the typical version with ground chicken and vegetables, but features crab, avocado, cucumber, and tempura veggies in lettuce cups, which is at least kind of close to a riceless roll. GRILL/SKEWERS: We tried all of the items marked as "one per person" (garlic, bacon/scallop, bacon/asparagus, beef tongue, etc). We didn't really care for these items but liked having them available for something different.NIGIRI: Fresh with surprisingly thick cuts. Rice wasn't too heavy but also didn't seem to have much flavor. The salmon, halibut, and uni quality all surpassed my expectations (better than average for AYCE) but the amebi (BF's favorite) was super tiny and bland.ROLLS: We tried the White Vegas and the XXX2 rolls, the former a bit spicier than the latter, neither one especially packed with rice as we've experienced elsewhere. I'd consider coming back to try more.I was surprised by how nice this spot was on the inside- high ceilings, cute kitschy decor, and a bar area with TV showing an NBA game. Pricing is a little higher than usual: $58 before tax/tip for dinner for two.I've been coming to Sushi Kaya for a little over 2 years now and it seems like every time we come here the service gets a little worse. It's really sad because this used to be my absolute favorite spot but between the service and the cockroach that was crawling by my head I will be looking for another AYCE Sushi place. The food quality has gone down a little over the years as well. It's not terrible by any means but it's just not as good as the first few times coming here. Management really needs to step it up before they start loosing more and more regulars.
Istanbul Grille=Getting lunch downtown is not always enjoyable. With the same few mediocre chain restaurants glutting the market (Au Bon Pain, Subway, etc.) it's easy to fall in to a rut. Enter Istanbul Grille:The portions are generous. The prices are fair. The staff is friendly and personable. The food is excellent.I, too, tried to pay with a card my first time there and also was told I could pay next time. When I offered the cash I did have (a $5 bill) the guy behind the counter refused to take it so I just tossed it in the tip jar. That's how you build a loyal customer base.Note to first-timers: The ordering process is a little confusing so either go with someone who's been before (if you're the type who doesn't like seeming like a newbie around the regulars) or be prepared to ask a few questions. And try everything because it's all terrific.I can't get enough! I'm hooked...Obviously, because I keep dreaming about the flavorful food here! The first time I walked in I was pretty confused. I've never claimed to be an ethnic food expert, so looking at most of the food, I really had no clue what it was. But, the thing that helps me out is that I'll taste anything. It doesn't matter what it looks like, if it's food, I'm probably going to taste it. True fact.So the guy, who I'm assuming is an owner or manager of some sort is nice enough to help me out. That was pretty much the only option I had, to trust him, considering there's literally no menu. None. So he hooks me up with every single thing they have in their food bins. Seriously, Everything. I ate for days! But every single thing was incredible. I wish I could tell you what it all was... so to best sum it up... I believe I sampled bubba ganache, hummus, chickpea salad and cucumbers in some sort of marinade. What I'm certain I had was salad, rice, chicken, beets and grape leaves. Even the grape leaves were excellent. i feel like I hadn't found some solid leaves until I tasted these. i loved that I could taste the lemon. Just bursting with flavor!So he hooked me up for dinner, lunch and dinner again for $10 with a free drink! He said first time I get one free. i stopped in again today and had a solid meal, no surprise, and watched him give another first timer a free drink. I love great customer service!I'm hooked, for realz.
Aloha Hawaiian BBQ=Fantastic Hawaiian BBQI still don't get the whole steamed rice & macaroni salad as sides but as far as the bbq-I was pleasantly suprised.This place has a small dining area but most orders are take-out. They also have the largest Hawaiian shirt on the planet hanging on the wall. REAL Cool!Service is fast & friendly and the prices and selection is terrific!:)
Basil Thai Cuisine=If it were not for the gift certifcate we had from a JDRF fundraiser I don't think I would have stepped foot into Basil.  I always drive past it and from the outside..it just looks like another Thai place that might be mistaken for a Chinese/Japanese restaurant. However, as soon as we walked in we were very surprized and impressed with the decor and that they were packed..on a Wed. night!  Our gift certificate had expired 2 weeks ago (I can't understand why a gift certifcate would expire).  The hostess at the desk didn't look like we were going to wiggle our way out of this one.  She called over the manager, Dillon, and he looked at the gift certifcate and said they would honor it and then thanked us for our donation to the JDRF.  Dillon seated us and took our drink order.  Hendrick Gin & Tonics - yes they had Hendricks AND they had cucumbers and didn't look at us strangely when we asked.  A+ already.  We started off with the Basil spring rolls.  They were very good and the dipping suace was very spicy, but you only got 2 of them for $6.95.  I thought that was a little pricey and I would have rather gone for the lettuce wraps. Dillon was very attentive and we had a great discussion about how the Uptown hotel market has been full for weeks and is booked until Thanksgiving.  He also made an excellent recommendation for a Pinot Noir and it wasn't the most expensive wine on the list.  For dinner, Jennifer our waitress was very helpful.  She said she liked the red curry dishes the best and suggested the Red Curry Duck  ($24.95).  We ordered the duck and the Pad Thai ($15.95).  The Red Curry Duck was awesome.  The Pad Thai had chicken and shrimp and it was very good.  One of the best Pad Thai I have had in awhile.  It did not stick together like a big wad of starchy noodles.  It was very good with enough of a helping of chicken and large size shrimp and a good amount of vegetables.  After dinner we went to the bar and finished our wine and had a rum mojito that was also very good.  The bar tender was personable and Dillon came over to check on us.  It was a great night and the food was superb.  Will definetly go back to Basil Thai.Ok ...hmmm...I rated this one only 3 stars.  As a Thai people, this restaurant is more americanize food.  I ordered hot but it was mild to me.  The food was ok.  We ordered Basil Pork w rice and Pad see eww.  It was ok moderate.  If u love spicy food, ordered Thai hot.  To me, its still not that hot but bc I am thai and i eat spicy food.  But if u dont like spicy food thai-american taste, this place is for u......Basil Thai Cuisine was recommended by a fellow coworker to eat for dinner.  Pretty tasty... and pricey too.  Their website boasts as "Refined Thai"; which I would agree with.  If you ask me, I probably wouldn't pay that much for Asian food unless I'm on a hot date where the guy pays for it though.  Since I was traveling for business, why not?I ordered the Pad See-Eu.  Delicious but it'll cost you $16.95.
The Mad Greek=I checked out the Mad Greek today.  We were on that side of town and it popped in my head, thanks Yelp!  I dont' know if I would drive and make a special trip, but if I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again.  In the light of day, it didn't seem so clean to me.  If you are the kind of person that looks at sanitation ratings, it might not be the place for you. I didn't see what their score was and I do not care, I will eat anywhere, but I know what people like when they think of a clean restaurant.On the upside, our server was pleasant, we ordered chicken sandwiches on pita.  It was served hot and was very filling.  It would be so much better for you to eat at the Mad Greek instead of fast food anyday.
Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh=I have to give this place a split personality review.  The party side of me says this place is a heck of a good time!  The foodie side of me says this place compares to a TGIFridays, but with German food. The first time I came here was right after they opened....so I wanted to come for the food and drink.  It was the dead of winter so the outdoor area wasn't open yet and we were shoved in the corner of the large dining room.  I couldn't decide what to order because I love sauerkraut, I love cabbage and I love German Potato Salad!  It's sad I didn't even want any of the meats, all sides!  So I just stuck to those and apps.  I mean who can go wrong with those choices?? So the fried pickles were good and....fried.  Check.  The sauerkraut was like mush.  Ew.  I expect good sauerkraut from a German place!  I want it crisp and tart.  Just plain mush.  The German Potato salad, mushy as well.  Potato's, mushy....no flavor.  Yuck.  Fried Cabbage...you hear me....FRIED....was mush!  Seriously, horrible!  I would never come here to eat again.  On the other side.... Atmosphere is fantastic! The dining room is really rambunctious! They have people standing on tables and singing.  they have a HUGE shot luge where a bunch of people have to take shots at once.  And the outside...FANTASTIC!  It's this huge open area with picnic tables and a large bar.  Plus you're right smack against the river so it's really pretty out to.  Pretty for a beer garden I suppose!  The beer comes in these huge liters, which is great in theory, but if you're not slamming them back it gets warm and nasty.  I'm always a lager fan, so I had the Hofbräu Premium Lager.  It was pretty much lager like.  Nothing to write home to Germany about. So remember, food gross but drinking atmosphere GREAT!I have wanted to come to the Hofbrauhaus since my 21st birthday but just made it here a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I don't get why people love it so much.  The food is very Americanized German, and the atmosphere is so strange.I ordered the Bauren Schnitzel ($16.95), which was a Pork cutlet with Ham and American Cheese.  Think a cheap version of chicken cordon bleu.  It was the waxy American cheese.  This was the kind of thing I would expect to get from a dive bar or cheap diner.  I also had a dark beer that, while dark in color, was not dark in flavor.  It was fine just not what I expected.  My dad was super unimpressed with his Weisswurst.  So food was a bust, beer was ok.I think the low point came when at 6:00 pm on a weeknight people were plastered.  The waitresses were serving multiple drinks to people simultaneously, which is illegal.  Some creepy old man who was there with his TEN children was double-fisting liters of beer.  And he and his children spent the evening running through the tables.  The Von Trapp family with a drinking problem?  Guess that's what I get for eating fake German food.If you just want to drink, go to the Beer Garden at a time children are not allowed.  Otherwise, skip the Hofbrauhaus.Cheers!  I love coming to the Hofbrauhaus  on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Most especially when it is nice enough to enjoy the outdoor biergarten along with the views of the city and the river.  Maybe it's the German in me, or the beer in me, or the German beer in me?  Eh either way you put it, I'm down with it.Now I haven't eaten here but on a few occasions.   The food is good enough.  No particular stars or duds that I can recall.  I love German food, but their version is much more Americanized.  It's okay though, since the South Side offers so much in the way of eateries I am happy to just come and spend a couple hours in the sun downing a liter of brew.   Our last visit here was great.    Perfect weather over the Labor Day weekend led to a great afternoon trying their September style Oktoberfest that is brewed in Munich.  I loved it.  Nice seasonal balance of flavors, served in a huge been stein, you just can't go wrong there.  When I do come here I tend to try their seasonal selection first, there are many that are very good.  Sometimes this place can get crazy, and if you aren't into that kind of atmosphere I recommend coming in the afternoons.   I would probably never come here in the evening again, though I have heard they cracked down on their tolerance of bozo drunken idiots.  This is always good to hear.  Bottoms up!
Las Fuentes Mexican Grill=One of the nicest Mexican buffet options I have ever seen.  It is great to have this location right here in Surprise.  The dining room is nice and the menu selections are amazing.  Prices are a tad on the high side for me, but in retrospect, the food was worth it.  Avoid Abuelo's at the Arrowhead Mall area, and stay right here in town for a wonderful dinner!  Service has been spot on each time we have been here.
Ono Hawaiian BBQ=Went here last night for dinner. The place was very clean and unfortunately - sorta sparse. I guess the South Side doesn't appreciate Hawaiian food like I do. :( I had the Bulkogi short ribs. They were braised in this wonderful tariyaki-like sauce and were very tender!! I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful! I loved it too!! i wish they had a bulkogi and katsu combo... but alas they don't! :( They have a pretty big menu and I needed a few minutes just to read through it all. and I didn't even get through it all! :( When our food came Steve is absolutely right! Our containers were BURSTING with yummy food! :) My ONLY complaint is that the Macaroni salad has onions in it. I hate onions. but that's just me. I am totally adding this place on my list of regular haunts. I know it's a fast food chain... but damnit it's GOOD! I look forward to trying the Span Masubi!! It's a giant piece of nori wrapped sushi made with SPAM!! How could that be bad?!?! I also want to try the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. :) to my yelpers, I say GO! i know there's another location Phoenix... but if you're on this side and you want to dine in a clean and you're REALLY hungry and want to be REALLY full... and you love BBQ like I love BBQ and have a few extra bucks to spend and are willing to give a fast food chain a try... then give this place a try! Where the grill is always hot and the surf's always up! :D
Crave Cafe=The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.
Hokkaido Seafood Buffet=3.5 stars.  I'm typically a pretty harsh reviewer when it comes to buffets since to me buffet quality food is synonymous to takeout quality, and why would someone dine out to just have takeout?  Also, for the same cost and time spent at a buffet one can go to a much better restaurant with better tasting and quality food.  With that in mind, I have to say Hokkaido isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.So here's what I have to recommend:1.  Go for lunch.  Only go for lunch.  At $8.99, it's probably one of the cheapest if not the cheapest buffet out there.  If you're shelling out over $20 for dinner including drinks, why not just go to a Chinese restaurant w/ a nicer ambiance and better quality food like China Palace?2.  Go early.  I've been there once around 12:30 and once around 2:30 PM and there's a giant difference in the quality of the food.  Get there either before or during the lunch rush.  They have adequate seating and it's not like you'll be waiting... it IS a buffet.  Food will be coming out a lot faster and everything will be fresher.3.  Stick w/ salmon nigiri.  If you're here for the sushi, their rolls just don't cut it, and their salmon nigiri is probably the only thing worth eating.  Their other options aren't really passable.4.  Get their dim sum.  If you're going when they're busy, fresh handmade dim sum is being made all the time.  And where in Pittsburgh can you get non-frozen sui mei?  I also like their pork buns (only if they're freshly made of course).5.  Avoid the usual suspects.  You know what fried rice tastes like.  You know what lo mein tastes like.  You know what chicken teriyaki and General Tso's tastes like.  You know it's all loaded with excessive MSG and you'll have cotton mouth while feeling like crap later.6.  Do try their Mongolian BBQ / Teppanyaki.  The chef actually knows what he's doing and cooks kinda okay.  If you're new to Mongolian BBQ, it might be daunting, but after a while you should be able to figure out what sauce combinations taste good.  The chef can make a sauce for you, but I don't like my dishes as salty as your average patron.I find myself eating their salmon nigiri, their dim sum, their beef brisket soup, and their "szechuan-style" pork.  I also get some veggies, be it baby bok choi, green beans, or broccoli for the sole reason of pretending to be healthy.  I stay clear of all their other sushi, their, pizza, sausage, pork loin, and random Americanized Chinese.A quick nigiri fix with some handmade dim sum in Pittsburgh for 11 bucks seems pretty good for me.When you get right down to it, it's a chinese buffet, and as we all know, Pittsburgh and the yinzers with their stretch jeans and sweat pants mentalities, loves them some Chinese buffet.On Jan 1st I took charge of my life and health and went vegan, it wasnt long after that Lesbian friend of Joe who eats meat with every meal and snack decided that for her birthday she wanted to come here for her celebration. we hit the place and she took off for the crab legs, shrimp, and anything she could find that used to be an animal that was sitting under heat lamps and oozing of juices that used to be blood.I went to the sushi station and asked one of the sushi chefs if he could make me a california roll and anything else without fish. He smiled and said that he could put his creative mind to work. I was floored with what he came up with. He took many different vegetables and made me a sushi platter that was both beautiful and filling. Using brown rice and white rice, cucumber, carrot, and scallion, he created a wonderful meal.
Tropical Smoothie Cafe="I was so disappointed with this place, that I was compelled to write this almost as soon as I finished eating." says Kellie A. in a review over a year ago.  Well lets start by saying that not a whole lot has changed in a year and that was my first thought on my drive back to work.First off I already had read some of the reviews and it was a consistent "customer service is crap" here.  I didn't pick the place as I was meeting my friend for a lunch date.When I walk in my friend is at the front of the line and there is a lady behind her.  No staff around.  We wait.  And wait.  And finally Mr. Ignacio shows up.  No greeting just asked my friend what she wanted to order.  When he finally got to me I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a diet coke.  He then asks me if I want a 12 oz or a 24 oz and without hesitation I order the 12 oz thinking the smaller is better....not fully realizing its a kids cup.  I pay for my meal (by the way he never told me how much it was) and he walks away.  No receipt.  No drink cup.  No "I will have your order right out".  So I move to the side to see if someone can help me.  Immediately he is annoyed and "thought" he gave me a cup (my kids cup).  I ask if THAT is 12 oz and he said yes.  Ok I guess?  Would have been nice to mention that little detail. The receipt without any conversation was awkward not knowing if he was going to give it to me or not.  Again he hands it to me and walks away in silence.  What a ball of joy this guy is.So my name is called and I kindly thank the guy (another employee) for my lunch.  My girlfriend ordered the same salad and as I am a quarter through I look at her salad and realize mine doesn't have chicken.  I quickly look at my receipt and make sure I ordered it with chicken. Sure enough they forgot the chicken.  So once more I'm headed to the front with no one around waiting for assistance.  Mr. Ignacio's slow ass comes up and as nice as can be I state that my Chicken Caesar Salad is missing chicken-praying and hoping they don't spit on it.  No apologies just an argument of him wanting my salad back and me not wanting them to do bad things to it.  I informed him that he can bring out the chicken separately which he did and added extra to be nice I guess. Thanks but no thanks.  The chicken looked gross and was clearly nuked (a little cold in the middle).  Maybe that's why they drench the salad in dressing "over" the whole salad so you don't see the chicken-which is how my friend's looked when it came out.  Anyways, I counted like 4 employees in the back.  Don't know what the heck they were doing because no one was up front unless forced to when a line piled up.  Not to mention not one of them paying attention to customers up front. This is exactly what I'm talking about how special it is to have a young person giving great customer service.  Because it is not often that you see that.  In this case with Ignacio, I cant believe they have him servicing people.  No personality and not one skill of customer service.  Very sad.  Lets just hope someone mentors the poor guy to grow up with a positive and friendly attitude. Like other reviews there isn't much to say positive. What a disappointment on all levels.  Maybe management should check out the reviews to realize after a year they aren't getting better...sigh.  Definitely will not be returning to this location.Came here around 950pm on a Sunday night. We were the only ones in drive thru. I would've chose to go inside but dt is only available. So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying "Hello?" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying "hello" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying "ooookay..." Like, why was he so confused? So, we pull up to the window and he goes, "So what was your order?"I repeat everything again."So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?"Yes we want all the food we ordered."Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that"Like, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, "sorry hold on you want what?" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. I also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. We get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had. That Miroslav guy was so rude!
Trophy's Steakhouse=Again, perfection. Had the 12 oz NY strip this time around. Look at it. It's beautiful. Almost sad to eat it .... Uh jk. Loved it.As good as it was though, I think I will never stray from the filet again .... I am so glad I found this place and I am glad QC is filling it - this place MUST stay in business - its the best steak within 30 min of my house!  Please QC ... go and you will fall in love like I have, and we will never have to worry about them going out of business!!Yea!!!
World Buffet=-Very clean restaurant.-Even cleaner restrooms.-Pretty decor.-Friendly staff.-Delicious food, including Dim Sum, Mongolian BBQ, Sushi, Chinese, Seafood, Salad Bar, and American food.-Fresh food rotation. Buffet lady with headset talks to the cooks in the kitchen and new food appears. -Reasonable prices.-Convenient parking.-One of the better Chinese Food buffets that I have been to.
First Food & Bar=The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!After reading Connie C.'s review and seeing "mojito lamb chops" on the menu, I was fully intrigued and sucked in. Yes, you read that right...MOJITO. LAMB. CHOPS.Quite the new swanky scene in Vegas. Dim lights, upbeat tunes, gorgeous view of the strip...I was saddened to have had to leave early to meet a friend who landed a bit earlier than expected. However, we were able to stay long enough to enjoy my 1.5 glass of Cotton Candy Kiss. It was amusing watching the waiter pour the drink into my martini glass filled with a fluff of pink cotton candy as it melted away into red liquid courage. With an abundant amount of crushed Lifesaver candy coated around the rim, each sip was full of fruity sweetness. Perfectly portioned Grey Goose and juices, the drink delivered an awesome kick without the jolting taste of alcohol. Loved it!Our waiter understood our situation and packed everything to go without any hesitation. Literally running back to our room so the food wouldn't get cold, we unpacked everything with a fork in hand and chowed down with the quickness.The mojito lamb chops lived up to their reputation! Blanketed with a minty lime glaze, each bite was packed with intense flavor. I found the meat to be a tad tough, but I enjoyed the non-gamy taste of the lamb. With 3 fairly large cuts, this could be served more as an entree than an appetizer. Highly recommended to anyone who swings by First Food & Bar.Accompanied with a side order of truffle mac and cheese, this was a delicious first meal in Vegas. Prices are very reasonable considering LV is known for raping everyone's wallet in every possible way. I hope to come back next time and stay long enough to enjoy the ambiance and full experience.My friends and I have developed a new system for our trips to Vegas. Instead of making a list of all the places where we can get drunk, we have lists of where we plan to grub.First Food & Bar was definitely a place we wanted to try, especially since a friend of ours went ahead and tried the place and not only gave it a good review, sent tantalizing pictures.First Food is located inside between the Palazo and the Venetian along the gondala canal. Right next to the Barney's New York store on the second level of the Palazo.Our party of 4 got seated in a booth along the window facing the strip and the big Palazo marquee. The view was great and definitely added to the ambiance of restaurant. Since it was a Sunday night, we didn't indulge in any cocktails. Our friend (the junky one that went here before the rest of us) did mention the cotton candy cocktail, which is backed up by many yelpers here.My friend and I were ready to have a realy grub moment so we each got an appetizer. I went with the yelpers choice of "Mojito Lamb Chops" and my friend went with the huge bacon wrapped shrimp.The lamp chops are flambeed table side when they serve it, so there definitely is a "wow" factor. I did a pieced of the lamb chop back into the sauce after it was served and wow...it most definitely has 151 in it!The bacon wrapped shrimp was perfect and if I do say so myself, LA can use some bacon wrapped shrimp carts next to the hot dog ones outside of clubs and sporting events!For the main course I got the Shrimp Diablo, and my friends got Cubano sandwich, and the Trout respectively. The shrimp diablo was served with eggplant which make my mouth absolutely happy! The heat from the sauce was a perfect blend of spice but not too hot that you would need a pitcher of water to calm our burnt taste buds.My friends were pretty happy with their choices..but I think it was dessert that pushed us over the edge. I decided to do a throw back to my childhood and ordered the push pop (yes just like the ones with the flintstone characters on it), while my friends went with the molten chocolate cake, and the s'mores,The push pop was, well a push pop. It was a very tangy sorbet that really cleansed my palate after eating very savory food. The molten cake was pure chocolate goodness. The s'mores on the other hand...just fucking amazing. The graham crackers on the bottom could have been a little more moist, but ugh..the whole thing was just too amazing. The toasted marshmallows on top..just made my mouth happy!Overall I would give this place a 3.5 but with a photobooth located inside it's bumped up to a 4. We had two different servers help us and they were absolutely great. One of them didn't really know all the components of a dish and rather than bullshit us he went and asked - awesome! Definitely stop by if you are in Vegas and looking for some good eats before doing whatever it is you do in Vegas :)We came here for a coworker's birthday lunch. I do think the strip could use more places like this - moderately priced, fun atmosphere, open for lunch, etc. It seems we have too many things on the uber-high end (and only open for dinner) or uber-low end (food courts, fast food, cafes). The space was great and the views of the strip are killer! I loved our booth right by the window overlooking the pirate disaster at TI. Service was just OK (he forgot to bring our soup and was slow in general), but unfortunately I've found mediocre service is becoming the norm on the strip..I was disappointed by how tiny the lunch menu was. Maybe 10 choices or so? Pretty slim pickings. The drink menu had 50 things, the food menu had just a few - what's up with that? Annoying when you're at a work lunch and not drinking! Prices were high-ish ($15-$20 on average) for the type of food it is, but it's on the strip in a swanky hotel so whatever, that's just part of it. 2 of us shared the pulled pork quesadillas and turkey club sandwich, and 2 others got the fish and chips. The turkey club sandwich DID taste just like the ones I ate at the country club growing up - but for $15 with no sides, I would have liked some primo ingredients (avocado or even cheese!). The pulled pork quesadilla was pretty awesome. It looked like a sushi roll with beautiful avocado layered on top, but it had that nice grilled crunch of a quesadilla. Unique, flavorful, and delicious. My coworkers seemed to really enjoy their fish and chips. For dessert we had chocolate creme brulee with toasted marshmallow on top. This was freaking awesome. Something different, well executed, and fun. Overall a nice change of pace from the high end stuff on the strip and the food court crap. It's pricier than what you'd expect to pay at this sort of place, but for the most part the quality and portion size is there and the atmosphere and strip views can't be beat.Jim G. and I have only ever eaten here during the late night hours, so factor that in to your own decision making process.  happy Hour is from 4-6 and midnight-2am!The vibe here is cool, with loud, often good music, and a nice view of the front of Palazzo and Venetian.  Keeps the energy up! The only downside is that this place is far away from most of the other stuff in the hotels, but it's worth the trek (as long as you have comfy shoes. Trust me on that...).Things we've tried:-Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings: Very tasty, served with a sriracha ketchup to add a little heat =)-Lollipop Buffalo Wings: Tasty, but a much larger order than I anticipated. Be ready to share!!-Lobster Chowder: Not too impressed with this dish.  It's super big (which helps justify the price), but not as flavorful as I expected. I'd pass on this.-Tater tots with cheese (can't remember the type, but very flavorful) and truffle oil!: This dish was big on flavor and on fun! Crisp tots, nice gourmet cheese, and the punch of truffles. Yes, please.-For me, the reason to return: Macaroni and Cheese topped with Doritos!! If this isn't late night food, I don't know what it. The mac and cheese is good, the Doritos are awesome. Together, it's a cheesy, crunchy heaven. Order it. Just do it!I'll be ordering that Mac n Cheese again really soon. Hope to see you there! =)I hate speaking in the third person but this place had Craig R. written all over it! Just look at these tasty dishes;Nacho Cheese Doritos Mac & Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=826LcTQfc4Yc0zdF0mZbDQMain Line Philly Cheesesteak W/ Foie Gras & Tartuffo Whizhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=duW7vzBywJFRDU8dD3kKrw or http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=HuYApeozWa7c71Mm-ZFRiQPhilly Cheesesteak Dumplingshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?start=200BBQ Pulled Pork Eggrolls W/ Slaw & Dr. Pepper BBQ Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=BsVPIS7yPlrPyRUk-WMi0Q Warm Pretzel Bread & Spicy Mustard (Free Appetizer) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=DmIHIg4jkp_x1HbiuIqU7gLike I said, Craig R. written all over it!Located in The Palazzo Hotel, First Food & Bar is large, dimly lit joint with a cool, relaxing vibe. As you can tell from what I ordered above, this place is all about tricked out comfort foods. Everything we ate was amazing. EVERYTHING!My favorite two items were the Doritos Mac (obviously) and the Main Line Philly. The Mac was super cheesy and flavorful and the Doritos gave it an extra cheesy, crispy element.  The Philly was HUGE and delicious. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and the Foie gave it an extra, fatty, buttery taste. It was also covered in Foie mayo, sweet onions, balsamic glaze and Tartuffo Whiz, all of which made this one of the best tasting Philly's I've ever had, even though I had to eat it with a knife and fork. And I got to give a quick shout out to the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=01F_4bCqJ9_EtE1fO9QSAw. It was fantastic.     My only beef with First Food is the pricing. I'm NEVER one to complain about the price of food, especially when it's amazing, but for five small (but super tasty) Philly Dumplings it was almost twenty bucks. The Main Line Philly was over thirty. Our entire bill was almost a hundred bucks (with tip and no beverages), which seemed a bit too much. The service is great though, so that's a plus. Overall, I really, really enjoyed my experience at First Food & Bar. The food was outstanding, as was the service. I can't wait to go back and try some of their delicious sounding desserts.
The Auld Dubliner=Quite a few Irish Pubs have sprung up in the West Valley; one by the Peoria Spots Complex, The Auld Dubliner, and most recently one at West Gate. I have been to each spot and I have frequented TAD many more times. I like the atmos at TAD however I question the rusty farm tools and nets hanging on the walls. After coming here for a few happy hours over the last few months, and taking advantage of the special pricing, happy hour is a good time to come. Some of the happy hour specials are $1 off draft beers, half priced appetizers, and extended lunch menu definitely makes this time of day a better value. TAD has a selection of about 12 draft brews including one of my favorites Smithwick's. On one visit I tried the Fish N Chips which are pretty standard and tasty. **Bargain hunter alert ** Tied into the happy hour, TAD offers lunch portions until 6 pm -- smaller portion and more cost effective.The Auld Dubliner is a solid spot for happy hour.
Red Rock Buffet=2.5  but definitely not good enough to bump to 3 stars.Just to get to the restaurant you must navigate through the dreary casino that is Fort McDowell (see my review on Fort McDowell).  And this restaurant is CLEARLY an extension of said casino. Let's get to the point, the only reason your even considering coming here,*Drumroll*...ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS. Yes, its true, for $9.99 you can sit for hours and eat crab legs until you can't can move. IMO, that is the only reason to come to this restaurant or even the casino for that matter. The crab legs were plentiful and were pretty good, these are snow and not king crab legs so they require a bit of work for the amount of meat you get. I ate my weight in crab and did not dare to touch anything else offered in the buffet. The rest of the food (enchiladas, green beans, macaroni, etc.) looked deplorable. I get, Crab is expensive, and if they must give you something else to eat in addition to the crab its going to be the cheapest side dishes they can call "food". No thank you.  The real question: Is all you can eat crab legs worth the visit? *sigh*, Kinda, not really. I don't regret making my 1st visit, but at the moment I'm not compelled to return. After I was stuffed to the gills with crab, and had to make the journey back to civilization, reality set in. The reality of having to drive 30 miles, 10 miles of that through surface streets, burn 1/8th  of a tank in gas, and walk thru a casino that is more like a smoky time portal to the Reagan era.. probably not worth it. I could save myself $15 in 91 octane premium petro and just eat at the local red lobster for far better food and a better experience.
Silver Mine Subs=Despite the construction on Indian School, this place was doing some major business during the lunch hour on Monday...I was starving and I wanted to something somewhat healthy but quick... I remembered reading Donald's review and thought about calling for delivery, but I decided I'd go check the place out myself instead.And I'm so glad that I did!The place is super clean, the employees are really friendly, the prices are right, and the food hit the spot too - it was exactly what I needed to fuel the rest of my busy day.I went with a medium "Caribou" on a tortilla wrap.  What's a "Caribou," you ask? It's Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Sprouts, Mayo.  I know what you're thinking... "Isn't she on a wedding diet?"  Well - yes, I am.  I ordered it with only single cheese and no mayo.  The wrap is low carb and was supposedly whole wheat but I'd question the whole wheat part.  It was really good though!  I also ordered a side salad and a pickle... both delicious!  (If you like a sweet tangy honey mustard dressing like I do - they've got that too!)I'm so glad to know about Silver Mine - I'd go the extra 1/2 mile for Silver Mine over Subway any day... or I'll just have them deliver.  Either way, I'm sold!
China One - West Charleston=Looking for a quick lunch spot in the area, we ended up walking in around 12:30.We found a seat and they brought a menu out to us for us to decide what we wanted to eat. I ordered the honey walnut shrimp from the lunch menu. I don't usually order that dish, but it sounded good on that day. The food arrived relatively quickly and the it was standard fast food fare. Portions were generous and service was standard.
Mount Everest India's Cuisine=What's up with me? 2 Indian buffets in 4 days. That must be a first for me. I don't think I've been to one for six months prior to this. My craving for the Indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to Mint and so I was determined to have a good experience today. After extensive research on Yelp I decided to try Mt. Everest. A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being "billowy." We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office. This buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic. My co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys). And yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty. My only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.It's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while. Mt. Everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the Indian buffet genre in Las Vegas. Thanks to all the Yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place. You guys were spot on!The very best Indian lunch buffet in town!!  I literally enjoy every hot dish they offer and I'm glad they're still doing brisk business.  Stand outs for me include the korma, saag paneer, chicken tandoori and the chana masala.  How do people operate after stuffing their faces here for lunch?  I only go on my days off since I'm in a coma for at least a couple of hours after.My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.They give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).Mango Lasi:Creamy mango shake. 5/5Veggie Samosa:You get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5Aloo Tikki:You get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5Palak Paneer:I was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5Garlic Naan:I love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5Chicken Tikka Masala:My favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5Kulfi:A mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5Gulab Jamun:My favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5I honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!This place is just okay. There are many rave reviews, and I feel like I may be missing something. I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons.
The Greek Gourmet=Holy hummus batman!!I mean, it's like a hummus party and everyone's invited.  Seriously, if you're a true friend you would invite everyone to this hummus party because it's so good!  Apparently with over 20 kinds of hummus, you can please them all.I tried a plethora of different ones but loved the buffalo, garlic and horseradish one the best.  I went home with the horseradish and have been happily eating it every day since.  Man does that horsey sauce give you a kick in the butt, but it's goooood!I also had a gyro with all the fixin's.  The pita bread, soft and chewy.  The lamb, loads of it and nice and moist, no dry meat here!  The sauce (maybe to me one of the most important parts) was awesome!  Love me some cucumber yogurt greek sauce... load me up with it and I'm good to go!  Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap, with gyro's at around $5 and the hummus being around $3.  You won't break the bank with this lunch/dinner/snack!It's a family run business and the owner is SUPER friendly and easy to talk to.  it's so awesome to see an owner that's so passionate about the business and happy to be there.  I know I'll be back for my stock of hummus, I'm hooked and I can't turn back now!!I stopped by today around 12:30 to grab a gyro for a quick on-the-go lunch.  I asked if they had chicken gyros, to which the guy behind the counter said, "Yeah, I can make you one."  Nonplussed, I said okay, and he rung me up for $5.After standing around for a couple of minutes, I saw the guy who waited on me get a hunk of meat out, unwrap it, and put it on the broiler.  Noticing that the bus that I needed to catch would be there in 3 min., I asked him if my chicken gyro would be ready soon.  He assured me that it would, and then proceeded to assemble it and put it on a panini press.  When he gave me the finished product, I rushed out the door and managed to catch the bus just in time.Once on the bus, I unwrapped the gyro and proceeded to eat it.  Upon inspection, it was large in size and bulky, and contained some surprising ingredients.  Instead of iceberg or romaine lettuce leaves, it was topped with spring mix, and I didn't detect any tomatoes in it at all--or fries.  The biggest surprise was the meat, however, which consisted of breaded chicken strips, most likely of the previously frozen variety.  This is the first time I've ever bitten into a gyro with crunchy (crispy?) meat.  The gyro also contained a generous helping of tzatziki sauce, which was applied between the meat and the spring mix.  Unfortunately, it lacked the zip that's the hallmark of a well-made tzatziki, and its plentifulness made for messy eating, esp. without napkins, which I forgot to grab when beating a hasty exit to catch the bus.  Overall, the flavor wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I'm accustomed to in a gyro.I'd be willing to give this place another try for the hummus, since that's what everyone seems to rave about here, or perhaps a pastry, since their selection looked good.  For gyros, however, I'd recommend checking to see if the broiler is in use before ordering--at least, for the chicken variety, if you don't want to risk getting a gyro made with crispy chicken strips.  For a solid chicken gyro containing standard ingredients and meat sliced from the spit, I recommend Lesvos in the South Side.  Based on the positive reviews, I must confess that I expected better.I have been looking forward to trying the Greek Gourmet for over a year and half, but I just made it in a few weeks ago.  The prices are crazy reasonable, and the employees are super friendly.  My experience:Lamb Gyro ($5)- The lamb meat and pita were spot on.  Diced tomatoes were great.  The tzatziki sauce was unique.  I was not a fan.  It was a very heavy and creamy sauce, almost like ranch dressing.  It also seemed to have a salty feta taste almost.  It was very unique.  Similar to Laura M, I found the spring mix off-putting and very messy.  I would have much preferred romaine.  A 2.5 star gyro.I want to go back and try the gyro again with a slight variation.  The girl behind me ordered hers without sauce but with hummus.  I think this is the way to go.  So I would recommend trying a lamb gyro with tomatoes and hummus.  They also have a frequent gyro card, and if you buy 10, you get one free!Small Red Pepper Hummus ($3.50)- Spectacular.  I will be coming back here to buy more hummus.  They had about ten flavors.  I also tried the plain hummus, and it was super delicious.  Some of the best hummus I have ever eaten.The employees were exceptionally friendly and upbeat and really seemed to like working there.  This is a take out only place and more of a market than a restaurant.  They also accept credit cards!
Vietnam Grille=---Brace yourselves, as this is a VERY long review----Hanging out with other foodies in San Diego I was constantly dragged along on hunts for perfect pho. It was definitely a trend among the foodies to compare pho notes, finding the most bizarre and hidden vietnamese restaurants and bragging about it among other gourmands. The fact is, I never really liked pho, my friends would ooh and ahh and suck down giant bowls of it. I'd do the same, thinking to myself, well this is good right? I just must not get it. Pho never really seemed all that special to me.Having moved to the mountains of WNC, my cravings for vietnamese food have grown exponentially, not pho of course, but delicious spring rolls wrapped with lettuce and the like, maybe a bahn mi sandwich. The fact was, there are no vietnamese restaurants in Asheville, and you always want what you can't have. On a recent trip to Charlotte I sought out the most accessible and highest rated viet restaurant, which just happened to be Vietnam Grille. I couldn't have been happier.Open till 10, it fit right in with my schedule. Well lit, and open seating, I was pleased immediately upon entering. Wasting no time I asked for an order of crispy spring rolls. Delivered quickly PIPING hot, and amazingly crunchy, the spring rolls were like biting into little nuggets of heaven. A perfect blend of pork and shrimp.When my server returned to take my order, I was torn between three items. The house special bun, the deluxe broken rice, and the pho. I didn't really want the pho though, it's just... that's what people get. I asked my server for his recommendation. He informed me that the pho was amazing. I winced, and flipped a coin for guidance.Heads: Get the phoTails: Get something awesome!The coin launched into the air, and landed in my palm... heads. Fate had decided for me. It was time for the pho. Once again I was amazed at the speed in which my order was brought to the table. The pho came out steaming, beautiful. From the aroma it was instantly apparent that this was no standard bowl of pho. This was something special.I got to the process I'd seen time and time again, tearing up the basil leaves, putting the meat under the noodles, adding the sprouts and lime juice. Just as I went to reach for the Sriracha a man came to our table, he looked at my bowl and said, "Before you use that, try it first" "People always ruin the broth before tasting what the chef has prepared"I was taken aback, how could I be so rude? I instantly complied and brought a spoonful of the golden, transparent soup to my lips. To call it an explosion of flavor would be an overstatement, it was much more subtle than that. Tiny waves of flavor, layered together to form a perfect tapestry of delight rolled over my tongue. I had never tasted something so light, but full of character. Exceptional, something truly intelligent and delicious. Suddenly it became apparent to me what pho was supposed to taste like, it's supposed to be like this. 3000 miles away from my friends in desperate search of the perfect bowl of pho, I was sitting right in front of it, and relishing every morsel of it. And to think that if I were to have added even a drop of Hoisin or Sriracha I could have tainted this perfect creation.The man introduced himself as the chef and co-owner Ricky Lai. The rest of my meal was spent having a fantastic conversation with Mr. Lai about food, thought, practice, and the fact that Asheville is in DESPERATE need of a vietnamese eatery. It was truly a pleasure to find and eat at the Vietnam Grille. It will surely become a source of pilgrimage when the cravings for vietnamese food become overwhelming.My go-to place in Charlotte if I don't know where else to go!The first appetizer on the menu, which is the rice paper meatball wraps, are pretty much a staple now whenever I go. Pho is also very good, but recently I have been ordering a lot of the grilled pork chops over rice. They even put two runny eggs over it. OMG HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The bun, which is vermicelli noodles with a light sauce is also very good. **TIP: if you are greedy like me and can't live without the taste of pho soup without leaving a Vietnamese place, I order a side of the soup whenever I get a non-Pho entree, haha. Smoothies are very badass as well, try the strawberry or the soursop.I go there a lot though, so I've noticed the music variety doesn't seem to change. One can only listen to Kenny G-like and candle in the wind instrumentals for so long. Other than that, solid place to goI haven't had Vietnamese food in quite some time...we're talking years here so I was really excited when a friend wanted to meet up at Vietnam Grille. He mentioned that he (quite literally) eats here four or five times per week...I can see why!Inside, Vietnam Grille is pretty basic and super clean. The owner and the waitresses were all very nice and made sure that our drinks were constantly filled and we were enjoying our meal. I ordered the spring rolls and the chicken pho. The spring rolls were very good and refreshing - wrapped in rice paper and filled with fresh shrimp, herbs and rice noodles - and came with a tasty dipping sauce. I could have easily (and happily) eaten five more for my lunch. The chicken pho was the star of the meal though. The broth was light and nicely seasoned and it was the most generous helping of pho I've ever been served. Seriously, there was enough for three lunches. The chicken was tender and there were a ton, and I mean a ton, of noodles. If you want to get a delicious lunch that will last for days, this is the way to go.The Pho train continues. Know this place to be one of the most highly revered in town when it comes to authentic Vietnamese, and I'm happy to jump on the bandwagon of believers. It's quaint, very simple inside and located off of South Blvd. Headed north on South Blvd, it's easy to turn in really quick. Located in the parking lot of Sports & Fitness. The rice paper rolls - best I've had in Charlotte. Very thin vermicelli, mint leaves were spectacularly fresh, crispy tofu and the peanut sauce was just wonderfully flavorful. Had to sample the pho, per usual at any vietnamese eatery, and I was thrilled. Simply put, it's just perfect. Savory and smooth broth, spiced well, filled with crunchy scallions, bean sprouts, fresh jalapenos, vermicelli, and a nice helping of thinly shaved beef. Two entrees and rice paper rolls for only $22. We'll be back really freaking soon. So good.
Geisha House Steak & Sushi=My family and I went here for my Mother's 70th birthday celebration dinner.  I actually wanted to take her to a very reputable Steakhouse but she insisted on dining here since it's been her favorite place for special occassions. They have two locations... the one near the strip has been around since the 1980's I believe and has been a local and non-local favorite spot for many. I would suggest to make a reservation since this location is a local spot,  you may have to wait if you don't... Better safe than sorry.There is a bar separate from two main dining rooms. One for Teppanyaki ( the decor is simple yet pleasant to look at, the lighting is dim... just the way I like it! ) and the other a more hip trendy lit area that gives off a L.A. joint vibe. I never been to a Teppanyaki place here in Vegas that played some really good beats... hip hop Hooray for me =) It really put me in a happy, want to sing along mood to every song. Hey DJ you ARE playing all my songs!!! Even my family was jammin to the beats.Our Chef was entertaining and got us to interact with him from catching food in our mouth wow never knew my family is soo talented, to scare the living Sh** out of me from putting sauce on my face BUT it was fake... He even talked to us and carried a decent conversation while cookin up a storm for us... skills... MAD skills I tell ya.We all ordered the Geisha Special which is Lobster, Chicken, Filet Mignon, Shrimp with fried rice and tempura. Also comes with salad that was refreshingly crisp and tasty. The soup broth with bits of mushroom slices had a burst of flavor even though it looked oh so simple. The tempura was lightly deep fried to perfection and enjoyed each crisp bite of hotness.The fried rice was colorful and delicious... I admired the texture of the rice which made it very enjoyable. The Lobster meat was juicy and plumped... Filet was chunky and tender... Chicken was plentiful and all the meats were cooked in no sauce but only seasoning that made it absolutely delicious and satisfying. They have their own house special dipping sauce on the side for the meats but in reference to cooking with Teriyaki Sauce?!?! LOL You gotta be kiddin me... I know what that tastes like and there's no Teriyaki Bowl Teppanyaki here. Overall my Mother had a great birthday dinner... happy with Sake, food and service was memorable, alcohol beverages were made strong * Good Job!! not watered down like some places, had tons of leftovers, which I was sooo excited to wake up for the next day, and now understand why my Mother loves this place so much. Go there BUT come hungry!!!Shabu shabu, aka hot pot, aka Asian fondue, has returned to S. Fort Apache Road!The Geisha Corporation has opened up their fourth restaurant with the name of "Little Geisha Shabu Shabu."  Taking over this huge space once owned by Nina's, Little Geisha offers hot pot, sukiyaki, and something called Genghis Khan shabu shabu.For $13.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, which also comes with a platter of veggies including udon noodles.  Two dipping sauces accompany this dinner, the first being a ponzu and the other possibly being of a sesame variety.  After cooking your meat and veggies in the hot broth, dip your food into both sauces before consuming.  Its all the flavor you'll ever want!  For $14.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Sukiyaki dinner, which also comes with a platter of veggies, udon noodles, and a raw egg.  Their sukiyaki sauce has quite a bit of flavor and the BF was impressed with their concoction.  They pour this stuff into a hot pan and start cooking your food in this sauce.  All dinners come with a bowl of rice and a couple of side dishes of kim chee and pickled goodies.  Be sure to add the garlic, radish, and green onions to your shabu shabu or sukiyaki, it adds a lot more flavor overall.Feel free to ask for more rice, kim chee, and pickled stuff since there's no additional charge for it.  (Double check though!)  The BF and I left pretty full, and it appears they offer a bit more veggies than Swish does.Business is still slow at this location since there's not too much traffic yet around here.  We were the only ones there at 7 pm, but by the time we left, three other parties had joined us.  Employees were helpful in cooking practically all our food for us, and I wasn't sure if this was standard practice or because they were so slow.  (I can't imagine how they could cook everyone's stuff for them if they were packed.)  It can feel a bit rushed when they do all the cooking for you, so feel free to tell them you can take over at any time.  It can get messy with them picking out all your food for you, but depending on your chopsticks skill, maybe you do want them to do it for you.They also offer plenty of tables for those not interested in cooking up their own food.  It's a pretty small and straightforward menu at Little Geisha.  Let's see if they can last longer than Nina's did!Reflecting back on my visit here a few months ago, with a unbiased neutral mind, my experience here was been THE worst of my life. Went in on a Friday night with a group of 5 after seeing an advertised special of 14.99 all you can eat sushi. When we got there, it was fairly empty but we weren't seated for about 15 minutes, for no given reason at all. After being seated, we sat for another 10 minutes after our waitress disappeared, without any notice or even leaving of any menus at all. When she came back to fianlly take our drink orders, she told us that the tiny piece of paper in the plastic display was the menu. It was then we foud out that the special 14.99 menu was limited to about 6-7 different items from the very basic nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp) to a few plain, unoriginal rolls (California, phill, spicy tuna). No appetizers, no included drinks, just those. Dissatisfied and irritated already, I asked to see a regular menu becuase I wasn't feeeling for any of those, she snarled and said "no a.y.c.e. on the full menu, you have to pay full price." I didn't ask for the prices, I asked for the menu. Her farfetched assumption that we were cheap was very insulting. We shouldve left then, but we didn't. There was a selection of happy hour cocktails and mixed drinks that we ordered some of which never arrived at all. Some chose to order off the regular menu, some chose the AYCE and one, so turned off by the way things were going simply didn't want to eat anything. The food came out extremely slowly for the AYCE, often all on one big plate, left for us to divide them across the table in confusion. The sushi was very very mediocre, need I say I've had some better prepackaged supermarket brands. Nigiri had too much rice, sushi rice being too cold and lacking vinegar and the fish being hardly fresh. The rolls were not bad nor great, just.. Boring. During the entire time our party was dining, we didn't recieve one polite gesture from the waitress, or even the bussers.The tipping point of the whole night was at the end. After asking for the bill, which was a difficult task simply because we could barely get a hold of our server, she delivered it and vanished once more. Ahh, the problems arose. We were grossly overcharged. She charged us for 6 AYCE's and all the cocktails we ordered were full price. When we asked her about it, she claimed that the non-ayce patrons ate fron the ayce's plate. That was not the case, trust me, I hardly doubt they were dying to sneak a bite of a California roll. She insisted that was the case and even started to argue. Also when asked about the drinks, she said that we ordered them after the happy hour time, when in reality the fact that we got our drinks 30 minutes after we ordered them due to the entire staffs negligence was probably why she thought we ordered them late. Also and the kicker? There was a crazy, "$5 service charge" added to every single AYCE dinner patron, which brought the actual price of it to 19.99 per person. Never in my life had I heard of hidden fees at a restaraunt. Cars and homes? I understand. Dinner? are you kidding me?Our entire party furious, we spoke with the manager explaining the entire situation, and the most he did was take off all the mistakes, even still that was only done because of us claiming we wouldn't pay if it was corrected. To further rate this place, I'll do it on a rubric based out of 100 points. Food Speed: 30/100Food Quality: 50/100Service: 0/100Decor: 65/100Price: 40/100Avoid, avoid, avoid. Service here is what kills it, and I know it wasn't just a bad day or just that particular waitress because I work at the starbucks in the same plaza ad see them regularly. Most of the staff is extremely rude and snobby.
Bigham Tavern=Wingsday, how can you go wrong!  $.44 wings on Wednesday, so we had to stop by craving some good wings.  Tacos are $2.50 for those that don't like wings.  BT is a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and real good crispy wings.  A nice selection of beers on tap and about 20 wing flavors that are rated 1 to 5 on the menus heat index.  We had the BT Original and the Dingo.  Both were very good.  Neither are real hot or spicy but with a nice flavor and just a little kick.  If you like spicy you may want to go to the 3 or 4 on the heat index.I'm sure we will be back for Wingsday.
Sirio Ristorante=This review pertains to the summer tasting menu.The Skinny: surprisingly weak in the flavour department, poor execution, and lack of a clear thought process make this place a no-go (2.5) service is quite good in the restaurant (4) value: given the quality, $42 per person is pretty ridiculous (1).We were originally going to hit up American Fish for their happy hour but unfortunately they were closed. We stopped by Sirio due to their appealing summer menu offerings.My husband and I both ordered the summer menu which consisted of beef carpaccio, mixed green salad with goat cheese, apple and candied hazelnuts, mushroom ravioli and the roasted chicken with asparagus, artichoke and mushrooms.The beef carpaccio (aka "where's the beef" carpaccio) was overwhelmed with arugula, capers and cheese - not much beef on the plate. The beef lacked adequate seasoning and was surprisingly dry. The dish really needed more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour.The mixed green salad was astoundingly bland given the number of ingredients. The apple in the dish was tasteless as if dunked in water for too long. The champagne vinaigrette was indiscernible. Goat cheese had no goatiness (in a good kind of way) or even saltiness.The only thing in that dish that imparted some sort of taste were the lovely scattering of candied hazelnuts.Ravioli, in my mind, was more than al dente - it was definitely undercooked. The filling which was supposed to have mushrooms in it was overwhelmed by the thyme inside and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever.Albeit, the skin of the chicken was nice and crispy, the breast was dry and overly salty. The lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduction used in the sauce. The sauce was unpleasantly odd and overwhelmed the vegetables. You couldn't taste the mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes. It was a very unsuccessful dish.Finally dessert. I looked for redemption on the last course of panna cotta and gelato/sorbetto selection. What I found was the complete lack of thought in these dishes.The panna cotta was okay - perhaps a little too much on the gelatinous side but fine. When served over the berry soup, the sweetness of the panna cotta made the berry soup overly sour. The same thing happened with the gelato and sorbetto. They served vanilla bean gelato with two sorbets - passionfruit and peach. When you took a bite of gelato then taste the sorbet, your mouth puckered like you emptied a bag of Sour Kids in there. Individually, each ice cream was okay...it's just the combination made no sense. There was obviously very little consideration put into composing this dish - a recurring theme at the restaurant.Given the poor quality and exorbitant pricing, this place rates a 2.
Parma By Chef Marc=Sometimes I wonder about Yelp reviewers.I say that because the reviews for this restaurant are almost unanimously excellent. But that's just not the reality.It's not that the food is bad. It's not bad at all. It's just not outstanding. There's nothing amazing about this place. It's small and cramped and the menu is miniscule,In fact, everything about Parma Pastavino is small, except the prices. My linguine frutti de mare was fine; with fresh clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp...but for $28? Hello?(By the way: if you check the online menu, the prices are about 35% higher when you get to the actual restaurant:...nice bait and switch Chef Marc!)Those kind of prices are comparable to Ferraro's...but there it's actually worth it, being a more beautiful and informed restaurant.And another of my pet peeves: how can any self-respecting restaurant not invest in a reverse osmosis water filtration system for their tap  water. Everyone knows that vegas water is some of the worst in the nation! And I'm not just talking about the water in your glass...don't forget that they use the same water to cook the pasta, rice and anything else that's boiled.My family loves Chef Marc.  He had a restaurant on Tenaya & W Lake Mead Blvd that closed a couple of years ago.  We didn't realize he opened a place on Buffalo & Washington....as soon as I heard that he did, I took the Better Half to dinner here.We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Chef Marc himself at the door.  The place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurant.....we politely declined as we prefer a regular table.  We told him we'd prefer to have a glass of wine while we waited for our table.....we're patient.  My Wife told him that we came here to have his Portobello Mushroom & Organic Spinach appetizer (one of our favorites from the old joint)....he said he'd check to see if he could make it.While we waited, we had a glass of Sangiovese wine....it was pretty good....don't remember any other piece of info as it was suggested by Chef Marc and we ordered based on his recommendation.After a 10 minute wait, we were seated....not too bad for not having reservations.  While I perused the menu, I noticed that the Portobello Mushroom appetizer wasn't on there....I wondered if we would get it.  I ordered a Bufalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad to start with Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce for an entree.....the Better Half ordered the Escargot Appetizer for her meal counting on the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer to show up.We were pleasantly surprised to see the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer show up.....it was one of our favorite dishes from his old joint and here it was!  It was just as good as we remembered!  The sauce was rich and creamy and the Organic Spinach was fresh and went well with the entire dish.  A few minutes later the Bufalo Caprese Salad arrived....it was a large portion that could have easily been split between 2 people.  The Mozzarella & Tomatoes were fresh and it was A-1 Grade Goodness!For a second glass of wine we ordered a glass of Zinfandel...don't remember the vintage or vineyard.The entrees showed up and I was eager to try the Gnocchi.....it didn't disappoint!  The sweet flavor of the Sweet Potato went perfectly with the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce....I was in Heaven!  Wifey enjoyed her Escargot.....we couldn't believe it was only $9!Overall, we had an awesome time.Will I return?  Hells Ya!I am by no means a "fine dining" type of person. I don't appreciate small plates of food that cost about 30 dollars a plate and you don't leave full. Chef Marc's is definitely not one of those places where you leave hungry, BUT the quality of the food is top notch as well as the service. I left Chef Marc's full, but maybe we should start back at the beginning. It was a busy Saturday night and they had large parties in so they were unable to accommodate us until 8pm, which was fine since we had a late lunch. Walking inside you realize that its a small, but cozy place. There's an area with couches that you can hang out with your friends and drink wine and eat good food. We were seated right away and Chef Marc came up and introduced himself. He told us about the menu and the specials of the evening. The one that caught my attention was the "boooofalo mozzarella", mussels and the uni fettuccine. They were out of uni so that was a no go. We decided to start with the Buffalo Mozzarella. It was delicious! The mozzarella was unlike any other mozzarella (creamy as Chef Marc had described it). The tomatoes were paired perfectly with the cheese. I'm not a tomato person usually, but these tomatoes were pretty dang awesome. The table next to us had ordered the Antipasto salad, so that sold me too. It was a huge heaping portion of awesomeness. I was already a bit stuffed after all that, but I couldn't resist trying the Veal Loin Strip and the Papperdelle Bolognese. The veal caught my eye, but I should remember from now on that I've never had veal that blew me out of this world. The veal was good and paired with kale, but it definitely was not my favorite. I guess not everything can be my favorite. The Papperdelle Bolognese was my favorite though. YUMMY freshly made pasta with yummy meaty tuscan style sauce. I could eat those noodles over and over again. Yum! Chef Marc came by after our meal and asked us how everything was. Our server (sorry he was overpowered by Chef Marc) was very attentive also. With a meal like this we had to have dessert.....one cannoli please. My fiancé had asked about the rum cake and the server was kind enough to give us a complimentary slice. Cannoli filling was delicious! The shell they don't make in house, I thought it was still delicious, but the fiancé thought it should be a tad bit crispier. Rum cake, maybe not my cup of tea but it was still good. Do I love Chef Marcs? Yes....service was awesome, food was great and I left full. For everything that we ordered plus tip, it was a 100 dollars well spent.  I can't wait to be back and ready to try other things. BTW they can "course" out the pasta and "protein" dish if you decide to go the way we did, so that each person can have their own individual plate.Been here several times now for lunch and once for dinner. Found this place while driving in the area. Doesn't look like much from outside but believe me, this place still got me grinning from ear to ear!..Recommendations:Italian Bread with butter (included) - Always fresh and a nice starter every time..Spaghetti Bolognese Pork: Fresh Pasta (made in house), little chunks of sausage, little chopped cubes of carrots and their red sauce.. The pasta was Incredible, sauce was like butter with some aromatic and delicious olive oil  and an excellent balance of tomato sweetness and tart that was sure to more than satisfy!.. Spaghetti Zucchini Pomodoro: Fresh Pasta, thick slices of zucchini, herbs, red sauce.... 99% of the time, I order pasta with some type of meat (meatballs, sausage, beef, chicken..), this time I decided to go meatless.. WOW!!!!! Seriously, this was Beyond Anything I expected.. One of The Best Pasta Anything I've Ever Ate!  Meat Lasagna: Fresh slices of pasta in between layers of meat, sauce, ricotta.. Rich in flavor, got that creaminess to it and definitely filling. Should fill up 2 hungry people and have leftovers.. Rum Cake: Definitely had that rum liqour  fragrance, moistness and taste that will send you off to dessert bliss! Nothing too Fancy, Just Rumtastic!The first time I dined here, I was so impressed that I almost stayed to have dinner right after a late lunch.. Like Back to Back Meals!! Every night, the chef comes in and decides what will be on the menu for that particular night. So next time, So and so dish might not show up again or at least for a while.. The service was great every visit, lunch prices awesome, dinner prices average and the ambiance very comforting and a tad elegant the same time. Aside from the typical bench, table/chair dining, they also got couches/coffee table seating as well. *Most importantly*, Both Spaghetti entrees mentioned above deserve Much More than a 5 Star Praise!!!!! They Really Set A New Standard In My Book: On How Pasta Should Taste Like!!!!!By far one of the best places to grace Las Vegas in a long time. I know that many people talk about the chefs on the Strip, but I purposely avoided that route for my friends bachelor party. At first, people were complaining about how we had to detour from the row of lights to go to dinner, but they quickly shut up after we began our gastronomical journey. Any special occasion can only be made better with a visit to Chef Marc's Parma. I was lucky enough to tag along with some Yelpers and have been hooked on this restaurant ever since. Call in advance and specify that you want to participate in a chef's table. For $50, a five course meal is a steal. An additional $20 more, there is an option for wine pairing. With a week notice, chef will be able to set up a marvelous spread. Long gone are the days where a chef tries to fill you up on bread and cheap ingredients. Chef even got upset that someone had given us bread. I had specified that one friend was allergic to pine nuts and melon. Another to pineapple, almonds, and does not eat pork. Chef said no problem and I was relieved. This was my second chance to experience a meal from this creative genius. He started us off with some sliced prosciutto before our first course. We were in for a real treat when we found out that chef brought out the pizza oven on a Sunday night. Not only did we get a classic margherita but a walnut pesto pizza as well. This was a creative way around our friend's allergy. Then the second course came at us with no warning. A sampler platter of perfectly grilled octopus, shrimp, sausage, and red snapper surrounding a bed of apple salad tossed in a citrus dressing. Already, some were ready to admit that the drive was worth it. Now slowing down, Chef came out again to explain what he had in store for us. Two words: LOBSTER RAVIOLIS! That was our pasta course. The al dente stuffed goodness was filled with the crustacean and came with a marscapone cream sauce. For many, it could have ended here and we would have received a meal worthy of $50. An Italian meal without a protein? Unheard of. Stepping outside of the box to provide us with a truly unique experience, we were presented with Veal Cheek served on polenta with German red cabbage. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was similar to an Osso Bucco sauce. Each component complimented each other so well. By this time we were all stuffed. Yet it did not end there. For dessert, chef sent out a french toast served with fresh bananas and berries topped with a Marsala wine sauce. Ambrosial! Still not enough? The groom to be and I had opted for the wine pairing. I had attended a wine tasting some time ago and came across a beautiful dessert wine that I had nearly forgot about until I took a sip here. Although our waiter prefaced that the wine didn't go with the dessert, I was happy to taste the Donald Ziraldo dessert wine again. At this point, I could not hold it in any longer and had to gloat. BOOYAH! All of the skeptics could eat it, because this meal was sensational.At last I visited Parma with Diane to order off the menu for my first non-group dining experience here.  Parma Salad with arugula, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, black and green olives, walnuts, Parmesan Cheese, tomatoes, and a delicious Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing was very good.  A saucy Neapolitan Margarita Pizza from the outside mobile oven on Pizza Night Wednesday was a nice appetizer, with just a little char on the bottom.  It was tasty but my favorite Margarita Pizza is still the one served at Postrio.  Pasta Fagiola Soup took a long time to reach me from the kitchen, but it was well worth the wait. The homemade broth and long-simmering beans, little tubes of pasta, basil, and tomato with a little bite to it, made this a simple but really classic bean soup!  The beans melted in the mouth, and the soup was even better accompanied by excellent crackling Italian bread and butter.   Nicely pounded veal with a sweet Marsala Sauce and delectable mushrooms had a little kick to it but was delicious, accompanied by a side of handmade bent Penne with Chef Marc's wonderful Sunday Sauce and good baby green beans that were a bit crunchier than I prefer.  Diane's side of Gnocchi made from scratch was also filling and delicious.Service from a very capable and efficient staff was personable and hopping!  I was glad that I had made a dinner reservation, because the restaurant was filled to near capacity when we were there, yet we were seated immediately.  Chef Marc came by and engaged with many of his customers, and near the beginning of our meal brought us complimentary Fried Squash Blossoms that were pleasing dipped in a tasty mild Marinara Sauce also provided.The ambiance of this place is rustic and clearly informal southern Italian.  But when we were present on this night we also seemed to share a special bond with our fellow diners, all of whom were strangers to us.  It seemed like all were repeat customers who looked forward to another memorable meal produced under the direction of the charismatic and talented Chef Marc.  So, an aura of excitement and fellowship was in the air, which added to the overall enjoyment of our dining experience.This will not be our last visit here, for sure!If Chef Marc's were any better it would be on the front lines entertaining the troops, kicking taliban ass, while rebuilding local infrastructure and giving local children education. But wait it doesnt stop there. It would also come home a glorified war hero and help rebuild the American Economy and finally just FINALLY get rid of all today's shitty ass music and possibly resurrect Tupac...Anyway i never been here before but often hear the raves of Chef Marc and how totally awesome is it. Lately i've been hankering for some good Italian food. So i set up a UYE http://www.yelp.com/biz/tien-hosted-a-uye-uye-at-parma-by-chef-marc-las-vegas10 people all going for tasting menus with some opting for wine paring. I'm not exactly a wine kinda guy so just food for me. Tho their italian beers were quite nice.Cant exactly remember what we all ate but it was good. Damn good. If i wore panties they'd be dropped by the 3rd course. Oh and holy crap the bread is NICE!!! with the garlic butter on top and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil...sooooo niceSo going off of memory lets see what we had1 - Conch Salad - Very good texture, soft and not rubbery and oh so tender. Flavor was a little off for me but it opted a good opportunity to use the "real" salt they offered. Balanced quite nicely after that2 - Escargot (our special diet friends who opted not to have escargot got some kind of ravioli) - Two per person served on a slice of bread drenched in garlic butter with some herbs. Not exactly the freshest snails available but they did their best with what they had and it was no less then absolutely delicious 3 - Fried Brussels sprouts with some kind of spicy prawn - I've only eaten brussel sprouts on a handful of occasions. These were halfed then fried to give them a nice flavor. The spicy prawns...wow just wow these were nice and plump and had a mild rising heat to them. Again quite nice4 - Pasta with wild mushrooms in some kinda sauce with ham in it - Pappardelle Wild Mushroom- LoL at my naming of items. This was the highlight of my dinner. The absolute best thing in my opinion. Pretty sure it was fresh pasta seeing as i've never seen noodle that big only on TV. The sauce they whipped up to bind the pork and mushrooms together with the noodles...genius...Ask Christie O i kept trying to steal her togo box the entire night.5 - Some kind of fish... - Wild Snapper Livornese- Some kind of fish and a portion of a barley like grain served with a tomato based sauce and a few strips of broccolini. 6 - Dessert - Turamisu and Chocolate Mousse Cake - Holy crap the little square of Tiramisu was orgasmic. The other chocolate cake thingie was good but holy hell the tiramisu...I have finally discovered Chef Marc's...Now they will have to discover a way to keep me away.Parma is delicious!  We stopped in for dinner and had no idea what to expect. There was seating on either side of the restaurant and then some couches and tables in the middle. We chose to sit at a half booth/table. The meal started off with complimentary garlic bread. I could have been fine with just eating the bread! It was hot, soft and some of the best I have ever had. I let the server know that and I was given a loaf to go at the end of the meal!They have a lunch and dinner menu. The dinner menu is basically salads, soups and pasta. The dishes range in price and the average pasta price was between $12-$18. There were some items on the menu that cost more. I was craving a sandwich and asked if they could make on even though it was the dinner menu.  The server checked and said I could order any of the cold sandwiched but not hot. That was perfect because I wanted a cold anyway. I ordered "The Parma". It had assorted imported Italian meats and cheeses. They have 2 sizes and I chose the smaller one and that was only $6.50! There was no masking the flavor this sandwich offered. The meat and cheeses had such wonderful taste. I will for sure order this again!The inside was very clean and the service was excellent. We would only take a couple drinks of our soda and it was being refilled.On Wednesday nights the server said they have pizza and only on that night. I'm going back to try that next!Parma is one of those places where the food is so good that if it fell on the floor, I'd still eat it. No 10 second rule.No shame.I would legit, scrape everything off of the floor and eat it.Because it would still be better than 90% of the food being slopped around in Las Vegas restaurants, some of which has fallen on the floor without your knowledge.Parma looks like it might be a chain restaurant-the sign is generic and it's in this tiny strip mall, sharing space with a Trader Joe's and a K-Mart, but outside of that, there is nothing generic or conventional about it. Step inside and the setting is kind of romantic with low lighting, intimate seating and a cozy lounge. You'll forget that someone rushing to get toilet paper at K-Mart almost just mowed you down in the parking lot.The food here is something to be celebrated. The menu here is a combination of main staples and specials of the day which keeps things fresh and interesting. More importantly, everything here just tastes like love! Who says that? I just said it! I brought my mom here, the pickiest eater I've ever met besides the 9 year old I nannied for in college, and she had not one complaint. Only the second time this has happened....in my life. On our visit, we had the beet salad which was enough to split between two people. The beets were fresh and we got a variety of colors which made for a pretty presentation. The dressing that came with it was simple but really brought all of the flavors of the salad together. My mom got some kind of cod and I got the pork chop "el chico" which was basically an enormous, quality pork chop with a sweet/hot pepper sauce. Like I said, my mom is the worst dining companion ever because she hates everything, but she  liked her fish so much that she was making audible noises of satisfaction when eating, which was embarrassing and satisfying at the same time. (I love to say "I told you so" when it comes to picking restaurants.)I know some would consider it blasphemy to go to a place like this and not order pasta, but I didn't on my first visit. So when I came back with some friends, I dipped into their pasta selection with chicken riggies, ravioli and wild mushroom papardelle. It was hard to pick a favorite, but because I am partial to meat in my pasta, I was really surprised by how flavorful and complex the papardelle was-so amazing! I've had freshly made pasta before, but Parma has the best execution, cooking the pasta to perfection and not over or under-saucing it.  The staff is friendly and eager to share recommendations. They have a decent wine list and if you have a favorite you'd rather bring instead the corkage fee is only $10! What I like so much about this place is that their non-pasta dishes shine just as much as their pasta dishes- so hard to find when it comes to Italian food.  I'm so excited to have found a place that just loves to make incredible food as much as I love to eat it and can't wait to go back!Having just returned from Italy, I was excited to try Parma; very high yelp ratings, a video explaining how they are so authentic, a passionate chef.  Grab a couple of hungry poker buds, order a ton of food and...Papardelle Bolognese - sheets of perfectly cooked hand made pasta drowned in a thick, meaty, sweet and acidic Bolognese drizzled with olive oil.Me:  "What a waste of really good pasta. It's drowned in sauce".Them:  "This is great.  Lots of meat".Shrimp Fra Diavolo - Large, sweet, properly cooked shrimp with a spicy aribata sauce on pasta with broccolini.Me:  "Why are these on the same plate?  Primi, secondi, and contorno served together?"Them:  "Everything taste so good together"Fiori di zucca (Tuscan classic, batter coated, deep fried zucchini flowers) with marinara sauce?  Me:  "What the?  Marinara sauce?  It's supposed to be served plain so you can taste the sweet, vegetal flower and enjoy the richness of the oil and crunch of the coating".Them:  "Man, these are so good.  The more sauce the better".Authentic Italian? No way!  What's wrong with calling it Italian STYLE cuisine?  Don't misunderstand, I think the food is excellent. Market driven menu that constantly evolves.  Outstanding Italian inspired sandwiches.  The Bologna with a great imported mortadella, provolone and drizzle of red wine vinaigrette that brings out the sweetness of the mortadella and milkiness of the cheese; Excellent.  The Campania  with fresh mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, fresh tomato, and a balsamic vinaigrette; a vegetarian's delight.Good, friendly service.  Trattoria wine list, well chosen simple wines at reasonable prices.Them:  "Are you enjoying yourself?"Me:  "Heck yeah!"  Living life, having a loud, jovial argument about food, kickin it with good company.  Maybe this place is more Italian than I thought.I gave this place five stars originally, as our first visit was tremendous. The food, no matter what, is amazing. The service, however, depends entirely upon one person (Diane).We have been five times. As I say, the first time was amazing... outstanding food, a very inviting atmosphere, and impeccable service from our waitress, Diane.The last four times have convinced us never to enter the restaurant unless Diane is there. The "gentleman" who seems to manage the place during the day time is so aloof and downright rude that you leave the restaurant upset that you gave anyone there any money.On our last dining experience two groups--one on each side of us--both expressed the same sentiments. The staff during the day is horrible, and it affects the entire experience of dining.It is a shame, Chef Marc, that you do not have better people representing your restaurant. Let me say this to you and to everyone considering dining here: if Diane is there, you will love this place. If she is not, you will despise it... despite the incredible efforts of the kitchen staff.I won't be going back for a considerable time, and never during the daytime.I was at Parma once before to enjoy one of Nelson Q.'s UYE with Chef Marc.  This time my wife and I came after a dance program for an early dinner.  In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.By the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorfulFor desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!Tracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group.This is a lunch review, so please bear in mind that they have a lunch menu that is different than the dinner menu!I was having a lunch meeting today on the West side and as my office is on the East side, original plan was to go middle to PF Chang... Hmmm I said, let me see what I can cook up as a  unique dining experience vs. high end Panda Express....Thankfully, a bunch of yelpers have recommended Parma and after reading Rod U's review and everyone's review, I was ready to rock and roll!First thing of course I discovered is that the menu for dinner which most reviewers discussed is not same as dinner.  Here are my thoughts.a.  Location - 4 star - Not bad considering I don't venture in this area.  Easy to get to right off the Summerlin Pkwy Buffalo Drive exit.  Plenty of parking in a nondescript strip mall.b.  Ambiance - 4 star - When I first walked in, it felt more like a deli compared to a restaurant like Nora's or something, but it was both funky and cool at same time. Reminded me of a coffee shop, a deli, a cafe, and a small restaurant all in one.c.  Service - I will say this is 5+ star.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable and very accommodating. They know their stuff and what the kitchen can do, so it makes it very cool to talk about the menu. d.  Menu - 4 star - their lunch menu features a few salads, antipasta, home made pasta, sandwiches both hot and cold, some soups.  I was so eager to try some of the yelping good ideas that I asked our waiter about what specials.  He quickly said that they can whip up some Linguine with Clams and / or Shrimp far diavolo.  We ordered this and some side salads.e.  Food - 5 star - The best thing started when I said, hey since both the pastas are not on the lunch menu, we will try it and can we split it.  Quickly the waiter said that since one was a red sauce and one was white, that it would not mix well and so when we said how about the spaghetti bolognese, he said PERFECT.  I have to say, the waiter, Mark I think handled this just right! Both dishes were fantastic.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and a bit smaller diameter compared to normal spaghetti pasta. I liked the texture and the feel when you were stuffing it all in your mouth.  It had the COMFY feeling!!!  The side salads were recommended and they were the right size and had just a bit of spiciness and it was perfect.f. Je ne sais quoi - 5 star +++ - This place has that "je ne sais quoi" , that "I don't know what" factor. It is the confidence in the kitchen, the knowledge of the staff, the coolness of funky ambiance of the restaurant, the home made pasta.  I am not sure but all of this combined makes for a most awesome experience!I will be coming back for lunch as it is so cool and relaxing.  I am also excited to come fo dinner with my wife as she loves Italian inspired food and so I cannot wait to try the dinner menu.GK says, if you are around for lunch, check this place out!What's good enough for Nic Cage is good enough for me.Have been here twice now, both for lunch.   First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.Well that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  To go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+Refills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.I promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)Called Marc (doesn't deserve the title Chef IMO anymore) tonight to talk about the dinner the other night! He was rude right off the bat and said that other help wouldn't serve us and that he comped he meal! BS!! he gave us the chicken Parma to take home! Didn't come to the table when his under trained staff screwed up a few times!! Wrong food brought tl the table. Etc. I've been there maybe 7-8 times since moving here and only one other time there was an issue with the chicken Parma. But the food wasn't the problem it was that blad so called server screwed up and forgot to put the order in!!! Diana and the Asian server has always been A+!!! The blad guy can go work at mc Donald's!!! But to Marc! I've been raised in family Resturants and know the business much better than you!!! Why did you raise the prices at the pizza joint and start making the pizzas smaller? POOR MANAGEMENT!! Period. YOU NEED TO TSKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR SHORT COMINGS!!! You are a poor business man and just remember Karma boy!!! Now we will go find another place to spend our money at! Bottom line you disrespected me on the phone and will NEVER GO BACK TO YOUR OVER PRICED STRIP MALL PLACE!! Plus I make a better chicken parm also!! And to think I wanted to work at the new place? Now I also see why your turnover at the pizza joint is like it is!!! A POOR BUSINESS MAN IS NOT WHAT ANYONE WANTS TO WORK FOR!!!Believe the hype. I stopped here for lunch with my husband before we continued on with our errands for the day. It is a cozy place with a neighborhood vibe. There is a deli and cheese counter in the front, along with a rack of specialty Italian ingredients and sauces for sale in the back of the restaurant. We actually picked up some stuff there because my sister in law and her husband were coming to visit from Italy and had promised us a home cooked Italian meal.We chose to split the Antipasti salad that was prepared with a generous assortment of meat and cheese from the deli case. The salad was fresh and plentiful for the price of $12.00. We also split the very hearty Italian meat sandwich which only  comes in large (most of the sandwiches you have the option between regular and large). This was a monster of a sandwich with juicy beef, melted provolone and mozzarella cheese topped with pepperocinis. As delicious as it was, I could only handle about quarter of the sandwich. The husband happily annihilated the rest of it. The service was friendly and this made for a perfect break in our busy day.Parma has been one of our favorites for a long time... but now I'm not sure if we'll ever return. This review covers two visits, one in March and again tonight.In March, our food took an hour to arrive and only then because we had started asking what the hold up was. The food was okay, nothing memorable, but the 60+ minute wait was. Because of that, we didn't hurry back.Tonight was 45+ minutes and our order wasn't lost. Our server, Kay, almost totally ignored us the entire time. We had to ask another server for soda refills after she ignored them and us for too long. Kay did ask Hubby if his steak was cooked correctly, which it was, then didn't return until we finally got her attention. My food, a Jidori chicken dish, was inedible. The sauce was good but the chicken was dry and boring. She took it off the bill after I refused to wait another 45 minutes for something else. Hubby's peppercorn steak was abysmal, he said, but we paid for it and got out.One bad experience could be a fluke. Two? Marc must not care about this restaurant any longer.I was browsing the pictures on Yelp before I arrived and all of the pasta dishes looked amazing. I came in on a Tuesday morning, right before noon. When the waitress dropped off the menu, I was incredibly disappointed that the menu was drastically different from what was pictured. Turns out that all the dishes I had my eye on were only served at dinner. To top it off, the dinner menu items are not offered at all during lunch. I ordered the chicken parmesan, which came with a side of spaghetti. The chicken had a tang to it. I wasn't sure if it was a lemony marinade or if the chicken was bad. But I ate it.  The side spaghetti was just ok. I wouldn't order it by itself.I had a taste of my husband's eggplant parmesan and that was a lot better. A little salty for my taste, but better than that funky chicken.I was so excited to try this place for dinner. With reviews like Anthony M's, I had some pretty high expectations. And it started off pretty good... Chef Marc has a fantastic presence and warm welcoming personality. I do really appreciate the personal attention. He comes by all the tables to talk personally to the diners, making recommendations and talk about the food. I loved that! But ultimately I came here to eat. And the food, while it sounded amazing, was just not THAT great. Was the chicken parm good? Yes, it was. And the portion was very generous. All good things, but it was definitely not the best chicken parm I've had in LV. And the side pasta, sad to say, was like chef-boyardee. Chef Marc also initially told us about the black linguini he had that he could make with Linguini and Clams. However, there was no black linguini :( The linguini and clams dish itself was overly salty. Overall, no one was particularly impressed with their dishes. Decor was homey.Service was aaaiiiiight.
American Junkie=I think the fact that...A) my boobs are realB) my style is very untrashy/un-stripperishC) I don't have nappy hair extensionsD) my IQ is higher than my cup size...equates to why I did not care for American Junkie. My friend and I got there around 10:30 on Saturday night and the line was pretty long. Luckily because we were just two girls (the rest of our group was already inside), we got to go to special "girls only" line. Ooooo, how VIP. Luckily one of our friends inside didn't want to stay, so I got my friend and I each a mixed drink to wash down quickly. Mixed drinks are $7 which is typical of OTS.All told, I was at American Junkie for about 20 minutes, but in those 20 minutes...wow, did I do some amazing people watching. The people watching is the only reason I could see to come to this place. I do have three suggestions as a result of said fantastic people watching:1) Guys - put the hair gel down! Seriously most girls think spiked hair is...well...douchey.2) Girls - if you have fake boobs, please don't concave your back to stick your fake boobs out more. We all know they are fake just by looking at them. Sticking them out and then looking at them all night does not make them appear more real.3) Girls - if you are wearing short shorts or a barely there jean skirt, wear a more modest top. We don't need to see boobs and butt; just one is more than enough thanks.I'm only giving this place three stars but I actually like it. I've been many times now so I feel like I can give a pretty good assessment of how it works... Here's the deal: it's trying to be Studio 54 in the 1970s under the guise of table reservations. There are two lines. The lines for the nobodies and groups of dudes (sheepishly raises hand) and the line for the douchy frat brothers of the bouncers and the ladies who blow them or steal blow from them. In fairness, the door guy for the nobody line is pretty cool as he remembered me when I left and came back out of a sea of douchebauchery he'd seen that night and I always have plenty of time to talk to him as I wait, like an asshole. As an aside, I don't have a very high opinion of the typical Scottsdale bimbo/DB. Someday, I'll write about my crazy night with G-girl who has gained a certain amount of dirtoriety on the Dirty.com. To sum it up, I spend the better part of a night with her, save her from a skeazy rickshaw driver and she never asked my name. They are typically very attractive, which is what they focus all of their energy on so it makes sense. But goddamn are they vapid. I find it hard to believe... In fact, I don't believe they're even half as stupid as they try to appear to be but the personal glory they achieve in the Fembot department is completely mind blowing. All body, no soul.Anyway, the line situation they have is made for the cool kids to be cool and the people like me to remember that my place, my home, is in Phoenix, 85003. Represent! Inside, nothing is notable except for the wheel. Girls dance on the bar and spin the wheel. And it's fun to watch because: 1) they have on short skirts 2) if they're wearing pants the chances of them at least being pulled down is high. I'm a cheap thrills guy. And that's a wrap!At least American Junkie is honest. By including the word "junkie" in their title, they let you know up front that they are a manifestation of the word. Also spelled as "junky" this adjective can be defined as - "having the quality (or being like) junk, cheap or of low quality" - and it perfectly describes everything about this place.The laughably long line of people waiting to get in on a Fri/Sat night? Junky.The bouncers? Unbelievably Junky.The patrons you meet once you finally get inside the bar? Junky.The food? Junky.The too crowded bar area? Junky.The wait to get one measly drink? Junky.The service? Junky.The wait staff that is more concerned about their looks than their tables? Junky.The dance floor filled with d-bags and wannabes? Junky.Unfortunately, I've been here more than once (not voluntarily as once was more than enough) and I always have a junky time. I don't like to waste my time doing junky things as Scottsdale has so much more to offer, and I also don't like buying junky things. Basically, it comes down to the fact that I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars at a place that continually promotes a junky atmosphere and junky customer service.Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's, but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business. Like almost everyone else who showed up early, I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate. What I found instead, was that the management lied, (they even admitted it to our faces), and guys were now $20 to get in. (girls would be $10 after 10)Half our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs, coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long. Am I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer? Maybe. I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons. They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway. WHY?? Why was I even there and why did I give them my business? Never again.Oh, and the inside was packed like sardines. They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right, getting a drink was hopeless, and bathroom lines were a half hour long. People were hopping the fence to get in, sick and tired of the line outside. But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anyway.We stayed till midnight, thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website, and pass out flutes of champagne. Nope.This would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix. I know it's just a bar, but honestly people, we need to hold places accountable for deception. My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined... and half our party left, fed up with the situation.Don't go to American Junkie... it is just that, junk.
Hon Machi=I love Teppanyaki. It is always good fun and usually good food. I have been to several different places and I some how always end up back at the "B" because other places just don't compare. The cook that we had was just okay. He rushed cooking our meal and was mumbling the whole time. It sounded like he was trying to be entertaining but his voice was so low that you could barely hear him because the fan for the grill was so loud. Before we knew it the food was all cooked and he was on his way.  I overheard him tell another table he works there 6 days a week. It was probably his Friday so he was ready to go home. As for the food...I must say that the miso soup and salad they serve prior to you main meal was excellent. The dressing in the salad was super good (I mean pick up the bowl and drink the dressing good).  The filet and shrimp for my main course was just right. He was right on with how I like my steak, juicy. They also serve veggies which is a mixture of mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, broccoli, onions and zucchini. I don't like how the serve it all together, I would prefer them separate so I can tell them what I don't like otherwise it's wasted food. The fried rice that I paid an extra 2.50 for was horrible. It was mushy and devoured with soy sauce. I don't like that I pay extra money for something that turns out to be botched. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. She gets a gold star. Overall, this place has potential. Maybe I'll try another cook next time.
Sushi Bomb=Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, I wanted to find a different place to eat sushi for evening other than my usual sushi bar.  Since this place is somewhat near our house, we stopped in for an early dinner.The bar area is quite nice, overall decor very comforting and natural.  I loved the fact that the place was basically all ours for the hour we were there.  The menu is great--simple and with some great options done differently.  Their amaebi, for example, includes the deep fried fish heads along with the two pieces of sushi.  I personally love sucking on a few shrimp heads, because that's where all the flavor is.  It was great.We ordered all the yakitori skewers, 4 types, and it came with 2 skewers each.  Thinking they were the small yakitori, we didn't think it would be a lot to order for dinner. Oh my.  These skewers are pretty big, so majority of our dinner were the appetizers.  It was great!  The sauce was yummy and the meats were cooked well.  As for the shrimp ones, I didn't eat the shrimp.  I feel that shrimp should ALWAYS be cleaned because that black line is poop, and I don't eat poop.  That was a no-no for me, and therefore a deduction of 1 star on my review.As for the rest, we tried their sushi, all perfectly portioned and the fish was great.  Their sauces are very good at this restaurant, everything from their cucumber salad, tempura dip, to the sauce they put on their yellowtail.  Oh and their tempura is crispy and light, too.  We loved it.I think this place, despite its location being right next to the 215 on W. Cheyenne, is a really good sushi bar.  We plan to go back this week to try the rest of the menu.  If you want a road trip within city limits, try this place.  I know that they serve the same special rolls as any other sushi bar, but their sauces and talent make for a great night.  Plus their website says that it's 20% off after 9pm to midnight.  Great sushi, excellent service, and I'll definitely be back for more.Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything. Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions. Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message! Im still trying to get the hang of eating sushi! Thanks Sushi Bomb for being gentle!I came back to edit my post. I had an extremely negative comment about how they had a waiter that was mean to the customers and that I wouldn't be returning because of his service. However, since then they have fired that waiter and the restaurant has done a complete 180.They have always had good food, no one every doubted that, but their service was rude. Now the service is great and you can actually enjoy the food! Sometimes the rolls can be a little too big and hard to eat, but my boyfriend asked if they could make them a little smaller so they were easier to eat and they happily did, it came out with more pieces that were smaller so it was the same amount of food. I'm sure we'll be back a lot because they are extremely close by and we do love their sushi, and now that they have fixed the service issue nothing gets in the way of enjoying that food. Highlight: lunch special all you can eat is only $20. :D
Bantu Bistro=Want to visit Africa in Phoenix? Head to 7th Ave. and Campbell for authentic West African food in a small and warm setting.Located in what could have been any one of countless styles of restaurant before becoming Bantu Bistro, this intimate eatery offers African fare that is accessible to even the most timid eaters.For starters, Bantu offers hot wings, tomato fried chicken and one other chicken dish that I cannot recall. The remainder of the menu is comprised of a variety of African stews and meat dishes that can be made with goat, chicken or beef. I had the groundnut stew (basically spicy peanut soup) with goat (per our lovely waitress's recommendation) and was not disappointed. With my stew, I chose a side of fufu (basically a mix of potatoes and cornmeal that tasted something like instant mashed potatoes without enough milk). When i put some of the soup on top of the fufu for flavoring, it became more enticing (nevertheless I might order the potatoes, rice or plantains for a side if I were to return). The goat, if you have never enjoyed this meat, was something like a tougher version of lamb. The Bistro does not list any desserts on its menu, but I did not inquire about it either. I have difficulty remembering anything on the menu that was more than $9. My friend and I had two stews with goat, a starter of tomato fried chicken and two imported beers. Our total, with tax, came to $33.Service was attentive and friendly. Upon leaving, the chef/owner (who has lived in the Valley for a number of years after moving from Africa) greeted my entire party, shook our hands and promised to provide us with a special treat (some sort of beans, he said) upon return. I'll be looking forward to it!I was really excited to try Bantu Cafe's West African food in the location of the former Melrose Cafe. It is a charming little place, outdoor seating, brightly decorated with traditional African art and sculptures decorating the walls and shelves. A stereo places African pop and Reggae. The menu consists of meats, chicken, goat, lamb, oxtail, available in curry or a tomato like sauce with mixed vegetables. You get your choice of sides like garlic potatoes, fufu, plantains or rice. The meat in the dishes can be substituted if one is so inclined. There are vegetarian options as well, being a traditional African cuisine, since meat is not always available and something we Westerners take for granted.They serve traditional soups, appetizers and sides as well as the entrees.The staff (one waitress) and owner were both warm and friendly.All in all, it was a good experience and good food. I wouldn't say great, but good. It is definitely worth trying and experiencing. I will be back again.I'm almost always game for an adventure in my mouth, so it was with much anticipation that I attended a UYE at Bantu Bistro. Fifteen of us ended up showing, which is a) a great turn-out and b) potentially disastrous, both for those of us eating and those preparing/serving the food. BB is my Little Engine That Could, because faced with that challenge our servers remained calm and courteous. Upon reading the menu, I immediately knew I was going to get the goat because I've not had goat before. And since I've also never eaten West African food I threw caution into the wind. While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, the first wave of us ordered drinks, as we are prone to do. We ended up finishing off some of the choices (beers, mostly, that weren't stocked to accommodate a large drinking crowd*) . By the time our full crew had arrived, I think that 2 or 3 beer choices were off the list. So, on the the eats. Now, keep in mind there were 15 people there, and we pretty much ordered something different off the menu, all of which include the "African spices." Each entree comes with one meat (chicken, goat, ox tail, shrimp...) and two sides (fufu, rice, potatoes and plantains). We were served complementary fried plantains with a lovely dipping sauce. Our entrees came fairly close to one another, however my goat was prepared as curried instead of plain. But that's okay, because it was good. While nothing in the flavor jumped out and smacked me in the throat, I have to admit that I over season and heavily salt everything and a lifetime of this has desensitized my taste buds. Authentic ethnic foods don't always have an explosion of flavors but rather rely on letting more subtle flavors mingle in the palatte. Sounds like a lot of moaning for achieving four stars, one might say. To which I would call as my justification: == I was rather full by the time I was half through my entree == free hot beans were brought to use during our meal. While I cannot recall the name of these, they had a peculiar and interesting flavor. I wanted more salt on them but I want more salt on everything--I have to trim that back in my diet == Graciousness is never overrated. The staff and the owner all were appreciative of our business and thanked us several times throughout the evening. == We pretty much took over the dining area and I didn't feel like the staff were concerned about that. == They broke down our bill without adding a gratuity fee, as is customary at most places for large parties. I'm looking forward to returning in a while and hopefully the stocking issue will be resolved and I will have educated myself more on the intricacies of truly authentic African food and flavors. Until then, I wish BB the best of luck and keep up the good work. ____________________________________________ * I personally feel that while the libations of an eating establishment are important--sometimes equally to that of the food--it's also understandable that a newer establishment would chose to emphasise its entree delivery. For this, I can look past the alcohol stocking issue.i will not even pretend to know what west african food tastes like. i read a blurb about what countries west africa encompasses and how southern cooking has heritage from west african cooking.  next i'm not from the south so i will not pretend to know what good southern food is either. lastly from looking at what countries west africa is i can say on a positive note the chef/owner still has all his limbs and was more then likely NOT from Sierra Leon. that's only my speculation really..he might have been a lucky guy.so again not knowing what good west african Cuisine i will not go into some sort of diatribe about how authentic it was or how it was shit because "i lived in west africa for a period". what i had i felt was a good meal. i left full and happy. i was part of a large party of yelpers who in a way sprung ourselves upon the helpless gazelle that is Bantu Bistro like that hungry Lion which is Yelp. the party was about 15 people give or take a few and people started showing up around the designated 6:30 agreed upon meeting time. drinks orders were taken..albeit a bit shaky to start with, the gentlemen who served us seem way out of his comfort zone and was not aware of what beer or wine was available..and since there was no drink menu we all felt that we kinda just had to wing it on beverage requests.after a while of getting all the drinks requested and everyone finally showing up. we all browsed the menu, asked whatever questions we could come up with and settled on our meals. the server took our orders and again..made the best of the situation.about 30 minutes later everyone was chatting each other up and food started to come out. here and there of "who ordered the (insert dinner)" or "which meal did you have" "who had (insert side dish)" finally it seamed as everyone had food in front of them and people started to eat. i ordered the curried Goat with a side of FuFu and Plantains..now i'm not really sure what the hell FuFu is, but all i could think of was Cream of Wheat from a box i had as a child. it was good with my meal, but absolutely tasteless on its own. which i'm not sure how your supposed to eat it anyways. i liked the curried goat. it was basically a stew of goat meat and some vegetables in a curry sauce. not exactly a pantheon of flavors and it certainly was not spicy. but i found it to be comforting and made me feel good inside. plus it's not often i get to eat goat. so the new experience put a smile on my face.i cannot in fairness rate my experience on the service. they were clearly overwhelmed with the size of our group and the business seems like they are still on training wheels. as the only people in the restaurant for the majority of our stay we did have full attention of the staff which was attentive. thank you. thank you Dottsy for the UYEit was nice to meetBaconRobert MHeather CTerry TMaggie (husband Eric)Scott WJason WDavid SBit was nice to see againJulie PMatthewAyeshaKevin (after dinner)and of course Dottsyi honestly hope this place does well. this building has seen way too many tenants fail. i would like to see one success.  good luck Bantu. Sincearly, Arik.PS. the average meal price was $11. so really not that unreasonable. thumbs up.To say our group from Yelp overpowered this small place would be an understatement.  It is not designed for large groups and I think we would have better served ourselves to have ordered in small groups as we arrived and had the food come out in that fashion than try and get all the orders on the table at once.  Part of a UYE is the camaraderie so I am pretty sure staggered serving would not have been a big deal and the food would have been hotter when it arrived.  As it was none of us had a clue what it was supposed to taste like so judgmental we were not.  I had curry goat stew, fufu and rice.  I got the impression this was common folk food, you make a base and toss in what vegetables and meat you have that week.  Sort of like the West African version of comfort food.Our experience from the owner and staff was very positive in my opinion.  Dottsy had made reservations and they had apparently brought in an extra server for the evening.  At one point early it appeared somebody had ordered a drink they were short on ingredients for or maybe the kitchen ran out of something and one of the servers dashed off to the store.  The owner/cook and his staff were bending over backwards to fill every reasonable request.  When the owner was out on the floor you could just feel his enthusiasm for what he was doing.I got out of there feeling full and well taken care of and with a beer, tax and tip I only spent $20.  While I do not think this will be a food often eaten by anybody I know, it and the service should bring enough people in to keep the place open.  One word of caution; if you drive a full sized pick up you can get boxed in if you don't pay attention in advance as to how you are going to get out.You've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? Here's the deal, it would be very easy to come to a place like this and be totally underwhelmed. The flavors and cooking style of West Africa are not very well known to 99.9% of us. The little things like an unhelpful menu and a mediocre wait staff could guarantee a 1 star review for most reviewers. On the other hand they get points for being unique, owner operated, and it was pretty fun to try some food completely different. I mean goat and ox tail, now really, how often do you see that on a menu? The plantain starters were pretty basic, but a nice start. I had the ndole, which I guess was something like an odd version of creamed spinach with chunks of goat in it. ---It tasted better than I described, trust me. The fufu was a let down, that was a close to eating just flower and water. I mean zero flavor. So if you let your guard down, chill out, and want to try some wild and crazy food then I say do it. Other wise stay home and save your scathing one star reviews for Olive Garden.I was a little nervous about what to expect.   I couldn't tell you where west Africa is on a map unless you pointed out east Africa first, much less hazard a guess about the cuisine.  But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.I was with the large group of Yelpers last night.  And let's face it, we can be a difficult bunch to please sometimes.  We can also be a difficult bunch to serve, especially in a small shop such as Bantu that is probably not used to  a crowd such as ours.  Drink orders were a little tricky.  They ran out of several of the beer options.  I believe they only had once choice for red wine.  I had that, and I was disappointed that it had been refrigerated.     However, it was clear that their focus is on the food, not on the libations, and I appreciated that they were able to offer alcoholic beverages.Although one of the servers was unfamiliar with the menu, I was impressed that Bantu actually brought in an additional server to accommodate us.  The staff was so welcoming, and the owner not only cooked his heart out for us, he paid us a visit as well.  I never once felt we were an inconvenience as I have at other events.  The complimentary fried plantains were served with a spicy chili sauce that nicely balanced the sweet, tender plantain.  I opted for the traditional groundnut stew with chicken.  It was a tomato-based stew with mixed vegetables in a rich and nutty sauce, very satisfying.  I was not a fan of the  fufu which I believe was mashed yams and corn.  It reminded me of grits.  I did try a few other bites of my neighbors' dishes and enjoyed them as well.Upon leaving, we were able to just tell the server what we ordered and pay separately.  I thanked her for taking the time to allow us to do this and for coping with the crowd.  She remarked "we love this, it's like a big family."  That is reason enough for me to say, "yay, I'm a fan."
M & M Chicken and Waffles=I cannot believe there is only 1 other review of this place. Chicken & Waffles people come on.I was looking for something different last Sunday morning and I remembered seeing this place on MLK.I would agree with the other reviewer about the parking, small awkward and hard to get in & out.It's a small diner with a booth along the entire front wall and several tables. A sign reading "seat yourself" greets you the moment you walk in.The place is small but cozy with a TV in the center so every seat in the house can see it,There is was only 2 servers and a large table there when I arrived so it took a few minutes to get drinks&menus.The menus said stright up "Just Chicken & Waffles"-and thats exactly what it was 2pc-3pc-dark,white,wheat,buttermilk,wha do you want.In small print across the bottom it read "Friday-Sunday BBQ Ribs $10"I asked and she said"nope,chicken & waffles"Well I got 2 breast,2 waffles and my son got the special 3 wings & a waffle.The food came out real fast with hot syrup on the side and we doused our chicken in some hot sauce & tore it up.Why have I never had this before, I bet I never even took a breath.Some of the best chicken I have had. Not all deep fried & greasy or steroided out just sweet crispy & very savory.And the waffles were good too. what a mix.This is a true dive spot DIAMOND!
California Pizza Kitchen=Located inside the airport in Las Vegas.This place was okay... people just sitting and having drinks, Dave's mom and dad got some beer and wine and we chatted.The place wasn't super busy, and I didn't notice any servers. Considering this is inside the airport it is a tad pricey.For the love of God would they please close this disaster of a restaurant and open up something like a Chick fil -A or even a McDonalds. A Waffle House would be an upgrade! Yeah, it's that bad. Most airport food options suck, but this place is at the top of my airport suck list!Service that is as slow as a tree sloth. Really, don't bother unless you have at least an hour to kill before boarding time. The other week when I was waiting for my flight and had 45 minutes it still was not enough time to eat here, and I had taken a seat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Um, nope! Even at the bar the service was slow, and I had to end up getting the bbq chicken salad I ordered to go so I could catch my flight. Good thing I looked in the bag because they gave me the wrong meal on top of that. I had to wave someone down to quickly give me the right meal and I ran to my gate barely making the plane. Ate on the plane and the salad was barely passable.As far as a California Pizza Kitchen goes there is not that much healthy here to eat, and a salad is the closet thing on the menu. Seems pricey too. Along with the super slow service this is one to avoid!Had 60 min to kill in terminal D, so to CPK it was! The place has a bunch of bar seats and has a gigantic window facing the runway, so no windowless, lonely, eating in the dark for you, Champ! The menu isn't a full CPK menu and everything feels a bit lazy (I'm not sure if they have a full kitchen), but it's better than eating Johnny Rockets before you pack yourself on a 500MPH flying tube. Picked up a pesto chicken 'wich which was passable and a Stella that wasn't from a skunk tap. Can you really ask for more in an airport? Oh, yea, I guess you can, but this isn't so bad either.
Fat Boy=Finally gave this place a try after driving by it numerous times and joked about eating there.  And then it happened. Fat Boy is a tiny little restaurant that is hidden in East Las Vegas. The place seats about 15 people - it definitely has this homey, only-for-locals kind of feel to it. I had a guacamole cheeseburger with fat fries, and the boyfriend had a chicken burrito with chencho fries.  I was half expecting the food to be overrated, but I was amazed at how fresh my burger was!  And how much I love my fries!!! I ADORE FAT FRIES!!!  The fries have these seasonings on them that just make them super yummy!  And they were FAT and huge!  The Chencho fries were covered with a green salsa and onions and cheese; it was yummy enough - a bit fattening though. I have suggested to return to this place numerous times after the first encounter, and that is pretty rare for me.  Enjoy!My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!WHAT WE HAD:-Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick!-Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger!-Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUMWHY: You will not be disappointed!!*NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!After reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a photo of a dripping Cheese Boyger, I was eager to try the food at this little eatery.  I took along Diane, another male friend who is always game to try a new top burger, and his burger-loving wife.  Even though the establishment wouldn't make any burgers medium rare, all of us were very satisfied with our burgers.  My Cheese Boyger with everything featured a quarter-pound beef patty prepared medium well, cool pickles, lettuce, a large slice of fresh tomato, relish, mustard, chipotle mayonnaise, and melted American Cheese on a soft bun, and I added some available Heinz Tomato Ketchup.  There was little American Cheese inside but the burger was still quite tasty.  I also enjoyed Chencho Fat Fries that contained chopped chicken, Green Sauce, and melted Mozzarella Cheese spread over the fries.  I noted that the soft fries themselves absorbed some liquid from the other ingredients.But I was really most impressed with my Wet Boyrrito with Beef, Red Sauce & Beans on the inside, and Mozzarella Cheese and Green Sauce on the outside.  This was one of the best burritos I have had outside of Southern California.  The Green Sauce was real good and zesty but not too spicy, small cubes of steak inside had a grilled flavor, the beans were small and tasty, and some of the Mozzarella Cheese melted nicely on top of the fairly large burrito.  I will likely come back for this.So, while the Cheese Boyger and Chencho Fries did not blow me away, the Wet Boyrrito was a nice surprise.  And, I liked that the friendly cooks were willing to prepare a Boyrrito just as a diner would like it (e.g., with or without rice, beans, beef, or chicken, and with Red Sauce, Green Sauce, or no sauce).The place is a small and unassuming storefront situated in the middle of a strip mall.  But it is comfortable enough, and free refills are allowed for fountain soft drinks.  Above all, the freshly prepared food is excellent, which should count the most.  I, too, am now a fan!  4-1/2 Stars!All these other burger spots getting love and I realized I've never reviewed Fat Boy. Four juicy solid stars. The only reason to drive to this side of town is for this damn burger and fries. Chencho Fries that is.Location: Shit location in a shit part of town. I don't care. I think I'm tough even though I am a short white girl who cries at Kodak commercials. Get real. Any neighborhood could be bad at any given time of day. This place is JUST FINE. The burgers taste like a backyard burger straight off the grill done RIGHT. Perfectly seasoned and the patty is not smashed or too thick. Both my biggest complaints about a burger. They don't even call it a burger because it's so cool. They call it a Boyger. Yeah boyeee! It's really nothing fancy, but it's exactly and I mean exactly how I like my burger. Please don't come here if you are expecting fancy. This sure ain't no supper club.The fries. I swear the Chencho fries deserve MAD love. Like Quentin Tarantino movie love. Uma could order them and be eating them and then BOOM a huge ass ninja fight! Or cowboy zombie fight! I don't care, but some fight with the fries and the green chile sauce and melted cheese flying through the air in slow motion. I wouldn't wait for Redbox for that shit. Do it proper if you order these. You have a choice: Thin or thick fries. I went with thin and asked for exra crispy to hold up with the toppings cuz that's how I roll. PROPER FUCKING FRIES, SON.Okay, I'm done. Just make the drive because it's cheap, it's real and even though I only went once I have thought about going about 100 more times....Dont you just love the bookmark feature?It's lunch time so I check my bookmarks and what do you know? Fat Boy is right down the street. So off I go!As I come in I hear Mexican music playing in the background. While looking at the menu on the wall, the lady behind the counter greets me in Spanish. I dont blame her cuz I kind of look like im Mexican. For a second there I almost ordered Al Pastor tacos. LOL.So I ask the nice lady what was good since it was my first time. She said to go with the combo of the single Boyger, Chencho Fries and Small Drink. CHEN WHAT? She smiles at me and says, "Chencho Fries: Your choice of fat or skinny fries topped with cheese, chicken bits, and a green sauce." Ok! Combo it is!I take a bite of the Boyger. I had to do a double take. Am I at Fatburger or Fat Boy? It tastes just like theirs but I paid 6 bucks and some change instead of 10 bucks or more. Now that I can get with. As for their Chencho fries, its basically an enchilada but with potato sticks instead. What I found out was that you should eat it right away because it tends to get soggy over time and it doesnt matter if you get it with fat or skinny fries. So if you are into green sauce, this will sure hit the spot!Besides burgers, these guys have wings, chicken fingers and pizza. Not to mention sandwiches, boyrritos, and combination plates. Their pizzas must be good because when I was eating my food, this lady comes in and picks up 5 pizzas to go. The minus 1 star is for their location. They are situated in one of many suites of one big building. The part of town they are in is kind of suspect. I can only assume what characters may come out at night. Some random info: They take cards and from what I noticed, there is no minimum. They have a decent soda fountain so you should be able to get your refills' worth. They got I would say about 6 small tables so if its packed, dont let it discourage you. You can always take it to go. There is a bathroom but you have to ask and then walk through the kitchen towards the back. Kind of awkward if you ask me but if you gotta go, you gotta go!So whenever I have a Fatburger craving, im yelling out "Fat Boy!" because nobody  wants to eat at "Skinny Boy".Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.This is my new favorite place to eat. If you like pastrami then get your butt over here now and get some. The Pastrami Boyger is great but the pastrami sandwich on its own is just brilliant. It isn't "The Hat" but it will damn do! The owners are super cool and make everything when you order it. The guy is pretty nice about customizing orders too. You can call your order in for pick up or eat inside. They have a pizza special that costs just over $5 and it tastes great. My wife ordered some of their Chencho Fries and we ended up sharing it because I liked it. It is simple but the green sauce and cheese taste great on them. You can't beat the cheap prices for the quality you get here. What are you waiting for? Get over here and try something... just save some pastrami for me!Fat Boy is AWESOME!  Yep, that about sums it up in a nutshell!  Haven't been there yet?  Well, pack you bags and take a trip to the East side of Vegas for some tasty grub.  Here's why I am a big fan of Fat Boy:1. The vastness of the menu! This joint has something for everyone.  They have burgers, pizza, chicken, and Mexican food all on their menu.  If you an't find something you like on the menu, you are definitely missing out!2. The burgers (boygers) are yum-tastic! I  They are all super tasty and some of the best I have had in town.  They are also a great deal for the price point.  $3-5 for a freshly made burger is a-ok in my book!3. The fries are great!  They have the thick, steakhouse stye fries.  A regular order comes with a fun season salt mix on them that tastes great.  You can also try their chencho fries that are covered in a green chili sauce and cheese.  They are a fun dish to chow down on for sure.4. The prices are fantastic.  Your money definitely goes a long way here.  You can get a yummy lunch and be full all day for under $10 out the door.  They also have family deals like 4 burgers, 4 fries, and a 2 liter of soda for $18.  Not to shabby.  I always love great food for cheap.Bottom line, I really enjoy Fat Boy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty lunch.  If you are on that side of town, go check them out to make your belly happy!FYI, it is in a small strip mall and you may drive right past it.  You have to be on the look out for it.  It's on the NE corner of Stewart and Lamb.Another hidden treasure on the east side! #yes (I know, hashtags are pointless on here). Anyway, my boyfriend and I shared chencho fries, 8 wings (1/2 bbq 1/2 hot), and a pastrami boyger. Between 2 people this can really fill you up! Pastrami boyger: soooo so good. What I love most is you can taste the quality (no copyright infringement intended, in-n-out) because they use fresh foods & are made to order. Chencho fries: pretty yummy. I would recommend an add on or two. Their options are bacon, ham, or egg. Pastrami would probably be bomb on there. I'm still pretty satisfied with it though. Wings: I'm not crazy about their wings but I like that the hot sauce is actually hot & their bbq is pretty flavorful. At least you know there's no steroids in the chicken so that's always good.Overall verdict: definitely worth the price & then some. One of the very few good food spots on east side Vegas :) Also! Bernie provided us the greatest customer service. So you're fortunate if he's working when you check this place out.
Les Enfants Terribles=So, we went to ride up to a near by resto to pick up a friend after work, (3 doors down), and decided to stay in the area for some food and a few drinks for it was a beautiful Sunday in the summer of montreal.  And that does not last long so one has to take advantage of such situations.  Just one humble man's opinion, and for the record, i randomly met this man, and found out that he was not that humble.  Anyways, it has a proper setup, and an aesthetically pleasing feel.  And having been involved in rest's that is such an important tool for your business.  Inside was on point along with the the terraces, and yes, they have two, one smoking, well, i should not have to name the other..  Best dish that was brought to the table was a lamb burger with goat cheese and of course normal burger garnishing and was "fantastic", NOT SURE IT WAS WORTH $18, but was very good.  The server was really nice and accommodating, for example, upon the delivery of the desert, some ice cream, the runner presented a bowl with one tiny scoop in it which was $3.  When she quickly appeared to check on satisfaction 'i guess', more likely what is about to happen-happens every time this is ordered from the menu, i said, "well, i ordered a $3 bowl of ice cream and they brought me a bowl with a small scoop of butter in it", BUT WITH A SMILE, i do recognize she is not in charge of portions and serving sizes.  But she got a huge laugh, and took it and brought it back with a two more scoops.  So a $1 a scoop, A WIN-WIN, for all parties involved.  Two more scoops for a good laugh.  All in all, had a great time, and will definitely go back.  The only drawback was they kept bringing us menu's literally one after another, with no acceptable cadence to menu delivery.  With all the menus in front of me i thought i was a student at the library writing a research paper when most of them did not apply for the time of the visit.  BUT, i must say, if you are in the area on a wonderful day, definitely, "make it happen"!!!!!!...side note, they have the best looking iced coffee i have ever seen, and i don't even drink coffee!!!!!!
Chicago Gyros=I stopped by Chicago Gyros for a late lunch today... I ordered a large Greek Salad to go.  And then while I was at it, I added on an order of hummus and an order of baba ghanoush.  I figured those would come in as handy appetizers since we had company tonight, and I was right!The salad was fresh and tasty.  It was a decent sized portion of lettuce topped with tomatoes, onions, red pepper, cucumber, feta, pepperoncini, and kalamata olives.  Note that I said pepperoncini not pepperoncinis - sadly, there was only one!  I ate my entire salad along with some of the fresh pita they sent me home with...And later tonight, I put out the hummus and baba and it worked out well too.  I was more a fan of the baba than the hummus, however.I noticed that their menu is pretty large - you can order everything from salads and vegetarian wraps, to gyros, Mediterranean pitas, burgers, fish and chips, and pizza puffs.  They also do affordable catering.While this place didn't wow me, it didn't turn me off either... I'm sure I'll be back - especially for the price, selection, and location.
Tio Freddys Mexican Food-Jalapenos=To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought "strip mall Mexican, need to check this out".  The place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.The food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.This is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos.
Yo Rita=If it weren't for the rude owner of this place I would have given it four stars based on the bartender and ambiance. We were greeted by the owner with hostility, not seated when a table opened up because "we asked too many times if the table was ready" and she actually told us to leave because she couldn't care less either way. To top it off, every time she walked by us when we were standing at the bar she made a snide comment about us sticking around. The bartender apologized to us a thousand times for her behavior (he said he finds himself doing this a lot) but I will never go back to this establishment. Simply awful.
Tru Burger Co.=First of all I will say the place itself is nice, and our server was very pleasant. That being said, nothing edible was worth the price. This place is insanely overpriced for the quality of food you get. If you want to spend the money go anywhere else but don't go here for the food.There are bugs in the restaurant.. Windows are disgusting! Floor looks like it is falling apart. Employees gossip about other employees in front of customers! Burgers are never cooked how they are ordered! Horrible restaurant!!!! Also just received a B rating from health department.Owner Wael, comments on every bad review saying that it is a fake review! Yes I was employed with him, I QUIT, he refuses to pay me for time worked and is now blackmailing me by saying he will release my personal information. But everything in my review is 100% true! And all of his other bad reviews were posted by others, not myself.
Jana's Bakery & Deli=This bakery has been here a while now. I did not stop in until a couple of days ago. I can not speak on the deli aspect of it, I did not get any meats. I did however ask for one item that in on the menu. I was told this is a special order item. Well then state it as such. So I got a poppy seed something or other. It was dough with poppy seed shaped in to a roll. One personal sized lemon cake and an eclair. The poppy seed doohickey had no flavour, I mean nothing. The eclair was pretty bland and tasted as less than stellar ingredients were used. The lemon cake was so bad it was trash canned after one bite. So I can honestly say I have had better. Arizona has a hard time with good bakeries. The bakery it self felt bordering on depressing. I could not stay there for long.
Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill=Quite possibly the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. Not only was it gross, but they charge extra for bacon and cheese. So for $15, you get a greasy tortilla filled with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese product. Oh, and a gracious helping of sour cream on top. Bleh!Service was fine - my waiter was perfectly pleasant. But the prices and quality were pretty offensive.Maybe I'd come back for a margarita or chips and salsa? Def not for breakfast!Typical bar & grill type fare, but here you will be entertained/mystified by a never-ending rotating slideshow of images of the great Sammy Hagar, from his solo days to Van Halen to his slow melt into obscurity, lending his name to generic restaurants around the globe Guy Fieri-style.  Burgers, wings, sandwiches, quesadillas.  The sole salad choice is of the Southwestern chicken variety.  Vegas hangover food while you wait for your flight, and nothing more.  The service is decent and they have a full bar.My traveling mate had a Bloody Mary and I enjoyed a mimosa; I did not enjoy dropping $30 for those two items.Save your money and hit the Wendy's next door. I certainly wish I did.This place is awful!  I rarely say that but it really was!  Our flight was delayed so we decided to hit up Sammy's for a quick meal.  There wasn't any signs so we seated ourselves.  Immediately we were approached saying that kids cannot sit in the bar area (I felt very far from the bar btw) and we had to sit upstairs.  Upstairs???  A foot away and up a 6 inch step up.  Um I beg to differ on the stairs comment.  But whatever we will go with it.  We get seated and order a couple drinks.  We weren't super hungry so we shared the Chips with Guacamole and a Burger with fries.First off, the chips were straight up obvious out of a bag...and cold and stale.  The salsa and guac had to have been from a jar because I couldn't imagine them making anything homemade here. Both totally bland but we ate about half of it.  Definitely a disappointment.  The burger was a "build your own" and we ordered it with carmelized onions $1.50 and jack cheese $1.50.  There was like two strings of onion (for that price?) but the burger was ok overall.  The fries were cold.  The best part was this coleslaw on the side that looked like they got it out of the gutter.  It was yellow-brownish and literally the serving was the size of a tablespoon.  We laughed at how small the serving size was...maybe they didn't want us to get us sick?!!  So gross.The wine and the "Can't Drive 55" drink both $13+ were a bit overpriced.  Ya think?  I know I know-its airport mark ups.  What do you expect?  I wasn't picky - I was going on a mini vacay!I think the whole time we were there we only heard one Sammy song.  I definitely will choose somewhere else the next time.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten from the airport until now.  Sammmay!  This place is a hot mess.  A definite need for some tender loving care and some pride in your food.BTW I have been to his Cabo Wabo on the strip and have always been happy with everything I've ordered there.
Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery=The whole trend of cupcakeries seems really bourgeois.  It's about as awesome as buying a $4.50 cup of coffee.Anyway, the cupcakes are NOT that special. They seem dry, and the buttercream has that taste of being made with shortening, rather than butter.  At $2.50 each, I'd honestly rather spend my money on a duncan hines mix and make 2 dozen at home.Brought my Aunt and Uncle here from out of town. The restaurant is a fun place and very kid friendly. My two nieces were with as well. We were seated by a small children's play area that they have. It was so nice to have something to keep them occupied with and busy so they didn't get anxious about food not coming right away.There are SO many choices on the menu! almost too many. I found myself finding something that sounded tasty and not looking at the rest of the menu *sigh* choices are just so hard.I was very happy with my choice. I got the Daisy Cod. It was a panko crusted cod sandwich with a very tasty aioli and slaw, it was FANTASTIC! Everyone else in our party got something different and everyone LOVED the food.  A very kid friendly place with tasty local foods.
Vinery 214 Bistro=I hate saying this about any venue that opens in CenPho but this experience was just HORRIBLE!Now granted this was the first day of their soft open but the food prepared by the self professed "Celebrity Chef" was not good ... not even a little.We had two tapas ... the first was the potatoes where were mini and most of them were undercooked and hard. They were not good.We also had Lobster Cakes were were had an extremely intense taste (that I didn't like) and that taste completely drowned out the Lobster. One of the cakes was even cold in the middle.I also had a steak that was under cooked and in no way a great piece of meat (chewy and a strong line of tough fat running through the entire piece).The place is EXTREMELY small and because of that the tables are WAY to close together ... and nearly impossible to navigate without bumping into the people next to you.I'm just sooooo sad that this place was a fail for us.Fine, because I'm tired of this place having such a high rating from fake reviews, I'm going to review my attempt to eat there.We went by last week, walked over there, and the owner was outside.  He told us that they had a soft opening the night before and that they would be open Monday at 4pm for dinner.  Ok pops, we'll be back at 4 on Monday.So Monday rolls around and we are starving by the time we get home from work at 4.  We walk over and there are two "chefs" standing around in the doorway chatting it up while smoking.  We walk up and are like...WTF?  And the guy tells me that the owner is out buying ingredients and that they might open at 5.  So I ask to see a menu and he says "we don't have menus"  Excuse me?"We type them up the day of..."Well that seems horribly inefficient and like a waste of paper.  So how am I supposed to know what you have to eat and if I want to come here?Ya...that's what I thought.  So even though your horribly tacky sign with a car on it (that conveniently doesn't say your name) says you'll be open at 4, you're not open.  And even though you guys are the cooks, you don't know what's on the menu for the night.  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.  I'm on a budget so I'm not just going to walk into your place and eat.  I want to see a menu before I walk in.  Get your act (and your website) together and maybe I will be back.  Until then, I will just walk by and grab a sub at Calabria.I also hate giving a bad review to anything downtown, because it's such an underated and underused community that's developing around my hood, and I want every new business to succeed.  However, I feel the disappointment still within me a day after my so called "celebrity chef" meal.  This is in the top 5 worst meals I've ever paid for.  To start, the hummus was served with store bought lavash, and it wasn't finished by 3 people, and that was not because of the size or lack of hunger, and all three of us love hummus.  The albacore on skewers was overcooked, dry, and served w a "homemade" aoli, that to me tasted like Helman's with a bit of red pepper.  If the majority of the ingredients in a sauce are pre-made, it's not homemade.  That's like buying ceaser salad dressing at the store and adding some parmesan to it and calling it your homemade dressing.  weak.  Lastly the sirloin with chimichurri sauce was also overcooked to about medium well and flavorless other than a seemingly similarly made chimichurri sauce.  This place is just half ass in general.  I put quite a bit more effort and thought into making a sack lunch.  Man, this is my first review on yelp, and i feel like an asshole cuz it's scathing, but I was that disapointed with this place that is trying to be something it is absolutely not.  On a final note, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, though the "celebrity chef" had not educated her on much more than maybe 2 items on the menu.  I hope that somehow, someway they can turn this place around, but as of now, the only thing worth going for is the free, crappy sangria.After much consideration, I decided my previous rating unfairly portrayed Vinery. That 3-star rating was heavily influenced by ambiance and vision, two very important aspects of a restaurant. When applied to the food, not just the space in which the food is served. I'm not giving up on Vinery, but rather challenging them to rise above the mediocrity that was apparent in our meal. Trust me, I will be back. And when Vinery has developed its standing in the downtown foodie destination guide I'll be proud of how far it's come along. Until then...====================================================Such a difficult place to review, because I see so much potential. It's a great location, tucked into an awesome neighborhood. The interior is intimate and has some great cosmetic touches. I like the idea of having the kitchen behind the counter, so you are right there in the action. Service is good, without the annoying hovering, and isn't rushed so this lends itself nicely to a slow meal to enjoy as much as possible. The complimentary sangria is pretty good (however, Dottsy's Slap me Silly Sangria has lifted the bar rather high). And offering a four-course Monday night meal for $10 is brilliant in any economic situation. Plus, they have a tapas menu. And now, the ubiquitous "but." But: Egg rolls shouldn't collapse on themselves from over frying. The slaw was good, but the egg roll could have been removed from the fryer several minutes earlier. But: English cucumbers are one of my favorites, however they don't have such a long shelf live. Mixed with vine-ripened tomatoes is a great idea; however, bringing some zing with feta cheese and a light sprinkling fresh dill and a splash of balsamic would really bring this salad to life. Perhaps I'm partial to the hummus I make and Crazy Jim's pita bread, so I'll leave it at that... But: Skirt steak should never be used for anything other than fajitas, cooked fast and hard. This is not a good cut of meat to have wrapped around a starch. Possibly fresh asparagus...but, leave it in the fajita mix. The rice was entirely too over-seasoned, even for a saltaholic like me. But: Merchant Services can be just as much your friend as your enemy. Americans use credit cards for $1 purchases, so certainly we would use them for dining out. Not having a working CC machine puts your customers in a very awkward situation. Granted, there is relatively close access to ATMs and even the Circle K. But, if you have to send your customers away to pay for their meal, are you really accomplishing much? There's a reason I front loaded this review with everything but the actual food--this is the part of the puzzle that keeps Vinery 214 Bistro from launching into space and being a stellar dining attraction. Ideally, this is a two-star restaurant, with the emphasis being on potential ability. For now, I've decided 2.5 stars is generous, and rounded that up to three. I'll be back, trust me. But I'm hoping that the menu is reevaluated, tweaked, reinvested and solidly delivered in this beautifully packaged restaurant.Possibly the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant. I was expecting much more considering the quaint interior and white linen draped table tops but I was deceived; royally!First Course: A veggie egg roll that was over fried a few minutes too long. The only veggie I could identify was a piece of broccoli, the rest, unsure.  I had the feeling (by taste) that the egg roll was taken directly out of the freezer and thrown into an extremely high temp deep fryer. The bed of cole slaw that the egg roll sat upon lacked any acidity or taste. Even worse, the egg roll and slaw were served on a damaged serving plate. The plate was cracked! Second Course: Cucumber and tomato salad, hummus and pita bread. The salad was missing any trace of vinaigrette or fragrant herbs. Just a bowl of cut up tomatoes and sliced cucumbers; no seasoning. The texture on the cucumbers was slightly slimy, possibly starting to turn. The hummus had a gritty texture (I like it creamy) as though the olive oil was omitted. Main Course: A total disaster! Risotto or rice pilaf wrapped in a skirt steak, pan fried, and served on  a bed of Spanish rice. My steak was impossible to cut with a steak knife and the middle was blood red. I had one bite and could not get another piece as the steak was to tough The Spanish rice tasted like it was cooked without any seasoning then was over seasoned before being served. I did notice the unfinished plates of other customers who were having the same meal. I could tell this was not a fan favorite. Unfortunate. Dessert: We had the server box it up to go. Never ate it.  I would like to note that the co-owner did approach us about our untouched meals and asked us if we would share some feedback. I  expressed my disappointment with the dinner providing detail of what was wrong with every item.  He seemed surprised with my candidness. I then asked him if he had ever tried the meal to which he responded, "No, I'm a very picky person."  He was very apologetic and gave us 10% off the bill and asked us to come back. He mentioned there were some changes being made to the menu and that he would discuss our feedback with the cook. We then had to drive to the ATM up the block to get cash to pay for our meal because their credit card machine was out of service. One catastrophe after another.
Tower Pizzeria=We ate at this particular restaurant located in the Stratosphere Hotel because we had a coupon for a free pitcher of beer with the purchase of a pizza. Our pizza was delicious. This small restaurant only serves pizza and beer. All the pizzas are large or you can order a slice. I would definetely return to this little restaurant, especially if we find another coupon  ((:
Halo-Halo Kitchen=Been here a couple of times, and every time it's been a satisfying experience. The tapsilog (one of the "silogs" they serve for breakfast - refer to the pics) is good, as are most of the entrees I've had for lunch or dinner. The storefront says "Filipino American Food", but that doesn't mean it's a fusion restaurant; rather, in addition to Filipino food they also serve some American fast food items such as burgers and corn dogs. Boba tea is available, too, and that goes well with pretty much anything you order there.I usually don't like Filipino food unless it's breakfast and this place hits the spot with their TapSiLog. That's marinated beef, fried rice (even better when it's garlic fried rice!) and egg.I also like that their "boba" isn't really boba but more of it's Filipino counterpart: sago. I'd definitely be back if I'm ever in the area :)This restaurant was everything I had hoped for..and more! I tried filipino food for the first time in August (what, there aren't a lot of filipino options in Minnesota..) and I absofrickenlutely loved everything I had. I was so excited to see an authentic filipino option in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant has an ala carte menu and a regular menu with a ton of options. I opted for a "three option" meal and got the lechon, coconut chicken, and this fried shrimp pancake thing..I'm sorry, I have no idea what it was called. On top of that, I also got the special Halo-Halo, lumpia shanghai, and the sisig fries. I can honestly say everything I had was amazing and if I could, I would eat there every day. You can tell the food is made with fresh ingredients and not any of that frozen or prepackaged nonsense. The girl at the counter was very sweet and patient in explaining the different food options to us. Here is my review of the food I had:-Lechon: the best part, tender pork, crispy skin, awesome sauce. -Coconut chicken: creamy, mild, coconutty without being dessert like,  and full of dark meat. -Shrimp thing: wish it would have been crispier but great flavor-Special halo-halo: a dessert on steroids, it was like a "kitchen sink" type of dessert where there were a bunch of deliciousness thrown into a cup...from what I can remember there was aloe, coconut jelly, taro ice cream, corn flakes, coconut milk, shaved ice, flan, red beans, pinto beans, grass jelly...and probably a lot more I am missing. -lumpia shanghai: crispy, flavorful, light, and great with the sweet chili sauce-sisig fries: amazingness smothered in more amazingness...this was coated shoestring fries double fried to a crisp with sisig, sour cream, onions, and chopped up pork on top. THE BEST. The owner of the restaurant stopped in to decorate and check on things and I have to note that she was actually the highlight of Halo Halo Kitchen. There was a fly in the restaurant and she spent a good 10 minutes chasing it around with a swatter and made sure it didn't go near our table. She complimented me on my phone case and we ended up talking about ebay and online shopping for a while. The restaurant has a bar like set up but there was a Filipino drama playing on the flat screens LOL. I honestly felt like I was at a fun relatives house chowing down on awesome food and catching up on soaps. It was so great.Disclaimer: I knew nothing about Filipino food outside of adobo and lumpia before coming here. I'm a total noob. But I know what I like, and I like Halo-Halo Kitchen. There are really several types of foods here: The stews: Some, like pork adobo or menudo are more familiar. I had the chicken pastel, with potatoes and carrots simmered in a savory coconut milk mixture. It was alright. Just be sure to watch out for bones! Getting a little sharp piece out of nowhere was a surprise, but it's all good. Then there's my favorite--beef kare kare. Beef in a peanut butter sauce, with a very strong little side of salted shrimp paste to top it off with. I like both flavors individually, but can't say I agree with them going together! All this with two generous mounds of rice for $7.00 is INSANELY good. Oh, and there was the dinuguan as well, or pork roasted in garlic and blood. Yes, it sounds weird! But it's not that bad. don't be a wuss ;-)There are breakfast plates (read: silog menu), that have various grilled meats with rice and egg. Served all day! :-DThere's the deep-fried Filipino junk food like lumpia, which were alright. I'll for sure come back for the sisig fries!Then there's the American menu if you wanna be basic AFSave room for desert. The Halo-Halo is intimidating and probably has a billion grams of sugar, but I'm down. Service is very friendly, but it's got the super local, laid back vibe to it in which employees are talking among themselves, on their phones, or watching TV while they serve you. Some people are irked by it, but I feel like I'm eating at someone's house. Groovy. Other oddities include the really cool bar that appears absolutely STOCKED. My pal tells me it's so that customers can party hard on karaoke nights. This place has just about everything you could ask for!11/18/15Returned this morning to use the second Groupon I purchased, which was to expire today.  This is Mom's and my second visit (our first was in July, when sister and her two kids were visiting, so they accompanied us then).  Mom and I weren't impressed with the meal we had then, which included dinuguan, lechon paksiw, longsilog (longganisa, which is similar to chorizo, and "itlog," which translates to "egg," and fried rice dish), lechon kawali, and porksilog (pork chop, eggs, and rice).  I believe we even ordered a BBQ item, and asked for a side of rice (two scoops for $1), which were then rung up together as one two-item dish that cost an extra $2 over what we initially ordered as a la carte!  I decided to give the woman (the owner?) the benefit of the doubt and didn't complain.  Everything was greasy and bland.  Sister liked her longganisa dish very much, though, since it had been a long time since she last had it.Fast-forward to today's breakfast of longsilog for me, with a side of tocino, and a tapsilog (tapas, eggs, and fried rice), with a side of bangus (fried milkfish) for Mom, and a Halo-Halo special ($1 more than the regular order of Halo-Halo), and again everything was greasy (Mom actually did what I suggested and patted down the meats with tissue paper to soak up some of the grease!) and bland.  Sad to say, but the only thing we both enjoyed was the "Halo-halo Especial." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/halo-halo-kitchen-phoenix?select=WWzdttOk7G2J3qbOLQk5QA  We thought the tiny scoop (between a quarter of a scoop to a third of a scoop'ish) of ube ice cream looked pitiful, but I didn't really feel like speaking to the woman/owner up front anymore, since this was going to be our last visit here.While we were waiting for our food to arrive, Mom was asking whether we should order some crispy pata, or lechon kawali to go, but by the end of our meal, she'd changed her mind.  Two very disappointing experiences, with each roundtrip costing us forty-eight miles of travel!   Very sad to say that we will not be supporting this Filipino-owned "turo-turo" business in the future.  :(
Crêpe Cellar=Are you going to throw tomatoes at me for not having crepes at Crepe Cellar?  I couldn't help it, I wasn't in the mood and there were plenty of other options on the menu.We started off with a French press of coffee.  Gotta love the French press, and they give you handy dandy timers so you can steep your coffee for light, medium or bold.  Great coffee, but it comes with a price tag of $5.  Man, I could of had a V8 (with vodka, of course.)We  ordered an endive salad with goat cheese, candid walnuts and apples.  It was yummalicious.  It had a tangy citrus vinaigrette, it look like there wasn't enough on the salad, but it tasted perfect.   We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts, mussels and  fries.If you think you don't like brussel sprouts or haven't had them since you were a kid, you HAVE to try them, they are swimming in olive oil and flash fried, they are like little bites of heaven.  Now if you don't like them at Crepe Cellar, let it go, cause you don't like them.The mussels were ok, shellfish weirds me out in restaurants, you never know how fresh they are.  The fries came out hot, YIPPEE!!! Our bill was $40 with no booze.  So, it isn't cheap.They have sweet and savory crepes on the menu, the sweet crepes that caught my eye were butter & sugar and nutella & bananas, there were a couple more, but Tasty Yo next door was calling my name and you know what they were saying......Tasty Yo Ho!!Crepe Cellar is a great casual neighborhood restaurant, it reminded me of a restaurant in Primrose Park in London.  well worth the trek to NODA!One of the best additions to the NoDa neighborhood over the last year or so.If you are going the crepe route for dining, hit up the Queen City.  If you are going for dessert, you cannot go wrong with the brownie concoction.The menu is also delicious well beyond the crepe realm.  The steak and Guiness stew with the insanely good mac and cheese will hit the spot.  For lighter fare, I recommend the pesto chicken french bread pizza.The beer selection (especially on tap) is always evolving and refreshing no matter what your taste.The wait staff and bartenders are friendly and fun.
Rosati's Pizza=I've been eating here or getting pizza delivered since they opened this joint. It was really good at first and has slowly gone down hill. Maybe they are owned by somebody different than the tasty Scottdale location?Going keep this short and simple. The quality of the food and service at this location is always CONSISTENTLY HIT OR MISS.Sometime it is great and other times it is awful. The last few pizzas that were delivered to the house had black (burnt) cornmeal covering the entire bottom of the crust. This is simply an oven that is not being maintained properly and most unfortunate.Since this is not about trying to graduate with a 2.0 or better and I'm not going out of my way to apply the Bell Shape Curve to my past dining experiences ... BIG MEH!2.25 STARSI was starving and stopped by this shopping center looking for Slim's Sub Shop.  I was disappointed to see that Slim's closed.  I was on a time crunch and saw Rosati's.I ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza, and wanted a bottle of Water....the girl working the register told me they were out of bottled Water, Strike 1.  The pizza came out after a few minutes.  The slices were huge!  It was almost the size of a small Pizza!  I thought that the Pizza was awful, the sauce tasted like canned sauce, the Cheese was flavorless, and I thought the crust was undercooked and rubbery, Strikes 2, 3, 4.  Since I was starving I ate it anyway, except I didn't eat the crust....which is rare for me, I always eat the crust....it was that bad.I know this place is a chain so I'm not sure I will ever try it again....not my type of place.  I prefer better quality pizza.Will I return?  No way!
Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria=The food was really good actually. It might have been better if they got the order right, and it hadn't arrived cold. So here are the cons:- It took 2 hours for them to deliver the food- They couldn't deliver to my hotel room because they were too lazy to park their car and walk it up- They forgot to give me the "complimentary" 2 liter drink they promised online- The pizza arrived cold- The caesar salad was sent to me with italian dressing for some reason- The caesar salad used iceberg lettuce even though the menu says Romaine- They forgot to give me the garlic bread they say comes with the salad- After I called to complain, the guy on the phone told me he would send me the things I am missing (caesar dressing, garlic bread, soda). It's been 5 hours...In conclusion, if you are looking for delivery, go somewhere else. They fail.
Black Dog Smoke & Ale House=Came here after my friends all raved about it. We arrived and there was a brief wait. I figured, hmmm...there are people here...that's a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Here's what I got:-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)-burnt ends (DELISH)The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned. Overall, the food and service left much more to be desired...
Thali Cuisine Indienne=I absolutely LOVE indian food. Majority of the food was spicy - but SOO good. Butter chicken is always a good one though. Plating size is very worth it - I can never finish all the food. Somosa's - yum! I believe I paid $11 - very good price for what I had. This is more of a place for quick eating. It's decor is not fantastic and the organization of tables is a little messy. But I'm here for food - so I don't really mind.
Krung Siam Thai=This was a nice little spot for lunch. The decor is actually cute and the restaurant is very spacious on the inside -- much different than most of the very compact restaurants on Spring Mountain. Our server was a bit rigid at first, but with time became a lot more relaxed and very friendly and attentive. The lunch deal was great.. $5.99 for soup of the day which was delicious Tom Kha on that particular day and one of many entree options. I of course opted for Drunken Noodles with chicken. They were great! The chicken was cooked perfectly and not too dry which is my main contention with most Thai places when it comes to their chicken dishes. I opted for heat level 6 on a scale 1-10. It had the perfect amount of heat..and I like spicy. So be cautious..if you don't do spicy regularly go for a 4-5 tops. Otherwise, 6-7 are ideal. This was a perfect lunch and you really can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food.Pretty good Pad Thai. Lunch special was $6.99***********PLEASE READ************:: Their spicy level is NO JOKE. They have a 1-10 scale with 10 being the most spicy. Now, I love spicy foods and can handle spiciness. When I go to Thai places and order my pad thai spicy, I usually request my spiciness in the B grading scale range. Soooo....I ordered my chicken pad thai with a level 8. HOLY SHIT.....this was wayyyyy tooo spicy for me. I couldn't even eat my dish because my entire mouth was burning. Even with a small bite, I had to gulp down water. I got full off water. So if you plan on making any of the dishes spicy, take it down a notch or two.....or three.We came on a Monday evening after a long day and ordered 1. Tom Yum (pot) Seafood - Spicy 5: 16.992. Pad Thai chicken: 9.993. Seafood Delight - Spicy 3: 14.994. 3 Steamed rice: 4.50 5. Garlic Pepper chicken: 9.996. Red Curry Beef: 10.99for $85.05 (automatic 18% tip charge AFTER tax)  - Easy to spot, but hard to get to! Coming from the strip, off of Spring Mtn, and to this place, does everyone have to make an illegal u-turn off Valley View?! haha- Great looking bar and dine for a Thai restaurant, but bathrooms don't match!- Ambiance doesn't match service. - Lame and lazy service. On a slow evening, we have to hunt down Takky to tell her we're ready to order, get drink refills, remove empty plates, organize our own table. No ass kissers here. Fail.- Tom yum had great flavor, strong sour and spicy taste. hot! Loved it, but a bit expensive for tom yum. Too much cilantro.- Pad Thai chicken was delicious! Just how I want my Pad Thai to taste. - Seafood Delight was a dry and spicy. I couldn't imagine how it would taste if it were a 5! Yikes! Mussels are tiny but packed with flavor. Too much onions. - Garlic Pepper chicken packed a punch of garlic! A Vampire's nightmare. Good with the broccoli. - Red Curry beef was pretty good, but I should have just gotten the Panang. Ugh..- Automatic gratuity = 6 or more in party.- SNEAKS! Charging tip after tax.This is one of my favorite Thai lunch locations. Parking is never an issue since they share private parking lot with other businesses.  My order was the boat noodle soup and a Thai ice tea. The soup arrived quickly and contained hot and spicy rice noodle soup with rare steak, beef stew, beef balls, liver and tendon. The broth was so yummy and tasty! I thought I was back in Phuket Thailand. This place is underrated compared to some other popular Thai restaurants in L.V. They offer live entertainment in the evenings. They also accept credit cards and the service here is exceptional!Best pad Thai with the very best tofu nuggets ever!This place is great & located on the way to the strip. There are 4 things I order here and I stick to them each time. Chicken pad Thai, cream cheese rangoons, chicken panang and Thai ice tea. Usually I experiment and try new things from regularly visited restaurants but not this one. I don't think I come here often enough to want to try new things. The decor is nothing special and it's a little stuck in the 90's with a small stage for some live random performances. One night an older Asian man was on stage singing everything from Frank Sinatra to Bruno Mars. It was awesome! The pad Thai is on the sweet side so prepare to ask for some lime and peanuts but it's really delicious without those items as well. The tofu is a winner and stands out on its own. Sometimes I pick it out a few pieces and leave them on my plate so it's the very last thing in my mouth :)
Sam's Chicago Style Pizza & Wings=Got the wings here...plain and simple...they're awful. Barely any meat, very dry, no flavor. Won't be back...**UPDATE**The (I assume) owner of this "fine" establishment decided to email me about my review on their wings...the following is the correspondence between myself and "Meridith". If this is how they treat their customers, I seriously don't understand how they've managed to stay open for a so called "40 years"...Message from Meridith:"Wings were sauced like they always are. If you read the menu you could have gotten the wings sloppy. Our wings are the same size as every where else in the valley. Try our pizza next time. We've been in business for 40+ years. We must be doing something right. You can try Papa Johns."Response message from me:"Don't be angry cause you have horrible wings...not everyone can get them right so don't feel bad. I can't say anything about your pizza cause I've never had it but even so I doubt I'd go back just to try it...Sure...your wings are the same size as everyone else's in the valley...as far as the bone goes. But it's the AMOUNT of meat on the bone which counts. And that right there is where your wings are TRUELY inferior.Your wings were purchased to feed a party of people during a boxing match on PPV and every single person at the party who ate the wings all said they were horrible...so for your sake I hope that we just got a bad batch or something cause none of those people there said they would ever go to your restaurant for wings.It was very immature and unprofessional to message me and talk to me in such a way about the issue when instead you should be more focused on trying to find out what the issue was and fixing it. I will be doing a follow up to my review to show everyone how you treat your customers over a matter of simply having their own opinion about your food if it just so happens to be a negative opinion."Sounds like a serious lack of customer service skills on their part. Looks like I'll be getting my wings from Papa Johns from now on...*sigh* what a serious tragedy....lol!
Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread=Mr. K has covered most of the bases in his FTR, but there were a couple of things I thought I would add... The green chile beef is every bit as good as the red. We sampled both, as well as the beans (we choose Pima style which is the smashed version of beans rather than whole). All were very ample portions and exhibited crisp flavors. We all agreed that each could use a little salt, but after some discussion and a few sprinkles we came to the conclusion that actually it was preferable to season your own to your liking. Too often, we had all been served items which were over seasoned and quite frankly, there isn't much you can do once that has happened. This way, we each were able to make adjustments as desired. The bread itself seems a little more tender than TFBH. It also seemed a bit larger. That being said, we did each have the "full" version of the tacos, so the "half" may be more along the lines of what you might get elsewhere. Prices also seemed to be approximately $1.00 - 1.50 higher than TFBH, for the full portion. Some other items on the menu were both surprising and intriguing. I'm definitely going back for the Blue Corn Mush (I would have ordered it today, but I had already ordered my taco and was sure I couldn't handle both). I've never actually seen this on a menu off the reservation, so that in itself is enough to make me a repeat visitor. They have a few mutton and lamb selections that are obviously more on the authentic side. The mutton rib plate is served with sauteed squash and diced green chiles along with a navajo fry bread and drink ($11.99). The people at the next table had one of these and it was a large plate of food which they clearly enjoyed. There is a grilled lamb stir fry and also a lamb sandwich to round out the native selections. The sandwiches and burgers are a definite twist on the common offering. Sandwiches are served either a tortilla or fry bread and come with such toppings as eggs/bacon/onions/fire roasted green chiles, eggs/grilled spam, or two burger choices. Lastly there are the stews... yummo! They have the standard red and green, but also offer up a monthly special (this month was a very tasty vegetable style). Stews are served in two sizes, which is particularly nice if you are sharing items. The decor is certainly nothing that stands out; the chairs and tables are a mosh of options, but it is clean, and the staff is very friendly and patiently answered questions. They have one high chair for those of you with little ones. It is a small place, so if you go during peak hours expect to wait for a seat or take your food elsewhere to eat it, as it fills up quickly. The final distinction is that the SH is open on Sundays from 11:00 to 5:00. So if you are dying for some of that unbelievable fried dough on the morning after a long night out and had to previously wait until Monday, this could definitely be a saving grace. It's great to have another option and I truly hope that they will build a following in the Central Phoenix area.Having driven by this area weekly, I only noticed Damelos Bakery & Pizzeria; maybe it's their bright signage? On my way home I saw the sign, Sacred Hogan, and immediately flipped a bitch. Frybread and I have a deep connection, it used to be the only reason why I would even go to the State Fair, well that and a foot long corn dog, but that's another story.I was greeted by a very woofy guy, thick goatee, nice calves and belly... Ah yes, frybread. After looking over the menu I ordered the B.R.G., which is a bean, red chile and green chile Navajo taco ($8.79).Now I didn't see my taco until I got it home since I got it to go... When I opened the box I swear there was a white light emanating from its center, their tacos are HUGE, ENORMOUS, PORTLY, and well, LARGE! I could sense its mightiness when I was handed the box, but I had no idea until I had it fully exposed. My mouth began to water as I opened to take in the hot and thick goodness, my saliva acting as a lubricant to get the whole thing in. Its girth was only trumped by its heft; it took 2 hands just too barely manage it to my face. At the last second I chickened out, what was I doing? What would the Mr. think of me if he saw me like this, face to face with a potential love affair? Cutting it into more manageable pieces was the right thing to do. The meat in the red and green chile was so tender and well seasoned it just melted with each bite.At the halfway point I figured I would save half for later since it was so large but I couldn't resist its chewy texture and savory allure. Yes *sniff* *sniff*, I ate the whole thing, every last bite including the tender beans that fell out of the sides!!! With no shame and no guilt, I waddled into the bedroom fell onto the bed and took a 2 hour nap. Sometimes life just doesn't get much better than this. I feel like I need a cigarette.Amazing! As a tourist in these parts--I encourage fellow tourists to make this place an eating priority when visiting Phoenix. When looking for a food gem out of town, Sacred Hogan rates off the charts. The place isn't much to look at. It's a tired looking spot in a rugged srip-center, but what it dishes out as far as food is spectacular. I was lured here by Alexander C's description of the frybread taco. The description seemed unreal, fictional--beyond the scope of human comprehension. I was floored to actually see it on the menu. I went with the red chile taco and a frybread all on its lonesome with honey as desert. The taco is just as luminous as Alexander C. describes it. Furthermore, the Navajo Taco tastes just as amazing as it looks. I'm going to have to make this place a personal pilgrimage. The frybread on it's own is an equal delight. What was the icing on the cake? Shasta soda in the cooler. Nostalgia and deliciousness--it doesn't get any better than this!After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread*ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness. My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad! To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!I can't vouch for the sacredness of anything here but the frybread was very good.  My daughter got one with powdered sugar.  It had a lighter and more airy quality than other frybread I have tried thus far. Given, I've only had frybread 3-4 times in my life, but compared to the other ones Sacred Hogan's was lighter.  For frybread.  Is that sort of a foodie oxymoron?  Light frybread?  Hmm.The atmosphere is pretty basic.  I will give them another try for a meal sometime.  I'm sure even though their frybread is lighter a meal on frybread is not something to toy with.  Seriously.  I've had a meal on frybread before it has been large enough to share or hold you through several meals.
DeBlasio's Restaurant=Unbelievably disappointing.  My dad and I drove from the city out here because he used to love DeBlasio's.  This meal was awful, and the service was worse.The bread that started the meal was good.  We both got wedding soup, which was acceptable as well.  We ordered fried zucchini to start, which was huge and not bad but nothing special.  I ordered the manicotti, and my dad ordered stuffed shrimp with a side of pasta.  However, I hate half of a tube of manicotti and threw the rest away when I got home.  The sauce was DISGUSTING.  Too much pepper and no real taste.  My dad ate a bit of the pasta and threw it away as well.  He said the shrimp was rubbery and there was no crab in the stuffing.  At close to $20 a plate, this place sucked.On top of all of this, our waitress was rude and nasty.  She was unpleasant through the entire meal, refused to refill our waters, and didn't ask when both meals went untouched.  She boxed the meals without asking if we wanted them, and made passive aggressive comments throughout the meal.This place is awful.  If you are going to insist on coming, order a fried zucchini and go somewhere else for dinner.  This is a step below an Olive Garden.  The only people in here are senior citizens that have been coming for years.  Avoid.
Snaps=My Milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... Mmmmm yes they do make a great shake, the glass is rimmed with the most sweetest and thick caramel one could imagine. Really adds a nice taste blend with a vanilla shake when you scrape the sides of the glass with your spoon! Can you say "Mouth Orgasm"?I used to dine here a lot with my boyfriend Chris as he lived around the corner from Snaps. We ate here several times a month for close to a year and a half so we have tried many meals here! We still talk about our old Snaps days, lolol. Yes, seriously the restaurant is called "Snaps".Service is hit and miss, sometimes we are ignored and sometimes they are up my ass with servicing me. The food quality is good and so are the portions. I really like having breakfast here, I think that is really their specialty.Can't go wrong with denver omelet, pancakes, french toast and their signature skillets. Make sure you are HUNGRY! I have also tried from the Chinese menu and they make a great sweet and sour shrimp. Huge shrimps, mmmmm. They have a great sourdough burger in which I believe they now call the "Frisco" burger. Mmmmm try it, you will see what I am excited about. I have to cut this burger down with a knife every time just to fit it all in my mouth to eat. Thick buttery fried sourdough bread, bacon, guacamole, double cheese, 1/4 Angus patty, lettuce, tomato, purple onion and fried onion strings. Mmmmmm is soooooo good! Prices are reasonable however are slowly increasing lately and the restaurant is very comfortable with booths and tables. Snaps is located inside of the Eastside Cannery.Try it!
Dong Ting Spring=Wanting some spice in our life, we headed in the direction of food from the Hunan province.  Our usual go to spot would be Yun Nan Garden, but we decided to change it up a bit and give its neighbor "Dong Ting Spring" a chance.  It's conveniently located right next door to Yun Nan and taking a peek inside, you can see which one has more customers.  That's okay though, we're an adventurous bunch and we'll give any place a go!  (It doesn't hurt that all their reviews are between a four and five star.)Walking in, we were warmly greeted by the waitress and shown to a table.  She asked in Mandarin if we wanted tea or water (or at least I think that's what she asked.)  We confirmed tea and it arrived quickly, along with a menu.Utilizing Tony T.'s posted pics, it helped with our dinner choice.  We figure it was a bit of gamble, but was confident we'd be satisfied.  After putting in our order, the waitress asked us how we wanted our spice level and we chose medium.* Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot ($11.95) - The first dish to arrive and it comes sizzling with a flame below it.  It's a combination of mushrooms, some sort of meat, peppers, and packed with flavor.  Great choice!   * Shredded Potatoes with Vinegar Sauce ($6.95) - We discovered this shredded potato dish at Yun Nan and really enjoy it.  But when it comes with vinegar sauce, woah - what a tangy contrast!  One bite and I knew the Husband would be loving this dish.  Something so simple and basic, but yet has so much flavor.  We're down with the potatoes!Steamed rice is 50 cents per person.Service - although English is limited here, the friendly face and patient look on the waitress's face makes ordering and eating here a much better and pleasant experience than other Hunan restaurants in town.Although it's not quite as busy as their neighbor, we did notice families eating in the back and a group of regulars arrive shortly after us.  So they do have a steady following.Overall, you can't go wrong with Hunan food.  It's just so full of flavor, spice, and kick.  Their food is far from bland.Our only downfall was not making this a group thing.  The more the merrier, and in this case that means more dishes to try and share!  Next time you want to add some spice in your life, do it with a group - it's always better that way!
Bacon=Ok. I was so excited to ride my bike to a new old town breakfast joint. We walked in and I was sooooo excited to try the food. Decor is precious and it is a perfect location for a breakfast spot with plenty of parking for bikes and cars. I just don't think they are going to need much parking in the future....unless they get their act together, this place is going to get a VERY bad reputation.Just like the 1st reviewer said, you don't get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression. We sat down and it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. I ordered orange juice and it came in a clear plastic cup with a lid, as if I was not planning on staying for a meal or something. My friends got coffee and had to ask several times for re-fills, as our watiress could not possibly have been less attentive.We placed our food order and were chatting and having fun, but 1 hour goes by-----YES, 1 HOUR-----and we realize we had been forgotten. We were all starving and if 5 more minutes had gone by, I would have walked right out! When we flagged down our waitress, who hadn't checked in with us for 1 hour, she said there are 2-3 tables ahead of us in the kitchen. We start looking around and noticed that people who came in at the same exact time had already eaten and left. Most of my group was willing to wait, since we had already waited an hour. We waited 15 minutes more and our meals come out. I order the "3 eggs". It is supposed to be served with toast and jam, meat, fruit and potatoes. I got 3 runny scrambled eggs, which I didn't eat, no fruit and no jam....The manager Sally came over to apologize, once she had heard about our experience and comped our 6 person table's meals. It was probably the best thing they could have done because I'm pretty sure other patrons were noticing what was happening with our table. It was the right thing to do. Today was apparently the 1st day of table service, which was the excuse for why our meals took so long. I guess they were trying to do the 'pay at the register 1st, then bring your food to the table' thing, but they said that wasn't working. I think this place needs to sit down with some successful restaurant owners and learn that service is just as important as the food. If our waitress had checked in at the 15 or 30 minute mark, we might all have been a little more enthusiastic about this place. Hopefully, the owner of this restaurant knows about yelp and is seeing all these bad reviews roll in. They need to turn things around quickly, if they are going to survive.I'm with Karri - I think that perhaps the proprietors have seen the reviews because I had an A-OK experience at Bacon this morning... or perhaps it's just that they had a very slow beginning?!Either way, I was so impressed!I left the gym and checked my phone to see a missed call and a text from Jared.  Here's what the text said (typos and all):"Headed to the bacon joint for quik brekfast its 10:20 right now..."So I called him and put in my order - something healthy please!I arrived ten minutes later to see Jared sitting at the bar of this pretty nice looking place.  Maryanna, the bartender/server took my order for iced tea and iced water and literally a few minutes later, I had my drinks and a beautiful egg white omelet with broccoli and mushrooms alongside a cottage cheese salsa and fresh fruit.  (FYI - this dish is called "the yogi" on the menu).  Although Jared had previously ordered me toast to go with it, I saw that they had whole wheat wraps and Maryanna promptly changed my order.  It was the perfect breakfast after a workout!Jared had the whole wheat pancakes with blueberry sauce and whipped cream and while I didn't taste them, they smelled amazing.  He must've enjoyed them because he 'almost' cleaned his plate!I was pleased to see that Bacon also makes a fruit, granola, and yogurt parfait and protein shakes with real fruit and protein.  They have a pretty huge coffee and tea menu as well as booze including "the bacon mary," mimosas, sunrise martinis, and more... In addition, they are green friendly!  That's right - they use biodegradable cups for to-go drink orders!Oh - and in addition, they serve some pretty yummy sounding lunch offerings from 11am - 3pm as well.Maryanna told me they did have a slow start with service, etc... but I think they are back on track now.  If you haven't been, go check it out.  And if you have been, give 'em another shot.  Tell Maryanna I say hi!  Maybe I'll even see you there as I plan on returning again real soon too!Sadly, I had to put my handsome son Zachary and his lovely wife Sarah on a plane back to San Jose...the visit was done...they needed to get back to their real life and quit hanging out with the old man.But, before they boarded the Greyhound Bus of the skies, they needed a hearty breakfast to tide them over for their arduous journey!Bacon lay right in the flight path:)It wasn't exactly on a direct line between the Valley Ho and Sky Harbor, but I didn't let that deter me from getting my kids a decent meal before their flight!And it was a decent meal...more than decent...it was pretty good:)I know Bacon opened recently and that they had some early "teething" problems (why do we call it teething problems?...the restaurant is not a "baby" and will not actually grow anything with enamel on it...it just doesn't make sense to me:)Zach and Sarah each got versions of bacon and eggs (I guess the breakfast meat nomenclature was too much for them to overcome:)I had sausage and eggs with the home fries...did you know that they toss their home fries in brown gravy before they serve them? I did not know that until the plate arrived, but the gravy earns them a "kudos"  (and an extra star:) from me...Gravy makes everything better, including breakfast:)The service was very good...I know, I know...it was 10:00 am on Wednesday morning and the place only had 6-7 customers, but Blake (our server) was friendly and attentive and helped Sarah get her order exactly correct.The portions are very large (not "Claim Jumper" huge, but more than I could eat for breakfast). Three big eggs, three large sausages, four thick pieces of wheat toast, a big pile of gravied home fries and a fruit cup...for under $9.00:)A good value, a good time and a good meal...maybe Bacon's teeth have grown in:)If you want to get someplace on time and you want me to find it you need to allow for some getting lost time.  GPS was invented for guys like me and I don't happen to own one.  In addition to finding this place I had been asked to find another place as well for future reference.  So after 3 trips around Scottsdale Mall (which really needs one of those map thingies) I found the first place and off I went on foot for Bacon.  Using Google I had picked out exactly where the building should be and walked right past it and by the time I crossed the bridge I was getting worried.  So I went a ways down 5th and still didn't see it so I headed back the way I came knowing I had a couple of other options for breakfast.  The sign over the door is much easier to spot heading south.Bacon shares an address with Devils Martini and in fact may be dual usage of the same space.  I know there were Devils Martini placards on the tables.  If they do share the same space it would explain why it looks more like a bar/lounge inside than a coffee shop.  In any event I walked past it the first time without looking close because the building and parking signs I saw first said Devils Martini.  I didn't think to ask the question so maybe somebody will fill this West Valley person in with the answer.  In any event the easiest way to find it is to look for Vidal Sasoon and Bacon is across the street.I was greeted quickly walking in the door and I took a high top with a view out the window.  The person who seated me got my orange juice and soon Tori, my server, came to take my order.  I ordered the first thing I saw that included gravy and potatos.  I think it was called the Big Pig ($9.50, I could be wrong on the name) and when it came that is sure what I felt like (see picture).  3 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages, ham, potatoes with gravy, baked beans with more bacon, fruit cup and a large English muffin.  More like a breakfast for 2 and if I had had a phone number for somebody I saw shortly afterward I would have offered.  In total volume I managed to finish off about 3/4 of it.Food.  I had no problems with the quality of any of it.  Overall it was very good.  The orange juice was about 1/2 ice cubes which was fine at the start but very watered down tasting by the end of the meal.  Subjective to my taste buds the German style sausages did not deliver, I thought they were too fatty/liquidy and lacked any real flavor.Service.  Tori waited on me hand and foot without being intrusive.  I did not have my camera with me and she showed me how to make the one in my phone work.  Looking around all the customers seemed pleased to be there.  One of the nice things about eating in the first wave before the crowds arrive is nobody has had a chance to ruin the servers day so everybody is pleasant.Waitress warned us when we got here that two tables had already bailed after waiting an hour + for food... ...So an hour + later we got our food, and the check comped by the manager... seems they have some issues in the kitchen and with communication. First they claim they lost our order, and then brought the wrong food - 3rd time was a charm though.The food is good and the menu is refreshing for a breakfast place. For Scottsdale's sake I hope they get it together.Poutine...a single word that can convey so much meaning!If you are a Canadian, the words and melody from "O Canada" begin to ring in your ears, as your chest swells with pride and you think, of all the Canadian exports...Gretzky, Oil...Pamela Anderson...this is the best:)If you are cardiac surgeon, you smile as contemplate your next Porsche, purchased with the fees received for the double, triple and quadruple bypass operations you will be able to perform on Poutine lovers:)If you are the folks at Bacon, you apparently think "what can we add to this to make it even "healthier":-)The Beautiful Carin and I took our lovely daughter, Whitney, to Bacon for breakfast this morning.Neither had been there and this was good chance for them to give it a try:)They had the "Yogi"...not named for the bear and the Yogi does not include a "pic-a-nic basket":)The Yogi is an incredibly healthy vegi and egg white omelet, that they both professed to really love:)Carin says this place stays in the rotation, so I know she was happy:)And when Carin is happy, I am happy:)I was almost transformed into a semi-vegetarian just by my proximity to their breakfast entrees!Fortunately, I saw "The Hangover" on the menu and I was saved:)The Hangover has a base of Poutine (french fries and popcorn cheese, covered in gravy:)...so bad, yet sooooo good:)What they do then is magical...they throw ham and bacon on top of the poutine and then slide 3 over easy eggs on top of that:-)I don't know who the genius was, that invented this little breakfast miracle, but I want to shake his or her hand before I have my coronary:)Sunday morning...no wait...great service today and everything was tasty and fresh!Tell me again why there's line at Breakfast Club?Bacon makes everything better. I know vegetarians who long for thick, salty slab of bacon. Crumbled on salads. Nestled between smoked turkey and baby Swiss. In potato salad. Reveered pastry chef Tracy Dempsey is famous for her bacon brittle. Yep. Even in candy. Bacon! Rejoice! So, needless to say I was excited to eat at Bacon. When we arrived I was loving the open, airy room with a bar straight ahead and lots of table options from booths to high tops. The doors were open and a lovely breeze entertained the room. But I got that vibe. Like we just arrived after some crazy ass rush. And I was correct. We waited a bit for our server to arrive, busied ourselves with a New York Times (for me) and a March issue of W Magazine (for Rickie...go figure!). We overheard a couple at the bar mention they'd been waiting 45 minutes for their food. UGH! I was ready to gnaw on the table I was so hungry. Well, we placed our order and received it within 15 minutes. And. It. Was delicious! Eggs Benedict (for me) and the Mr. Big (for Rickie...go figure!) did not disappoint. In lieu of Canadian bacon, I had a thick slab of ham...a little too much for the dish...but no major complaint. Everyone from the hostess, the GM and the bartenders and servers were very friendly. Though I felt for them, as brunch is THE hardest shift in the business. I always equated brunch (at least when I lived in West Hollywood) as hungover guests being served by hungover waiters. Dicey vibe baby. Can't wait to return to Bacon. Hoping, however, they up the OJ from a Sunny D like product to freshly squeezed.I've given this place 3 trys. Bacon struck out 3 times. You know what they say...its 3 strikes and yoouuuurrree out!!! Every time the kitchen is SUPER slow and every time, something was wrong with the order. One late Sunday, we (2 ppl) waited 45 minutes for our food. The restaurant was NOT even busy at this hour. I was starving!! Wait! On top of that, the servers suck!!! Two out of my three experiences included sucky service! They don't know the menu, they forget stuff, get the order wrong, neglect you....etc....To make it worse, the food simply isn't all that great and definitely not creative. You know those places where the food is so damn good (IE Breakfast Club) that the long wait is worth it? Or an overwhelmed server is forgiven? Yeah! But not the case here. They really need to step up their game. Especially in this economy! OMG! I almost forgot to mention their incredibly overpriced alcoholic beverages!! The location is great. Has a ton of potential ONLY if they revamp the service and the food.
Jr's Fish and Chips=I finally made it over to Jr's. I had 3 piece cod with frys, the kids had a burger and the fish and shrimp combo. Everything was made correctly and tasted excellent. The fish was not greasy, the frys did not taste fishy, the burger was perfect for the kid. The tarter sauce was good too. I will be back to try some more things. Only downfall was they were out of lemons and had one bottle of malt vinegar to share in the whole place. Oh and they charge for credit or debit purchases.
The Edge of Town=This was a classic experience where Less Is More could have been employed to make it better.  After passing by this joint many times, my Mom and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday.I ordered the Triple Cheese Burger (Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone) with a side of Thai Slaw.  Mom ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (Cajun Chicken blackened in an iron skillet, topped with onions, peppers and melted jack cheese with a cajun mayo on a ciabatta roll) with a side of Thai Slaw.Here's the breakdown....the Burger has a lot of potential.  I like to put Cole Slaw on my Burger, so I put some of the Thai Slaw on it.  It was juicy, but there was simply too much Cheese on it.  I couldn't taste the Burger and the Cheese flavors were indistinguishable.  The Thai Slaw has some serious potential too, but it was way too runny.  After the first few bites of the Slaw, the bowl was full of liquid so the rest of the Slaw was 'soupy'.....too much sauce and very, very sweet.  Also, there was a ton of Peanuts in the Slaw.  I don't know if they meant to do that, but it overwhelmed the flavor....also, I expect a Thai Slaw to have some heat in it...their version doesn't.I had 1/2 of Mom's Blackened Chicken Sandwich....again, they should employ the Less Is More Rule here.  The Sandwich was topped with a bunch of Grilled Onions, then fresh Onions....it was Onion overload!  The Chicken had a good, char-smoked flavor, but was lacking a Spicy Kick that I would expect from a Cajun flavored Chicken.Overall, it was a good experience....not great, but good.Will I return?  I probably will to try other items on the menu.
Eest Asian Bistro=Wow, last review was from 2009.  I guess I would update.  They have changed owners  from the original set when they first started.  I ordered take out.  Again it is Friday and my laziness kicks in.  I got:Chicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok "breathe" or air when you open the containerCreamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion, but the soup seemed bland..  But the crispy wontons I ordered extra and a little salt fix that up.Chicken with Cashew Nuts - Yummy!!  Perfect!I need to stop by for a sit down meal soon!!!
McFadden's Restaurant & Saloon=We should've known to take our business elsewhere by the previous Yelp reviews and the fact that McFadden's was not so crowded.  But I think my group of five was giddy over getting last minute amazing seats to the Bon Jovi concert, that we just wanted to get a quick bite and a beer and head into the show.The service was ok until the food arrived and it took a good five minutes to get napkins, forks, and water... The food was decent but nothing special at all.  I had the salmon entree (served with mashed potatoes and spinach) and the others went with chicken wings and chicken fingers (both served with french fries).Needless to say, our time at McFadden's was the lowlight of the evening.  (And yes, I just made up the word lowlight!) The concert was incredible!  I will not be returning to McFadden's since there are plenty of other options to grab a bite before heading in to Jobing.com Arena.I came here a few weeks ago for a birthday, and that calamity was bad enough.  I held off on the bad review until I gave them another shot.  Well I did and they failed even harder.1st trip -- we had reserved a table for a birthday, and as reservations were made it was made clear to us that if we weren't there by 9:00 they would give our table away.  So we arrive at 8:45 and they make it out to be a big inconvenience to them that we arrived......15 minutes early.  Nothing was setup, and they scrambled to get a "party" table put together (which I don't think ever reached the size we had reserved).  All decorations became "we could put ________ on the table but........we'd need for you all to get up".  So after all this I thought it could be a fluke, so we gave them another shot last night......2nd trip -- Had a friend come in from England and he wanted to go to the bars at Westgate.  God forbid he wore shorts on his trip to.........Arizona, so we weren't allowed in.It's Thursday night. And no matter how hard you try, you are not a Scottsdale bar.Choke on your impending failure.We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.  I should have known better to dine without checking Yelp first.  We got seated and the hostess notified us that she is also our server.  She took our drink orders.  And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.IRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.CHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.  The fries were  good!Service was actually good.  The food is not so good.30 mins sitting at a table, waitress never showed. Walked out with nothing. Why does this place exist?Ummmmmmm not the best thing that has ever happened to me, but fun for a girls night out.  I would not recommend this place for a date-- it seems to be better for groups and hoes.Yeah, definitely groups and hoes.I have never tried the food here.Ever.This last time there was no cover since a buddy did the happy hour route-- which is: if you have like 8 people total, give them your name and guarantee those people will be there, they will give you a "host bracelet" and free drink coupons, and the rest of your group will get bracelets which gives them $2 well drinks and $2 beer (nothing fancy, so you've got to like Bud Light)It is right across from this country themed bar with a mechanical bull, so that's a fun distraction for a while... but it's not like either of these places are Vegas-class or anything.additionally...Do NOT drink and drive.Like ever.But ESPECIALLY from this place-- there are cops EVERYWHERE.Cops standing right outside the doors looking for the drunkies... cop cars parked all over the parking lot.Don't be afraid to get into the passenger seat of your car, toss those keys into the backseat and take a niiice looonnng nap until you're sober, or someone comes to pick you up.ENJOY!You know how the guy on ESPN uses the catchphrase "Useful....useful shot"?Well, this review is Useful....if you want a shot. Go here, it suits you well.~Fud/Drink~I smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  "Why did I come here.....?"~Atmosphere/ServiceJust when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway.... ~Extras/Rating~You might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks. There are so many better options in this center. I mean, seriously.Am I getting too old for this?Me thinks not!  Granted I'm not the youngest cat in the crowd, but I think I deserve some love don't I?  Well I guess not at McFadden's. I might not be that young lad that buys drinks for everyone and continue to pound down shots of liquor in the attempt to get myself drunk anymore.  However, I'm the guy that can actually afford it without burning a hole in my wallet - wink!  Maybe you should be looking my way next time instead of continue to serve the drunk dude down the bar who probably shouldn't be drinking anymore unless tent city is the next destination for him.  Loud obnoxious drunks and college frat party like atmosphere only goes so far.  Let's just keep it where it belongs because I really don't know if it should be public thing unless it's a place called Vegas.  Westgate is no Vegas!  I can party with the best, but even I felt uncomfortable here.  Let's just say if a fight broke out I wouldn't be surprised.  Patio is nice, but without a smoke vent is sucks -- yes I know the "patio" needs a smoke vent!  Unfortunately a bad experience this time; we'll see if I ever return to do a follow-up. - Enjoy!The food was ok, the service was mediocre... I would probably give this place three starts but...I checked my credit card statement a few days after going to this place and found that I had been charged and extra $20! I called to try to get that taken care of. I was told that the manager was unavailable and would give me a call back. I did not receive a call back, so I called again two days later. Still no call back. I called again today and nobody answered, so I chose the option to leave a message for the general manager. His voicemail is full!Sooo now I guess I'm left with the option of filing a police report and contacting my credit card company.McFadden's, that's STEALING and it's wrong! I will not be going back here, and I recommend anyone who goes here pays cash!!This place SUCKSSSSSSSS. Drinks are expensive and they charge a cover sometimes. A cover!?!? Idk if they still but last time I was there they did and I was like wtf. Only paid it cuz a few friends were inside already but never again. Service is horrible and then they allow people to dance on the bars which was gross and almost knocked over my drink. Skip this place.Depressing. Not a good sign. Completely dead on a Saturday night in the middle of Westgate. I get that there are a couple of other choices in westgate but we decided to pop in here. BIG mistake. Their menu is the typical Irish bar fare,  greasy and should've been perfect after a day of drinking. Unfortunately, this was not the case. All we wanted were pretzels. Seeing they had it on their HH menu we assumed we could just order the more expensive plate not at the discounted HH rate. Ummm, no. They won't serve anything that's on their HH menu unless it's HH. The service was poor-my friend preferred to compare them to a smelly bottom body part. We asked them what beer they had on tap and were told "we have a lot, do you want them to name them ALL?" Huh? I'm sorry that we came into your life and inconvenienced you seeing that your only purpose to be in front of us is to serve us and make sure we have a positive experience in your establishment. Clearly, that was too much to ask for at McFaddens. I've never had such a poor experience in my life. The food was mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting.Maybe, this space is cursed. The Other place that was here shut down too. Seeing all the reviews on here and being at a 1.5 stars should be a sign. Shut your doors and close up all ready.This one is pretty simple. Only good to grab a drink, maaaaaaaaybe two, before a game and move onNot even nice for a sports bar. The bathrooms could use a lot of work. The stainless steel stalls of the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this.The bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased.We had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now. It seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display. I don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future.If I could I would give the place negative stars. The staff was EXTREMELY rude not just one but all 5+ that we encountered. It was not for a lack of trying on our part... We were friendly tried to make conversation and tipped well but still couldn't even get a smile out of the staff. The later you are at this place the more questionable the crowd becomes. Felt VERY unsafe. I will never return and have told all my friends to do the same. Sucks to have to post such a negative review.It the worst bar ever.  I'm With the band Los Lobos. And security let us in and after 35 minutes a little security guy came and ripped the sun glasses off Cesar Rosas and got there manager Armando Tavares in a choke Hold for no reason.  They refused to give him his credit card back till he called the police. And all of a sudden they found it. We will never go back to this bar Or town no matter how much they pay us!!!We are Seahawk fans and wanted to come to this so-called Seahawks bar to watch the Superbowl to be with other Hawks fans. Here was our experience:1) We paid $105 per person for standing space since the place was fully booked. It said the price included a buffet of food. They had a couple trays of nachos and wings for hundreds of people. 2) Waiting in line was so confusing. We were supposed to have access to it from 4pm-end of the game. Waited for an hour; fought through the line to ask the host, he had no clue of what was going on and said we were in the right line. Found out later that we were in the walk-in line, not the line with people who had reserved a spot (this was a blob of people, not a line). We finally fought our way into the bar.3) Whenever the Patriots scored, someone blew a horn.. Seahawks bar?? Not to mention some Pats fan (a guy) pushed me when I fought my way to the bathroom.4) When we lost the game, they played the song "We are the Champions".. WTF. I would rather they just slap me in the face directly.The whole experience was awful. At some point some punk Patz fan threw (Yes, he really threw it!) a tray of unfinished food on a large table of Seahawk fans and then wanted to fight. Sauces and food went flying everywhere and got on people's shirt.After the game, not only they trash talked, they also took off their shirts (the guys) and flung it around and wanted to fight. The whole reason we picked a Hawks bar was because we want to be with other real Hawks fans. This is a flip-flopping bar. Whoever wins, they support. Overpriced, overcrowded, rude staff. Never again...Yep No shock here why the owner of Calico also owns McFaddens and guess what? They both suck! The staff is run by bimbo teens who couldn't tell you there ass from there head ...when you say you can have your burger cooked to how you like (medium) and then when I bite into it it's cooked fully through...that's not cooked to order (waitress was also some teen bimbo) between McFaddens and Calico Jacks they are the eye sore of Westgate ...avoid going to either at all costs.....and when it's night time and it turns into a "bar" watch out for the asshole security ppl at the front door and throughout the place they take there jobs way too seriousThis review is LONG OVERDUE. When you read reviews saying this is quite possibly the worst restaurant/bar, they are not exaggerating. I have been here MANY times.. Mainly because it's convenient for my friends who live on the west side, and also because it's easy to go to after the coyotes game. Don't get me wrong, this place used to be mediocre a few years ago, and it wasn't dreadful. Now I am seriously SHOCKED when I hear it is still open.Let me give you a little run down of the experience here... They are DESPERATE to get people in. If you are on their "VIP" email list they will legit email you every weekend and say you have won, and you can get free drinks from 9-11. And when you get there... They don't have the AC on and they will have all the doors open so it's 115 inside. You will be sweating and crying and wondering where your life went wrong that you had to come to mcfaddens.The music is usually good.. That's the ONLY plus.. And I mean ONLY. They give free shots to girls every Friday and Saturday and usually it's fireball. They will make them get on the bar and dance.. It's usually pretty entertaining to watch. The drinks are WEAK. They have this Asian male bartender who will ALWAYS get on the bar and take his shirt off and do some sort of weird breakdancing. He thinks he is God's gift to earth. this is also very entertaining. They like to throw hundreds of napkins in the air and scatter the entire dance floor. Not only is this extremely annoying, it's also disrespectful and wasteful. It's makes me cringe. And they get stuck to your shoe and you look like a teenager from a bad 90's movie who is coming out of the bathroom with toilet paper on her shoe.If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, go in and order a beer, stand in the corner and watch the shit show commence. You're welcome.I could go into detail as many have about the multiple terrible experiences encountered here, but to keep it as accurate and short.. EVERY ASPECT OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS TRASH. If yelp had a negative rating this place would not be 1.5 rated, but more like -4 star rated.
Yola's Cafe=As much as I still love Yola's for its ambiance and great-tasting coffee, unfortunately my last experience there was quite disappointing and felt I needed to update my review. A friend and I were there on Dec. 30, around noon. We approached the counter to order and were told we'd have to wait a few minutes. No big deal, although they do seem to be consistently understaffed at busier times. We ordered two coffees in mugs and were told they were out of mugs. Again, not a huge deal but couldn't understand how this could be when they always default to paper unless a mug is specified, which isn't often. Sensing my disappointment, my friend found a used mug and handed it to the barista. We sat down next to a table containing items that previous guests had left behind (two coffee cups and used napkins), despite a nearby trash receptacle and dirty dish station. Why some people can't clean up after themselves is beyond me. However, as another reviewer pointed out and because this is a considerable issue, Yola's needs to have signs reminding people to return used dishes and dispose their trash. And so we waited. And waited. And waited some more. It was a good 30 minutes before our coffees arrived. I took a sip and it was obvious my latte was not made correctly, requiring a return trip to the service counter. Similar errors have occurred on past visits, making me question their order-fulfillment system. My companion and I lingered for a couple hours, talking and drinking. We were approached at 2pm with an announcement that they would be closing at 2:30. What?? I asked why and was told "Oh, just because of the holiday and everything." Ummm.... what holiday? Mind you, there was no sign on the door or counter area indicating the early closing time, and there were several confused customers still in the shop. Thankfully, we had finished our coffee, but we left baffled and unhappy.Although Yola's is still a nice, cozy place for coffee/breakfast/lunch, I think they need to work on a few things to improve service and the overall enjoyment of their guests. If the owners are reading, I would also suggest installing blinds or shades on the large expanse of south-facing windows. It's almost impossible to sit near the window on a sunny day, unless you like being blinded. It also gets very hot. Lastly, 4:30 is kind of an odd closing time. Staying open until at least 5 or 6pm seems more reasonable and customers wouldn't feel so rushed.I'm impressed what a great lil café. Black coffee and baked oatmeal and yogurt. The oatmeal is to die for. Its your typical coffee house/café. Its comfortable and wasn't to packed so I was able to just eat and chill. Kinda wishing I would've order a few pastries to go. I'll probably head back for lunch after shopping the menu looks really good
Cakes N Flakes=Stopped by after lunch at Thai Taste (awesome food, btw!) two doors down.  It was CnF's grand opening week.  I immediately posed my food allergy questions to the manager/owner Hitesh, who went into the kitchen and quickly emerged with the pastry chef, who informed me that their chocolate croissants ($1.75) are corn-free (no baking powder in the batter, and neither corn syrup nor powdered sugar were used in the chocolate ganache filling and frosting).  Out of the individually-sliced French cakes, I could only try the "chocolate-chocolate" cake (I swear this is what Hitesh called it), $2.50 plus tax.  Again, no baking powder used in the cake, and only semi-sweet chocolate chips and heavy cream in the ganache filling/frosting!  How did they taste?  I loved the croissant's ganache filling.  The pastry, however, didn't fare so well.  With the exception of a very few flaky nibbles, most of the bites instantly felt gummy, like I was chewing on leather.  (Have you ever chewed on a moist piece of dried mango?  Yeah, something like that.)  No exquisite bites of buttery flaky crust that descend onto the tongue... I decided to just throw the bread away, but not without eating all the chocolate first!  But, oh, the chocolate-chocolate cake!!  Do yourselves a GRAND favor and buy a slice today!  One of the best chocolate cakes I've had in a long, long time!  (I've had to pass on so many recipes...)  So moist, and so devilishly good!  If I were the pastry chef, I'd give it the unoriginal, but spot-on name of "Devil's Food" cake!  The chocolate coin on top, however, was a big letdown.  Almost no flavor at all.  A waste of cocoa, that one.  I just tossed it away.I had asked if my nephew could sample their chocolate-chip cookie and was handed a shortbread cookie.  My sister, our Mom, and my nephew all gave the cookie the thumb's down.  (I couldn't try it due to a food allergen used.)  I hope this isn't a sign of the quality of their cookies, but no worries.  As long as Cakes N Flakes offer their chocolate-chocolate cake, people will come!p.s.  I finally received a reply to an email I sent inquiring about location address and website URL.  Looking over their online menu, I'm surprised to find out that Indian food is also being served here, alongside the pastries!  I did not spot any menu listings on the walls that advertised savory foods.  Now my sister and I willl have more reasons (as if we needed more than one reason, the cake!) to come by!
Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers=After our recent visit to the Sammy's L.A. Pastrami on Decatur, we were told that we need to visit the one on Tropicana.  Of course, this didn't take any persuading for the Husband who had his dinner planned out before he saw me.This location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.Sticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger "A 1/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone." ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!I was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!We also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.After we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.Of course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky! They also have gift certificates available at restaurant.com for this location.I have been going to Sammy's for a little less than a year after finding it on restaurant.com.  I liked it enough to purchase additional coupons for it, but I would only go once a month or once every 2 - 3 months.  I live on the West side of town and this is on the East side of town so it wasn't all that convenient..I had gone the other day after picking up a friend from the airport and when I presented my coupon I was told that as of November 1st, he, the owner was no longer going to accept the coupons.  I said I had more coupons at home.  He said I should bring in what I had and start using them before Nov 1st.   I had 5 more coupons.  The next day I called him to verify the use of the coupons.  I also asked him, since he wasn't going to be accepting them anymore can I use more than 1 since there was going to be 4 of us going there the next day.  He said, "one coupon per email per day".  I said fine.  Next day rolls around and I bring in 3 friends, he said I wasn't going to be allowed to use them.   He said the rules state 1 coupon per month.  I said but you told me the other day, PLUS I called yesterday.  All he could do was repeat the rules of restaurant.com of one a month.  He said he loses money every time the coupons is used.  After he and I both were repeating each other in frustration, I finally got him to admit, "well, I changed my mind".At that point, my friends who I had also just picked up from the airport started to chime in to tell the owner off.  I was quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of my out of town guests.  (After I had told them what a great place this was for pastrami).At that point, we decided not to give him our patronage.  I will never be going back there again so his statement can hold true...he will lose money.I would have been perfectly all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupons in or to tell me when I called that I wouldn't be able to use them.  NOT for him to tell me AFTER i get there.  How inconsiderate!While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!PLEASE READMy husband saw the review for this place on the Travel Channel and we made it a point to stop in Las Vegas specifically to give this place a try on our way home to So. Cal. from Lake Powell.  HUGE mistake! My husband had the Pastrami Melt and before even finishing his last bite he had intense stomach cramps (approx. 4:30).  We spent the next two hours waiting for my poor husband who got serious food poisoning. He had not eaten anything since breakfast so we know with 100% certainty it was from the Pastrami Melt. I am not a fan of pastrami so thank goodness I didn't touch the pastrami. Aside from the hubby getting sick he didn't feel the Pastrami Melt was any better than others he had eaten elsewhere. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was extremely thin, not even a full chicken breast half. The chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-a is ten times better and less expensive. They won't give you a glass of water (we don't drink soda) but will gladly sell you bottled water. Only good thing was the Garlic Romano Fries. Overall the place was quite dirty (floors needed sweeping, tablecloths dirty and torn), very small and extremely hot inside. It's 113 degrees outside and they are too cheap to turn on the A/C??  Oh and no bathroom for customers. Makes me really wonder about how or why restaurants are selected to be featured on shows such as The Travel Channel.  Extremely disappointing.This place. Goodness. As far as food it was ok. I mean what's not to like. I ordered the Italian Beef (with no onions) and it tasted great. The fries could have been better, but I didn't really expect much considering. Why such a low review? Well, we went through the drive thru and even though there was only 1 other person in front of us it took over an hour. Honestly, I probably could say closer to 1.5 hours, but I fear no one would believe me because that is just insanity. If it wasn't for getting several people on board and figuring out their order prior to going there - as in if this was just for me- I would have surely left and gone ANYPLACE else. I just kept thinking, well, surely it will be soon. I can not imagine what the heck was taking so long? It's just outrageous. Honestly, no matter how good the food is, I will never be back. I don't have the time to wait 1-2 hours for a sandwich. It should also be noted that I only ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 order of fries. Although all of that is regardless because the majority of the wait was before he even got to me. Also, when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I was crazy and handed me a scratch piece of paper with nonsense written on it. The reason I asked for a receipt was because I thought he had over charged me slightly, but wanted to double check before saying anything. But clearly these people have no idea what's going on... so instead of saying anything I just decided that who cares, because I'm not returning. I had to give 2 stars, because the food is actually pretty decent. If anyone else braves the wait, good luck to you, I say! Seriously what a headache!
The Cracked Egg=Great food! Great value good service! Need I say more?As others noted, I too noticed a considerable lack of good, creative brunch spots in Vegas.  Most places are the same ol', same ol'.  Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns.  The Cracked Egg doesn't deviate too much from this standard. It mostly offers typical breakfast fare - an assortment of omelets, pancakes, scrambles, etc.  If you're in the mood for something relatively unique they do have plenty of options for interesting omelet combinations, a delicious benedict ole (heart attack on a plate), and their "coffee cakes" - a standard side with many of the menu items - are divine (and flavors vary daily, it's not your typical coffee cake, they must use smooth as silk cake flower and maybe add in sour cream or something to give it creaminess and tang).  My favorite standard is the huevos rancheros.  A simple tasty sauce covers refried beans, eggs how you like them, sitting on a flour tortilla and topped with melted cheese and jalapenos.  It's simple, but they do it well.  Not too much cheese (I really don't need to eat 12 oz of cheese in a given meal like some places believe), medium spicy peppers, and plenty of beans, just how I like it!It's not the most unique food you can find (although it's as unique as any I've found in this city) nor is it on the top of the healthy list, but it's satisfying and consistent, reasonably priced, and has become my weekend go-to place!Management soured my experience. Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles.First of all I would like to start off by saying how much I used to love the Cracked Egg. My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug "don't care" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is "the food industry and that bugs happen". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, "well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared." !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for "politely" complaining, she said, "ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too." That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed."Breakfast (at) Epiphanies"I come here for breakfast on Saturdays. Just once in a while, though.I'm the brooding one at counter's end, staring at the wall like a poster boy for autism, solving complicated problems, arriving at life-changing realizations. I'm aware that I should instead be gazing slack-jawed at a cell phone like most others but I'm capable of occupying my mind without mini-screens. Besides, my cell phone is just a phone, and I only turn it on when I need to make a call.Anyway, the coffee is good here, and the food tastes like it should.Last time I got corned beef hash; it came with bell peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast, although you can substitute hash browns with seasoned potatoes if you want, and the toast with coffee cake for something sweet. Everything was good. I liked it.The time before I went with the cakes and eggs combo which arrived witheggs scrambled(my favorite way), two huge pancakes and sausage links, although you can order patties instead of links and bacon instead of sausage. I didn't care for the links so next time I'll get patties. But the cakes were good. Hot and fluffy like a freshly served souflee, which, I suppose, is kind of what pancakes are in a way.This location does get crowded so plan to wait unless you're an early bird like me. They are open for lunch as well and the link below will show you their fare.http://www.thecrackedegglv.com/cracked-egg-menu-0611.pdfIf you make it here some Saturday and see me at the counter, feel free to ask what I'm thinking about. But don't get mad if you don't like the answer. ;(The Cracked Egg is not the business. I found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.   I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh.
Sausalido=This gem is pretty close to work so i was able to check it out for lunch with a couple of my work mates. There were 6 people in my party and they were able to seat us immediately ...it was also 1230pm.   The place is small and intimate. Cute decor and very homey.  They have a simple no fuss italian menu.  Appetizers, sandwiches and bigger meals. Its BYOB. They had one vegetarian salad, one vegetarian wrap and entree. Our waiter was a bit dull and even maybe hangover?? very blah demeanor.  He also wasn't familiar with some of the items on the menu. i.e the salad of the day. However this was quickly redeemed by their white bean/olive oil vinaigrette dip that comes with the basket of bread. OMG delish i probably ate too much. It had the perfect kick and a great way to get the tummy ready for the entree.  I ordered the  lemon goat cheese ravioli with asparagus and it was delicious. A bit more cheesier than i expected but still extremely flavourful the asparagus was probably my favourite item on the plate. Fresh and not too raw or over cooked. The serving was big and i got to have some leftovers for dinner.One of  My meat eating friends got the chicken sandwich that shes still talking about. My glass of water was refilled frequently and so was my friends' ice teas. We also got our checks pretty quickly.  A+ for the fast service. Other than the lack of enthusiasm for life from our waiter, I thought this place was great. The lunch prices are also very reasonable. $11 for my ravioli and about 9/10 for sandwiches. At the end of the meal the chef came out to see how we liked our meals and he was cute and friendly thus adding one more star to this review. If you work in Bloomfield or shadyside this is a great place to check out for lunch. We were there for about 45 minutes and with the fast service you will be able to enjoy an amazing meal without getting on the boss's shit list.Sausalido, I'm into you!What a cute little place! Again, I ponder why it took me so long to come here. Maybe it's a hidden gem?? Whatever it is, I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu appealed to me, which is always a good sign. Oh yeah, also a good sign, deliciuos bread and hummus on the table!I was with a party of six and as soon as our food came out, I was struck by what a beautiful presentation it was. I mean, everything looked fresh and delicious, with a lovely looking plating to boot! I was in the mood for veggies, so I choose the roasted veggie wrap. It came LOADED with portabella mushrooms, red pepper, yellow squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrot, mixed greens, parmesan and white bean spread in a spinach tortilla. I also loved the balsamic dressing inside. It was just a nice refreshing meal for lunch. Not too heavy and definitely on the healthy side.I was VERY intrigued by the dinner menu though. I must come back soon to get some of the seasonal items (yum pumpkin!).Sausalido is truly a hidden gem in Bloomfield! Inventive, creative dishes, stellar service and BYOB. One can't ask much more. Reservations are recommended because it's not huge. I really like the upstairs space best because there's a bit more elbow room than downstairs, especially if you have a larger group. You're greeted with a chalkboard of the evening's specials - typically a fish of the day and other seasonal specialties. It's easy to order off that menu. Love the bread and bean dip they bring to the table and the smoked Gouda appetizer is not to be missed. We've ordered it every time. You can choose a dinner salad portion of any of their options or their soup to begin your meal. I'm hooked on their Beets & Bleu Salad and it's perfectly sized as a starter. Even though the menu changes regularly, the crab cakes are always there and they're delightful with a different flavor profile than a typical crab cake. My friend can't keep herself away from their pork chop which comes with a stellar presentation, as does their lamb. The fish special preparation changes regularly, too. We've also really enjoyed steak and pasta dishes. On our last visit we actually saved room for dessert and shared their chocolate, caramel, cashew bread pudding. Wow, it was amazing!Service during every visit has been perfect and our wine glasses never seem to be empty. Great restaurant!
Lebowski's Neighborhood Grill=Meeting a couple of people here for a Yelp gathering, I was impressed. (Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!) Comfortable neighborhood style restaurant with great pub grub style food and an extensive selection of beers, local and faraway. I don't know if our service was typical - our Yelp status was common knowledge - but it was good. The waitress took great care of the table and was very helpful with beer selections.I had the hummus appetizer and really enjoyed it. Lots of garlic in there and good amount of pita pieces and tortilla chips for scooping it up. The beer was cold! Other selections at the table looked good too and the jerk teriyaki chicken wings smelled great!Plenty of parking with such an urban location. Out front and out back. Prices were pretty good, especially if you stick with the specials!Would I return? Absitively! I am considering volunteering the place for our Tuesday night guy's outing.UYE @Lebowski's 10/18/2009;     If you look at the name Lebowski's " Grill and Pub " its very deceiving....   I bet within a 1 mile radius  there is( Dave help me out) 30 or more places that  A)Serve Food B) Serve drinks and or combination of both so I guess it comes down to this.       If your going out to have a meal why settle for food that is not cooked  basically reheated ?  Diners want quality not something that was driven or flown half way across the county  just so it can make it to your plate! If you haven't been to Lebowski's for a meal or appetizers the last time you " Go" to where ever you "Go" just ask as I did and the taste tells " what is actually cooked?" .Then they will be glad to have you as a " regular" at Lebowsk'is!        If it's Spirits that your out for when was the last time you visited your " Favorite Place" and did not have something to eat? So we are back at square one.Why lower your expectations of the food just because, your having Drinks?You should not have too!!        When you go to Lebowski's you will learn very  very quickly as did our group of YELPERS  that this is a place that we will return to...Determined to shake up our Saturday lunch routine, hubs and I stopped by Lebowski's to try their famous wings and take in a bit of college football in the mean time. The first impression is a bit nondescript - Lebowski's looks like many other sports bars in Charlotte and has a nice little patio facing East Blvd. Because Mother Nature gave us a break from the 90s, we chose to sit outside and enjoy a relaxing lunch (hubs was especially happy as there are TVs outside, too!). Both the hostess and our server weren't the cheeriest of individuals...it seemed like they both had a long night out. Regardless, hubs went with the Carolina Gold wings and the Beef on Weck, I choose a side salad and the small version of the Chili & Mac 'n Cheese. Upon ordering our server informs us that the wings take about 15-20 minutes to cook. Um...ok...that's a little odd, but we would still like them. This was noon on a Saturday in a not-so-busy restaurants. Now, I'm not a wing eater but even hubs said that that's a long time to wait for six wings. So, basically the entire time we were joking with each other that the cook had to go fetch the chickens and take care of them so he could have his wings in less than 20 minutes. And yes, it did take 20 minutes for these wings to reach our table. I'll let hubs review his own food. As for mine...the salad was fresh but not too much to report. Their side salad included bits of iceberg and romaine, a flat crostini and a few other veggies. As for my Chili Mac 'n Cheese, it was pretty tasty albeit the chili was a bit sweet. I had a different expectation...when I saw a cup of chili mac 'n cheese I expected a cup of chili with a bit of mac 'n cheese at the bottom. I was a bit suprised when I saw a flat dish of mac 'n cheese with a small scoop of chili on top. No worries, though, I ate it up - it was a nice little serving. Will I be back to Lebowski's? Sure...for a few beers and maybe a snack, but I don't think it's going to make it into my trusty lunch spot list.Not sure why I had never reviewed this place yet.  I've been going here for years.  It seems to be the place Dilworth area bartenders go to eat after their bars close for the night.  Even though I had lived in Upstate NY for a year I actually heard about Beef on Weck from here, not Buffalo.  Now I make sure to get it when I go back up there, but I like Lebowski's Beef on Weck and Lebowski Burger.  The place caters to the northern transplant crowd and is packed when the buffalo football and hockey teams are playing.  There is a full menu of white russian type drinks.  The daily specials are usually a good deal too.My biggest issue is the parking lot is almost always a cluster.
Karey's Kitchen=Kareys Kitchen...a new takeout fusion restaurant near me in PHX..yay~! I attended the soft opening and got to sample all of the filipino/mexican fusion tasties! The family is so friendly that you leave Kareys feeling all warm inside.., whether from the food or the family, and your wallet not too hit! Cassava cake is the bomb..even though Im not to into sweets.. A bit hard to see from the street ..next to Blockbuster on 40th.. look for it..its worth it:-)Went Friday to take advantage of the special lechon (roasted pig).    I found the cafe cozy- nice, dark wood furniture and dark wood blinds.  Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler!  I found the high counter a little daunting- I, being only 5 feet tall, had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down, or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter, and have a look through the sneeze-guard.  Their labeling system needs improvement: I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line.  I'm sorry, but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order, food laid out in huge trays and placed in "turo-turo" style ISN'T food cooked-to-order!Here is a list of the food I tried that day:1. Lechon, large order $6.99- includes corn tortilla (I subbed flour) and  choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice.  (I chose Filipino, of course!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg#SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg2. 3-entree combo of Dinuguan ("chocolate stew"), Beef Mechado, and Pork Adobo $- includes garlic rice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ#Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ3. Lumpia shanghai (fried Filipino pork eggrolls)- small order includes 8 pcs. of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ#HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ4. Halo-halo $4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans, coconut strings, coco jellies, ube (taro-based pudding), coconut milk, choice of ice cream, and shaved ice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA#cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA5. Pan of cassava $8- Cassava is a root, much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream, butter, eggyolks, and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish.  Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie... A little help here, Joel?  6.  To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan, each $3I found all the entrees and eggrolls, save the mechado (meat was a little tough), very tender and very tasty (loved the dinuguan!).  However, they're ALL very greasy, unfortunately!  I'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again... Everytime I ate them, they came back to haunt me, and all due to the high grease and salt content.  A coworker came for her first visit (with her husband and stepdaughter. as well) after I had left, and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty, as well as the other dishes she tried there, but couldn't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet.  Karen, Rey, and Purine, as well as Michael, were all very friendly and accomodating, this is true.I would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again, but I won't eat any of it until I'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat, reheat, and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time.  Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes.  They are very tasty, but I have to be careful...  Or I could enjoy them fresh, but without much of the sauce.What my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again!  This dessert, similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau, tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients, instead of from a bottled mix of beans, coco strings and jello.  I liked the ice cream they used, too.  You have your choice of either ube, vanilla, or mango.  I'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors...  As a special, Karen had prepared ginataan, a warm dessert consisting of plantains, jackfruit, coco strings, taro, and something akin to yams, cooked in coconut milk and sugar.  This looked and smelled so very good, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies.  I wonder if Joel had a sample?  I know he enjoyed the cassava... I did, likewise.As for the lechon, I'm sad to report that the skin wasn't crispy at all, and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin.  It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like.  A faint hint, but still there, nonetheless.  The pork meat didn't wow me, either.  A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce, which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler (or at Mekong in Mesa).  Awesome sauce, just ask Joel!  I'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce (I stayed away from it bec. I wasn't sure of the ingredients at the time).I will definitely be back to try their daily specials.  I do hope that Karen and the others strive to lessen the grease content of their dishes...Lunched here Monday.  Had read all of the reviews, so expectations were high.  And they lived up to them..About the place.  Family run, mother/daughter combo.  The son handles the web site and Twitter posts (check Twitter for daily specials).  They were very nice.  The mom kept bringing me food I didn't even order, just because I told her I would eventually try it.The food:  I ordered a 3 item combo.  I was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so I could taste one more dish.  The chicken adabo was very simple and good.  Won't overwhelm you with flavor.  It is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  The spicy orange beef was very good.  Daily special I believe.  Very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  Also tried the beef mechado, which I am told is one of their better burritos.  The potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  I expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.They also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!Go try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..I'd like to thank the good Lord above for bringing another filipino restaurant to the valley! (And for yelp for letting me know about it)I visited Karey's tonight because I had that hankerin' for filipino and since it was close to work and was getting great reviews I decided, hell yes!After finding the tucked away business, I was warmly greeted by Karen and her brother. She told me of the already prepared food that she had and if there were something else I had in mind, she would happily prepare it for me. I decided on tha chicken adobo burrito with garlic rice and lumpia. I asked her about some other filipino dishes, she said she still had some pinakbet (a meat and vegetable stew) so I ordered that as well.Now, I ordered this to go but I live in Gilbert so I was a little wary if the lumpia was still going to have it's crispyness to it after my commute home. The delicious little guys made it home and still had their delightful crunch to them. Next was a bite of the burrito. The chicken was very tender and not dried out like sometimes adobo can get. It also didn't have the sometimes overpowering bite of vinegar that is common in adobo. It had a nice balanced taste that lended it well for making burritos with. The pinakbet was a bit of a dissappointment, it was little on the bland and dry side, but I am judging this on how my mother used to make it.I asked about any specials coming up, like lechon, and she said that in a couple of weeks they're going to have another lechon roast. She also said that if there was anything that isn't on the menu and if she knows of the recipe, she would be glad to prepare it, all you need to do is call. Karey's is going into my full rotation even if it's a good half hour away!Considering the Spanish influence on both Mexican and Filipino cooking, it is a wonder that no one had thought of bringing the two cuisines together in one dining establishment sooner. Well, Karey's Kitchen did, and they did it so well! (Again, thanks to yelp for allowing me to find yet another great place!) The Filipino dishes made me homesick for The Old Country, especially when I tasted the the pochero and the mechado. But I was so delighted to discover that making Filipino adobo or mechado into burritos would result in a kick-ass fantastic fusion, especially when paired with their zesty mango salsa. Unlike other places that also serve burritos, they serve the rice and the salsa on the side, so you have the option of adding it to your burrito if you want to cut the richness a tad. Great food, low prices, very warm and friendly staff ... Karey's Kitchen, you know I'll be coming back soon, and often!This latest hybrid might sound different but after trying the Filipino-Mexican fusion at Karey's Kitchen, you'll ask yourself why no one had done it sooner?Situated at the southeast corner behind Blockbuster at 40th Street and Thomas Road, Karey's is in one of those blink-and-miss-it locations. From the good luck kitty at the register to the rich looking hardwood floors and dark wood furniture, it's actually charming. There are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in, and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more.Karen, once an accountant, has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture, which includes her mom, Puring, husband, Ray, and brother, Michael.It brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent. The warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming. Karen and Puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook.For the unfamiliar, many Filipino foods consist of stews, braises and roasts of beef, pork and chicken, which work perfectly for this concept. For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items, or you can go for something more unconventional, yet accessible, like many of its tasty hybrid burritos, chimichangas and flautas.I must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone. If there is something on the menu you find yourself craving, maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day. Sourcing top quality has been tough, and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another.Daily specials play a large part of Karey's menu, and there are always three to five specials per day. If you'd like to know about those dishes, you can choose to follow Karey's Kitchen on Twitter.On one visit I created my own three-item combo ($5.99), which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs. The barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor.I also chose the chicken curry, which was fall-off, the bone tender and not heavy like most I've tried.To round off the combo, I chose the pancit, which is the Filipino version of Chinese lo mein. Though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles, it has a lighter sauce. Of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp.The pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures.Adobo is to the Philippines as Pho is to Vietnam. Essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the Philipines by the Spanish in the 1500s, it has become the national dish.Karey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats. You can have this in a combo or rice bowl, but do yourself a favor and get the Pork Adobo Burrito ($5.99). A huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in Parmesan cheese. With the outside rolled in cheese, it adds a depth to the burrito that I've never quite experienced.With the burrito you also have your choice of Spanish rice, white rice, garlic rice or beans. The Spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful, but my favorite were the creamy beans. Karey's doesn't have a traditional Mexican salsa but instead chooses to use Asian chili paste. The spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish I tried.I love eggrolls in about any shape and form, including Karey's outstanding Filipino version called Lumpia ($2.95/$4.95). These are smaller than what you'd normally expect at an Asian restaurant, but the crunch factor is far bigger. Simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce, these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light.Keeping with the hybrid fusion theme, desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories. The Halo Halo ($4.95) is made of shaved ice, beans, purple yams, sweetened condensed milk and ice cream.Okay, I know, it sounds a little crazy, and when it is served, the first thing that comes up is, "What have I gotten myself into?"This dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers. Once you brave the first bite, it won't be your last. Creamy, icy, tender and smooth, it's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once. I have a feeling I'll be having another one on my next visit.Ask about Puring's Cassava Cake ($1.29). It's served warm and is made from shredded cassava, coconut milk and sugar.From the crispy lumpia to the tender, melt-in-your-mouth adobo, Karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated, like family.lumpia! lumpia! lumpia!I feel as though I have died and gone to LUMPIA heaven.  They are tricky to make-- just really time consuming and it leaves yuor kitchen messy so eating them when you didn't make them yourself is such a treat! We started off with lumpia and then had the pancit.  Panict was not 5 star--- I like mine more dry, so the one I make at home is better in my opinion.  But it was still really good.HALO HALO-- oh my!  I have not had halo halo since 1993 so the minute it hit my mouth, an entire flash of memories came back to me!  It's very interesting and has a lot going on in it, some stuff I love, other stuff, I pick around.  I can't wait to go back and try the adobo, and some of the more mexican type foods.The people working-- owner and family are sooo nice and really friendly, that makes for an excellent experience!I am looking at my schedule seeing when I can get back there again---Karey's Kitchen was my very first Yelp bookmark. Isn't that sweet? There was a big lull in my afternoon yesterday, a lull in which I had not eaten lunch, and yet, it was still much too early for dinner. I decided that this was the perfect time to head over to 40th St. and Thomas, and knock one more bookmark off of my ever-expaning panoply. Karey's Kitchen is located on the southeast corner of 40th St. and Thomas, somewhat hidden behind a rogue Blockuster. There are many other businesses occupying its strip mall, but when I rolled up at about 3:30 in the afternoon, the entire parking lot was empty. Like, the whole thing. Mine was the single, solitary vehicle present. I'm sure it's a hub of activity at other times of the day, but apparently the middle of the afternoon renders the street corner a veritable ghost town. The restaurant is small, and cute inside. It's clean and cheery, without being bright and antiseptic. I was greeted by a friendly lady who offered me several delicious samples, because it was my first time visiting! Is there any better introduction? Another very friendly gentleman joined her, and asked me how I came to hear about Karey's Kitchen. I told him that I read about it on the internet, and he said, "OH! On Yelp?!" I like it when Yelp comes up in my daily life. It's fun. They were both very kind to me, and very interested in explaining the dishes to me. Ultimately, I ordered a three item combo with garlic fried rice. Chicken Adobo, Beef Calidereta, and the Chicken Coconut Curry. I also snagged a square of Cassava cake. A brief disclaimer: I do not have a sophisticated palate. I like my meals to have flavor. A LOT of flavor. Subtleties are generally wasted on me.Delicious. Everything was absolutely delicious. The Chicken Adobo was definitely my favorite, but the other two were very, very good...things I would certainly order again. Every item was totally bursting with flavor, and I was in a food coma before I even finished eating. Scrumptious and savory. The Cassava cake was a perfect ending to the meal - it has an enjoyable, thick texture, and is not too sweet. I loved everything that I ate, and can't wait to scurry back next week and try something new. Maybe the Lumpia...but definitely with a Chicken Adobo burrito and garlic rice. Yes. Sir.Ps: The guy working there told me they will soon be offering Adobo sandwiches...apparently, people ask for them a lot. You heard it here first!Alexander does right again! Please do not hate for the 4 star not 5, as they are worthy but missed it by a little fraction. I had the 2 items with rice. I enjoyed the Chicken Adobo, a favorite of mine, and the Chicken afritada, which was suggested by the owners. Both were really good, I had hope the meat was a little bit more tender, but the flavor was there. The fried (garlic) rice was really good. I asked a bunch of questions and they were more then happy to answer them. One thing to ask about is the Pancit instead of rice, we can get rice anywhere, but not the pancit. I was also a little bummed they only serve the lumpia is a group, you cannot order one with a meal. (unless you want the veggie lumpia. As previous mentioned the place is on the South East corner and on the south west of the complex. Enjoy.... I did.Based on the Yelp reviews it had received, we all went to visit Karey's Kitchen yesterday for lunch. This is the second new Filipino place we have tried in as many weeks. The place is very small, but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais). We went after traditional lunch-rush hours, so it was not too cramped. I'm actually glad they opted for a small location. Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead, so it's good they are keeping their expenses low. We had our toddler with us, so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well.We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great. I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta--both were excellent, as was the garlic rice I had on the side. My wife and niece, who are both Filipinas, also were impressed with the food--especially the cassava cake, which they raved about. Karey's also offers Mexican-Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time, but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review. The service was also outstanding--super-friendly and fast. My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch. Living in a Fil-Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food. My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express), so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook--and as for me, well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there. So, we order take-out food frequently. Along with Wholly Grill, we now have two new staples. I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT!I'm giving Karey's five stars based on the fact that the food was good, the service was fast, and the owners were super-friendly. That goes a long way in my book.To paraphrase Carl Sagan..."In order to create fillipino/mexican fusion cusine, you must first invent the universe"   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbcYou will want to give that vid a look and a listen...preferably while enjoying some roasted piggy prepared by the utterly adorable Karey and friends:)I had lunch with friends today at Karey's:)A little lunch, a little solving of the worlds problems (without benefit of alcohol, this time:) even a discussion of the the galactic issues that confront us all (did you know that there is an excellent chance that the Milky Way Galaxy...our home...will collide with another galaxy (Andromeda), soon?!?!?Less than 3.5 billion years...things could get very dicey!Until then, whistle over to the SE corner of of 40th St. and Thomas Rd. and drop by and visit Karey.She gave us samples (since who among us understands what fillipino/mexican fusion really is?I will tell you what it is...it is really good!I enjoyed samples of chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, the aformentioned piggy, beef mechado (no I didn't do that from memory...I took a menu:)I was sorely tempted to to have the "all the above" platter, but I controlled myself:)Pork adobo, Beef mechado and garlic rice, along with a shared order of lumpia egg rolls...just delightful:-)I am happy to report that Karey's was busy during the entire lunch hour...I am also happy to report that Karey brought us a delightful little dessert cake to try...I did enjoy my lunch today:)In the universe I've invented, single malt scotch flows like water, I have no need for tax attorneys and fillipino/mexican fusion cooking at Karey's Kitchen is here to stay:)When you invent your own universe, be sure to include Karey's Kitchen...I might want to visit with you at lunch someday:)I've never heard of Filipino-Mexican fusion.  (Filican?  Mexipino?  FiliMex?)  I joined friends Donald and Mark (Donark?  Monald?) here for a nice Friday lunch.The folks here were friendly and hospitable (Fraspitable? Hofriendly?) when we came in and offered sample tastes of several dishes.  We tried chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, beef mechado and the special, roasted pork.  As in roasted pig.  A whole pig, roasted on site.  In my head I heard Christopher Walken blurt his patented "Wow."Everything was tasty.  I went with a platter of two meats and garlic rice.  I chose the chicken coconut curry and the pork adobo.  The meats were tender and well sauced.   Savory and aromatic.  Savormatic?  Aromavory?As we were finishing they brought over a slice of cassava cake, sliced for three.  Very sweet.  (The gesture and the cake.)  When we ordered I had asked if the cassava cake was similar to flan because it looked a bit like flan.  It's not.  It has more depth and texture and substantial vegetable flavor to it.  Good stuff.I think Karey's gets 4 stars.  This is a place that could take their food to the 5 star level.  All of the dishes were really good but tasted like they were going for a milder, more mainstream version of the full bright flavor potential.  My advice is to keep doing what they are doing, only more.A few weeks back.. waking from a migraine fog and haze of migraine meds.. I seriously was jones'n for Kareys rice! I had a friend drive me.. Intro'd my friend to Karen... who gave samples and  her friendly beyond friendly personality.. that speaks volumes in a society whos forgotten the value of customer service! Im always trying new things when in Kareys.. this time roasted pork, curry to go, and of course, my craving for the fried rice....and wow! I think my migraine got better... because a 5 is the best thing for that:-)I am on a roll when it comes to trying new (well to me anyway) cuisine across the Valley. Today at work, my coworker and wonderful friend Vicky mentioned how she wanted to try Kareys Kitchen. I went on Yelp, read the reviews (especially from people that I really trusted) and I couldn't wait to go. Walking in there (remind me please to always check the website and menu before I go into the unknown!) I was highly confused on what to order. The words Chicken, Beef, and Pork rang a bell to me, but not the words Caldereta, Tinola, and Asado. One of the owners, the ever helpful and super sweet Rey (the wife's name is Karen - hence the name Kareys Kitchen) let me try three sample tastes. The Chicken Adobo and the Beef Caldereta were amazing, but I ended up getting the Chicken Coconut Curry with steamed rice. The curry wasn't overbearing at all...in fact it was made just right. Vicky order the 2 combination plate of Dinuguan and Pinakbet with steamed rice. (And let me tell you that you will never go hungry with the amount of rice that they serve!) I tried the Dinuguan...it was alright to me...but I am not a big pork fan. She loved it, though she was used to more of a spicier taste (Though the Pinakbet had bitter melon in it - ewww not a good after taste) I also ordered a piece of their Cassava cake...but I was so full I only at a couple of bites. I took the rest home with me...what I had it was really good. I am scared about when the word of mouth becomes so widespread that this place will get so crowded that it will start to become annoying to go there. Basically, the cafe is very small...cozy for now...Spectacular service, meet Above-average Food. Although I don't know what that equals, its unique for sure.  You don't get this kind of friendly, overly-anxious to please ('officious' for you vocab buffs) service in too many PHX restaurants unless you are willing to pay for it.I took my family to Karey's Kitchen a couple of weeks back because it was on Yelp's HOT list forever and because lumpia are like a siren to me (The Odyssey sirens, not the police car kind). We walk in and it was as if someone threw us into some foreign third-world country for lunch. The outside tables looked like an injury waiting to happen, and the inside (though VERY clean) had a feel of 'frugal budget' to it. Nonetheless, we walk up to the counter to see what goodies were bubbling for our pleasure.  The young girl was extremely nice, and was feeding us samples of everything from BBQ pork to strips of steak and chicken.  Everything tasted pretty good so we decided to order.You order in a kind of Panda Express style with a bowl of rice and one-three choices of meat.  I got the chicken adobo (i think) and the BBQ pork (my favorite)... we also ordered a small batch of lumpia (it comes with like 10 of them!)The only thing I was disappointed in (taste-wise) was the lumpia.  It had a plain hamburger taste to it.  I was hoping for something with a little more flavor.Karey was a delight! She chatted with us as we ate and suggested some sauces (The Banana Sauce rox!)... She also said she roasts a pig every other Friday. I have GOT to try that!!!All-in-all, it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely try it again!I've only been here once, but due to the fact that the food was excellent and the experience was wonderful, I have to give up the 5th star.  To say I am a picky eater would certainly be an understatement, so I really have no idea what was going on in my head when I decided to try Karey's Kitchen.  I pretty much hate Mexican food and have no idea what Filipino food is, so this was pretty daring for me.When we came in it was empty, thankfully, so we got to sample lots of food and ask all of our stupid questions to the super sweet girl behind the counter.  She wasn't shy about offering her recommendations when I asked, and I really appreciated that.  After tasting a bunch of dishes I decided on the Chicken Adobo Burrito.  It came with a side of garlic rice and chips and salsa.  The salsa I didn't eat because that's just too far out of my comfort zone.  The rice was good, but I honestly wouldn't mind if there was more garlic in it.  The burrito was absolutely heavenly!  I'm the kind of girl who likes stuff pretty plain.  Just the meat and cheese thank you very much.  To my surprise, that is exactly the way my burrito came... stuffed with chicken and loaded with ooey gooey cheese!  It was even covered in something that tasted like paremesan crumbs.  Yum!I really cannot wait to go back here and try something new and maybe overcome a few more of my culinary fears.
Sonora Mesquite Grill=I like reading about food and restaurants...no question about it.Some of my friends write the best stuff about carne asada, amuse bouche, foie gras and other gastro-porn delights (if there can be gastro-pubs, then there can be gastro-porn).When my buddy, Hotdish, wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada, I knew that I needed to try it out myself!Really, it's not like I'm just following Joel around, eating lunch where he eats lunch, having drinks where he has drinks, going to the movies where he goes to the movies...well you get my drift...it's a complete coincidence that I just happen to show up at the same places at the same times!I follow lots of you around...via Yelp (so you don't need to be too worried that I'll show up at your respective houses).But you could frankly do worse than to stalk Joel and eat at the places he recommends...the man finds some gems and he really knows his victuals!So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had (and I've had some good stuff, believe you me).I've been back 3 or 4 times since I first dropped by and it's so damn cute...Selena, the owner, greets me like a long lost son every time...and she never remembers that I've been in before!That cracks me up!Selena is like my wise Latina mom (well, except for the fact she's younger than I am...and I'm not really as Latin as I look in my profile picture)...she is so sweet!And...she makes everything from the carne asada and barbacoa to the charro beans, salsa and guacamole, herself...fresh...from scratch...every day (BTW, the folks at the Mission need to drop by and get a Guacamole making and pricing lesson from Selena...$1.50 for the same size side of guac that costs $15.00 at Mission...and isn't as good...maybe you're paying to watch it made at Mission).It's hard for me to recommend any one thing...the taco's are sublime, the quesa's are wonderful, the charro beans and rice are among the best in town...the carne asada is (as Joel testified) some of the best around...in short...Sonora Mesquite is a wonderful little find...and heavily in the current lunchtime, retox rotation.Drop by, say "hola!" to Selena and have a taco or a quesadilla...tell her I sent you...she won't remember who the hell I am, but that's OK...she'll treat you like family anyway!if you haven't eaten lunch yet, i suggest you get your cute little butt over to sonora right now. i had the carne asada taco combo on flour tortillas. It comes with two tacos and rice and beans. I also got fresh guac. aaannnnd i was coaxed into the mexican version of bingsoo (the mexican version is better in my opinion) I had to get it to-go and head back to work... and since my hands were full of that delicious little fruity icee treat, the lovely lady working carried my lunch to my car. how stinking sweet is that? she didn't want it to spill, however, spills were the theme of the day.as soon as i got in my car i forgot about that fruity concotion and stuck my elbow in it. and it tipped over and fell.then i took a sip of my drink and that went down the front of my shirt. did i mention i was wearing white? the tacos were amazing, and the beans were amazing, and the rice too. I could have used a little more heat and I am sure if I used the salsas it would have been perfect, but i didn't want to spill that all over the place so they stayed closed. the fruity dessert thing that i got was so delicious. she made me a special concotion. it was shaved ice with coconut, mango and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. if she could have just blended that with a little rum it would have been the perfect mid-work cocktail. they should seriously start blending that little treat. amazing. next time i will go back when i have time to sit and enjoy, i will also bring a bib with me since i can't seem to avoid making a huge mess all over myself.love this place. delcious.So is it awkward that I may have fallen in love with a 50 year old hispanic lady named Selena?You wouldn't think so if you met her and tasted her food at Mesquite Grill. I went there for lunch today after seeing it on Yelp's hottest restaurants and was very impressed. When I arrived it was empty so that is never a good sign. But Selena put my worries behind me. She recommended the combo platter which consisted of a carne asada taco, chicken taco, beans and rice. The tacos were out of this world. They weren't your typical street style tacos; they are so big they are almost like mini burritos. The rice and beans were good but nothing out of this world. Selena makes all the food fresh in the back and you can tell. If you are deciding between the Chipotle just across the parking lot or Sonora Mesquite...there is no question go say hi to Selena.All right guys, I'm getting a little concerned. I see the reviews and that's all well and good, but every time I go into Sonora, it's empty! After the loss of Karey's Kitchen, I feel I have to take a more proactive approach. I went to Karey's Kitchen when I was hungover all the time, but apparently a restaurant cannot live on Georgeann G.'s hangovers alone (I know, it shocked me too).Next time you think about going to Chipotle, come here instead! They can share the massive line Chipotle has from open to close every day! Don't get me wrong, I love me some Chipotle, but I don't want to lose Sonora, so I want to share the wealth a bit.That's enough of my plea. Still 5 stars. If you look at the picture of the to-go order that I just inhaled while watching a Hills marathon in my living room, you'll see why. Delicious!The owner/chef of this place sold her soul to the devil...that's the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good. So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and we've only been here once...so after a couple more visits, more than likely I'll be tacking on that coveted 5th star. We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned, a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food they're serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoa's (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food. Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:-Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.-Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm. -Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.-Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner. God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great. Overall, we were just very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily, and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks, it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to. 4.5/5.Dear every other Carne Asada spot in the 602,It's not you- it's me, not liking you anymore.Sonora Mesquite Grill is SO flavorful and delicious, it makes me grateful I wasn't chosen to go to heaven for the rapture.As others have mentioned, the carne asada is the star here. Well, that and the service. To say this place is sweet and the people are charming, is the understatement of the year. This place is owned by a Mother and her son, and both times I have been there, they have been just outstanding.Today I phoned in a takeout order, and the Mom would answer with 'Yes dear' in the sweetest, non-condescending way ever. She literally exudes warmth, and it is not only in her customer service, but also her food. The carne asada burro is tremendous. It comes with beans and rice in the burro, but I am a purist, and I ask for those items on the side, as I just want to taste carne goodness in the burro. If you order chips and salsa you get a few different salsas, a verde, rojo, and thicker rojo. The salsas are so delicious and tasty- you can taste the freshness and care that goes into it. In fact, the salsas are so amazing, if I ran out of chips- I would dip lucky charms cereal into the salsa, because anything that good you cannot waste!The restaurant is small, but impeccably clean, and care is taken throughout the establishment to keep guests comfortable. The food is very, very good, and it is so cool to have business owners so proud of their product, and at Sonora Mesquite Grill- they have much to proud of.Also not to be missed is their fresh made lemonade. I read here on Yelp that it was tasty- and my fellow Yelpers did not let me down. It is very fresh and tasty- without being too sweet.The only thing I am curious about is that they serve bagged tortilla chips, as opposed to making them fresh. Not the end of the world, just kind of curious. I would recommend if they can't make their own, to consider using the 'My Nanas' chips, or another type which is more consistent with Mexican restaurants. This is just minutia, and doesn't change anything, the place is just that good. Try for yourself, you will not be disappointed. Ciao!Taco tuesdays never looked so good!or tasted so good for that matter.The rumors are true, the hype is justified and the myth is in the making.SMG is what everyone says, and couldnt be more deserving of all the praises fellow yelpers have heaped onto them; they are ab-fab.From the second I walked in I was greeted with smiles and warmth, in fact throughout my meal I felt an extreme sense of deja vu, it wasnt until the ride home that I realized that the owner and my grandmother might in fact be long lost twins separated at birth! All kidding aside, the owner is one sweet little lady, talk about customer service oy vay!The Carne Asada? game over. Hands down the best in the valley.When I ordered my taco platter I didnt even specify what delicious type of meat I'd wanted, she looked at me, smiled, and knowingly suggested the carne asada, to which I heartily agreed. The calibre of the food here is just incredible. So good that it could probably cure rascism. NO.JOKE.If sheriff joe ate here, he'd probably repent hole-heartedly, doubling down on his knees prostrating himself on the floor and weeping the sorry tears of a man whose seen his folly and begs forgiveness. I would challenge any white supremacist to eat here and say one bad thing about Mexico afterward. Sonora Mesquite Grill is the solution to Arizona's bad rap, sure we can produce ignorant rascist laws like SB-1070, but hey, we also have places like Sonora Mesquite Grill! Sonora Mesquite Grill is The Jesus, and nobody fucks with the Jesus.Aye Dios Mios!  I think I have died and gone to carne asada heaven. The reviews were right, Sonora Grill is astounding! I was so impressed with everything I ordered. The carne asada, hands down is the best in the valley. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole... Oh the guacamole... Mas deliciosa! While the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the 3 salsas I devoured. I was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most Mexican meals. At Sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu. Qué bueno! The girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff. If I owned a restaurant I would try and steal her away! This is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation.
Roma Deli II and Wine Shop=Please, someone tell me what I am missing here? My family loves Italian food. LOVES LOVES LOVES IT. Being super carb sensitive (I think about carbs and I gain 5 lbs. Eating Italian is the bane of my existence for this very reason.The premise is nice. A family run, Italian deli. I can dig that. We entered, were instantly greeted, I checked in on Yelp (the Elite thang to do), and perused the menu. I was shocked at the prices. A simple pasta dish was $14.99. For PASTA?  None of their dishes came with soup or salad to justify the high cost. Anyway, my family ordered, freshly baked bread arrived. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. I had once slice and savored it. This was the best part of the meal. We each had ordered a cup of soup (70 degree weather in late May justifies as cool enough for soup in my book) They were all  homemade and they were all awful, My pasta e fagoli was nothing but a weird broth, white beans, and pasta. The minestrone was vegetable soup with pasta. The chicken soup was hopeful, but it didn't have any real flavor. Each cup of soup was an additional $5. Decent sized cups, but when the flavor is lackluster...Next come our entrees. The stuffed pepper was the only tasty thing ordered, a bit salty, but had a rich complexity in flavor profile and texture. I ordered the four cheese risotto. It was far too salty and thankfully my mama put some of her yummy stuffed pepper sauce into my dish and it perked it up a bit. The risotto was cooked a little too short, it was not to the point of al dente (which to my knowledge is how all noodles in Italian restaurants are served). The other dished ordered was the baked rigatoni. Pasta, greasy meat sauce, and a layer of cheese. Ekk!  I tried a bit of it and I swear this AM after brushing my teeth last night and again this AM, I still feel a thin layer of grease on the roof on my mouth (okay, I'm being dramatic). These dishes all ranged from $14.99 to $18.99. I don't understand. Pasta, tomatoes, and buying bulk cheese isn't that expensive. All of the food was wrapped up and taken to go. Again, portions are HUGE, but when the food doesn't taste good, it's just even more of a waste.Service was great. Attentive. Informative. So kudos there. However, $90 for 3 people to eat at an Italian Deli is ludicrous in my mind. Especially when I would rather eat at Olive Garden and it would have been far more satisfying and lighter on the wallet. The restaurant was also very loud. The high ceilings and the absence of a wall in the dining area amplified noise level. I feel like I was robbed eating here. I ate carbs for you, Roma! Carbs! And I gained about 20 lbs while writing this review because of all the thinking and writing about carbs!
Maximum Flavor Pizza Shop=Maximum Flavor Pizza is slightly falsely named.  Nothing here really has maximum flavor, but it is maximum cheap for the area.  I frequent Craig St when I am starving between classes, and Sophia H. and I tested this place out.I ordered a slice of pizza and jalapeno poppers, which came to a grand total of $5.58 with tax.  The slice of pizza was ok and super reasonably priced.  The poppers were not so good, and I would not order them again.  My recommendation is to stick to the slices of cheese pizza for a cheap and filling meal!Service was a touch gruff on our visit.
Egg Works=I met clients here for bfast since they open early. There were four in our party and the waitress was attentive and friendly.Being a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.I won't let this negative experience keep me away from Egg Works - hopefully the next experience will be better.This isn't really directed at Egg Works, but instead it is more me pondering the mystique of breakfast spots. I mean, there are many things I will never understand and among those is the draw these type of places seem to have. There is nothing on the menu that one could not whip up themselves. So, I just don't understand people willing to wait 30+ minutes to eat an omelet or another equally rudimentary breakfast food.So, on a handful of occasions when the wait time was not ridiculous I've had a chance to try this place. They have a large menu and their service is solid. I am also a fan of the endless coffee refills.  I have had their basic eggs breakfast, sampled several of the omelets, and most recently highly enjoyed their carnitas rancheros menu item. Everything is fine, and that is pretty much the most you can expect out of these joints...hence why I don't understand the hype or the wait times.  The food is fine, the prices are fine, the service is fine...is it worth waiting 30+ minutes for? Heck no.We have officially lived in Las Vegas for a year.How have we never been to Egg Works before now??We literally live right down the street and we drive by this location almost every single day. I'm honestly ashamed of myself.Now I have seen this place on a weekend and it is crazy packed! But, being a Tuesday mid morning we were seated right away and it had a decent flow of customers.Maya (our wonderful server) came and greeted us right away. One of the things that stood out to me the most about our entire experience is that everyone working there seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Everyone was bubbly and all smiles and it definitely made for a great dining experience!The hubby ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet and I had what I would describe as being their personal take on Biscuits and Gravy.Everything was delicious! We especially loved their potatoes, they had a wonderful seasoning with a light kick!Another major bonus is when you check in on yelp you get a free Banana Nut Muffin! So moist and tasty!!This place is Eggcellent! After reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.Apparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.This location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place. When we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!Upon scanning the menu, I decided to get the "Sundance Special", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........One of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.With my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!Overall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.The menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM.I went to Egg Works for the first time a few months ago and I just didn't care for the flavor at all, plus our food was cold but since this place has so many amazing reviews, I decided to wait for a review till I tried them one more time. It took me a few months but I just recently went back and now I totally understand the hype! Great prices, good flavor and portions and many locations. I decided to go with the Chicken Fried Steak since I'm not an omelet fan and my boyfriend went with the Waffle Works. So I'm a little weird with scrambled eggs, I like them slightly undercooked if that makes sense. I always thought places made them so rubbery and dry but this place makes them perfectly the way I like them! Soft and fluffy but not watery or rubbery. Their seasoned potatoes were also pretty addictive and the gravy on the Chicken Fried Steak was seasoned perfectly and had the perfect texture. One thing that made me really happy, the breading didn't slide off the steak! Whoo! My boyfriend's waffle was also nice and sweet with soft chewiness and I liked that they offered sausage patties. We also both checked in on Yelp to get 1 free Banana Nut Muffin each!!! Awesome! So warm and flavorful! Our server was also great and had a good sense of humor, she made us laugh a few times. Overall, Egg Works doesn't offer any crazy menu items but simple can definitely be better if executed right. Also, there are soo many different options to choose from! Benedicts, Omelets, Pancakes, Waffles, Scrambles, Skillets, Sandwiches, Crepes, Salads, Soups, Burgers, even Enchiladas, Burritos, and Spaghetti! Basically, if you're looking to have breakfast with even the pickiest of eaters, they'll find something they like here!
Paradise Bakery & Cafe=I never tasted "Paradise" until a recent visit to Arizona. They have some slogan about being known for their cookies. I felt like the gauntlet was thrown, so I took up the challenge. I decided to get two chocolate chip cookies. The clerk working here was nice and gave me two for the price of one since it was near the end of the day. The cookies didn't look incredible, but looks can be deceiving. In this case, they weren't.Mr. L and I waited until our Greyhound Bus ride to Tucson to try them. They were too sugary and did not taste good. We weren't interested in finishing them - not worth the calories nor the effort of chewing. Mr. L said Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chip Cookies were better, not that Pepperidge Farm cookies are the pinnacle of greatness or bad either, but I expected better from a bakery that brags about their cookies. The cookies were the perfect 2 star complement to sitting by the bathroom on the back of the Greyhound Bus. Instead of finding paradise in the cookie form, it was more like "Paradise Lost."
Burke in the Box=So, I love all things Top Chef in any of its various forms, and I am trying to have a Top Chef food baby before I die.  I am slowly but surely working my way up to this goal with much planning.  So imagine my surprise -- nay, sheer delight -- when I espied in McCarran Airport Terminal D, David Burke's "Burke in the Box."  Whaaa?  Since it was 10:20 in the morning, I was nursing a hang- and gambling-over, and we had almost two hours to kill before our flight, I thought breakfast here (at a Top Chef-touched eatery in the *airport*!!) would really scratch a lot of itches.  All it did was irritate.After drooling over the breakfast menu (I couldn't *wait* to sink my teeth into a pretzel bread eggwhite sammie with tomato, 'shrooms, and feta), the server informed us breakfast was over at 10 and we were now on the lunch menu.  I'm sorry, breakfast ends at TEN did you say??  I get that this is Vegas and time doesn't really exist/count here, but on what planet -- besides high schools -- do people eat lunch at 10:05?  So I ended up ordering a *ten dollar* tuna sandwich and husband ended up ordering a Caesar salad.Wow, David Burke.  Just...wow.  Salad was romaine, cuke, tomato, Asiago (completely unconventional ingredients in a Caesar) and KEN'S DRESSING IN A BAGGIE.  So boring husband kept dozing off in the *plastic bowl* it came in and nearly poking himself in the eye with the *plastic cutlery*.  My sandwich was fine -- the tuna salad itself was actually quite good, with all white meat albacore, capers, celery, onion, and a touch of mayo -- but the rye bread was really thick and really dry so I ended up just eating the salad off of it.  The fries it came with were crispy and golden but didn't have a ton of flavor, and the *tissue thin paper napkin* couldn't keep up with my greasy fingers.  I overheard another waitress telling a different table that for $1 extra they could add Asiago and truffle oil to their fries.  Gimme a break, Burke.  Truffle oil fries and Ken's baggie dressing on the same menu?  Make up your mind.Service was actually pretty good, especially since it was our server's second day.  He was on top of the ball and we never had to wait long for anything.  He even swooped in with a drink refill before I had the chance to open my big mouth.Best part about Burke in the Box?  Watching the Bears hand the Cowboys their butts on home turf.[Top Chef: David Burke]quick lunch before a flight...sports on the screens...a bar for drinks...tables for dining...taking a soda $3.99 and reuben $12.39...steep prices for a soda, but with quick refills...sandwich quite small....pastrami quite chewy...fries decent...$21 total after tax and tip...seeing a hot dog at a neighboring table and quite impressed with the size...if you are hungry and just want something super filling, get the hot dog or sausage...that was monstrous...
HARRY O's BBQ=I guess I should have known a new location wasn't gonna change anything.I had even been warned by my fellow co-workers that had already eaten here...BUTI had to try it myself...it's BBQ and it's in my office building..there such huge potential upside.They told me it was small,pricy and just OK.Well I stopped in after work This place is attached to the Sand Dollar Lounge a blues bar next door, so Harry's has no restrooms but for some reason it still has the smell.I still stayed and I got the Beef Brisket with 2 sides for $10.95 and 2 catfish tacos for $5.95I was the only customer but they were making it fresh so it was gonna be 15 minutes.I wandered around and checked out the small dine-in area they had a jukebox and vinyl records & autographed photos of soul legends everywhere.The waitress was real friendly when she had to break it to us they were out of cilantro & onion for the tacos so they would be dry as a bone. no tartar or lemon offered, just some sour-looking  salsa.The beef brisket was actually as little as a school lunch sandwich with a ice cream scoop of mac n cheese on the side and 5 hushpuppies.The mac n cheese looked strange from the go, but after tasting it I had to spit it out. Dry, gritty like sand and where is the cheese?? Stay away from the mac!! You have been warned.The brisket was more like pot roast smothered in super sweet and watery sauce. Not my kind of BBQ.The hushpuppies were good-crispy but soft and flavorful in the milddle.The catfish was dirty tasting and kinda rubbery. I didn't eat them all & I wouldn't try them again. I hate dirt tasting fish.I should have listened....pricy($28.95 full rack ribs),small portions and nothing special about it BBQ.Why you ask? After all I gave it 1 star last time around. As I mentioned before it is the ONLY eatery in walking distance from the business park I work in. So reluctantly I entered through their doors again. First thing I noticed upon entering was the wall sized paper menu with black magic marker drawn through half of the menu items. Looks like the nixed all the appetizers,salads,hamburgers,catfish tacos and OKRA. Raised Sweet Potato Pie to $3.95/slice. Well the only things you can get on the NEW menu for under $5 is Seasoned Fries for $3.95 or Hot Link Samich w/side of potato chips or potato salad. I went for the later-BBQ Hot Link Samich w/potato salad.$3.95-Not bad. I was completely suprised to see a poppy seed HAMBURGER bun when I opened my to-go container since I had ordered a link. They slice the link into pepperoni thin slices and smother it in super spicy but bland bbq sauce and a doughy bun. WTF!! :( I had faith that by ordering a link I was playing it safe, I mean how the F*#% can you screw up a HOT LINK Samich. Harry O's has figured it out. Slice it to shit,smother it and pretend it's bbq. Bad location, competing with super popular Polaris Street Cafe and the taco truck in the neighborhood. Food is way overpriced takes way too long -I mean Famous Dave's has a full rack rib meal for $20. Here they want $30 and I never smelled any smoke in this place. What gives?!? Definitely not worth the money or the wait. 1/2 star for giving it a go.
Apple Dumpling Cafe=I had such high hopes for this place.  Let me start off by saying that I am a breakfast person and very particular.  Breakfast ingredients are cheap and there are not that many unique combinations so it is an absolute necessity that it be done right.  If you are thinking, "Oh! That's me!", this is not the place for you.First, the staff was friendly but not overly excited or very apologetic that it took 30 minutes to get our food.  It was also unpleasantly warm inside the restaurant.  I might be able understand if the place had been crowded, but it wasn't.  It was half empty at 11 am on a Saturday.The food was not especially cheap for the quality.  I had the ham steak breakfast which was nearly $10 for ham, eggs, toast, and potatoes.  Here are some thoughts from my meal and what else was ordered at our table:  The ham was tasty but it was sliced ham and not a ham steak.  My over easy eggs were browned* .  The toast was cold*.  The pancakes were fluffy but dry like a biscuit and not spongy.  The home fries were tasteless and undercooked*, unless you like hard potatoes.  The "cream" for the coffee wasn't cream, it was milk.  The sausage patties used were the cheap ones you can buy frozen at Walmart and hardly qualify as meat. I let out a sigh of relief when we stepped out into the open air; glad to be finally free from waiting for someone to take payment while enjoying the cool breeze rushing across the back of my legs, cooling them as it evaporated the moisture built up from an hour of sitting on a cushion in an over-warm room.  The joy of this moment left me with one final utterance, "Eff that place."On the bright side, this has motivated me to start writing reviews instead of only reading them.* denotes things about a breakfast that would make me want to punch a kitten.Had breakfast this morning at Apple Dumpling and found a hair in my biscuits and gravy.  I pulled it out but then could not eat because it made me sick, so I put it back.   Mentioned it to the server and the cook came out and told me that I put the hair in the food.  I explained to him what I had done, but he continued to blame me for the hair.  With the added burnt pancakes, cold eggs and a late kids meal, we will never visit this place again.Bad service and bad food....it's a shame that yelp does not allow no stars....
Vine Tavern & Eatery=Mmm, the Vine! I'm a huge fan of the Rural and Apache location by ASU, but this one is closer to my neighborhood. Great place; chill ambiance, perfect for catching up with your friends over a beer, or even watching just about any game. Friendly service.  Speaking of which, funny that people are griping about ASU students frequenting this location and being out of control . . . Found it to be the complete opposite here. Sounds like y'all are describing the other location! Maybe this is just my experience. Delicious wings, never slimey and always have come out crispy. Best flavors are the Superhot and Spicy Garlic. Thirty two ounce beers for $5 and under and Happy Hour is seven days a week. Thanks for having Leinenkugel Summer Shandy on tap, guys! :)
Ah-So Sushi & Steak=Decided to run in here, because it's close, for a quick sushi dinner and afterwards, we wished we hadn't.  They were NOT nice to us, it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.So... as we are talking with the hostess, working on being seated, some snooty chick comes up, interrupts and says, "um, we need to be seated NOW".  The hostess then asks, "Is your party all here?" (which is necessary when you are doing the teppanyaki) and the girl said "No, but they will be real soon so we need to do this now."I wanted to slap that girl.  Where are these people's manners that their momma taught them!?  I don't care of you think you look like hot shit, I was here first, so don't interrupt and then proceed to be rude.So we order some of the specialty rolls.  And were told some 10 minutes later that one of the two we ordered is not available.  So I picked another.  Waited another 10 minutes.  Then was told the other one of the originals wasn't available.... Really?So I actually had to ask the server "So which ones can I order where I'll actually be able to get it?"Bad news.  I'm real easy going because I know just how hard that job is, but come on.I just love being ignored too... no acknowledgements, no "hope you enjoy your food"... no "do you need a refill"... wrong.Don't appreciate it.The only good part of the whole night was a server named Steven who came up and joked with us when delivering the last roll.  That was the highlight.I've decided I'm not going back.
The Lobby Grill=09/02/10I've dined a few times at Arizona Grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (Latitude 30 and The Phantom Horse Grill).  The Lobby Grill is a smaller version of TPHG- same furnishings, different location.  I'd have eaten here earlier if I could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  Don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the "hill."  There was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; This was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  Service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and I'd already perused through the menu online-- I knew what I wanted to try!  (Oh, how I'd rejoice when the day comes where I can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when I am seated!)We ordered the Filet bleu cheese pizza and the Reinvented Waldorf salad.  This order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  Thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  As far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  It even carries Brighton jewelry!  Be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  But I'm not here to talk about silver watches...I included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high, but when my Mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza, w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese (we ate all but a small slice, which I took home and ate for dinner that evening!), or the terrific salad (the candied walnuts were addictive!), then I know I've found a winner of a dining venue!We'll be back very soon!
Magnolia's Veranda=My friends and I were really hungry and not wanting to drive anywhere, decided to eat here since we were already at the Four Queens. Plus most of them were drunk. One of my friends asked me to read the reviews on Yelp first but my other friends were too hungry to even care and kinda herded us into the restaurant. Plus there was a special on Prime Rib and most of the guys wanted to eat that.The restaurant ambience is like the 80s and a bit tired looking. The servers were kind of slow. I couldn't figure out if our server was being sarcastic or joking when she talked to us. She came across as being brash & not friendly. Oh and btw, she added 18% on to all of our checks which I get because we had 8 people but it still would've been nice if she mentioned it. I ordered the New York and asked for it to be cooked medium. My bestie ordered the same thing. Hers came out just as requested but mine came out beyond well done. I cut it from the end and took a bite thinking that the ends would be a little well done. By the second bite I knew it was beyond over cooked. I was sawing away & getting no where. Decided to cut down the middle and as you can see from my picture it's well done. I don't like sending food back but in this case I just had to because there was no way I was going to eat it & certainly wasn't going to pay for it.I gave it to one of the servers who took it back and said they would make another one but I declined. I asked her to take it off my check. My bestie shared her meal with me. Our server came over and told me I was right it was over cooked & she didn't blame me for sending it back. She also said she never saw a steak so over cooked. I was a bit confused at her comment because she came across as being sarcastic. I couldn't tell if she was appeasing me or being rude. The New York that I shared with my bestie didn't have any flavor. I don't like adding salt to my steak after it's been cooked. I always feel that a well cooked steak doesn't need steak sauce or salt but I had to add salt & so did my bestie. My friends who ordered the prime rib enjoyed their meal. One friend ordered a taco salad. She said it was ok but had too much lettuce. It was pretty big too.Don't think I'll be eating here again. The reviews here are mixed so maybe we went on an off night. Either way, I suggest passing this place up & going somewhere else.
La Salle à Manger=Surprised about some of the comments regarding the service. We thought that the service was excellent. We did arrive around 6pm though, before it got terribly busy. The food was excellent. We got one of the daily special combos for 2, which came with rabbit, paella, seafood and veggies. It was a huge portion, and cooked very well. Lots of variety. Also tried the tacos, which were good too. I liked the atmosphere.... definitely more on the casual side (not snooty or anything like that)Will definitely return if I'm in the area. It was one of our favorite meals in Montreal
Sakun Thai=Looking for a place open on Labor Day for lunch, my coworker and myself ended up at Sakun Thai. We were pleasantly surprised by the size and nice decor by this very unassuming restaurant. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken swiftly. That's where the quick service stopped. Our drinks took a while to arrive and it took the waitress a little longer to take our orders. I decided on the massaman with pork at medium spice level. Once our food arrived, I was happy with the presentation. The food looked very appetizing and tasted pretty good as well. My curry was perfectly spiced, but just a little sweeter than I prefer. It tasted like there was too much coconut milk in the dish. My coworker enjoyed the sweet aspect, but I was just happy that I didn't decide to order kang kua since that would most likely be way too sweet for me. They offer brown rice as well, which I think is a good touch. Overall, we had a pleasant meal here but it's definitely not the best Thai food I've had in town. I'll be back since I work in the area.Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines. And whenever possible, I try to find a good one wherever I go. I have to say, my wife found this place. She told me it had four stars and a lot of reviews, I was sold.Here's the rundown. Tom Yum Shrimp - it was a super cold day again, so a hot soup was the perfect remedy for that. Love this soup. I was  craving the sourness from the lemongrass flavored soup. The mushrooms & shrimp were very good. But what set this Tom Yum from the others I've had was the cherry tomato. Never had that in this soup before and it worked so well. The pop in your mouth was a flavor explosion, delicious. Satay Chicken - it was just okay. It was lacking in flavor IMO. Even with the satay sauce. The cucumber salad it came with was outstanding. Lemon Chicken - I never had lemon chicken at a Thai place before. Usually I find this dish at a Chinese restaurant. But I have to say, I am a fan of this dish. The lemon flavor really stands up to the deep fried battered chicken the sauce was in. Panang Pork - I usually get Panang beef. Having pork even though it was very good. I still prefer the beef. The panang curry was outstanding. Pineapple Fried Rice - it was good. Chunks of pineapple and cashew nut pieces all over the dish. As for the flavor, it was just ok for me. Pad See Ew - my wife's favorite Thai noodle dish. It's a good dish, but it didn't have the burnt wok (in a good way) taste we are accustomed to at our regular Thai spot. Still very good. I love spicy food, but on this trip we have a bunch of kids so the heat index was dialed down quite a bit. The pickled serrano chilies help a lot. You can request it and they have them in tiny cups to go. This was a solid Thai restaurant. I'm rating this a 3.5 Stars and rounding up. I'll definitely be back.
Vig Deli=This is the second time I've been to Vig Deli. The first time I was there I wasn't hungry and was just sitting and chatting with friends, but after seeing the food that came out, I made the point that I will be back to taste the food out myself.So this place is a high-end deli joint located in the M Casino.  (for those who don't know, M casino is a fairly new establishment in Henderson area where the first thing you see coming across the mountains from LA would be the M casino)Checked out the menu and decided on the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  For $9.99, the portion was humongous!  Aside from the bread being super soft and delicious, they don't skimp on the toppings either!  Loaded with thinly sliced steaks smothered with I believe it's provolone cheese (it didn't taste like Mozzerella) and beautified with various red and green bell peppers with onions, this sandwich is a piece of art!One bite into the sandwich I couldn't stop myself from digging further.  (despite my continued effort in cutting carbs down and out of my diet, I have to have this sandwich whole and quick!)  Overall the sandwich was tasty, soft, delicious, yet not salty at all!  Very proud of Vig Deli for creating this masterpiece...My buddy got the triple decker with swirly bread!  The sandwich is actually bigger than those busses if there are any triple deckers out there.....OMG!  I'm so proud of him for finishing that up but I'm sure he was dying afterwards.... and he said it was absolutely wonderful!  The other two buddies got the pastrami sandwich and a bbq pull pork.... pastrami is pretty good and not salty and the pull pork is actually better than most of the bbq joints out there!  (Shame on your other "real" bbq joints out there for not being able to keep up with a deli joint!)  Love me some onion rings as they looked so big and delicious, but needed to pass on this before I pass out!One very small gripe though... I was looking forward to chicken livers as they had it on the menu last time I was here few months ago but they decided to take it out..... pretty sad as I was really looking forward to trying it.........Definitely a place worth visit when you come to vegas.  Better yet, before those of you who drives from CA to NV and is heading back home, you might as well stop by the Vig Deli and pick up some of these artistic creations on your way back!  I guarantee that you will have a great ride home instead of trying to hit up In N Out or McDonalds for that matter!  Just make sure you stay awake after ingesting these awesome sandwiches!When I first tasted this place it was pretty awful; however, after coming back again this place has gotten better! The variety of choice that they have is great and the size of the food is worth the price. I usually order the spaghetti & meatballs.  Thought its not something out of a five-star italian restaurant it is certainly better than the one a any Olive Garden restaurant. Past orders (out of 5 stars) Casear Salad: 3.8Fish & Chips: 4.2Patty Melt: 4.0Fries: 4.5Cheese Steak:3.8 (I think I prefer Capriottis Cheese steak over Vig deli)Tuna Sandwich: 3.0Chicago Hot Dog: 3.0Service:  The cashier I usually encounter are always very pleasant and they usually have a great attitude.This deli is adjacent to the sport book/sports bar area in the M Hotel and Casino. We stopped in for a quick bite after playing the tables for a little bit on our way out. It's a nice option for a meal. The deli meat was fresh. There was a nice option of different meats for sandwiches. There were several sides to choose from, but we skipped sides and opted for a salad. The sandwiches are made to order. The tomato and lettuce was crisp and fresh. The accompanying pickle was crunchy and yummy too. We also got a Cobb salad. All the items were fresh. It was a generous portion of ingredients. The dressing was good, but they had only a small selection of dressings.In all, it's a decent place to eat. Nothing gourmet. Prices were on the high side. There were other food options if you wanted hot dogs, fish and chips or other dishes.
Studio B=Studio B Buffet was GREAT. First of all, just like Paolo D. mentions, the decor is awesome. Very modern and very nice. I also liked the tables - very minimalistic yet nice looking, not the usual plain boring seats you see at restaurants. One of the things that first astonished me was the free, unlimited wine and beer. I have never been to any other buffet that offers this. Heading to the food line, I was surprised to see how much food there was. The food line was very long and offered everything such as American, Italian, Greek/Mediterranean, Italian, Meats, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, etc. Most of the food I tried was excellent. Some of it was okay, but that's understandable since it would be hard to have every item out of so many to taste great. I particularly liked the several fishes I tried and also the baked salmon at the cutting station. The sashimi and salads were also great.Last but not least, I loved the dessert options. I tried the creme brulee and chocolate gelato.. yummy. If you're looking for a new buffet to try out, check out the Studio B Buffet. I definitely want to go back next time.My future trips to vegas will include a stop at Sonics for tots, A Capastrami from Capriottis, and on the way home -the Buffet at M-resort. I would have never thought to have stopped by the strange looking blue building until my friend who lives in vegas, said we have to try it. so my friends and i stopped by on the way home the last time- and it's the best way to end your vegas trip before the 6 hour drive home. At least your tummy will happy in the traffic. The best time to go is right when brunch ends and dinner begins, so you can try both! Fresh seafood, a variety of meats, and wha? a gellato bar? and a pretty decent dessert spread! They also have a bakery in the casino, but you can try most of the same desserts as minis in the buffet!SEAFOOD HEAVEN: -Snow Crab Legs-Oysters-Shrimp Cocktails-Fried Shrimp-Mussels-ClamsPrime Rib is juicy and tender! 7oz NY SteakBaked Salmon (cooked over bamboo wood)They have many varities of dishes: Salad, Pasta, Pizza, Sushi & Thai Food. Awesome Pad Thai! spicy and flavorful. Shrimp Fried Rice & for you asian lovers out there they serve steam rice.  THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS! HANDS DOWN. !My friend heard of a new buffet off the strip in the M Resort Hotel.  For $25.95, you can enjoy an all you can eat seafood buffet with all you can drink beer and wine!  And if you sign up for the iMagine Rewards program, you get $2 off the buffet price.  The buffet is pretty huge.  I went straight for the king crab legs and shrimp.  On my first round, I filled 2 plates with food.  I would have to say the best items were the crab legs and shrimp.  All the other food was just ok.  I've had better prime rib, and their sushi was just ok.  On my second round, I browsed the Asian food, and nothing really called out to me.  They tried to make a Pad Thai, but it looked dried out.  It could be that we just went late, so they weren't making any new batches.The desserts were pretty good for a buffet.  They had lots of mini versions of tarts, meringues, eclairs, creme brulée, flan and other stuff I can't remember.  There's even a whole case of ice cream for you to choose from.  I wasn't able to take advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine.  I had to run a half marathon in the morning, so I only drank half a glass of beer.  =(  I'll have to come earlier next time and give this place another shot.  Maybe with a higher turnover rate, the food will look more appealing.  $25.95 for all you can eat and drink is a steal!I have been to this buffet many times and it is our normal stop as we drive into Vegas. I can say that I enjoyed it alot better before it became popular (especially with the locals) because the line can be well over 2 hours long.Our most recent trip to the buffet was on Christmas eve. We waited in line for over an hour and it was a total clusterf#$k. The line was unbelievably disorganized. The people who had already paid and were waiting to be seated were blocking the path of the people waiting to pay. Because of this the cashiers were not calling people up to the counter to pay and the line seemingly didn't move for an hour. I was scolded by the cashier when I dared to walk up to the counter without being summoned. Our total wait time was 1 1/2 hours, but when we were led into the dining room there were many empty tables. The line could move more efficiently if they would put some sort of system in place and possibly remodel the entrance to the buffet where people queue and pay.Aside from the logistics, the buffet itself is good but not great. For the price it is a good value considering it includes all you can drink beer and wine. My favorite items at the buffet are the Tomato Basil soup and the sweet potatoes. I sat next to a man and watched him down 4 bowls of the tomato soup...it really is that good.Other than that the prime rib is good, and everything else is hit and miss. Like any other buffet some items are better than others. The desserts are good. There is a nice selection of cookies, pastries, and many different flavors of gelato. There is also an espresso bar where you can get drinks with Baileys, amaretto, Kahlua, etc.Personally I think lunch is the best value at $14.95.3.5 starsI read Pauline C.'s review about this place and I had to go to Studio B to check it out. $26 seafood dinner = awesome deal! Plus, guests may also enjoy beer and wine selections at no additional cost!! well there arent that many selections...they had 3 choices of wines and 2 choices of beers.The food was okay. A lot of the fish was over cooked. The snow crab legs were a too salty, but i'm okay w/ it..but for those who don't like salty food, you have been warned. They do have warm crab legs, so that's a plus, as well as asian style crab legs (sauteed w/ ginger).The oysters, scared me.. did not look appetizing at all. Didn't taste fresh either.The cocktail shrimps - no thanks. not crunchy and they were smaller in since. Salmon - dried..overcookedBlack Cod was goodClams were good and there were a lot of different styles of clams.Seafood selection where abundant but it can do better. However for the price that you're paying, can't complain!The prime ribs were alright. Desserts were good! I also like their coffee bar - your choice of espresso, cappucino, lattes you can even have it w/ a shot of Kahlua, bailey's, etc. Atmosphere, it was okay nothing special.. it's trendy. Oh and yes, do prepare for long waits. The only thing this place got it going for is that they offer free beer / wines. And if you sign up for their reward card, you can get $2 off of the buffet price each time you dine here. I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way and drive out here for their buffet.. i'd only come back to this buffet if i'm on my way driving into the strip or driving back home to LA..so far, Studio B is the manny pacquiao of vegas buffets.1) voted the #1 buffet in vegas - and reigning champ until knocked out2) attracts filipinos like a PPV fight night... seriously, who knew free beer, all you can eat crab legs and seafood buffet, and cheap prices would turn out so many asians.3) i heard you can kareoke it up like Pacman on friday nights too... just kidding... but that would be kinda cool tho...Ok... I'm not really quite sure what constitute a good time frame in terms of reviewing an establishment...1 day? 1 week? 1 Month? 1 Year?  Over the year I have been to so many places and finally realized that yelp is the place to be to review all these establishments... so please do excuse me as I'm trying to catch up with many of my reviews that describes all the places that I have been in the "recent" past (Reasonable amount of time)  They are great memories and I would love to share them with you.Well... here is a good memory for you!The Studio B Buffet.  Located at the top of the hill in Henderson, LV, is a fairly new local casino.  With high praises and recommendations we were told that we "NEED" to be at this buffet as it's the best in Vegas.  I'm really sorry I'm not giving it a 5 star on this but I do have to admit that it's pretty tasty therefore it needs to be on my top Vegas list.Without further delay...Let me cut to the chase and tell you WHAT IS HORRIBLE about this place!!!  Tell me... would any sane person who is starving after all day of fun in the sun / casino / Pool would wait at a buffet for 5 hours???  Well.. you are looking at one!  (Let me remind everyone that I'm never doing that again!!!  EVER!!!)  We got to the M casino early (2:30pm) because we heard that there will be a line forming and we must act fast.  By the time we got there people were already in line for dinner...at 2:30PM!!!!!  (I thought party-goers are still in bed at 2:30pm but waiting at a buffet?  Really?)  So we head to the counter thinking that we need instructions for this....To our surprise.. they asked us to take a number!  (or putting down a name of the party)Let me tell you... once we got the name we were suppose to get back in another line and wait....What the heck???  So we decided to rotate taking turns in line while some of our party members went to have a little private moment with the one armed bandits... As our life passes us... it is now 5:30pm, Dinner Time!  We are absolutely starving and was excited to see the line finally moving.  However, now comes the name part!  The host called out names of the party listed and have them get into another line to wait their turn to get into the actual buffet.  Are you kidding me?  ANOTHER LINE???  Good thing we were called but now I see myself growing older and getting all the grey hair and long grey beard like an ancient chinese kung fu master then finally, we were in......(It's is now 7:15pm PST)  Did I say we were in?  I really meant that we were in beyond the cashiers..... Once we got pass the cash registers, we were in the final line.....This is like American idol audition I tell ya!  gate after gate after gate!  Referring back to my kung fu theme.. how many big bosses do I have to encounter before I reach my food?  I'm getting sad now...Finally, the flood gate opens and we were in...  (It is now 7:45pm PST) Once in, we were treated to football stadium sized TV showing celebrity chefs cooking, but ain't nobody cares as we were so hungry we sat down for 2 seconds, then all headed to the buffet to get our food...Sad to say.. although the food is ok..Had the typical fares of prime rib, snow crab legs, chicken dishes, etc. actually nothing much else stood out for me, but they had an awesome dessert section and free wine and beer!  OH OH!  Can't forget about the GELATO!!!!!  Terrific Gelato for my tummy!  The verdict:  The food was tasty which earned it's 4 star rating (But also including the ambiance, decor, presentation, etc.  So for all foodies who is looking for a dining experience... I'm not sure if this is the place to visit unless you like to wait...It's mostly for locals......One last thing.. apparently the locals knows about this place.  When we went to this buffet they called and told us (the out of towners) to get in line.  The locals (about 8 of them) decided to conveniently show up at 7:30pm and ask how we were doing.... They had the nerves to ask how we were doing?  REALLY?  We were set up the whole time I tell ya!  P.S.  For those who wrote this reviewing stating that there was no line... They either got REALLY lucky or they are just liars!!!  I'll just call the locals next time to get in line for me instead.....(Total waiting time: 5 hrs , total eating time:  1 hr)On the way home from Vegas on a recent trip, bf and I were starving and couldn't decide on anything to eat.. but luckily we were headed past the M Resort and made it just in time for lunch!Weekday *Mon-Fri until 2:30pm* lunch prices are ridiculous.. a whopping $15 including beer and wine! FIFTEEEEEN DOLLARS! ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE! I felt that this was caps-worthy news.They boast over 200 menu items available, and it was quite clear once we quickly entered the buffet after a short wait. The buffet line snakes around and includes all sorts of ethnic dishes.Noteworthy:-pasta salads and mixed salads (huuge variety!), eggplant parmesan, mac and cheese w/ ham, tortellini!-tri-tip, rotisserie chicken (super moist), meatloaf w/ mushroom sauce, carne asada! YUM-3 types of curry: green chicken curry, beef panang, and red seafood curry. They were all so flavorful and delicious! Better than some thai restaurants I've been to.-chocolate crepe, fruit tart, cream puff, creme brulee, and cheesecake w/ raspberry sauce were all deliciousJust so-so:-chicken enchilada was salty-fried chicken was good but greasy-orange chicken and teriyaki chicken were okay-macarons-gelato.. not as good as I've had elsewhereDrinks:you have a good selection of beer, including Heineken on tap! We also had some raspberry cider, and wine choices.At the dessert station there are made-to-order cappuccinos/espressos/lattes which you can add baileys or amaretto to! :)We were also given raffle tickets for free buffets but didn't win :(and the other catch was, there was no seafood (crab legs, oysters, etc) but only a seafood buffet on Friday nights for $30, which I would come back and try sometime! I would definitely have to say for $15 we were thoroughly satisfied and happy. Although this is not considered a gourmet buffet with fancy items, rather more simplistic items, the quality is not sacrificed at all.Overall well deserved 4.5 star rating.okay so last time i went i had a horrible experience.  This time was better.my friends have never been here and wanted to try it. so on our way to vegas, we decided to stop at Studio B for dinner. This time my experience was better. The food was better too! They now have sashimi salad which was my favorite item of the place (aside from the snow crabs).they also have this Thai section, which i thought was pretty good for a buffet. the pad thai was cooked well. and server Choy is awesome. She takes away your dishes at the perfect time. And she refills your drinks without you needing to ask her.I am going to have to say that this buffet is still standing in my book as (dun dun dun) THE BEST BUFFET IN TOWN! Whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner any day of the week, I am still surprisingly satisfied and amazed by the uniqueness, quality, and deliciousness of the food being presented.  I know you all are wondering what there may be in store for you (or at least the ones that have yet to try almost everything out), but there is literally a piece of everything around the globe! From the cheesy macaroni, appeitizing sushi rolls, and enticing kalbi ribs, to the yummy-in-my-tummy Creme brulee, various flavors of gelato, and savory taste of what is found in the tiramisu cups, there is at least one thing for everyone to enjoy! Hint, for those of you who are 21 years old and up, congratulations because you get unlimited cider, wine, or beer with the presentation of your ID! If you are also wondering when the best time to go is, I suggest going either on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (if you are addicted to seafood like I am)! Depending on your luck, they serve clams, oysters, shrimps, crab legs (either warm or cold), and muscles! If you're really curious as to what type of seafood they are serving specially for that day, give them a call!As some of my fellow Yelpers have mentioned, this is one snazzy buffet.  When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.I have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  Meats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  While not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.And then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.Finally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.Overall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election.What can be said that hasn't been in over 500 reviews?!?!?Get in line before 6pm.  The line is longer than some nights at Tao.  I try to get there at seniors dinner time which is like 4pm..5 at the very latest.  Don't even bother after 7.Why not have a few beers/glasses of wine before even eating?  Hey..you waited long enough in that goddamn line.  Might as well take your time and enjoy it.  It surprises me that I've never seen anyone inebriated beyond comprehension....ASIDE from my wife's friend who downed about 18 glasses of wine and actually had to be assisted back to our booth by a server since she was lost and couldn't walk in a straight line.  We actually had to carry her out of the M.  Miiiiiildly embarrassing.  3rd best daily buffet in town.  Bellagio and Wynn are still better.THE GOD OF LVG BUFFET IN MY OPINION.must. bow. down. (specially. you. wynn. buffet).snow crab legs, wine/beer selection, grilled fish with mango sauce, bbq, kbbq, asianfusion, desserts.I feel like scoring jackpot every time I eat here :DBest buffet in Las Vegas? Please. This is the best buffet I have ever been to. Taps Fish House is close, but Studio B wins because of value (Taps is a steep $32.99 for Sunday brunch while Studio B is $29.99 on weekends and just $14.99 for weekday lunch). I realize I can get carried away with superlatives at times, but I was able to catch the $14.99 weekday lunch, and this might be the best value I have ever gotten from a buffet. Here are the things that stick out most in my head (mostly great, a few bad):Macaroni and cheese - Before you smack me in the head for getting mac and cheese at a buffet, hear me out. I normally don't. But this mac...spoke to me. On my first trip I could hear the mac call out my name, but I decided to walk past it. When I got back to the table, I asked everyone how their food was. Cindy T immediately said that the mac and cheese is RIDICULOUS. Shit. I knew right then that there was no avoiding this mac and cheese cooked with diced ham. I got a scoop of it on my next trip, and it blew my mind. BLEW MY MIND.Prime rib - For a lot of people, this is the main appeal of Vegas buffets. Unlimited prime rib. Many sins will be forgiven of a buffet if they can just do this one thing right. And not that they had to because they had so much other outstanding stuff, but Studio B does their prime rib MARVELOUSLY. I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the prime rib (I only meant to taste it), but that piece of meat was so good that the entire thing ended up in my stomach.Panang beef - I just recently discovered the creamy, spicy miracle that is panang beef (like a month ago recently), so when I saw this at the buffet it was like a sign from God. The panang beef is DELICIOUS. It lived up to every expectation that I had for it. The pad thai is good too, but the panang beef over steamed rice is what you want.Clam chowder - Another universal dish that pleases a large proportion of diners if a buffet can pull it off, and Studio B more than pulls it off. This chowder is FILLED with clams. It would've been heavenly with some tabasco sauce, but I had inhaled the bowl before a waitress could walk by.BBQ beef ribs - I told myself that I would only eat a few bites to save room for everything else. But after I picked it up...I couldn't seem to put it down again. I pounded that bad boy. These aren't quite "mind-blowing," but the meat is tender, well-sauced, and just really good.Mahi mahi with mango sauce - I was so full and dazed at this point that I was only able to eat one bite, and I barely remember how it tasted. I'm pretty sure it was delicious.Oxtail soup - Wasn't able to try this, and I'm devastated. Next time this will be first on my list.Fried chicken - Dry and bland. Don't bother.Madeleines - Sweet. Baby. Jesus. These things are amazing. They are PERFECTLY crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.Chocolate souffle - If you love chocolate, and I mean absolutely worship chocolate, you will die for these.Pistachio shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.Oreo shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.Gelato - Absolutely ridiculous.Canoli - Absolutely ridiculous.Oh and one last thing - open bar.I am not much into buffets anymore, however this is one I would repeat! I went on a Saturday which is the seafood brunch and everything else under the sun! I think this buffet is worth a try for sure, a different experience. I was not able to see the live cooking demonstration in which I was really excited about as I was there between the two times a day they have an actual foodnetwork presentation.  The service is impeccable, I swear our drink server was connected to my hip, never went more than eyes reach of me. She kept my drinks filled to the brim! However I am not sure that everyone gets that superb treatment, I think it was my sweet, adorable, loving personality that really attracted her to service me really good. I am also really pretty to boot, pleasing on the eyes, so... lol Needless to say she got a fat tip baby! Fatter than normal I am sure :) And yes, I took advantage and had some alcohol, a couple of mimosa's, wine, champagne, and a couple of brewski's!I have included the details below provided courtesy of the Studio B Buffet :)Choose from over 200 items daily  Beer and Wine Included with Lunch and DinnerStudio B brings you a buffet experience unlike anywhere else by integrating a state-of-the-art restaurant with a live-action cooking studio.

Possibly one of the best buffets in Vegas. It's located in the really nice, but also empty M Resort 10 miles off the strip.I'm always skeptical of buffets with a large variety of "ethnic foods," but everything was generally great. I especially loved the layout of this buffet! HUGE!- A large island in the middle for meat carvings: prime rib (my fav!), mahi mahi cooked on a fancy bamboo stalk, roasted chicken, and more.- The seafood stations divided by cold and hot. So the chilled crab legs were by the raw oysters and there was also hot crab legs, yay!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?userid=QMqSgBqSrlRhz2B0UiORjw- Never ending dessert station. My friend and I looked at the tiny plates provided for the desserts, and we made a detour to grab some large plates: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=LR3Fm9zcy0ayy1BF4BikkA variety! Possibly 30% of what I consumed consisted of creme brulee....- AYCE beer (on tap) and wine station. Didn't get to take advantage of this yet, but definitely will next time! They also have cider on tap- Coffee bar at the end of the dessert station, so I ended my meal and desserts with a nice cappuccino.I never have conversations with the people who prep and cook buffet foods, but the staff and cooks were so nice!Sat & Sun: Seafood Brunch & Dinner $33.99Saturday: until 2 p.m. buy one, get one free!**even struggling to type this review because of my pudgy fingers**My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bABreakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24Seafood Brunch Sat/Sun 9am-2:30pm  $34Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXACreme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts, MEATS: Brisket, ribs, tri tip, pork loin,hamOthers: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE?!fuck the food...go for the drinks...it's a deal!Ok, but if you do care about the food, dont trip chocolate chip...the foood is bombbb. This is one of the  best buffets in vegas. It's off the strip, but the food is really good. They have the best crab legs everrrrr.What does the "B" in @Mresort Studio B buffet stand for?Hmm how about...B for bountiful! Studio B buffet has so much selection! They have all kinds of food- like Italian (pizzas, pastas), Chinese (orange chicken, fried rice, chow mein), Thai (yellow curry, red curry), American (turkey, prime rib, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes), Mexican (Spanish rice, enchiladas), breakfast entrees (eggs, bacons, corn beef hash, potatoes), all kinds of salads and a abundant amount of different desserts  (creme brulee, meringues, cheesecakes, gelato)B for beautiful! Studio B buffet's presentation of food is simply beautiful. The desserts are a perfect example of this. They have colorful meringue cookies (pink, yellow, green), cute dessert shooters, cheesecakes drizzled in sweet strawberry syrup, small awesome looking fruit tarts and scrumptious multicolored gelato!B for brilliant! Studio B buffet has a brilliant setup! The overall buffet atmosphere is a true winner! I like how they showcase different clips from the food network all around on large screens all around the buffet. In between the clips, are cute cartoons of dancing fruit! When we were there, at the dessert bar, there was a Super Mario cake that was a winner at a dessert contest. It was one cool looking cake. Visually pleasant and hip all around, one can enjoy scrumptious food in one of the coolest looking buffets in Vegas.Lastly, B for best! Yummy tasting food, good selection and nice presentation of food and cool place = Studio B buffet :).What B is it for you? ;)Like this place needs another review!!! (I THINK SO!!!!)For $30+/per person for either BLD, I think it's worth it! Vegas is all about their buffets and extravagance - Studio B is probably the epitome of both! I heard lines can form and people wait for hours just dying to eat here on the weekends. BUT!!!!! If you just come a little bit earlier (which is why the early bird gets the worm), you'd be able to not wait as long and just chow down as you intended to.I came here for my grandmother's 75th birthday. My fam bam took her out to brunch. Service was awesome and the food was grastronomical! Food that they cater to: Mediterranean/Lebanese, Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino, American, Southern, Mongolian, Italian, Chinese, Seafood (FRESHLY STEAMED KING CRAB LEGS & OYSTERS!!!), Mexican, Indian and the desserts!Memorable foods I'd love to eat HERE again:- Hawaiian Poke - Hawaiian Lau lau- Caprese Salad- Ribs- Sweet Potatoes- King crab legs- Oysters[SODIUM WARNING] I took off one star due to the HIGH salty taste of their LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP. It sounds amazing, but just tasting the darn thing reeked sodium overload! I couldn't finish the bowl I had poured for myself and hated that such great food went to waste [**insert sad face here**]DESSERTS: I enjoyed all of their mini dessert shooters! Pistachio, Tiramisu, Cookies N' Creme are just to name a few...... Not to mention their gelato, yummy cakes, cookies and other decadent delightfuls! Desserts weren't over-powering sweet! Just right to end your meal extravaganza at Studio B!Overall thought?I will definitely come back to Studio B when I'm back in the neighborhood! Great service, great food (minus the lobster bisque) and come hungry (and early) to get your moolah's worth!Next time: I'm going to tackle the "unlimited wine" I heard about!I have a hard time putting this LV buffet in the top of my pyramid of buffets in LV when I love the Wynn buffet so much.  But in in terms of value this is the best place for your buck.  Studio B offers complimentary beer and wine unlike the other buffets in LV, but the only drawback of this buffet is that you need a car or you need to pay a hefty taxi fee to get to The M Resort, the location of Studio B.  It's a hike from the strip, which is why I only see SoCal peeps, local peeps, and high rollers staying in the hotel or gambling in the casino.Studio B is phenomenal.  The quality of the food is pretty darn good for a buffet.  I like the fact they have oxtail, crawfish, and crabs (on seafood night), and other high quality dishes.  My only recommendation would be to stay clear of this buffet during the holidays.  We waited 3 hours in line to get in this past Christmas.  Unfortunately, for us, our line pass was good for January only...darn!  Other than holidays the lines aren't really that bad compared to the other buffets in The Strip.  I would rather come to Studio B than the Wynn or Bellagio buffets if I had no line pass and a mode of transportation.  The Wynn buffet is still my fave.  If the Wynn would offer me a line pass...I would choose it beyond any other in LV.For living in Southern Highlands, I can't believe how stupid I was in not coming here earlier. My stomach prolly hates me right meow!Hawaii family was in town and wanted to try something new.I've always heard about this buffet but, hearing that they had oysters on the menu sealed the deal.We arrived to an hour long wait. Which is to be expected on a Saturday night. Thankfully the bar was near by so, we had a few drinks to entertain us in line. Drinks were cheap, too =) You don't even know how shocked I was at paying $15 for 3 drinks.Once we got inside, I headed straight for the oysters. Ugh, SOOO GOOD!And next to the oysters was OXTAIL and KALUA PIG AND CABBAGE.I have never been to a buffet that has any of those. I was, literally, blown away.Their dessert menu is, by far, bigger and better than Wicked Spoon. And we alllll know how much iiiiiiiiiiiiiii love Wicked Spoon. It was levels on levels of desserts AND they, also, had dessert and coffee drinks made to order. IN-SANE.By the time, I ate my way through the buffet line was when I realized that WINE AND BEER WAS AYCE (AYCD), too. Sadly, I was too stuffed to drink anything. In the words of Arnold Swartlakjdlkjdlkja;lkjf - "I'll be back!"I've heard so much good stuff for here so we came for lunch on a Friday afternoon on our way to Vegas.  Luckily, there was no line to get in and we go seated near the windows with a view of he strip.  The bad thing was, it was so far away from the food!  :P  No prob though, we needed to get the cardio in.  We started in the salad line and made our way through the whole buffet.  I loved the way it was set up.  Lots of action stations and lots of variety.   However, I don't know, I wasn't impressed with the flavors of things.  The best thing I had was the beet salad.  That was really good.  Everything else was just average.  I'm not much of a drinker, but the unlimited beer and wine was cool.  The root beer on tap was really good too. The service we got was average, some of our dirty plates were on our tables a lil too long though.I'd like to try other places again before coming back here.  I guess the $16 price tag for lunch was a deal for the variety to keep everyone happy.This is hands-down the Best Buffet in Vegas!  On weekends--Friday Saturday and Sunday--Studio B has a Seafood Buffet, and for the same price that you're paying for The Buffet at The Wynn ($43 with tax on weekend), you get much, much more value.Why is Studio B better than The Buffet at The Wynn?  Here's a few reasons why:- Quality is much better than the Wynn buffet.  Overall, the meat & food quality is better at Studio B.- More Variety: Studio B has a much more variety of dishes for you to choose from.- Unlimited Beer & Wine: yep, one of the things I love about this place is that they serve unlimited All-You-Can-Drink beer & wine as part of your buffet meal that you've already paid for.  At the Wynn buffet, you'll have to buy beer or wine separately.The thing I love most of about this buffet is that they have raw oysters.  (see photo)  Yum...unlimited raw oysters!  I must have had over 35 raw oysters, which could have easily costed me $50 right there.  The oysters, however, weren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.  They come out somewhat fresh...but at least fresh enough to be good to eat.  But you'll have to pick them out individually from the buffet tray.  Add a nice squeeze of lemon and maybe a touch of cocktail sauce and you should be good.  It's still good, and above all a great value for what you're paying.I also had Alaskan Crab Legs, which was very good. (see photo)  The hot butter sauce here has a nice little touch of sweetness to it that complements crab legs and brings out the taste of meat pretty well.  The slightly sweeter sauce is much better than the sauce at the Wynn buffet, which is just plain butter sauce.  The Alaskan Crab Legs quality was about the same here at Studio B and The Buffet at The Wynn.We also picked up a plate of Crawfish (see photo).  I'd have to say that this was my only disappointment.  The Crawfish, unfortunately, wasn't fresh.  Instead, it was frozen.  It definitely makes a big difference in taste, but I can't really complain for the price I'm paying for this buffet and for what I'm already getting.  I guess we'll stick to The Boiling Crab in So Cal for crawfish.  So far that's the best place for it (as far as I know).The Prime Rib was good as well.  The meat quality at Studio B seems to be a little better than the meat quality at The Buffet (at The Wynn).  The meat is more moist and juicy.  The prime rib I had at The Buffet seemed a slightly dry.  It was still ok, but it was a little dryer than Studio B's prime rib.Everything else here was great!  They have such a great variety of food here, and the quality of everything is also great!  You really do get a good bang out of your buck here at Studio B, and I'd recommend this place to anyone....so far, this is the overall + seafood buffet in Vegas! :)Let me start by saying that I am not much of a buffet fan because 1 You feel like you're forced to eat your money's worth,  2 The freshness of food is rare because it sits out in warmers for who knows how long, 3 The drinks that are normally included are standard cheap drinks such as water, juice and coffee. Last but not least, 4 Desserts always seem the same. However, Studio B which is: LOCATED in the M Resort on the south side of Vegas, sheds a little light for me and here is why: My friends and I came for the seafood brunch. The selection was pretty much what I was expecting. Your standard crab legs, variety of sushi, oysters, shrimp and so forth. They also had prime rib. I give props to the crab legs which was pretty fresh and the prime rib which was satisfactory.  I wasn't impressed with the other stuff as the quality and freshness just wasn't there. Overall, the food was okay but eating your money's worth without unbuttoning your pants wasn't a problem because it's seafood.  Here is where it gets good. The DRINKS that were included were different from your normal buffets. - They had beers on tap! Can you believe that? Now of course it's not self serve but I still think that's awesome. I don't quite remember the different brands of beer but I do know they had a cider flavor  which was pretty good. They serve wine as well. It was the first time I ever left a buffet buzzing. They also had a coffee station where you can order espressos and other specialty coffee drinks. Like a mini Starbucks. I didn't try it but it sure looked cool. The desserts were pretty standard here with your variety of bite size cakes, creme brulee's, fruit tarts and so forth. But! they got a GELATO station!  I don't remember all the flavors at the time but I do know they had around 8 to 10 different flavors. I tried the pistachio and strawberry. Both were delicious. The SERVICE here was standard for a buffet. We didn't run into any problems. I must say that I was impressed with the employees manning the beer, coffee and gelato stations. They were pretty quick at handling the lines. This place is around 3.5 for me but I will round to a 4 stars for the overall experience and value.This may have been one of the best buffets a few years ago, but Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal have passed it by with their unique dishes and plating. The food at Studio B is still better than most buffets I've tried but my opinion of the place has changed since my first visit years ago when the M Resort opened.Desserts are the best option here with the apple pie, cookies, and pecan tart leading the way. Items like stewed and braised meats work well because the quality doesn't diminish as quickly when it's been sitting out a long time as opposed to other dishes where timing and freshness matter. For example, the chimichangas and pizza crusts get soggy  after a while and mussels become rubbery. You should skip the sushi altogether. The Asian section with kalbi beef, curry, and kung pao beef fared much better and were some of the more memorable dishes.There's a buffet that's been on my mind...all the timeStu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohNow I know that it's not on the Strip, but with a car you can get there in a zipStu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohTucked in the corner of the MPlenty of options, it's a gemFresh are the off'rings at this buffetI ate so much, at least five more pounds I weigh...Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh ohFive more pounds I weigh-ayStu-Stu-studio! oh oh ohVeggie options bountiful!

Here is what I came up with.Positive - Beer and Wine is included in the price. And it isn't horrible.                  Deserts are great, some of the better Gelato I have had outside of Italy.                  a lot of choices.                  The chef was very friendly and eager to assist at the carving station.The rest of the review - Ok this was a horrible experience from the start.  When we arrived we were sixth in line on a mid week night..  It took us over 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 30 minutes to get seated.  The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).So we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  My first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.Specific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level)When we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.The place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1/2 of in the car.)Under our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.)All in all it was a huge disappointment.  I think the majority of people who rate this place high do so because of the free alcohol.I will not be back here.Being as there are a TON of reviews already, I'll try to point some key things out.Soo this buffet (inside M casino) had a very high reputation when they first opened but they've dipped in some areas. But in my opinion, still deserve a high rating as long as you:- DON'T GO TO ANY OF THEIR SEAFOOD BUFFETS! Honestly they add only like 3 different options for seafood and they are not great at all. I remember their lobster was mainly just stuffing! Ack!- Avoid going during any major holiday! Especially Mother's Day! Was $49.99 a person and we were all disappointed especially after waiting 2 hours! -Only go to their Monday-Friday Lunch from 11am-2:30pm for $15.99. Same quality as the Dinner and Seafood Buffet in my opinion without their measley 3 extra options lol.Hours of Operation:Lunch= Mon. - Fri. 11:00am - 2:30pm $15.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $11.99Dinner= Mon. - Thur. 2:30pm-8:00pm $23.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $17.99Seafood Buffet= Sat. - Sun. 11:00am - 8:00pm $39.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99Seafood Dinner= Fri. 2:30pm - 8:00pm $39.99                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99During my most recent visit a few days ago for Lunch, it was exactly like I remembered! Tons of vegetarian options including about 10 different salads and I love the mushroom ravioli! But they also offer prime rib, fried chicken, green mussels, pad thai, yellow curry, all the usual chinese options, tomato bisque soup, pastas, jambalaya and a lot of the other usuals but done better than most buffets. And of course, their infamous desserts! Just try like all of them, you won't regret it. Well, maybe your pants will lol. But overall, I still love this buffet. I just won't waste my time and money for anything besides their lunch! Enjoy! :)Very decent food with good selection. And with a CA DL you get 5 dollars off!Love the crab legs and the ox tail soup. I drank a lot of the ox tail soup! Yum!The steaks are ok. But still, rest of the cuisines are great!We went there on Friday night and there was not a big line, so we got in fast. I would say it's the best in Vegas recently. Good price, good food and good service!Headed to this buffet before reaching Vegas because supposedly they had an awesome lunch deal.$20 bucks per person!! Not bad at all.Huge varieties of different foods, which were all super tasty btw, and their DESSERTS. MY GAHD. I was munchin' on them cookies, their mini pecan tarts? Friggin addicting.The staff were all so friendly as well. Definitely a favorite of mine so far.This buffet is pretty good!  It's located a little ways away from the strip at M Hotel and Casino.  If you park on the 2nd floor of the structure, it'll lead you right to the buffet.  Special discount: $5 off with a CA ID!  The crab legs and oysters were extremely fresh, and there was a good selection of different cuisines to choose from.  My only gripe is that the sushi section was very limited.  My favorite part of buffets is the sushi/sashimi area.  I guess the unlimited oysters and crab legs made up for it though!  One of the best parts of this buffet is the unlimited drinks.  They have wine and beer as well as some cocktails.  The dessert here is also really good.  It's not as big as my favorite Las Vegas buffet and the price is about the same.  But if you show them your California ID, you get $5 off!  The line here is also really short compared to the ones on the strip and moves quite fast.  If I want a good buffet without having the 2 to 3 hour lines, this is the buffet I'll go to!  Fresh food, quick lines, and unlimited oysters and crab legs...what's better than that?!So I lost 40 lbs in the past 6 months and gained at least 10 lbs in 90 minutes eating what is described below. Wednesday 11/18th I came to feast by myself and was very impressed with the Studio B buffet at M Resort. I would consider this buffet one of the best in Las Vegas, and the best buffet for locals.The carving station was in the round and this buffet is designed in a serpentine shape. Each of the food bins had their own digital thermometer showing the temperature which was comforting compared to other buffets where i've questioned to myself if it was safe to eat.Fantastic foods I devoured that added at least 10 lbs to my body weight within 90 minutes included chef salad, Greek salad, stuffed grape leaves, large cocktail shrimp w/ lemon wedges & tangy sauce, several trips to the amazingly delicious trimmed prime rib where the chef was kind enough to ask how thick of a cut I desired and if I prefer medium or medium rare, woodstone fire oven pizza, pork loin, lamb paella, curry chicken, oxtail soup w/ peanuts, kalbi beef ribs, chicken adobo, kalua pork, miso glazed salmon w/ coconut rice, rosemary garlic lamb chops, pork osso buco, BBQ pork ribs, fried chicken, fried pollock, grilled pork chops, chicken saltimbocca, fried clam strips, tempura veggies, potato au gratin, creamed spinach, steamed swai fish, grilled asparagus, steam cauliflower, waffle fries, sweet potato puree w/ marshmallows, hericot vert green beans w/ almonds, ginger carrot coins, mussels, melons, assorted sushi w/ masago, and the dessert station oh my where to start? I won't admit it! At least they have comfy chairs :-)3 wines, 4 beers on tap and 1 root beer on tap are all included with this buffet. I had ice tea.Studio B has a very modern decor and beautiful interior design. Estimate 50 flat screen TVs that form a wall 3' foot high stretching at least 100' feet in length, advertising areas of the M Resort and some of the TVs showed the Food Network. Low volume classic rock played as background music, to an upscale clientele that I judge based on manners and apparel.Friendly service by the cashier, hostess, server, each of the chefs including the head chef. A nice conversation with the head chef who shared with me the 13 Southern NV Health District Grade A Certificates were because all the cooking is done here and the SNHD requires each station to have its own.I did not take photos inside as I would never be able to focus on my Gluttony :-)See 2 outside photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #286
Joey's of Chicago=Ha!  Joey's of Chicago is a total 5 star place to grab a fantastic Italian beef sandwich!  Despite what you may read in a few of the other reviews this place is a reliable 4 to 5 star experience.   You can count on it!  What the heck! who goes to a Chicago  style restaurant that is known for the hotdogs and Italian beef and orders a hamburger??  (Although I heard their hamburgers are burger-licious too)!This place is locally owned by some very nice folks transplanted from the burbs of Chicago.  At least I know one of them is from Schaumburg, grew up there, at least that's what I heard while eavesdropping :-)  Seriously these folks are from Chicago and they know how to cook some great Chicago style hot dogs and some DELISH hot Italian beef!   It good enough to make to folks at Portillo's proud to have some respectable competition!   Oh but this not Portillo's, for their Italian beef is a little different but in a good way!  I had their Italian roast beef sandwich with hot peppers covered with melted provolone cheese dry with a side of dip. (Don't call it ausue... Haha, that's what the peeps from Arizona called it.  In Chicago it's simply called dipping sauce :-)  Anyways, my sandwich was DELISH! The folks with me also had the same thing but they had the sandwich dipped and the other got their's wet.  I don't care for soggy bread but they seemed to like it all the same.  Hungry for a fantastic italian beef sandwich or a super chicago style hotdog Joey's is a great place! It's almost guaranteed you'll meet some other folks from the Chicago area dinning here.  I'm not from Chicago but I travel there all the time and I know you'll have a 4 to 5 star experience.  I hope to see you there!
Beijing Noodle No. 9=My last review...Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.  But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice. I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.  Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.  Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business...This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.  The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.  Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!As you would expect from a place as ornate as Caesar's Palace, this has to be the prettiest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' "THX 1138" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. Yet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. The scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips. FOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish SERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? TOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smileI am very surprised by the number of poor reviews for Beijing Noodle. This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant and there are no P.F. Changish dishes going on here so maybe that's part of the problem. I am only knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars because the service( even for a Chinese place) is challenging and in true fashion it's hard to get away from the MSG here.  Some general notes-observations that may help:To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the "Palace" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable. If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.   Beef with Hand Pull Noodle -sensational and complex beef flavor.Not all that spicy a advertised.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQThe XO sauce works well with the velvety noodles but the MSG is a bummer for me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#7AfT3oZKnjLMKGoKCi4PowAsparagus and Scallop in XO sauce- well executed by not my favorite of the lot. The scallops were a tad sandy and that is always a no-no. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#8Owy1p3ypoKRr1UGOB8ugwThe pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand.If you are in Cesar's Palace and fancy yourself some Chinese food... Skip this place altogether. The decor is misleadingly impressive. I had a gift card that was authorized for use here, I checked with the manager on duty prior to being seated and he said yes. After eating the subpar food reminiscent of any typical hole in the wall (not in a good way) Chinese restaurant you'll normally frown at as you pass by, I presented the gift card which was denied by the manager. There are many places very nearby in which you can pay less, for higher quality food. Do yourself the favor and frown as you pass by.Visiting Beijing Noodle No. 9 was a little bit of a homecoming for me because it's at the same space where I had my first Vegas fine dining experience 15 years ago when it was known as 808, a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant.  Well, Beijing Noodle isn't exactly same restaurant but I had a decent experience here.I don't see how this place can get less than 3 stars.  It's a very clean and hip looking spot.  The decor with the fish tanks is very eye-popping for a noodle house (http://bit.ly/1FsSJd0).  How can you not want to go inside and check it out?  Plus its got an open noodle kitchen which was genius for them to put out in the front so you can see the chefs show off their noodle pulling skills which is almost like a Vegas show in itself (http://bit.ly/1MU6Sp7).  It was a total no-brainer for me to sit at the noodle bar to see them work on the noodles from start to finish (http://bit.ly/1H4K5IY).On to the food.  So obviously I came here because I woke up with a craving for noodles.  I opted for the Pork Wonton Noodle Soup with Knife-shaved noodles and ordered a Thai Iced Tea for my drink.Thai Iced Tea -- http://bit.ly/1BtOnqQIt's pretty much your basic Thai Iced Tea.  Nothing too fancy or subtle about it.  But it was a little pricey though at $7.Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Broth with Knife-Shaved Noodles -- http://bit.ly/1GxRP31Even though I was impressed with the chefs making the handpulled noodles, I settled with the Knife-shaved noodles with the Pork Wonton soup.  And just was entertaining as the handpulled noodles were, I was just was impressed seeing the chef shaving off the noodles from a huge hunk of noodle dough into the cooker.  So they were definitely fresh as well.  Overall, the Pork Wontons and Noodles were great.  My issue was that the broth really had no flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything so I had to add extra soy and chili sauce to give it a little kick.So overall Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a decent casino noodle house.  I came here to satisfy my noodle craving and it did just that with some professional noodle-pulling showmanship as a plus.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes.  It is pricey though but convenient if you have a craving for noodles on the Strip and don't want to take a bus or cab ride to Chinatown.*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown.
Rhythm Kitchen=I guess you could call it our first official date PB (post-baby).  It was a last minute decision to check out Rhythm Kitchen on a Friday night, especially since we drive by it all the time and have to wonder what it's like.We walked in to an elegant foyer and for a moment, I felt a bit under dressed.  There were two hostesses manning the front, one of whom I had the impression was the owner or manager.  With no reservations, we were easily seated at a table right by the pianist.  (They just added the pianist on a regular basis.)  It was really nice inside the dining room, and rather busy.  Despite the upscale feeling, there's a very casual crowd inside which works out great.  You can have a nice dinner out without the stuffiness.  Since we were on a time limit, we ordered only entrees and waited for them to arrive.  In the meantime, a basket of hush puppies and one bread roll with sweet butter arrived at our table.  (We are a party of two, only one bread roll?)  Nonetheless, we enjoyed the piping hot hush puppies and the warm bread. There was a bit of lag time as we waited for our food and I was under the impression that it felt like it was a bit understaffed.  It looked like there were three waiters, which had me concerned with how long it would take our food to come out since the wait staff definitely took their time with each customer (getting drink orders, getting apps started, explaining items on the menu, etc.).  It gave us a chance to enjoy the lovely music though.  Our food did arrive by someone else and the Husband chose Seafeast Platter "Combination of catfish fillets, oysters, fried shrimp and cold boiled shrimp." ($17.79) It came with one side, and he chose a Baked Potato with his.  He appreciated that it was loaded with butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  The deep fried catfish and oysters were pretty good, and not overly oily or fatty.  It had a good batter on it.  His platter also came with their chow chow relish.I chose the Grilled Cajun Scallops "With andouille sausage." ($17.99)  It came with two sides, and I chose the Baked Potato and Sauteed Mushrooms.  The scallops were on a kabob stick (about 9 large scallops), along with sausage, bell peppers, and onions.  Rice and gravy sat underneath my protein.  The scallops were pretty good, not overcooked at all.  More on the rare side, which I prefer.  And the mushrooms were cooked very nicely too.  I pretty much devoured my dinner (as a customer noted from a nearby table).  This same customer also commented on how delicious her crab chowder and deep fried alligator was.  She even offered some to us!Since we were in a rush, I quickly asked our waiter for our check and let him know we had a baby waiting.  He seemed like he understood our urgency, but took the time to clear our table first.  (Yes, I know he was doing his job, but I think he missed the point that we needed to go and now!)The manager/owner took the time to talk to us and let us know about the bar/lounge connected next door and their happy hour.  She also mentioned that they have banquet facilities upstairs and there's a live band that will be coming on a regular basis as well.  (I think there's a cover charge.)  She also mentioned joining their email list so we could find out what entertainment was going on.Overall, we both were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our experience at Rhythm Kitchen.  One would have a better experience if you can enjoy a leisurely dinner instead.  Yes, it might be a bit pricey depending on what you get, so it helps that they are in the Entertainment Book.So the response I receive from Scott G of Rhythm Kitchen is;"Hi Shawn,Unfortunately it's our policy to ONLY accept one offer  at a time. It's posted with our 1/2 off wine that it CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. In addition, your Living Social deal also stated CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. We do remember when you were here - and you had a Groupon you tried to use in addition to the Living Social and 1/2 wine special. We apologize for any confusion you my have experienced - however if you use Groupons/Living Social deals often it's standard that the deals can NOT be combined with any other offer.Hope this helps!"The funny thing about this response is that I didn't have a groupon that I was trying to use and YES people I understand NOW that their policy doesn't allow the use of two or more offers.  However when one is told in the beginning of their dinner by someone that is representing such policies that you could get 1/2 price bottle of wine after they knew of living social, combo that with it being my first time there and trusting the server to guide me.  I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED THE WINE IF I WERE NOT TOLD THAT I COULD GET IT 1/2 PRICE!!!  The "lady" that came to the table even said the server was wrong and he will never make that mistake again.  Great so fix it ma'am and stop saying its my fault.  As I said to Scott G to his response if I ever received a response it would be the caliber it is..  Lame.  Also I didn't experience any confusion just embarrassment for me and my guest with being told the police were going to be called and being rudely spoken to by that "lady" manager.  Again if you are considering dining here, I highly suggest you reconsider.We came back here for happy hour.  These 2 things should/would make RK at least 3 stars:1. The service was quick and friendly.2. They were giving away free Miller Lite. But it all went to shit when the food came.  The prices for happy hour are pretty awesome.  I just wish the food was somewhere close to that too.  Our alligator bites were served cold and sent back.  KFC chicken wings are 5 stars compared to the ones they serve and the pizza was shameful.  Seriously!  Just buy frozen pizza from the same place you buy the frozen alligator nuggets and give that a shot.  I'm only coming back for alcohol if there is another visit.I was here once for a music program on the second floor and just had drinks while I listened to the band and singer.  I was always intrigued by their menu.I asked the server about the alligator because the menu had it available both blackened and breaded.  She explained how each was prepared and then said that I could get half of each.  That's what I ordered.  My wife ordered the chicken with pasta in cream sauce.  We did not have any starters.Our iced tea was brought quickly and a basket with hush puppies and two rolls was brought.  The butter for me was awful.  It was honey butter.  Maybe it's a southern thing.  I like salted butter and this was just too sweet for me.  It was also hard as a rock from being kept in a very cold refrigerator/freezer another hang up I have.Our meals came and I totally enjoyed the alligator.  If I got it again, I'd definitely get half of each.  It really is good.  There was a nice dipping sauce that came with the dish and the alligator had a spicy flavor.  My wife liked her pasta.  It was tri-color withe a Southern style Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.  I think the sauce was a bit off putting for her.We had dessert.  I had the Mississippi mud pie and my wife had the crème brûlée.  My mud pie was mostly icy chocolate ice cream--something I wouldn't get again.  My wife really enjoyed her brûlée.Service became an issue before and after dessert.  The place got busy and it didn't seem like the staff could keep their acts together.  I had a show to go to and I made the reservation for 5:15 which would give me a good cushion for dinner with time to get home and get ready to go to the show.  It took so long to get the bill and then pay it that my cushion of time disappeared.  I had to hurry to get my wife home and then get to the theatre.  Plan accordingly.Had a groupon for this place. First walked in, had a sinking feeling that I was in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The place is so big, didn't know where to go. Hostess sat us down, place was kind of empty. More of those nightmares starting to creep in.You walk in and you already smell desperation. Not from the servers. The service was fine overall. Just that the place didn't know what it wanted to be. It's trying real hard to be fancy. Waiters with the vests, white linen, wine pairings, candles on the table, music you'd hear waiting for the weather on the 8's on the weather channel plays. It just didn't feel like it connected. This is supposed to be New Orleans style cuisine. I'm expected a party, some jazz, some energy and I got...elevator music? Kitchen....nightmares....Food. The hushpuppies were fine. Bread was old, dry and flaky. The gumbo was not good. It was microwaved as the middle was molten hot and the outside was luke warm at best. Crab inside was fishy. Hardly any sausage. The Crab Cake Elaine was a travesty. Crab Cake over seasoned AND burnt, etouffe tasted strange. The red beans and rice was the worst I've ever had, over cooked and flat out gross. Brussel sprouts came out cold. The Mac and Cheese was also Microwaved AND overcooked. Hardly resembled Mac or Cheese. Kitchen...nightmares....Spoke with waiter (Rob) and told him we were not happy with what we got. Traded mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and got the shrimp kabob appetizer instead. Waiter informed us that there was a rookie chef in the kitchen and that it was obvious that the crabcake was overcooked. Kitchen...nightmares...The mashed potatoes were okay, which is saying a lot for how this meal was going. There were bits of garlic in there, which was nice. Sucked that the mashed potatoes were still really lumpy. The shrimp kabobs were strange as well. It was obviously overcooked on one side, charred to hell. My first bite was grittier than all hell. Think that the sauce got burnt on that. The rice pilaf was better than the red beans and rice, but that's like saying the Jets right now are better than the Raiders. Ain't saying much. The rice pilaf was still overcooked and watery. Brussell sprouts again and this time i just unraveled them and they were just stone cold in the middle. Kitchen...nightmares....Before I even finished eating there, my stomach hurt. It must have known that it was going to pay too much money for this type of food. I left a comment card on there and I did tell them that I could pay $2.50 for Stouffer's and be eating that while watching Breaking Bad in my underwear. It didn't make sense to have the waiters act like this place is some high dining establishment when they can't be bothered to have decent soup or even make mac and cheese. Kitchen...nightmares...The server was nice, didn't want to send food back, but it was really the worst food I've had in a long time. It was awful. I'm so glad I tried to stick to things that would get me too sick. The rookie chef thing might be true or it could just be an excuse on why mac and cheese is getting microwaved. Whatever it is, it shouldn't be happening. Kitchen....nightmares....Sometimes you need to go back to a place, again and again, before you can really change your first impression. This is definitely been true with Rhythm Kitchen.From the very beginning I have wanted to like this place, I crave great cajun cuisine quite often and it helps to have a place you can rely on. Like BBQ, Cajun / Creole restaurants in the Valley mostly fall drastically short of mediocre.I have been back several times since my first review, and I have to say, I am starting to warm to this place. Their jambalaya is not great, but it is good enough to get a 3 stars from me. The rest of the food still lingers around the 3 star range, the service is 3 star for sure these days, up form a dismal 1 star, but it is in the high 3 star range so I go with an overall 3 star review.Way to go Rhythm Kitchen - keep up the good work.The service in this place is terrible. I walked in with my girlfriend for happy hour and waited for about 20 minutes without anyone even acknowledging our existence. To make matters worse a couple walked in and were greeted right away. I think this place attempts to be classy, and upscale, but falls incredibly short with their lack of quality service and poorly arranged menu. Proving that just because you're a rich investor, it doesn't mean that you can just throw money at something and succeed. Clean your act up. You're sloppy.From the ponds, marshes, wetlands, slow-moving rivers, lakes, bayous and swamps to Sin City...the alligator has arrived! Not too many places I know around here offer reptiles on their menu. Well, they do here at Rhythm Kitchen!Yesterday, I met a friend here for Happy Hour and it was a fantastic and unique culinary experience.  The Louisiana ambience, impeccable service, delicious foods, intoxicating drinks, and great conversation was an evening I will treasure until I get Alzheimer's.The elegant dining room is beautifully decorated and has an upscale feel. The bar/lounge has it's own private entrance, or you can do like I did, and use the main entrance and have the hostess lead you through the restaurant to the lounge.The bartenders were very friendly and personable, offering the stereotypical friendly southern hospitality. I enjoyed the Hurricane, which was strong tasting and intoxicating, fruity and delicious; all adjectives combined in one very large glass! (see photo below)We shared a dinner menu entree of catfish filets w/ red beans and rice. Also catfish bites, and blackened alligator. I've never had a catfish, except when I was about 10 years old pulling one off a fishing hook and its spine sliced my hand open. Well, time to move on from being 10 and give the ugly bottom feeder another try...surprisingly, it had a wonderful fishy taste!The alligator tasted kinda like chicken. Doesn't everything that is 'not the norm' taste like chicken? The red sauce added a nice enhancing kick to dip the alligator and savor the chew.I look forward to coming here again and trying their AYCE Specials of crab legs, ribs, more! Call and inquire what night is what special, as several nights per week they offer All-You-Can-Eat Specials!Also, I'm eager to try their steaks, French creole seafood, gumbo, jambalaya, and more of the catfish and alligator, washed down with a Hurricane. To Try: Go North on Decatur from the 215 South, look for the pretty 2 story New Orleans style architecture on your left/west side of the street, just past Sunset Rd. Plenty of convenient parking!"Yay! I'm a fan."YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #236
Regio's Mexican Food=I've passed by Regio's plenty of times and I wish I had tried them sooner! Tucked right next to the 51 on Indian School, Regio's is far from an optimum location, but I can agree with most of the other reviews so far and say that the food is poppin'! I got a gordita plate from them on New Year's Day, and I was way surprised! It was delicious, and it helped settle my stomach after a night of properly ringing in 2011...I want to go back as I write this to try their sopes! If their carne asada and their al pastor gorditas are any indicator, I will sure be in for a delicious treat! If you live in Central Phoenix and fancy some good, cheap Mexican food from a local joint, get your buns over to Regio's. I personally think I found my new regular spot for some Mexican chow.
Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue=Over the river and through the woods.. lalalala, la, la.. Cave Creek, AZ is kind of a drive but I suppose no worse than driving to Gilbert from Scottsdale. Though this journey includes cactus, multi-million dollar mansions and the occasional coyote rather than tract homes and freeway. Once you get out there the entire area is sort of like old cowboy rustic charm. So doesn't it makes sense to open a BBQ joint way out in the middle of somewhere? The owners of Bryan's sure did!Only being open just over a month, Bryan's was hopping busy and there is a reason why.. the smell. You can just about taste the pecan smoke as you pass by or pull up. Its an enticing fragrance that grips, strokes and pulls you in to see what's about that hopefully delicious smokey goodness. Once inside you'll easily tell where you need to go.. it's all about counter service here. The menu is easy to navigate as its short and sweet. Its a greatest hits of BBQ and you'll be hard pressed just to order one thing. Go ahead, order as much as you like, loosen your pants and stay a while. Ordering for us was pretty easy though we did cross section the menu, pork ribs, pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, olive cole slaw, baked potato salad and cowboy beans. Get your drinks then grab a seat in the modern, cowboy space. They do serve beer as well as Coke products though I noticed something strange, most people were drinking water. Is that how they are dealing with the economy? Spend a little on food and cut a couple of bucks on the beverages? Good idea I suppose, coke is coke is coke, right? Water cleanses the palette and pairs with anything, sure Ill go with it! Okay, they called the Mr.'s name, my mouth is watering, my sauces are ready, good to go! First bite, the brisket, smokey, juicy and perfectly tender, the white bread under the brisket soaks up the meat juices, good idea, why didn't I think of that?! Next, ribs, oh no.. I can suck the meat right off the bone? Its not like I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose (well, Ive never tried)  it's just that the ribs are that tender! Dip in a bit of the spicy sauce, hellish good (I don't think they serve BBQ in heaven right? Smoke and flame thing, eh?)! Pulled pork sandwich, is melt on your tongue tender, I can see why so many older folks were ordering these sammies, no teeth required. Oddly the sides are in need of some tweaking. The baked potato salad was on the dry side but I have yet to have a baked potato salad that I like. Something about cold baked potatoes that don't do it for me. The cowboy beans had no real character and were only one flavor, a smokey sweetness that was good on the first bite but lacked depth. The olive cole slaw was different and while the Mr loved it, I'm just not a fan. However each plate was served with a bread and butter jalapeno, not only clever but addictivly delicious. Oh the desserts, simple and satisfying. Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich and a Sarsaparilla Float. We got the ice cream sammie which was 2 huge chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Nice crunch factor on the cookie with the cold smoothness of the ice cream, talk about a happy ending. On the way out the sun was setting the moon was rising and all seemed right in the world. Perhaps for the first time in ages, a calm swept over me and all I could smell was pecan smoke begging me to come back some time soon.  Oh yeah, me and my O-face!Good bye Bobby Q , So long Joe Johnston... I have found a new love...his name is Bryan.. and I love him.A few months back Alexander told me to check this place out .. and I thought oh sure it's probably good. Boy was I wrong it's not good , it's fantastic!   First, most BBQ joints that are any good are rinky dinky dives  that you try not to touch too many surfaces in ( you know its true!) But Bryan my new amore , is different his joint is well decorated, cute even , maybe whimsical. It has clean well lit, well thought out decorating,a large screen with old time westerns showing , nice touch,the place is clean  and in a tasteful strip mall. The food is ordered at the counter , we opted for ribs, shredded pork and brisket. The brisket was well cooked / smoked with meat falling apart as you cut into it.The sauce was tasty  but not over powering. No fake smoke taste or over top sugar taste here.  The ribs had a gorgeous pink smoke ring , lovely! Husband proclaimed the   shredded pork better than the ribs but he is wrong and not writing this review.  So there.   Now here is the extra special touch .. the sides were really delish  no empty fillers here .. the beans are obviously slow cooked with care and dare I say ...love?   I even tasted a hint of beer which I  love in beans , they also had a rich taste that made them crave-able. The coleslaw was  a surprise as well , not only a great balance of taste not too sweet not too vinegary  but low and behold olives were hidden in there as well like little treasures just waiting to be uncovered.  Will I  be back ...oh yes ..Bryan and I plan to see each other at least a couple times a month . I think it's time for him to meet my folks.... I am looking forward to our kinda like a date night .   Can't wait to try him out again!  I mean try the food again .. Whatever I love Bryan.Ever since El Paso closed down I have been looking for ribs I like as well.  I found them!  I was surprised the place was as quiet as it was early on a Saturday evening.  I was informed by my date that Cave Creek businesses suffer in the summer as many folks willing to drive that far out of Phoenix will drive the extra hour to Prescott and the cooler temps.I had the ribs and my date had the brisket and we both chose beans and cole slaw.  She really liked the brisket but I thought it was a bit dry and we both needed to use sauce on it.  We really loved the ribs and beans! The cole slaw seemed a bit flat in taste but I think it would have been hard to stand up against the bold flavors of the rest of the dinner, in any case it was certainly fresh and had no off flavors.Be careful of the iced tea machine.  The 3 labels are: unsweetened black, Sweet tea and Green tea.  We both made the assumption the green tea would be unsweetened only to find out it was very sweet.The counter service was pleasant.  The place was clean.  The only restrooms were in an outside walkway and served the entire building.  I was surprised they close at 8 on the weekends.  I would like to go back in cooler weather and set out on the patio.So, my friend and I decided to spend the day hanging out together on this side of town. We both needed to get out of the house, and go for a pretty drive.While we were driving down the Carefree Hwy, we swung by and hung a left on Cave Creek road because its been a while since we had been to this side of town.  While we were driving, we parked the car in town and found this place.  I spotted it from across the street, and we ran in to get some food.Place is cute, with a nice patio and plenty of seating inside as well. Mostly tables with some booths. It's a fast casual type place, so you go, place your order, and they call your name when the orders ready.The food itself was really good. I went with the brisket sandwich with fries and a drink. My friend went with the half chicken, baked potato salad (which had sour cream) and a drink. the potatos were awesome! I wish I had ordered it as my side instead!Brisket was soft and tasty, and my friend enjoyed his chicken a lot.  It didn't come with a ton of BBQ sauce on it (which is fine by me) and you can always add more from the BBQ sauce station that they have set up in the condiment area.  I really liked the condiment area because not only was it neat and clean, but it was well stocked. I also like that they have a decent selection of food to choose from as well.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. If your in the area, or want to try excellent BBQ, please, go eat here. Place is awesome! Patio is a great size as well.  Make the trip, you'll be really happy you did!
Pittsburgh Willy's Gourmet Hot Dogs & More=This is a dive in the very best sense of the word.  Guy Fieri needs to come here!  This fine establishment is located inside the Antiques Mall.  Walk in and go to your left.  My sense of direction is not so hot and I started out thinking this was somewhere near downtown Chandler but it's closer to Warner on Arizona Ave.  I finally made it and Rand H. and Robyn N. were patiently waiting for me and my daughter.  Randy, the proprietor of this fine establishment was sitting at the table and greeted us warmly.  It just so happend that Sonoran Living had been in to do a piece on Randy and we anxiously waited to see it.  As soon as the piece was over, the phone started ringing, no joke!  All three of the adults had the "3-Legged Chile N Cheese Hot Dog" and it was very filling and very good!!  My daughter had a Lil' Willy and scarfed it down in two minutes flat with a big thumbs up!  There were a couple of tables to sit and eat and Randy took our orders and we got our drinks and sat and chatted for a few minutes.  And if you are a Pittsburg fan, this is the place for you!  Randy is so warm and welcoming.  He is an excellent host and clearly loves what he does.  This is the kind of place that you want to come back to over and over again simply because the owner puts his best foot forward and does all he can for his patrons.  And when I went to pay the bill I even got a hug!  Now that is service!  My daughter's favorite food is a hot dog so we will be frequenting Pittsburgh Willy's.  I hope Randy doesn't get sick of us. :)What a fun place!  Fortunately I knew it was IN the Antiques Marketplace because I read all the reviews last night.  As soon as you walk into the Marketplace, you can smell the hot dogs cooking!  Walk towards the left, pass by aisles of "antiques", and once you see all the Pittsburgh sports stuff and a few tables, you've found Pittsburgh Willies.Rand and I had a seat while we were waiting for Lynn and Claire and met Randy the owner.  Very friendly and a gracious host.  Being from Chicago and growing up on Chicago style hot dogs, I was a little unsure about some of the weird combinations on the menu, so I played it safe and went with the 3 Legged Chili and Cheese - almost 1/2 lb of Big Willy sliced in 3 - over a split sesame bun and covered in chili with big pieces of beef and lots of cheese!  Yum!  The hot dog was good quality and the chili was better than I expected.  Had a side of potato salad that was pretty good also.  They have a refrigerator case for your drinks, cans of soda are only $1.  They also had glass bottles of Coke and Pepsi.On Wed they have homemade potato and cheese pierogis and Randy said to call ahead if you're not coming until the evening because they almost always run out before they close at 7pm.  Take a stroll through the Antiques Marketplace after lunch.  They said it's the largest one in Arizona!
PastaBAR=Finally made it here with a group of friends in an attempt to order one of everything off of the menu. While we didn't accomplish this mission we had sure had a lot of fun working on it.I have to say that someone in the back is extremely heavy handed with the salt! I mean seriously, every app we order, Seasonal Vegetable, Mozz Salad, Fritto Misto and even the mixed lettuces, salty. You know I'm a fan of good seasoning but came on. I of course told our server who actually tasted the fried broccolini and agreed 100%, salty. No offer of taking them off the bill, remaking them or anything like that.. what it did seem clear is that the staff is afraid of the chef. Our server didn't even want to mention it it him till later, if something is broke, fix it! I will say though that if the apps weren't salty they prolly would have been outstanding, the initial flavors before the extreme saltiness hit you were very good. Also I have to bring up another point, why not serve bread? Charge me for it, whatever.. those shitty prepackaged bread sticks don't cut it at all! Apparently the chef feels that bread, and dessert for that matter, shouldn't be served at the PastaBar that the focus should be pasta, if that's the case then ditch the salty apps. Ya know if logic dictates then then make it consistent, ya know?Okay, onto what was really fun and yummy, the pasta and the sides. The pasta here is out of this world delicious! We ordered the Gnocchi, Chitarra Alla Amatriciana, Orecchiette and the Chitarra alla Carbonara. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented, each and everyone! The winner at the table was the ricotta Gnocchi! Each pillow bite was better than the last! The ragu was deliciously thick but lacked one thing, bread! All the sauce on the bottom of each pasta bowl was wasted since there was no bread to sop it all up. Damn that pisses me off to no end. Why make this outstanding pastas and sauces then waste it with no way to sop it up.. *sigh* The side of Pork Shoulder was phenomenal! Tender and juicy this was almost like a confit of pork with a nice puddle of liquid fat on the bottom of the plate, was a shame to let the plate leave with all the goodness sitting there.. I swear,  it cried out when the server took my plate. Haunting.Alright, I wont mentioned the lack of bread again but come on! LOL! There, over it.. next time I'm sneaking some in under my shirt! Ill charge the other diners 5 bucks for my bread service, it'll be fun! Who knew that bread could be considered contraband!I'll start by yelling, MORE PASTA PLEASE!... and that's a good thing because the dish I had was insanely delicious. I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara with Guanciale. Man-o- man was it good. Thanks to Kevin H for my new found addiction; Guanciale! You Rule!  Now back to the review...If I were rating my entire experience on the pasta alone, you would see 5 stars. However, in order to get there I feel a few tweaks are needed to land on perfection. First, the local greens salad I had was way overly salted and a bit meager in my opinion. A little less on the salt and throw in a few shavings of Parmigiano and you got a winner. Second, I feel the pricing structure is little steep for the lunch crowd and may be the reason why my co-worker and I were the only ones in the place during the 11am lunch hour on a Tuesday. Consider a price adjustment to attract the lunch crowd and you're sure to draw them in.  My bill with tip was $24.66 for the salad, tea, and pasta. Lastly, and I second Alexander's plea. Where's the freaking bread!  I could not believe I had to give up my bowl with a pool of deliciousness still left at the bottom. The drippings alone could feed a family of three. It was criminal. I mentioned my disappointment to our server who kindly said there were no plans to serve bread with pasta dishes, the cracker sticks is all they were serving. Ditch the cracker sticks man and get with the program. I begged with him to make it happen and was a bit dramatic while conveying this request.  He must have got the message because 10 min later he came back to our table saying that the kitchen staff was working on a plan to serve bread with the pasta dishes. I promised a return visit to validate the change and I look forward to reporting back.  Wishin' and Hopin' and Thinkin' and Prayin' la,la, la, la~Let me make this clear that I am aware the owners are going to read this and they know who I am and what I do. I am in no way going to let this fact influence my review. I came in for lunch with my dad and unfortunately for the restaurant, we were the only ones in it. Almost for the better, as dad had a lot of questions about where the ingredients came from and we had the full attention of Nick and the bartender. The space is clean, and has some local art on most of the walls. One wall though, needs to be decorated... it's very empty. The restrooms are outside the restaurant, which is only a minor inconvience.I ordered the gnocchi and it was good, but I have been very much spoiled by Marcellino's gnocchi, so I didn't truly think it was phenomonal. The portions at this restaurant are also crazy small. I honestly don't think I've had such a small meal at a restaurant as long as I can remember. I understand about ingredient prices, profit margins, etc. But I'd rather the prices be a couple dollars higher and get a larger meal. The overall experience was very positive, but I'd not be yearning to go back immediately. I'll save it for a somewhat special occasion. I think everyone would be happy to at least try it once though.When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.Thanks Denny's for saving my night.What a let down this place was.2.5 stars I have visited PastaBar twice now. Both times I have been left with the "Eh.. it's ok" opinion about it. The first visit was during their opening week, I believe. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I noticed the very stark decor and the nice big mirror they had to make the room look huge. We were seated in a corner booth that is not very comfortable for two people that want to sit next to each other, not across from each other (just a note). We took the time to look over a simple menu. They had just obtained their liquor license and our waiter was stumbling on the wine selection. While I understand that the liquor license is new, your knowledge of wine should not be. For such a nice place, the servers should have a slight knowledge of wine and be able to advise on them. When it came time to ordering our meal, our waiter was nice enough to advise us to order a side to split with our pasta if we were hungry. Good to know! On my first trip, I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara. I enjoyed the dish, except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it, personal taste is one thing, but when you're chewing into black pepper...woah. I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce. The pasta was very good, I like my pastas al dente and this pasta met my expectation. My date ordered the gnocchi. It was again just ok. On the side my date and I split the meatballs. I thought they were ok. The sauce wasn't your run of the mill spaghetti sauce. It had a smoky, almost barbecued flavor to it. It was good, but again a little crazy with the black pepper. At the end of that trip I was left with a "yeah....uh...I think it was good" and vowed to come back to render my final decision. The second trip sealed the coffin for me. We were greeted and seated immediately, once again. I took the time to really check out the place. Oh! They put new artwork up....um... I will refer to the art as "Signs of the Apocalypse". Timothy McVeigh? Really? I found it tasteless, but to each his own. Knocked the restaurant down a notch for me, personally. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozz, Marinara "crudo" to start. Our waitress left us to take our time looking at the menu. I decided on Orecchiette with homemade sausage and greens. My friend and I shared the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder. We noted that our appetizer was taking forever and when I spotted the waitress to ask her about it, she was delivering our dinner.... HUGE pet peeve. I gently said "You delivered our entrees before our appetizer." She stood looking astonished and said "OH! Yes I did!" and continued to stand as if she was lost. Well after we told her we still wanted the appetizer, she came back MUCH later with the incorrect appetizer, and offered to leave it and not charge us for it. NO. Wrong. If the customer ordered an appetizer, they wanted that one for a reason. Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience, but that's not it folks! Rewind to our meals. My pasta was lukewarm at best. It was like I rewarmed leftover pasta and didn't warm it all the way and decided to eat it out of a Tupperware bowl. This was definitely not the marking of a 17 dollar bowl of pasta. By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish, it was cold. At this point, I was so irritated, I truly didn't care. I know we're not in Scottsdale, but does that mean we need to sacrifice quality and service due to a different zip code? I know we're in America, but do we need to offend patrons with artwork of mass murderers while they're trying to eat? Again, to each his/her own, but I doubt I will visit PastaBar again. I'm sure it will thrive without a few people with discerning taste. It's not a place I will crave, it's not a place that I would jump to visit again.I'd give this place 3.5 stars... after reading the other reviews I expected a half of a cup of pasta or something ridiculous but I thought the portion was adequate. And, I was REALLY hungry when I got there. We ordered the olives as a starter (they are all green and served warm) and were able to get some bread to accompany the reserve oil. Our server voluntarily explained menu items with important details like: it's ricotta gnocchi, not potato and the extra items in the puntanesca sauce (my recipe only has 7). We both had the orecchiette with sausage and greens. I found it to be a bit oily but the pasta was cooked well. He described the deserts perfectly and the chocolate bark with almonds was a nice finish with a second glass of nero d'avalo, and, by the way... I though the wine prices were very reasonable! Without tip, we spent about $36 a person and we each had two glasses of wine and left satisfied!Overhyped!!Yeah,  the Chef and manager are from Scottsdale...so what?Yeah,  the pasta are all homemade....so what?If it ain't good...it just ain't good... even if you used fresh hard to find ingredients, if the execution is not there..the dish is...so what?Harsh I know, but my one pet peeve is when non-locals come to Downtown claiming to make a change in Downtown..and this is what we get?!?After talking to the head chef (it was a sat night  and there was 1 table at 9pm)  I find his claims in changing the downtown late dining scene to be obsurd..hello have you heard of Carly's, Fate, Sens....Anyways, about the food....I ordered the gnocchi with sausage...it was ok , I have had better....the only thing is..I could not find any sausage!  The portions were a bit small for the price.The pork shoulder was the other item I ordered that night...it was tender but too salty!  Not my thing...I ordered coffee which they said they could make, only to come back to me and say that they do not have any coffee cups!  what? :)My friend and I shared those two items, with 1 drink and tip, it came out to $40 bucks...kinda high when you consider the portions and quality..I dont mind paying that kind of price if the food was good....IF it was good.....The call came at 11:30 AM..."We're here at Park Central waiting for you to go to lunch downtown"." I said, lunch is tomorrow not today, but I said, OK, bee there in 10 minutes". Friend says's he heard that Pasta Bar was good so let's try that. I said, yeah, there are 3 restaurants there, a Irish Pub (Turf) a Thai restaurant (Sens) and Pasta Bar. I said "Larry likes Thai"...Phil said, "Phil likes Italian" and that was the fateful decision.I knew I was in trouble when we entered the restaurant and first, there was not a "sense of entry" nor anyone to greet us other than the strong smell of newly painted walls. Bartender said "sit where you like". Two of us had the lunch special (about $12) and friend who suggested Pasta Bar ordered from the menu. His pasta was $15. Lunch special came with a drink. I will say, the pasta was very tasty, the salad had very good thought and fresh locally grown produce. Salad and pasta lunch special was served on the same plate which to  me was unappetizing. Lunch came with a very thin slice of bread. Bread was excellent but no butter. Server/bartender was made aware and out came a the smallest portion of butter I have ever been served and to be shared with all three of us. There was enough to cover half a Triscut wafer! Pasta was fresh, but without any meat. The atmosphere is dark and we were told that it was to be an Italian diner. What added to the dark side was the art work. Andy Warhol images of Jim Jones, Rasputin, Christopher McVey and other icons of evil. The headache lingered on all day after I paid the bill for $52 for lunch. Hope they improve the portions, the service and the look. I would be hard pressed to come back.After reading about PastaBAR on yelp- I had to go see for myself what the heck is going on here!Walked in--- liked the seating situation and the ambiance.  Had the nicest server ever, his name was Nick.  He talked about the menu and answered our questions.  Brought some really great tea and tangy lemonade.  We ordered the fried mozzarella, they make the cheese there-- it was so good.  But not as good as my entree!  I ordered pappardelle and it was possibly the best pasta I have had at a restaurant ever.  It tasted just like my Nonna's homemade pasta, the perfect texture, cooked the real Italian al dente way and I was in heaven.  It was the special and it sure was special.  The portions were good too.  After reading everyone's reviews about portions, I was scared I was going to have to pick a sandwich up afterwards, but no-sir-ee.  I was happily full and planning my next trip!!!Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after 4 visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  3. Love dwntwn Phx.So what could go wrong? Service: No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the "signature cocktails" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily "Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now." Yikes.Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.Vibe:The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)The Cocktails:They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. The Food:Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, "gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water." The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? Sadly, no.At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)I don't quite get PastaBAR.This place is 1000% right in my wheelhouse. Passionate about one thing. Focus on getting that completely right. Focus on quality ingredients. I'd heard positive recommendations by many friends and colleagues I respect. I was expecting to love it. How could I not?I don't know. Maybe my expectations were way out of whack. They had been knocked down a bit that same night by 3 or 4 friends that had been there.  I was in the area and itching to go even though I'd heard multiple comments that it was kind of meh.Well, we ended up going later in the night.First of all, I get the space. It's cool. Has character. No problems there.  Service was great as well. No issues at all.No problem with the pricing or portions. In fact I thought it was quite reasonable.I first tried the buffalo mozzarella, basil pesto, heirloom tomatoes. It was nice. I dug it. Would have happily eaten more. No fireworks though. And maybe I'm unfair for expecting them.Then I tried the two entrees I most wanted. Both had gotten rave reviews in a recent article.  I ordered the chitarra alla carbonara (guanciale/bacon, farm egg, local onion, pecorino) and I tried the orecchiette con salsiccia (home-made sausage, greens, pecorino).Now over the past couple of years I've really developed an appreciation for people doing simple or standard things really, really well. That was what I was expecting here. The food was definitely good but with all the pub that it's gotten, it definitely didn't knock me off my chair.  And the thing is that I've recently been repeatedly knocked off my chair by other spots doing standard, simple homemade pastas with killer, killer ingredients. Have been hit totally out of left field and couldn't believe how amazing a pappardelle with homemade sausage was. Or a linguine with clams.I'm guessing that maybe my expectations were out of whack but I left appreciating the meal but saddened that I felt no hurry to rush back.BORING, FLAVORLESS, OVERPRICED CRAP; exposed-filament bulbs, paper napkins, sans s/p shakers. Kale- and collard-earthy and squishy garnishes little better than pig fodder.--sealed brown concrete, minimalist 5x7 postage-stamp art in monochromatic, rhythmically-spaced repetition--exposed-filament bulbs throughout give that yellowish glow evocative of kidnap cinema;--gangsta buser keeps glaring at us, slamming our glasses down after refilling them; oh, maybe we won't get out of here alive!--going to charge me $17 for pasta? buy some GODDAM cloth napkins!--"table bread" is a plastic package of stale, pencil-thick breadsticks. what would you think if someone brought you two packs of saltines? Yeah, that's what I mean!--ambient music an unpleasant mix of rural-southern Creole woo-woo ritual chant, washboard-and-spoon percussion and harmonica (I think they recruited that woman from the GTA3 shanty town);--outside, the manager is explaining to the police amidst an army of tow trucks that these cars really are valet-professionally parked, not by their owners.--heirloom tomato side dish was the one delicious thing. At $3, the best value on the menu (+1 star)...--unfortunately the spices were so old there was no flavor left in them.--no s/p shakers; on request we received two contact-lens cups of s/p for pinching, chef style (i.e. no spoons).On our way out, some employee was being disciplined on the back steps, presumably about to quit.I've never been so glad to quit a place as this.Worst Pasta I have ever eaten. I'm not even kidding. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozzarella, Pork Shoulder & Calamari to start .. all of it aside from the Pork was blah and unimpressive, the Pork was tasty, but the flavor was REALLY strong and I couldn't eat much of it before wanting to vomit.For our entrees we got the Orecchiette alla Puttanesca($15)... which apparently has 12 random ingredients from some streetwalkers pantry and last time I checked, a streetwalker is a hooker, so, I mean, if you're cool with eating shit from a hookers pantry, order this, its not good. We also got the Fettuccini Tagliatta($19)... rib-eye was a little tough, noodles tasted funky and me and my palate were overall just very disinterested in eating more than 2 bites. Also, id like to add that both entrees were not hot, like they had been sitting there for a while. This irritates me to no end.Not only was the meal sub-par, but its was freakin' expensive! Honestly id rather bust open a package of Safeway brand angel hair and Prego from a can - it tastes better anyway.Sorry PastaBar, never again.
Brio Tuscan Grille=Dear Brio,After giving you such rave reviews back in 2009, you have kindly let me down in the most unexpected way. See I do understand that you do not take reservations for happy hour, and I totally respect that. However the fact that I came to give you a courtesy head's up that I was bringing around 40+ people over the three hour time spam for my birthday happy hour a week in advance and you kindly but adamantly let me know that you could not accommodate me left me speechless. Your friendly manager kindly explained that he did not want a "rowdy" group and that he wanted to keep everything orderly.  He let me know that no I could not hold two tables once I arrived and that my party would be seated separately as they came in to keep everything orderly. So no standing around and being unorderly, et al. Again the look on my face was priceless. Last I check I was almost 40 and my friends don't get "rowdy" but ok whatever. However I still had a friendly smile and thanked your manager for letting me know that in so many words he did not want my business and that I needed to find a new venue.Yea hmm wow. No worries. I found another place that welcomed me with open arms for my birthday happy hour and they don't mind if we stand around and get a little "rowdy".  Love,EbsI've driven by Brio many of times and never really had any desire to visit this place. My family talked me into it the other night. So it was game on for this place. Walking into Brio I was a little surprised. It seemed like a more upscale Macaroni Grille. They use butcher paper for their table tops but fancier than MG. They have high ceilings and somewhat reminded me of some of the Las Vegas places with high ceiling and huge lights. Very nice decor. We started off with their bread basket of hot sour dough and flat bread. Really good. Down right outstanding. So if this was good I can't wait for our meals so come. I ordered the Sausage Peperonata Pomodoro. Very nice dish. Nice amount of sausage that had a little kick with tender pasta, cherry tomatoes, and Broccoli. The cream sauce was really good. It was really tasty and I really enjoyed it. I would say the star of our dinner was my wife's Balsamic Strawberry Chicken Salad. Wow. Outstanding. My wife was raving about it and everyone tried it. Both of my kids said that next time they are going to order this salad. It was the BOMB. I don't remember what was in it but it was booming with flavor. My daughter really liked her Chicken Pomodoro Classico with the red sauce. Looked really good and she just gobbled it up. My so ordered the Raviloi Di Bello and it had mushrooms and tomatoes. I tried this and the Raviloi was so fresh with cheese in the middle. It was very good and filling. We had a really good meal and everyone enjoyed their dinner. Our server was Dane S. She was really good. She welcomed us very quickly at our table and brought us our water cups. She was always paying attention to us. She did a great job but she was all business. She didn't show no personality but that's okay. So let's see. Nice decor, high ceilings which makes the place a little loud (that's okay), very good food, and excellent service. What more can you ask for.  So I enjoyed a great meal and will definitely be back. Enjoy.
La Parilla Villa Catering=I'm am just updating since they are open, and my review before is now outdated.Simply put:Best street tacos in Phoenix. Hands down.food is awesome and the prices are great!
Rita's Kitchen & R Bar=We had the most amazing breakfast buffet here while staying at the Camelback Inn. The restaurant is very beautiful, interesting glass fixture hanging thru out, rich dark woods, nice views of the patio. The buffet include omelets, the best hash brown potatoes in the world. Other food choices include juevos rancheros, fresh pastries, breads, bagels, muffins, bacon, sausage, cured meats, yogurts, fresh fruits, granola, cereal, etc. Service here is also amazing. I highly recommend Rita's for breakfast.2/23/10Sat at the patio to admire the colorful and lush surroundings, but at the expense of sitting on very damp cushions, which I didn't even notice until I had risen to go the restroom to wash my hands before having a bite to eat.  (Another man sitting at the next table eventually stood up to look for drier cushions, as well.)  Service was very friendly- that is, up until I paid, but more about this later.  Ordered the weekly drink special- the rose margarita.  Delicious!  Pretty, too.  For apps, I tried the Cilantro hummus ($2) and the Grilled steak skewers ($5).  Loved the hummus and pita, and the pita also paired well w/ the spicy cheese sauce that came w/ the steak skewers.  As for the skewers themselves... these were processed meat pieces, not from fresh steaks.  I did not appreciate the texture.  (I'm very interested to read about others' opinions on this dish.)  To think I received more satisfaction from a $2 dish and a cheese sauce!  At least the margarita was very good...As I've said, the service was very friendly, and patient, answering all of my allergy concerns.  I had a very hard time securing a working outlet for my laptop, though, w/ my server and the assistant manager saying that the outlet that I found was "out-of-service."  Yet, a third server/runner enthusiastically offered to get maintenance to have a look at the outlet, only to be intercepted by the asst. mgr., and suddenly, I was out of luck again.  Apparently, the asst. manager didn't want me to have use of my laptop while sitting outside.  Too bad, bec. I would've ordered another drink AND a dessert had I been able to stay much longer, but my dying battery had me packing and looking for an outlet to use elsewhere.  (Also, when it looked like I wasn't going to have access to an outlet, and after repeated visits from the server regarding dessert, I decided to ask for my receipt.  It took quite awhile to get the table ticket.  It seemed like when she knew I wasn't planning on ordering anything more, the friendly service disappeared.  Where once I had two or more reps coming over asking if I needed their assistance, I now couldn't even flag down one for a glass of water!)I'd like to come back to surround myself again in such sensuous and verdant environs; I just will be sure not to visit right after it rains.  I may even just skip R-Bar and try Rita's Kitchen or BLT Steak's happy hour menus, instead.  Perhaps it's best not to return at all?  I wouldn't want to trouble the Camelback Inn staff to wait on a troublesome customer such as myself...as the holidays fade into the calendar behind me i reflect back on the month of december and i realize i spent the entire past month attending an ocean of parties, drinking a river of christmas cocktails, and wading through a forest of friends at random gatherings in a haze of booze and mistletoe.it was festive, it was fun... and it was exhausting. as i scroll back through the rolodex of 2010 holiday memories, the R Bar most certainly stands out as one of my top 5 favorite evenings.our very big group of holiday revelers was initially seated indoors as we waited for a circle of chairs surrounding a fire pit to free up. right after we ordered our first round, the sweetheart of a hostess ran over to let us know the party sitting there had just closed their tab and we could pounce on the coveted area. once our group was seated outdoors in over sized lounge chairs beneath twinkle lights by a crackling fire, i took note of the rest of our surroundings.... stunning! a striking desert rock formation as a backdrop, waterfalls roaring, a moat trickling through, live music filled the air, laughter, conversation, clinking glasses.i don't know if it was the group i was there with, the energy of the crowd, or that everyone seems to be in an especially happy mood during the holidays, but the air had an electricity to it that night.... i settled back into the cushions, poured myself deep into a cocktail and let me date hold my hand.  we ended up staying until closing time and then finally moved onto a new venue.alas, R Bar is the kind of place you don't remember much about the service because it was so flawlessly executed... you don't remember the name of your drink, only that it tasted divine and you barely remember the conversations you had, only that you laughed the entire time.however, you DO remember you hated leaving and couldn't wait to come back.PS: ok, i lied. i did remember ordering the rose margarita a few times and yummmm.Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. Breakfast: Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. Lunch:Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.The R Bar has great specials on food and drinks during happy hour from 3:00-6:00, daily, which you can enjoy sitting up high on bar stools or sinking into a comfy low couch.Thursday, my roommate and I enjoyed fish tacos, pan seared, NOT breaded and fried.  Two regular size tacos come folded in soft corn tortillas with crisp cabbage and veggies displayed in an ingenious zig-zag shaped metal holder with a side of salsa for $7.00. (I think they are $15 normally.  I had a glass of merlot off the happy hour menu and it wasn't bad.Friday, my roommate ordered the chicken tacos and I ordered the lettuce wrap chicken fajitas.  The lettuce shell (several layers thick) was piled so high with yummy chicken and peppers that I had to eat a good bit of it before there was any hope of getting the lettuce to wrap around anything.  They should have called it the lettuce spilling out everywhere fajitas.  They arrived with sides of salsa and sour cream.Saturday, we missed happy hour by a few minutes and ended up splitting a quesadilla that was very tasty.  I ordered a Kiltlifter from local Tempe, AZ brewery Four Peaks which I enjoyed immensely.  There was live music to help me get over my sadness at missing happy hour.On Sunday, I rad the lettuce wrap fajitas again - they were just too good to keep switching, and another Kiltlifter.  My boss ordered the sliders and seemed to enjoy them.  They have live music nightly starting at 6:00 pm.
The Parlor=In this day and age of many pizza concepts around the valley sometimes it's tough to figure out which one you actually want to visit. For me it really has to be a complete package for me to sit down and spend my hard earned money. In my years of package peeking I think I've become quite the expert and can quickly sum up if it's worth exploring or not.One part of this package is coifed, bobbed, styled and blown; Salon de Venus was making women beautiful for 58 years in the same location on Camelback and 19th Street.  The star shaped bricks along Camelback are unmistakably Phoenix and remind me of being a wee package peeker growing up in the valley. The new owners Dan and son Aric Mei deserve so much credit for preserving the wall and repurposing many of the items used in the old salon space. Every time we turn around there is something being ripped and bulldozed over to make way for the new with no respect to the old, hats off to them for their thoughtful redesign. What has been done to the new space is simply amazing. The sheer volume and proportion of the main dining room while open, has a sense of coziness and interest with the use of wood and other recycled materials. You can tell that the building is special and well thought out with so many details you can discover something different on each visit. Since the space is so well designed and inspired, what about the menu? Created by two local chefs, Jared Porter and Jerry Alday, the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients. There is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance. They have many of their own herbs, vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes. I even noticed several eggplants growing which I hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit. While the menu is pizza centric, there is also a varietal of sandwiches, salads and pasta. For the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from. Aside from Mac and Cheese, this part also includes a B.L.T. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie, how cool is that?Looking at a great package I like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package, in this case the balls. Arancini ($8) which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto, deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. These are some of the tastiest balls I've had in ages and are a must when ordering. Having a similar impact is the Cauliflower Gratinata ($7) that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted. Basically a cauliflower au gratin, it's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread. For something a little bit different, the Eggplant Cannelloni ($8) uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta. The slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of Parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes. On the lighter side, salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite. On one visit Parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage, Queen Creek Olives, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette ($9.50). In a similar preparation, the on menu Parlor Insalata ($6.50) showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad. While the heat coming from the wood-burning oven couldn't be felt, you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package.  Coming in at 8" and 12" sizes, you can have it a few different ways, your way or the chef's way. Though why limit yourself to just 8" when you can have 12", right? The 12" is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin. The wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection, Parlor has some seriously great crust! Yukon Gold Potato ($10/$14) is so simply built its near perfect. Roasted potato, gorgonzola cheese, leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself. Desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying. Seasonal Fruit Skillet ($7.50) was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make. Made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right, was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Taking my time with each bite, savoring the quality and preparation, it's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable. So when you get a chance go ahead, take a peek at that package, you'll never know what you might find unless you look.I wanted to do my own thing and only give this place four stars, but I realized I have no justification for doing so.  I loved every bite of my meal, the service was fine, and the ambiance was killer.  I'd describe the space as very open and very welcoming, but in a modern/mid-century modern wrapper.  The pricing is fair, the beer selection good.  Fresh herbs growing out front is a nice touch.  I like it a lot, and expect to be back soon.Oh hell yes!Now this is what I'm talking about baby! Freshly prepared pastas, delicious inventive salads, and fancy pizza I actually like?? I must be dreaming as this simply cannot be Phoenix.In the business of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of fancy pizza. I prefer crispy, thin crust, NJ style pizza. For The Parlor however, I make an exception. The dough is just a touch fluffy but fantastic. Each pie is cooked to a perfect crisp in their wood burning oven. Their ingredients are top notch, many of which they actually grow themselves.I've been to The Parlor probably 4 or 5 times at this point, and I have yet to eat/drink anything that wasn't mouth-watering. Yes, the pizza and salads are great, but the pasta, holy crap THE PASTA!!! Being a young girl growing up in North Jersey, pasta (spaghetti bolognese in particular) has always been my comfort food. To the point that it's the only thing I ever bothered to learn how to cook, and I hate to cook.But after sub-par Italian restaurant after sub-par Italian restaurant in Phoenix, I found myself cooking far more than I like. I am thrilled to say that I am have to cook no more! Because The Parlor makes one hell of a delicious bowl of Pappardelle Bolognese. The pasta is the perfect texture, practically melts in your mouth. The bolognese sauce is thick and meaty as it should be. Literally, heaven.I always order the small size, for the reasonable price of $10, and have never once finished it. I feel like the large size may feed me for a week.Another great thing about The Parlor is their beer and wine list. Extensive and cheap!!! And by cheap I don't mean 2 buck chuck, but I mean they don't mark up their bottles nearly as much as many of the other local establishments that I frequent, and this recession-living girl appreciates that. Huge list of beers on tap, and they serve them in pitchers. Something about a nice restaurant willing to serve me my beer in a pitcher that warms my heart, can't explain it, it just does.I think it's fairly obvious that I am turning into a regular at The Parlor and am actually pleased about it, and if you're ever in the hood, you should be too."All we need is because, come and party with us "just had a belated birthday dinner party with what i consider my family. figured parlor was the spot to try, yes there are other places i want to try. but this jumped my bookmarks. rolled in bout 6:30 parking was scarce. wait was 45 mins. the waiting patio is cute. herb garden, outside fireplace *off* and the most awesome door i have seen on an eating establishment yet. wood. yup i got hard. 45 minutes later seated. party of 4 nice table sans-booth on this roll up. hostess was nice, introduced herself and asked if it was our first time. i blushed..how did she know i was virgin...bitch. why you gotta call a man out like that? oh well. waitress was nice, did a good job,..could be better..yea. but could have been way way way way worse. i aint gonna rip on someone doing their job unless they just miscarried in my food. that i cannot put up with. that thankfully didn't happen here so i got no beef. i did get some pork. yup sapriccio pizza, (sausage and yum moo!zarella) on a 8". also grubbed on the pesto on a eight inch platter, on deck was the pepperoni. all 3 pizzas was spectacular. gooey ooey and crisp, center of the bottom crust was firm and crisp, unlike bianco and metro which can have some cooking codensation. none here. just pure crisp, like a kit kat. ya know. 7 buck pitchers of PBR. the beer selection was really good. but i was bout the ribbon tonight. grabbed some bruchetta.. some coal charred bits of awesome covered in some sweet and savory toppins. pine nuts, red sweet peppers, some great spreaded cheese topping to hold in all on board. made a great start. pizza was bomb. i'm talking manhatten project bomb. i was blown away like a 1940's japanese soldier. flavors are well put together for signature pizzas. plus you can build you own.. gonna be here a lot more. price isn't bad. actually affordable. i really wanted to snatch a menu because they do not have one posted on the website. worth a trip. hell well worth the 45 minutes wait. i saw plenty of daters coming in and then walking away. come on clown. it's only time. any ways...i think it's a great addition to the cenpho area. viva non-chain revolucion ya heard!Totally MM (Marriage Material).I LOVE this place.-Easy parking and access-Separate dining and bar area-Shaded patio seating-Fresh ingredients-Approved portion sizes by yours truly-Good service-Good coffee and they offer french press (totally MM without the prenup)I hereby nominate the Parlor's basil vodka gimlet as best cocktail in the Valley!The pizza's good. The pastas are house-made - and well, I might add. Great sauces. I love the salon chairs at the bar - a nod to the building's previous incarnation.But that drink. I'm tellin' ya: Best. Of. Phoenix.I am giving 4 stars but will say it is 4.132548. I liked everything but the service. Granted they were a little busy but the server seemed to care less. He was there to answer questions, know his stuff but the actual service was a bit lacking. He actually told me "I forgot about you" LOLWe split a:Parlor saladPesto pasta with chicken (small) served with breadSmokey Pizza (Small)Everything was really good. The salad was fresh and had a great mixture of veggies. We loved the crispy chickpeas. The pasta was very good, great flavor, plenty of pesto, a little light on the chicken and portion but it was a small size. We quickly went through the one piece of bread, and used the crust of the pizza to soak the rest of the pesto up. The pizza was excellent, great combo of flavors and the crust was spot on. (on par with Pizza A Metro)As I said the only downfall was the service.I love this restaurant!  Just had dinner last night.  The pizza was outstanding.  You can pick your own ingredients and I picked Gorgonzola cheese, roasted chicken, spinach.  It was outstanding.  The staff was very efficient and had my meal in what seemed like minutes. Since I wanted dessert, I shared my pizza with my friend and will have the saved pieces for lunch. For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu which was also outstanding. Will definitely visit this place again. The atmosphere is very nice, muted colors.  Great for a date or after work.too bad, but you knew it would happenthe douche bags would find this place outand now, the hoards and the massesof DB's are roaming aboutthis groovy, mid-century modernthat tosses a pretty good piebut sadly the ol' DB factorhas ruined the place, for this guyit's no fault of the ownersthey did their very bestbut now the dicks and bonershave descended from the East and the Westside, in their True Religionsto prey on the Cougars, et alwho also have seeked out the parlorthe kitty's have started to crawlaround, looking for actionmade up, for making outand you know the rules of attractionwill keep the C's and DB's, turning out.I'll miss you, Parlor Pizzaenjoyed our little affair,but I'm off, seeking douche-free pasturesman!! ....I used to love it there.....I'm going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. I've been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options.The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.Audrey & I met Kevin & Marian at The Parlor for dinner.  Since they don't take reservations we waited about half an hour in the bar.  The bar area is nice and the service was good.  It was very crowded and noisy.  The Parlor has a nice selection on tap including a couple of my favorites, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  Between the outdoor seating area, the bar and the open yet warm restaurant I had a sense that this was a place the cool kids would hang out.  This was confirmed when I remembered that Kevin & Marian were there with us.  Further confirmation of the cool kid factor was provided when Ayesha and Amber were discovered at the bar a bit later.  We shared a couple orders of the Arancini appetizer which was excellent in flavor and textural complexity with a delicious sauce.  When our server commented that he didn't think anyone else in the valley offered these I had to think back to the last time I had them.  It was on Long Island at a family Italian place called Blue Moon in Rockville Centre.  Kudos to The Parlor.I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza.  Between the blending of sweet and savory flavors, the tender pulled chicken, the roasted serrano chili's...this is good stuff.  It doesn't hurt a bit that it is made on a wood fired crust that has a great firmness and consistency.  Sitting here writing about it...I may have to go get the leftovers for breakfast.  brb....I'm back.  Even cold that was awesome pizza.  Note to self:  hot coffee does not cool the burning much when you get several slices of serrano together....I also sampled Kevin's pizza and Audrey's burger.  Both excellent.  The parmesan fries were dare I say it...better than the fries at FEZ.  The service was top notch throughout the meal.  We finished by sharing a slice of tiramisu.  Made with mascarpone cheese as it should be, nice flavors of rum, coffee, etc coming through.  I also had a coffee.  Single serving (probably about 16oz) french press.  Again, excellent.  So there it is...5 stars.  I started out at 4 stars because...maybe I'm a little stingy with my 5 stars.  But what could I knock off a star for?  Umm...honestly I can't really think of anything that stood out wrong.  The Parlor has a fairly simple and straightforward menu which...at least on this Saturday night...they executed flawlessly.I think I just had the best roasted beet salad of my life ... and who'da thought a pizza parlor, ahem, The Parlor, would have blown me away after a so-called fabulous dinner at a fancy new American restaurant in Houston during Yelp Eats? The Parlor, beet salads across America should bow down to thee. In town for a Yelp Elite Event, the awesome Gabi K suggested this somewhat new (three months old) pizza place that's garnered such raving reviews on Yelp. Since we're both "dieting," she noted that they have a great selection of salads. I'm in!The Parlor is a beauty and architecture and design fans will admire the simple clean lines, woodwork, and natural but modern essence of this former beauty "parlor" which it still holds true to if you look closely. A lot of the wood (bar and tables) and other pieces were reused from the former beauty salon and reworked into The Parlor. Way to stay Green! This bit of info was given to us by bartender Chris, and yes, Amber W is right. What a cutie. But more importantly, attentive and friendly.When you walk in, you can choose to go left and sit at a dining table, or go right into the bar area, grab a seat there or at one of the high boys (which seats six). The bar area is where all the magic happened for us on this glorious day...No one should miss out on the cauliflower appetizer. Forgive me if I get the details wrong, but all I can remember is a steaming hot plate of the healthy vegetable covered and swimming in an Alfredo-like, creamy cheese sauce and sprinkled with more cheese (Parmesan?) and baked to a slight crunch. It's served with toasted focaccia. Yumz. And the roast beet salad ($9.50) that is *this* close to moving me over to the 602? Think large quarter cuts of orange heirloom beets (which I've never seen before), fennel, avocado chunks, onions and walnut-crusted goat cheese--a generous portion of goat cheese I must add. For $4 more, add the roasted chicken for a protein boost.And The Parlor is more than just pizza, salads, sandwiches and friggin' good apps. I was also happy to find a cheese and meat menu. With a bottle of red, this would be a perfect date! (And in cooler weather, you can sit out on the patio and snuggle up to the fire pit with your sweetie. Til then, stay inside!)Looks like the lovely Farrah A beat me to the punch and yelped about our luscious lunch today before me... I'll just add my two cents here, so make sure you read (and UFC) Farrah's review too if you haven't already!Upon picking Farrah up from the airport today, I wanted to take her to lunch.  Instead of the usual LGO stop, I decided to finally make my way to The Parlor... Chris, our server, was fantastic - helping us decide between the eggplant and cauliflower apps (cauliflower it was), helping me choose between black tea and green tea (green for me), and selling us on the roast beet salad (no onions on mine).  Upon seeing our Yelp stickers on our laptops (yes, we were those geeks with our laptops out at lunch), he commented that he'd seen Amber's comment and was flattered by that - too funny!We enjoyed every bite as well as the crisp, clean, green-friendly ambiance of the restaurant, the service, the view of the garden, and of course the company... I will for sure return for the pizza and/or other menu selections post wedding diet!  The Parlor is a welcome addition to the Camelback Corridor!I loved the pizza, the service not so much. We came here a few weeks ago, when Saturday nights were still date nights (before college football season). There was a short wait for a table in the dining room, but we found some seats at the bar and decided to sit there instead. Oops. Although there were at least 4 bartenders behind the bar and they weren't busy they were all standing around and chatting and pretty much ignored those trying to order. Finally one of them came over to take our order. Luckily there were many of them behind the bar because the girl we ordered from was almost nonexistent for most of the night. The pizza was so good. Thin and cheesy with a crispy crust. We will absolutely have to try the meat and cheese plate and the arancini next time. They both looked yummy. Cool, sleek and clean atmosphere. I love the recycled wood. I also love the herb garden near the entrance (I'm currently trying to not kill my own) and the patio looks like the perfect spot to eat and drink once the nights cool down around here. I'd love to just have a meat and cheese plate out there with a glass of wine and just relax.I like to bring red heads here. I don't know why it works out this way it just does. I think red heads really suit The Parlor. Alright, alright, alright.The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.*****LISTEN UP OWNERS*****I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!I wanted to love you Parlor. You have such great potential for so many reasons. First off, you are smoking hot. Sorry, I mean attractive. Your decor is sensational, even when I'm sitting next to the pipework.I've also fallen for your personality. It's subtle and sexy. Mysterious, yet calm. I don't know how you are able to make me feel relaxed and excited at the same time, but I like it. As if it couldn't get better, you are creative. You have found ways to make me love pasta, and I am not really a fan of Italian food. Your spaghetti with basil pesto and pine nuts was a true culinary masterpiece. You even let me order it without tomato. It was also just the right size. The apple smoked bacon soup you made me was ingenious. What a delicious starter. However, you had one flaw that I just cannot get over. You did not let me order dessert. Why was that? Do you think I'm fat? I had a perfectly sized dinner, you made it for me yourself. Why did you wait so long to come back and ask me if I wanted dessert (which I did) that I was worried it would take equally as long to get it to me and therefore passed? It made me very sad. I had to settle for Gelato Spot instead. I love you, but if you can't deal with my love of desert, it was not meant to be.Well you know if I  can't wait to take back Mom  , it's got  to be good!  The hubby and my youngest all went to dinner Saturday. We went at prime dinner time and were pleasantly surprised at no wait.We  were torn between the Funghi Pizza and Yukon Gold/ Gorgonzola. Each looked good when we saw them throughout the restaurant. We ended up with Yukon Gold  which  I loved .  Crust was super tasty. Hubby is looking forward to going back and getting Funghi  next time. My ten year old baby  had cheese pizza  and loved it . Looking forward to next time.I adore  the  Funghi Pizza and Beet Salad  , can't wait to go back !!  Tonight's Field trip to Scottsdale was completed with dinner at The Parlor and 100 % of my little group L-O-V-E-D  it...Had lunch here w/ Violeta today.  Funny- I had spotted The Parlor a few times whilst looking for other venues, but even w/ the knowledge of the address and the general area of where to look, I still missed the turn into TP's corner!  Strange, that.We really liked the ambience of TP.  Wood everywhere- much of the wood and windows were recycled from a Bahama Breeze that had shut down awhile back.  I was hoping we'd be able to dine outside, but there wasn't a spot available; No worries- indoors isn't as noisy as I feared, and it was great to see how busy this place can get!I had planned to order only an entree, which was a task, I tell you, since the menu was chock-full of delicious-sounding selections!  However, we were at a pizza joint, and what better than to order the house's specialty?  Since V. ordered a salad insalata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=rESBIwLbWWIuuBmiUrzfog ($6.50) along w/ a Margherita pizza, I decided I'd try the Farm salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=fBvN3SRC2CsX6H3ZC1DX2A ($7), as well as customizing my own 8-inch pizza ($6) w/ ricotta and pecorino cheeses ($1 each), artichokes ($1), and rosemary and sage (n/c). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=hsvoqgf-kCxmbUK-QcpKoA  We chatted for quite some time before the salads arrived, but what a beauty mine was to behold when it did!  I felt terrible for V. since her salad came w/ salami- I can relate to her misgivings for the dish, as I, too, am not a fan.  But what of my Farm salad?!  Roasted chicken, baby greens, pear slices, gorgonzola, spiced pecans, and dressed w/ a white balsamic vinaigrette.  I thought the chicken was a bit too tender in its soaked and shredded form (I would've preferred it grilled), and the dish could've used a bit more gorgonzola, or perhaps a pinch of sea salt to add a little more flavor, but the candied pecans did spruce the dish up a little.  And what of the pizza?  Well, even the server had to comment on how great it smelled!  It was a lovely sight to see, and I really liked the flavors.  I would need to speficy that I'd like the crust to be more crispy next time, but I can't complain on how fresh the cheeses were, and the artichokes seemed to be fresh and not from a can.Since V. wasn't up for splitting a dessert, I ordered the zeppole (Italian donuts) to-go.  These were described to be ricotta fritters rolled in cinnamon-sugar and garnished w/ seasonal sauces (cranberry relish and a nutella ganache).  I love ricotta, so I had to try it.  I was hoping to crack open a donut hole to see candied ricotta oozing out, but it was just fried donut batter that was moist due to the added ricotta.  I did have one at the resto, and while it was good, I wouldn't order it again.I'll definitely be back--so many items on the menu begging to be tried!Absolutely love this place!  Came here with a girlfriend of mine for lunch on Saturday, and can't rave about this place enough.  Decor is awesome, very sheik and modern.  Service was awesome, and food was tasty.  They have a great little menu here, and you get good food for a great price.   I went with a parlor burger, and they have a few nontraditonal toppings to choose from.  I cant remember what I got on top, but dang, its good!  Have I mentioned how much I love the decor here?  Service was AWESOME too.  Will return in a heartbeat.1/21/10Ordered the duck club http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=7A5VAyqfTeIMbaoicdd9GA minus the red wine tomato jam and instead had pesto on the side, along w/ the roasted garlic aioli and the side of fries that come with the entree.  Looked great- the fries were perfect (!), but, and perhaps the absence of the red wine tomato jam had something to do with it, I didn't find the sandwich to be anything to write home about.  The delicious and crispy apple-smoked bacon and roasted garlic aioli were big pluses and helped to round out this review to three stars.  The tiramisu I had for dessert was very good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=AaTAT23mL5rguQtrmDEbNw  Your usual espresso-soaked ladyfingers layered w/ sweet mascarpone and cocoa, BUT w/ the added toffee-crunch of pine nut brittle!  Oh... I could use a few bites of that pastry right now :)Service was a little lacking- I had noticed a woman busily jotting down the night's specials and had asked my server what else were being served (if anything struck my fancy, I'd have added more to my tab), but he would not and DID NOT go to any lengths to get the info.  Lo, and behold, as I was walking out the door, I looked at the board and, sure enough, there were at least three items that I would've gladly ordered for take-out had my server relayed the info.  Hey, it was his and The Parlor's loss in tips and sales!I wanted to sit at the bar area this time, to get a different perspective of the place, but I didn't care for the austere metal chairs that contrasted w/ the rest of the wooden furniture.  Found it jarring, especially since I felt that the rest of the venue to be cozy and inviting!Step into The Parlor said the hostess to the guy...and while I wouldn't say we stepped in (it was more of a skip)...we did find ourselves immediately pleased with the decor. Herb garden lining the sidewalk, bar windows wide open, fireplace straight ahead and an interior that may rattle my heavenly friend, St. Francis. Get it? Heavenly? Saint? Um...well...anyhoo...the few times I've been there was always that awkward post lunch-pre dinner time (around 2ish)...we were always greeted and seated immediately. That can be an easy time to be forgotten in a restaurant.I had dreams about the Pesto Pasta after my first visit. It was weird. Pesto Pasta and I were on a cruise where Chaz Bono was performing Send In The Clowns. She kept throwing chunks of Parmesan at us from the stage calling us Parlor Gays. Then a huge unicorn came from above and ate her. I don't know what that means. But that has to be one full unicorn. Spinach salad and calamari are big weiners here...wait, I mean, winners here. Winners. Love the tropical ice tea. Service was a solid B+. LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes. I try to eat my cheat foods in fist size portions. Ok. No fist jokes from the randy gays. Please. Welcome to the neighborhood said The Culinary Comedian to The Parlor.Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. First, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. Most importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. So, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. So, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). The waiter responded -- "well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic." He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: "would you like something different?" OK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. Really, "do we want something different?" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. And come on..."it's organic"...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. I understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. Sure, eventually there was a rather late "sorry" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. On the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. The pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.I could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. ...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have.My goal on Saturday night was to stay home and just relax.  I should have listened to that goal.I have been to the Parlor many times in the past year and always enjoy my food and service. I have to say that my one experience there that I had Saturday night will guarantee that I never step foot in this place ever again.  This isn't something about it being an off night...management proved that they just do not care about their guests.Around 6 o'clock through Twitter the specials came through for the night.  They had listed a Prime Sirloin with a pesto spread and potatoes and broccolini.  Since my friend Jill and I end up sharing almost the same brain, she texted me immediately that we should go there and try it out.  I was game.  I even called over to the Parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait.15 minutes later, at 7 o'clock, Jill and her boyfriend Tony show up and put their names on the waiting list.  About 10 minutes after I showed up we were seated. We sat down and immediately told the server that we wanted 3 specials.  Tony, the server (not be confused with BF Tony) regrettably told us that they were out of the special after I ordered an Iced Tea. Since Jill has Gluten and Dairy allergies, there wasn't anything else she could eat there.  We asked to speak with the manager before we would make up our minds to just leave.  Server Tony asked me if he should hold off on the tea and I told him yes.  (The iced tea is important to this event)The manager (who I believe her name was Monica...not 100% sure) came up and acted very defensively about running out of the special...even before we had the opportunity to explain our situation.  Jill said that I even called before to make sure about the special and there wasn't anything else she could eat.  Manager excused herself, came back, and stated that they could use a flank steak instead.  We asked what the price would be for that and she said the same price.  For a FLANK STEAK?  That isn't even close to the quality of a Prime Sirloin!  Manager Monica (?) said that she would comp us either drinks or dessert.  We decided to stay...silly people we were.Server Tony came back, with my iced tea...though I never told him that I wanted it again.  He asked if everything was taken care of.  We said yes and that the manager said that she would comp drinks...so we all ordered glasses of wine.  Tony leaves and then comes back to tell us that Manager Monica told him that she would comp us desserts and $2 off our entree.  Since Jill can't eat the dessert and that wasn't what was discussed, we asked for the manager again.Enter Eric.  I have to say that I never met a bigger jackass in my life.  He comes up to us and says "My name is Eric and the Parlor is considered my place.  As we make specials, you have to understand that it isn't an exact science.  Sometimes we run out of things."  Fine we get that.  I told him that the not having a special is now a moot point since his manager offered us something that she is now reneging on. He faces me and says "Have you ever worked in a high stressed environment before?  Sometimes we say things that we just think about then."  I told him that "Yes I have worked in a high volume stressed workplace before and as a manager I honor what comes out of my mouth."  I am sorry, but if you can't trust your manager with making decisions in a "high stressed" environment then you need to rethink your staff.  He then back pedaled and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we wanted.  We told him we weren't looking for a free meal, but ok.  Food came and he left.Well, of course, the flank steak (cooked medium rare) what not up to par and very tough. The broccolini had absolutely no flavor.  The potatoes were great though.  Of course this isn't the end of the story.  The bill came and I am not shitting you....the only thing on the bill was my iced tea.  After all of that, you couldn't comp my iced tea along with everything else? We should have left then, because a few minutes later the server came back and told us that he handed us the wrong bill.  The correct bill was drinks comped, 3 entrees for $12 and still my iced tea.  (Yes this is a big deal to me)  We couldn't believe it.  If a restaurant is not prepared for a special for Saturday night (a high volume day) then you shouldn't even offer a special.  As a friend said to me today, this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other specials just to get us in. Customer service comes a long way especially in our economy.  I will be willing to pay for good food and good service.  The Parlor proved that they have neither.Yeah, it took me this long to get to The Parlor.  I can walk to it.  All my friends have gone a gazillion times.  Whatever, I'm busy.There was a group of 8 with a crapload of kids in front of us, waiting for the rest of their party to arrive.  I let the hostess know that I'd sit anywhere...except nowhere near them.  Ha!  She put us on the patio.I love patio heaters.  They are necessary in the winters here and the patio was really cozy and warm.  Not overbearing, juuuuuuuust right.I had a pasta dish with seafood and a spicy red sauce.  I like that the meals come in two sizes, as leftovers don't work very well with shrimp.  It gets rubbery.  Blech.  It will rot in my fridge next to the broccoli.  The service was spot-on, as I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  Really nice guy.  Cute, too.The prices were great, even though I didn't have to pay.  I love valet service, too.  Didn't have to pay for that, either.I've tried to pace myself when it comes to bragging up The Parlor, but there have been some tremendous standouts over the last few months that deserve some attention and praise.Several weeks ago, on a date, I had one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten.  Wild caught Sturgeon on a bed of cippolini onions, purple fingerling potatoes, fava beans and a watercress puree with some greens on the top.  My date, who doesn't like fish, ended up eating half of the dish!  Truly great.The other standout was the Spring Farro Risotto.  I never thought that risotto could come across as light, but this dish does.  Farro rice, preserved citrus, asparagus and spring peas all come together beautifully.  I had to force myself to stop eating in order to ensure I had leftovers for later.It's pretty obvious that I'm a Parlor fanboy.  I don't feel bad about it though, they had to work pretty darn hard to make me this way.  Keep up the amazing work!The Parlor is as good as all the reviews say it is. I could end right there but I will divulge a bit more. First, I will talk about the atmosphere. It's absolutely adorable and you'd never guess just how adorable from busy Camelback Road. Hidden behind those cement walls lie an enclosed patio with a fresh herb garden and plenty of shaded seating. They also have tables in the doorway so if you are torn between eating inside or outside, there's always the option of halfway in between! Moving on to the food, the pizza literally melts in the mouth. I went to lunch here with fellow yelper Carolyn S who had been here many times before. She went for a pizza and said they were delicious, so I just had to do to the same and I am so happy I did! I got the Funghi pizza which has mushrooms and goat cheese, but I added mozzarella to it for that extra cheesy taste. The pizza crust is soft and crunchy in all the right places. The pizza was heavily topped with mushrooms and the cheeses and had the perfect amount of bite to it with a great taste. I could have finished every last piece but I got about half way there. The cool thing is that they have eight inch pizzas so everyone can order their own pizza which is nice since so many times, people like different pizza toppings. As I was leaving, I noticed a cool bar on the other side of the restaurant and think this would be a great option for some drinks on a night out. I can't wait to come back again!4/18/12Very, very good late lunch/early dinner meal for me, and it all started with a classic mojito.  Not the Garden mojito on the specialty cocktails menu that has cucumber in it (allergy).  Just a mojito made from a well rum, in this case Bacardi.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=9-cZ-SOtiX2ihwdrCs2FrQ  $6 during happy hour.  And it's a good one!  Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)I was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I'm just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I've been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today's dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You'd think after a few years' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I'm just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every "guitar" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn't hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn't charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.  The entire entree was off the hook!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=wYz23WxyjrTKUXsSUwnKSw  Now, this is where any practical and health-conscious person would say, "Ok, I've had enough.  I can't eat another bite."  But, I can't be practical.  Not when I'm half-way through my mojito!  So, I went ahead and ordered the zeppole ($6.50), and it took more than a few minutes to arrive, but I wasn't in a hurry.  When the six little Italian puffs of sugar-coated fresh-fried dough arrived, accompanied by two small pots of almond crema and Maker's Mark bourbon mascarpone, I knew I was in for a treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=0-sLOjmoMEBkWAcTZyHskQ  Even before I took a bite, I could detect the scent of cherries that were inside the fried moulds of dough, some of which you could see peeking through the sparkling sugar crystals.  And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it's pretty strong, and I didn't mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i'd enjoy the almond crema, I'd have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.  Now I know.4.25 stars.  Can't wait to go back!I toyed with this rating for a while. 4 or 5? Man 4.5 would be perfect! I settled on a 4 based on my first visit, but I can see myself upgrading on future visits. We all know the history of this building. An old beauty parlor. I love how the building was preserved. There are old photos all over the business and even have parlor chairs at the bar. Starting from the main door you pass a garden where the cooks grow their own herbs and produce. Very cool, I wish I was good enough to grow all my own herb, but i know they would just wilt up and die.lol.anyways you can see a real,nice cozy patio while you walk up to the door. You are greater by a host to great you if you want a table in the dining room, or you can go right into a small bar area.Service was good the entire. I really dug the decor.  Hard to explain,  but it was a little dark and just overal hip and romantic at the same time. What I'm trying to say I would feel just as comfortable with my buddies here as if I was on a romantic date with my wife. That is super cool. Now for the food. We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer called Fritto Misto. Wow, when that came out it was just awesome! I couldn't believe how juicy the shrimp were. The sauce was also great for dipping.  I would totally order this again!For the pizza we ordered the Proscuitto Cotto. It wasn't what I was expecting, even though the server told me. But there was no cheese on the pizza, just proscuitto and a smokey tomato sauce. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd like to try something with cheese on it next time.Also while we were dining the music track playing was surprising good! I saw a fellow Yelper that commented in how much the music rocks. He's right, every song was good!  I will be coming back to the Parlor again. This time to try a pizza that more fits me, and I would expect my rating to improve afterwards. Overall The Parlor is a great local Phoenix restaurant. I can't wait to take my out of town friends hereIf a gal can have a spectacular time while on an uncomfortable date, a place Rocks. So was my first introduction to The Parlor. (Hey, to be fair, I didn't realize a date was in the works. Turns out you can't say yes to just meeting up for drinks. Things are Assumed.)Anyhoo. My only criticism of The Parlor is how popular it is. I showed up earlier than my fella (not MY fella, the guy) and wasn't sure where to go. This place is *so* popular it's kind of hard to sort out where to stand. The bar was buzzing and the outside area was hopping. So as a single gal I kind of hovered until I could procure wine. If you're with a group of friends the fun vibe of this place provides energy. Fast forward to an unofficial Yelp event. Heck no! I wasn't going to miss Happy Hour! This time I knew the deal-O about finding the entrance. Tip: Don't drive like a race car driver. The entrance requires sharp precision turning. Miss it and you'll love (really) dealing with Camelback traffic. It's fabulous I tell ya'.HAPPY HOUR | A Blessed ThingM-Sat (3-6pm)$3 Drafts...aaaaand then I pretty much stopped listening.But no, wait! The 8" pizzas are only $7 (!)Ok, fine. More details. There are 16 beers on tap. Well drinks are five bucks.Additionally there are a handful of appetizers at $5.BARSeated like a Queen I met the most Awesome Bartenders. The worst part? I have no idea what their names are. Impeccably dressed they serviced a full bar and were happier than clams. Dressed to the nines. (If that means Hipster Plaid and a bowtie!) I *almost* ordered The Parlor. The amount of care put into producing this gin cocktail was impressive.PIZZAIf you're with a picky eater (ahem, a bad date) the staff is more than happy to modify a pizza on the menu for you. I speak highly of the Salsiccia, Spicy BBQ and the Prosciutto Cotto. The service here is on a grand scale. Front to back, hostess, bar, table service. I've enjoyed both of my visits. Can't wait to visit to scarf down some more pizza! (Oh! Please note that parties of 8 or more will be billed on one check.)The Parlor, a place I would have thought was a VFW more than a restaurant. Once you enter from the rear (that doesn't sound right) you find a contemporary spot with wood, glass, concrete and subtle light coming thru from Camelback Rd. I have been here a couple times and the food is always spot on! For some reason I always seem to write my review after a few visits. Maybe I like to grade on a curve! That always worked for me when I was a kid. Hahaha. The one thing I would change about this place is the seating at the pizza oven. One, I would lower the bar a little so you can see them make the pizzas and two, I would shut the door to the dishwashing room. Kinda nasty looking at food on the floor and dirty dishes. I see enough of that at my house! With that said, the barber like chairs are very cool. Great place for a date night or with friends! Cauliflower gratin? Seriously, that shit is good!If you're about to post lyrics in a Yelp review, ask yourself, "Is it worth it?  Let me work it.  I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it."  Oh Missy Elliot, how I love you.  I also love Meghan L. but she's leaving us...  At least The Parlor is here to stay.  Let me eat my emotions!It was a fabulous dinner tonight filled with a parade of pizza, alcohol, and dessert!  Majority of us [excluding me because I suck] arrived on time at 6:30PM and seating was prompt.  Food was ordered and suddenly the table was a blur of slices being exchanged and food was being consumed.  Noms I got to try:-The Funghi  which consists of roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  Thank you Yuko H. for exchanging a slice with me!  The goat cheese gave it a creaminess that melded well with the chunks of meaty mushrooms.  -The Market Pizza, which changes frequently so I don't know if this will be helpful but it had golden yellow beets, a beet puree sauce, walnut pesto, spiderella, feta cheese, and added bacon.  I'm not a fan of walnuts but I was seriously digging the walnut pesto.  I never had spiderella until tonight either and I gotta say that the earthiness of the greens was amazing against the sweetness of the beets.- The Summer Corn which is made of roasted summer corn, chiles, a corn puree, spicy crema, cilantro, and added goat cheese and bacon.  This one had the boldest flavor.  I had originally thought that this would be a sweeter pizza since it had corn but the spicy crema fights for dominance.  I like the added bacon which adds more saltiness to the otherwise spicy slice!- Tiramisu, we all know what's in it but they added something extra in theirs:  pine nut brittle.  This was probably the dish I'd skip.  The pine nut brittle was so overly sweet that I could do without it completely.  There was also this weird moisture at the bottom that wasn't espresso.The atmosphere was absolutely lovely and intimate and our waitress was amazing.  She took the time to go over the menu and seasonal items with us in great detail and never made us feel like a burden.  She packed our leftovers, the busboy took our photo, and the staff here is just really awesome.  Even the valet made for pleasant company!  You are what you eat and I am pizza.  I also need to live in Meghan's pocket because I'm already getting separation anxiety.  Help.So the last time I was here, I got my brows waxed. That was probably about 7 years ago.I always thought this place was cool,because, it was mid century modern.But, now it is a restaurant, and it is cooler than ever!I came here with 3 friends for lunch. It is a little hard to find if you have never been here before. So make sure to pay attention as it is on the North side of Camelback road. You pull in and park in the back. They have done such a great job bringing it back to life! The atmosphere is relaxed and 60's. Early 60's , I love it. The menu is amazing. They make all the Pasta from the start right there and it is fabulous! They even offer a Gluten Free pasta,which is amazing as well. I can tell you that was not around in the 60's. I got the seafood with linguine. It was great!! My friends got the steak salad and it too was divine. Next time we might get the pizza. Everyone says that is awesome as well. The place is decorated wonderfully. When it is cool enough outside you can sit on the Patio. They even grow their own herbs right there in their garden.I am always Happy when I see a cool Ladies Room. This is right up there. Even with a cool hair dryer chair. Look at my photos.Cool place, Wonderful Food. Worth a visit.First off, great service. Our server was very knowledgable in menu items and drinks. She made great suggestions. Her name is Rebecca and you should request her! Also, I'd suggest the St. James drink and the Pesto pasta. Delicious recommendations suggested by our server. Excellent service and and all around great experience. I'll definitely be returning. A must stop!
Harvest Buffet=One day we decided to make the drive out to Maricopa to check out the Harrah's casino.  When we arrived, we were hungry and decided to give their buffet a try.  We were really disappointed.The selection of food was not very good.  The best items was the Ice Cream and desserts....which were average at best.It was one of those meals where you got mad at yourself for wasting calories on bland food.  Oh well.One good thing is that the cashier at the buffet told us we'd get a discount for signing up for a players club card.  We did and got a good discount, unfortunately the food wasn't worthwhile.Return Factor - 5%
Santorino Pizza=I was lured in by the street side billboard offering a Large pepperoni pizza for $5.00-and as they say you get what you pay for.It was fast & they were real nice and the prices on everything on the menu are real reasonable but...When I first opened the box I thought they had given me a cheese pizza but quickly i realized they just put the chesse ON TOP.I have had many a pizza and this was a 1st...the pizza was cheap and nothing to write home about..actually it was another 1st in my house. 1st pizza to NOT get finished.I wouldn't bother with the pizza here again but I'd give their other stuff a try.
Pollo Campero=Let me start off by saying, THIS WAS THE BEST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I am appalled (In a good way). So my mother is always going on and on about "Pollo Campero" and makes it her mission to take me to lunch there today. I've seen this establishment a few times while driving on Thomas Rd but never put much thought into having a meal there.We arrive at "Pollo Campero" and right away the smell makes me savagley hungry. Their menu included many sides from ceaser salads to white rice mixed with black beans. While seeming like a very much Mexican themed restaurant, i was surprised they served "yucca frita" and "platanos fritos" (fried plantanes), which are traditionally found in Central and South American dishes as well as Carribean dishes. Every side dish was nothing like a fast food restaurant, the rice and vegtables tasted just like it was home made (amazing). I must emphasize this again, THE SIDE DISHES ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY. I ordered the "5 Dollar Meal" which includes two pieces of chicken (grilled or fried) and two sides,  and a dinner roll or tortillas. I felt bad about paying so little for such a large and freshly prepared meal. The ceaser salad was half of the plate and so crisp and fresh :)Another thing, I have never been treated so well at a fast food restaurant in my life! Again, I cannot emphasize this enough! The owner even came out and gave us coupons for our next visit after asking us if there was anything they can do for us. The cashier lady walked over to our table to give us crayons and a coloring book for my little nephew. When we left, the entire staff waved goodbye. Now tell me that doesn't sound like a cheesey Pleasantville skit, only it's true!The restaurant was decorated great, with different pictures of landscapes on the wall. The music was of excellent taste as well, mixing different latin music from different regions of Latin American. The restaurant was very clean and organized. I give this restaurant a full 5 stars and recommend everyone to try it out sometime, you will be amazed as well :) I guess this made me officially a "regular".(Quick recommendation: Opt for the grilled chicken, you will never taste chicken the same ever again.. goodness! :) )
Ports O' Call Buffet=Sweet little gem inside the Gold Coast! We came here for lunch and cracked up at the fact that this is definitely a hotel for the MUCH older elderly crowd, lol. We stopped at the buffet though and were really impressed with all of the choices we had for food. Chinese, American, Mongolian,  seafood, Italian, tons of fruits, veggies, desserts, and much, much more. The selection of food is fantastic for lunch, and DIRT CHEAP! Only 8.99 for all of that food. The inside is very large and tables are spaced out, and the place is clean. Definitely no complaints about room. The wait staff is awesome and kept our plates cleaned up and our drinks full faithfully. I'd definitely make it a point to stop here for some cheap eats and a full belly.Let me preface this review by stating that there are plenty of fine buffetsin Vegas that are located off the Strip.Unfortunately,this is not one of them.The food lacks any kindfinesse, flavor, and love.For example, you got yourchoice of overly well prime rib,super dry fish,or pasta that was never close to being al dente.And don't forget the blah selectionof wilted greens and stuff from the salad bar.Which I guess is kinda to be expectedconsidering how little I paid for dinner.So if you're ever feeling nostalgicfor mediocre cafeteria food,this would be your place.The full price is not worth the quality and selection of food that they serve. We only go if we have a buy one get one free coupon that you can easily get on the receipt print outs at the Smith's on Decatur/flamingo, otherwise it would not be a good decision. We like the swai fish they usually have as they prepare it in a couple of different ways depending on the day. My favorite is the sweet and sour swai, mmmmm yum. Their bread pudding kicks ass in flavor!They really need to revamp this buffet as the selection is limited and dull in flavor and execution. It could be so much better if they would make some changes with the food selection and preparation. The food I noticed was not even warm or hot, a lot of items were room temperature. The staff is friendly and is good at keeping the drink refills up at least. This is not a buffet that will keep me coming back, I am pretty much three and done, is not worth going for two likeable items in my opinion.
Xinh Xinh Cafe=I woke up incredibly, incredibly sick yesterday, with a thudding headache, achy limbs, hacking cough, and sniffling nose.After dragging myself through a long day of class, I knew--KNEW--I needed a decent bowl of soup.  When I was living in San Diego, the best cure for my tiredness and illness was always a big bowl of pho.  And I'd just heard that Xinh Xinh Cafe had opened next to the Schnucks.  Thank God.The space is a bit small, and has a whole "Chipotle-forced-industrial" look to it, softened with Vietnamese hats and other cultural items.  I made a beeline for a nice big bowl of pho and was delighted by the flavorful bowl in front of me.  However, it could have used a little more beef.That said, I enjoyed myself very much, and the menu is extensive, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  They've only been open three weeks, so you should give them a shot, especially if you're sick and need a big steaming bowl of pho to feel better.Edit: Keep in mind, they don't take credit/debit cards yet.  So, just run into schnucks and use the ATM or get cash back.
Nick's Diner=I wanted breakfast for lunch & they delivered beautifully :)The food is simple & understated, but still yummy. The atmosphere is casual & cool. I literally do mean cool, lol!  The shades are drawn & lighting is low, which is awesome when you're basically suffering from heat stroke just by walking from the your car to the restaurant door, which was only about 5 steps! Service is friendly, but during lunch they do get really busy so expect to wait your turn.They have breakfast specials from 7 am to noonish (ask them for the exact times) BUT they do serve breakfast all day :)
D'Vine Wine Cafe=The wine connoisseur will not be disappointed with this place.D'Vine is a smaller, intimate cafe on the second floor of the Ballantyne Village complex. It has a full list of wines for every palate. There were many I didn't even know the names of!They were perfect for a quieter venue on a Friday night. Get a table on the balcony and listen to the music on the square below. Strings of lights over your head complete the atmosphere an give you the warm fuzzies!Prices depend, of course, on the wine. Two full glasses ran me more than $20, but I was not disappointed with my choice!The service was very friendly! They had a strange ESP which gave them the ability to always know when my water needed refilling. They did not hesitate to check on you just the right amount as well!They also have live music on Fridays!Definitely give this place a try!
Carlito's Burritos=I finally got a real meal at Carlito's (after visiting for some margaritas, chips n salsa and legumbres many months ago -- all of these things were very good).  I confirmed which items were vegan with the owner via e-mail (most stuff - beans, veg, rice, sopapillas, chile sauces).  So basically you have a great variety of vegetarian choices and a good variety of vegan options here.  And the meat looks pretty good from what I've observed but not tried.Ok, so let's keep in mind that this is NEW Mexican food.  Not Mexican.  Not tex-mex.  It's not supposed to taste exactly like Mexican food.  And it doesn't! It definitely has it's own character.I got a burrito w/ beans, rice, calabacitas, and green chile sauce.  It was gigantic! Pretty tasty too.  But the real star of the day was the sopapilla.  OMFG, how has this not been a part of my life?! Light, pillowy pockets of dough that are toothsome yet melt in your mouth as you chew.  I'm in love!!  If nothing else, do yourself a huge favor and go try a sopapilla.  If you don't like it, call me and I will come finish it for you.Carlito's is the B-O-M-B. I am such a fan of this place and then some. I have been here time and time again and not once been disappointed in the food. The prices are beyond reasonable and the service is decent.I have inhaled several items on the menu and here is how the rank on the medal stand:1. Nachos- Insane! Number 1 in town! I want them in my belly right now!2. Enchiladas- Yes, you are pretty too, Miss Enchiladas. (Get it with green sauce)3. Tamales- excellent4. Tacos- Yes, pleaseThey serve beer and margaritas and my favorite Horchata-drink of the Gods!!! I cannot say enough wonderful things about Carlitos. Only negative is the space itself is tiny and because the food is out of this world you might have to wait a few minutes and get it to go. It's worth it. One bite and you will be addicted to it, too!Holy Guacamole Batman...  This place ROCKS!!!!  I was totally tempted by Jaime W's ROTD for this place and so I had to go ASAP.  I was Sooooo NOT disappointed!!  My stud muffin had some errands to run so as luck would have it we were on the other side of the universe from where we live which just so happened to be RIGHT BY CARLITO'S!!  Serendipitous! So we walk in and the place is small but PACKED!!  That's a good sign.  You could tell that these were ALL REGULARS too.  I saunter on up to the little counter staring at the menu overhead trying desperately to remember what I had decided I wanted to try.  I couldn't remember so I just told the guy that it was our first time and asked him what was the best thing they had.  He asked us if we like spicy and WE DO so he suggested the Chili Verde Burrito.... I got it Combo which is beans and rice and Eric (aka stud muffin, studster, baby maker, hubster, etc) got it Carlito's Way which is double meat.  My son ordered the chicken Nachos. (All three lunches with drinks plus tax & tip came out to under $30.) The service was fast and friendly!When the food arrived (which was quickly despite being very busy) we were first impressed by the shear SIZE of the portions... HUGE!  More than enough to fill up my teenage son who can easily eat a large pizza by himself!!  The nachos are piled HIGH with everything you can imagine and the chicken is SO GOOD!!!  TONS OF FLAVOR!!!  Our Burritos were so big and smothered in green sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug in and both immediately started making noises you would normally hear coming from a bedroom but it was sooo good we couldn't help it!!  Just the right amount of hot without losing any of the flavor.  OH. SO. GOOD!  I still have half of mine left and will be having it for dinner tonight!!I am a definite FAN of Carlito's!! There is not one thing negative I have to say about this place.  It is exactly what it should be.   So my taste buds and  tummy send many thanks Carlito's and to Jaime W for sending me there!!Another one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:Nachos (no meat, $6.50)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=pyMpCBcJmA49t_wZ_fsfaACheese Quesadilla ($3.95)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=E5aH0xwP8-Ja4poLxosfDwThe Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQYou have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.The Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.Overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.Return Factor - 79%I've had this place bookmarked for ages, but despite driving by on many occasions I never forced myself to try Carlito's, until today.My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on green chile and sopapillas. I guess I was a little nervous that I would be disappointed by Carlito's as I have been by New Mexican restaurants in the past. I'm happy to say that Carlito's exceeded my expectations.After seeing Jaime W's taco Tuesday treats on the newsfeed, I decided it was time to finally bite the bullet and give Carlito's a try. I ordered a Navajo taco with pork verde to go. On the ride back to my office, I couldn't resist trying some of the pork. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked and really spicy. The fry bread was a little soggy, but it was probably because I took it to go. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu. I'm looking forward to bringing my mom along with me next time to get her more expert opinion on the place.They also roast Hatch chile during the season, sell pinons by the pound and offer parking lot barbecue parties from time to time when you check out their web site and facebook page.I could write a one-line review of this place--$10 for two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans, sopapilla, and a Mexican coke equals a happy belly. But I'll elaborate a bit.Yes, it is a great deal. Yes, the flavors are delicious. But the real winner here is the green chili sauce. Is this Adderall? No, it's Carlito's green chili. This sauce makes you feel good all over, like you were donating money to charity or listening to George Michael (both of which I did on the day in question, so obviously it was a super good day). What I liked second best about the place was not its sopapilla (but really, eat that thing first when it comes out when it's hot and melty--it's not as good cold) or its Mexican coke (hands up if you h8 high fructose corn syrup) but how you can pick your sides. I'm not one for refried beans, but black beans make my heart sing out with joy, so getting to be all democratic and have a choice in my Mexican side dishes is casting a vote and knowing your candidate will win and be successful in office--I rocked that vote, my friends.All of this is to say, try this place out. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (as much as something can be in Vegas can be in this sea of suburbia, amirite?) but if you seek it out, you won't be disappointed.Starvin' like Marvin, we arrived for dinner on Thursday night around 7:30pm.  I'd heard how good this place was that served cuisine of New Mexico.  What does that mean?  Something to do with hatch chiles.  All I know is that it was some good eating.  I was so ready to eat that I have no pictures of the food.I had two chicken enchiladas, a red chile pork tamale, and a side of black beans; the beans were not necessary after all that food--I had two bites.  Boyfriend had a stuffed steak sopapilla, a tamale, and a side of rice.  Not much talking, lots of scarfing.  Everything was so delicious, fresh, and cheap for what we ordered.  This is one of those places that has so many good things on the menu that it's hard to decide, so take a gander before you go.  I want to return to try some other items, like the Navajo Taco and the dessert sopapilla, and next time I'll remember to save room.Pop QuizWhy did the gurlpren and I decide to eat at Carlito's Burritos?A)  We were starving and looking for something closeB)  Because Alicia R (aka Yes) said this place was good and we had to try themC)  We haven't had Mexican food in a whileD)  Most of our Yelp friends gave them solid reviewsE)  All of the above.If you answered E, you're the 2nd smartest Yelper I know.  Carlito's is located on the southeast side of town and I have to admit, I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food out here in the valley. Coming from San Diego, I never thought anyone out here would come close. Carlito's has changed my mind really quick.  But let me get one thing out of the way first.  When you drive up to this place, you see their sign that reads "Carlito's Burritos, New Mexican Restaurant".  That doesn't mean that this is a new establishment that serves Mexican food. It means that this is a restaurant that serves Mexican food from New Mexico.  Hah...I was one of those fools that misread their sign. Read the reviews, it's all about their burritos and tacos. But for me, it's all about their sopapillas, which is fry bread stuffed with chicken, shrimp, pork, or steak. Being the meat lover I am, I chose steak.  First impression...Man, this is a lot of food. I estimate around 8 oz of well prepared, well seasoned meat, stuffed into the fluffiest fry bread that I ever had. Top it off, it was literally topped off when red sauce. My meal was huge, but so good that my belly wouldn't allow me to quit until it was all gone.  Long story semi-long, try their sopapillas.  You won't be disappointed. Price is about average for most of their items. But the tacos and enchiladas are a steal of a price.  Big plus for service here. You get it with a smile, some convo, and of course, good food. PS: I also tried their chicken tamale and thought it was just okay. But that's just me.So, after a few more visits I have to say I really love this place. Prices are so reasonable, it's ridiculous. The portions are huge, I almost always have to share to get through a whole order.After seeing their post for Super Bowl bbq and catering, we couldn't resist ordering the nacho bar. We picked the fixings up the morning of the game and there was so much food for the very small price tag we had to pay. The ingredients were fresh and we were thrilled with everything. The game was a bore but luckily our nacho bar and good company made the party a complete success.I'm from San Francisco and visit Vegas a few times a year on work and every time I go I do WHATEVER IT TAKES to make it out to Carlitio's. They have hands down, the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life. It's the size of a super burrito at most places and full of the freshest and tastiest ingredients you could ask for. The employee's are all super upbeat and friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. My only complaint... all 5 times that I've been now, I've had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. I'd love to see these guys move to a location just a tad bit bigger, it would really go a long way.LOS ALAMOS COMES TO VEGASOrdered to share a Green Verde Carlito's burrito smothered for just an extra $1.00  Added a giant burrito sized sopapilla, tossed salad and pork posole for $3.00 more which is well worth the extra coin spent.  Only item we didn't find were the blue nachos. Otherwise, one burrito plus the sides more than fulfilled our hunger. Our burrito was filled meat only... no carbs... which was perfectly executed.  Seasoning was spiced perfectly. Understand that they also offer a sopapilla burrito which explains the burrito size.  Very casual and folksy place filled with all sorts of  New Mexico artworks for purchase. Seating is tight and comfortable. Three flat screens to watch college bowl games. For sure we'll be back for more.+1 Green chile everywhere, on everything!+1 Menu has Frito Pie and Indian Fry Bread+1 Sunday special is BOGO breakfast burritos+1 they serve beer and margaritas tooThis place deserves a second location, it's that good... and that busy! The food is stick-to-your-ribs good, so definitely come on a cheat day. There's cheese on everything, and gigantic portions, so you're not getting out of here under a thousand calories.Menu has a good amount of variety but my favorite is the stuffed sopapilla (pork verde please!) topped with the green chile. The Santa Fe Slider is a fairly unique offering, consisting of a slider-size burger patty folded into a tortilla and topped with green chile relish, spicy mayo, and cheese.
Tiki Shack=Went here for New Years Eve.  While the evening went well, towards the end the bartenders were more sloshed than then partiers [and observed taking multiple shots] and refused to serve us water unless we paid $1-$3 OR flashed our lady parts. (such a deal! video camera not optional) I could write more, but frankly there are hundreds of places to have a drink downtown and this place should be your last last last last last last choice.I was at the same party as Carolyn and Jen E - heyyy ladies!  And yes, it was terrible.  The owners/bartenders/managers (three in one!  tripe threat alert!) lacked any discretion, acted obnoxiously rude, and were total douches - and this was on top of NOT honoring our agreement on drinks, et al.At one point they kicked out my friend for calling o/b/m a d*ckhole, which is indeed insulting and slightly out of line, except for the fact that they were, in fact, being huge d*ckholes.  Upon kicking him out, they nearly refused to let him get his jacket in the -15 degree weather - and (get this) said he was welcome back "any time."  WHAT?!!!  Please, o/b/m's of the Tiki Bar - take your meds before coming to work, because you are seriously wacked out.There are so many wonderful places in Madison to have a drink - skip this one.  Unless you like showing your hoo-has for water at the end of the night.I hope it goes out of business with all its shady practices and ludicrous douchebaggery.
Toby Keiths I Love This Bar & Grill=I (used to) love this bar, but it's gone downhill in terms of service and clientele. We went out for a friend's birthday last night and I was surprised to find that a bar that prides itself on being a neighborhood-type, country bar now charges a cover. (For guys, at least.)I love the live band and last night was no different. They rocked. I was disappointed to find that the crowd was nearly half the size of what I remember though. The place used to fill up. Maybe it's the cover that's turning people away? Or maybe it's the bad service....At the end of the night, we had a difficult time flagging down one of the many bartenders to close our tab because they were preoccupied with cleaning up. When we finally got one's attention, she rolled her eyes, asked for our last name and then replied: 'You opened your tab wayyyy on the other side of the bar.' She rolled her eyes again and then reluctantly fetched it, because, you know, that's her job, and then slapped it down on the bar top before us without so much as a thank you.We noticed there was a charge for a Jack Daniels ($8.50 for one BTW. Forgot to mention that their prices have gone up.) we never purchased and when we brought this up to another bartender, we got the same amount of attitude and not a single apology. I've worked in the service industry and certainly understand how, at the end of the night, you're more than ready to clean up and get out of there, but that's no reason to treat your patrons so poorly, especially since the crowd appears to be thinning.I don't know that we'll be heading to Toby Keith's anytime soon. I'll take a good DJ over their fabulous live music if it means I'm tended to by a mixologist who makes me feel welcomed and appreciated. And maybe one who smiles. :)Oh no, I have apparently become a regular here!  So, I am from the middle of nowhere, where the definition of dressing up to go out entails putting on your cutest plaid shirt, jeans and boots.  I think this may be why I kinda like Toby's; it reminds me of back home.  The inside feels like a large barn with a bar in the middle, and a band playing live music on a stage.  The staff is nice to look at and generally pretty swift at getting anything you need.  The clientele has become variable.  I almost wonder if the band playing almost determines the turnout of the kind of patrons at Toby's.  Some white trash mixed with some true country folk and for some reason lately random hipsters and rockabilly guys and gals end up in here too???  In all honesty, I think I am still swooning from the first time I stepped into Toby's.  I met two of the finest cowboys I have ever met in my life, and they turned me out on the dance floor.  It is amazing how important first impressions are..Maybe I just keep going back in hopes of such a grand night out of beer, tequila and cowboys, but it usually ends up rather anticlimactic.Toby Keith's I don't Like This Bar. thankfully i'm a girl and it was free to get in or i'd be angry! the poor guys who have to pay. that's so dumb. it was basically impossible for anyone to get served here. everyone at the bar was getting irritated because no one could get drinks and when you'd place an order you'd have to wait forever again just to get the drink. same story when you're ready to close your tab. either their bartenders are horrible or they're insanely under-staffed. regardless we left because it was horrible.
Penn Ave Fish Company=This place has the freshest fish in the city.  There...I said it!It's a must for sushi lovers who claim they've had the best sushi in the city but really haven't because they haven't tasted Penn Ave's sushi! You're even able to pick up fresh fish to fry, cook or grill.  Although nothing beats visiting the location to eat it up!  I come here so much that, yes, they know me by name and know what I order.  Sometimes I'll tear myself away from the sushi to try one of their other fabulous fish creations.  The shrimp and crab pizza, spicy tuna melt and energy salmon lunch are all winners for my fishy taste.  The Strip District restaurant is pretty small so be prepared to hunt for a table at lunch time.  Be warned, I have been known to hover and pounce on a table if it looks as if they're getting ready to leave.  They offer up daily sushi specials which has actually made me branch out to try something different then my old faithfuls (spicy anything really).  There's also Taco Tuesday -  2 for $4.99, 3 for $6.99 or all you can eat for $8.99.And remember, if you're ever there it's highly likely I will be too!I've been on a quest to find really good sushi in Pittsburgh since I've been here about a year and a half and I have been pretty disappointed in the offerings in the city (after living in several coastal cities prior to this).  But now I have finally found what I was looking for in Penn Ave Fish Company!   For some reason I had the impression this was a more fancy pricey restaurant so it took me awhile to finally make it down here.  But it's more like a market style casual restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  You can also buy fish in their market to-go though their market selection is much smaller than Wholley's.  My friend and I shared a few sushi rolls and split the fish tacos. The fish tacos, which were a combo of swordfish, tuna and salmon, were amazing. The best I've every had.  And I've had some pretty damn good fish tacos when traveling in Southern Cali or Florida.  Then the sushi rolls were so fresh and amazing with generous portions of fish.  I saw a guy there working on butchering a very large tuna so I know their fish is some of the freshest you can get in Pittsburgh.  Also everything was so affordable and inexpensive!  I will definitely be going back here regularly.I've been trying to get to Penn Ave Fish Company for Taco Tuesday for months.  Since I had Christmas Eve off, I decided to try it out with a friend.  Unfortunately, on and near major holidays they aren't able to do taco Tuesday or have a full kitchen running.  They do still have sushi, though!  Plus, they do a FIERCE business with people picking up fish.  And after eating the sushi, I would eat and purchase anything here.I believe in starting with a California Roll at every establishment.  It's my baseline for comparing sushi.  I broke my own rule a little, and I went with a spicy California roll.  It was, hands down, the best one I've ever had.  The fish was SO fresh.  I mean, SO fresh.  The spicy was perfect, and I have been craving another ever since.  Plus, there are so many other awesome options (some traditional and some unique).  My friend loved his speciality roll and demolished the whole thing. I can't wait for my next Tuesday off to try taco Tuesday!I know everyone else has already said it, but this is hands down the best sushi in PIttsburgh.  It's some of the best sushi I have ever eaten.  Get here ASAP!As my loyaI readers know, I never like deducting stars from a prior rating--especially for a place that I previously rated 5 stars.  However, I feel the need to do so in this case for a major reason: false advertising.I came by this past Sat. for lunch to try the sushi, since I'd long been wanting to do so, and I've been on a sushi kick lately.  I'd heard this place had the best sushi in PGH, and the sushi I'd seen in the photos and on others' plates had looked promising.  Before going, I looked up the prices on the website, and the price for the sashimi lunch, the platter that most interested me, was listed as $9.50.  I didn't see it listed on the chalkboard menu anywhere, but figured the price listed on the website would be accurate.  Imagine my surprise when, after eating, I went to pay and was told that it was actually $14.99.  What had actually seemed like not a bad deal for the quality and quantity of sushi I received quickly turned into quite a pricey lunch.I would be remiss to mention that the sashimi itself was incredibly fresh and excellent in quality, so I was very pleased with it in that regard.  (My favorite component was the octopus--I loved the texture!)  I also found the quantity to be appropriate for a lunch portion--at least, for me (perhaps not so much if you're a large guy).  And, as an added plus, the presentation was pretty, and service was efficient.  So, I must agree that this is indeed the best sushi I've tried in PGH, and is 5 star quality in that regard.If the difference between the price on the website and the actual price had been a dollar or two, I probably would have let it slide, esp. in light of the quality.  However, a 50% difference in price is substantial, esp. to someone like me who doesn't exactly have money to burn.  I'm not sure if the difference was intentional, to lure people in, or unintentional, as in the sushi page hasn't been updated in years.  In any case, though, this is a major discrepancy that needs to be corrected.Aside from the price differential, a couple other minor things bear mentioning.  The first is that I find the order first and pay after system unintuitive and unnecessary, given that there's no real waitservice or even a bar.  The second is that the sushi menu isn't readily apparent to newcomers who approach the front counter to order.Although I'm leaning towards a 3 star rating, I'll be generous and average my previous 5 star rating with my 3 star experience this time and award a 4.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back again at some point to try a soup or classic fish sandwich, though it'll probably be awhile.  We'll see if they can redeem themselves in the meantime.
Terrace Room=We had Xmas dinner 2009 there, (I know, sometimes we get behind on our yelp reviews, but this experience was too good to just forget about).  The Terrace Room was one of the few restaurants open for the holiday and it was open in more ways than one.  Not only were they offering dinner to paying customers, elsewhere in the Omni William Penn Hotel, meals were being served to the homeless.  It was a little difficult for us to get reservations, because they were being taken by the restaurant manager only.  We left a couple messages, missed a couple call backs, but finally connected.  He was kind enough to email a menu so we knew what to expect.The Terrace Room is huge and located right off the lobby of the hotel.  The holiday decorations were beautiful.  We got a nice table with a window bench seat.  Our server was very warm and friendly.  BJ ordered the Frisee & Smoked Salmon Salad with dill vinaigrette for his starter.  I got a wild mushroom & brie tart with Sherry onion confit.  Both were very good.  Next came the soup, BJ got the roasted cauliflower and I got the pumpkin bisque.  Mine was SO amazing.  I expected it to be a little sweet, but it was not.  The favor was very pure.  For our main course, BJ had a grilled pork tenderloin with sweet potato gnocchi and sauteed brussel sprouts.  I had a filet of beef with leek & apricot bread pudding, hen of the woods ragout and sherry demi-glace.  The steak rather large and perfectly cooked.  I couldn't even eat half of it!  Plus, I wanted to be sure to save room for dessert.  They served a Christmas Triology, a ginger bread cupcake, chocolate yule log and panforte.  Everything was first rate.  I would love to have Xmas dinner here, again!
Jean Georges Steakhouse=For a high end name like Jean Georges, this restaurant is ridiculously amateur and low-class.  The substandard food and questionable dimly-lit dining room do nothing to improve the eating experience.  First, my girlfriend and I were poorly greeted by the two hostesses.  When we approached them, one immediately asked, "Do you have reservations cause we aren't taking walk-ins you know" in a Paris Hilton-wannabe tone.  I replied politely that I did with a smile.  She rolled her eyes.  The other hostess gave me a wimpy death stare that looked more like the face of indigestion than one of menace.  The first hostess asked us to follow her into the dining room after confirming the name.  She did not properly sit us down, e.g. failed to hand us our menus or pull out chairs, etc.  If she knew anything about proper dining etiquette, she would not have stacked the menus on the plates like some ogre playing Jenga (tm).  She abruptly walked away without saying a word.  Nevertheless, I was determined to salvage this experience.    Unfortunately as the evening marched on, I learned that it was not going to happen.  Our food was sub-par.  The foie gras was okay.  The bread was heavily buttered.  My plate was very greasy the moment I laid the bread piece down.  Unfortunately, this made the already rich course even denser.  The lobster caesar (a special request) was plain, but decent.  My girlfriend and I ordered the New York and filet mignon respectively as our main courses.  They were perfectly cooked, but UNBEARABLY SALTY to the point that they were inedible.  When I complained about the entree to the waiter (slightly over-weight, 30-ish, and bald), he said, "I am sorry you feel that way" and walked away.  I could have raised a storm and complained even further, but I decided it was not kosher to cause a scene. After drinks and dessert, my tab was ~$330 for 2 people.  Now ask yourself this... would you pay that much for a watered-down version of a Jean Georges restaurant with poor food and service?  If you crave for a Vongerichten restaurant, treat yourself to a flight to NY and eat there.==== UPDATE ====I received a message from a dummy account -- which might have been from an employee or someone related to the restaurant -- attempting to shoot down my review.  Here's what he/she wrote:"The consistency of this review is totally inacurate. JG had never had a lobster caesar, and hostes don't present dinner menus either, the server does." -- Ramon L.I responded..."Before you claim a review is inaccurate, note that your experiences and opinions may be different from mine.  In my case, the hostess planted our menus on our plate.  Our waiter was not even prepared to greet us until a couple of minutes later as he was fussing with two other staff members near the back cashier.  Even if the hostess was not trained to hand us our menus properly, this does not excuse her unprofessional demeanor during the entire greeting process.Also, the lobster caesar was a request -- it did the job, but it was not special or elevated.  I edited the review to make a note of the 'special request' to avoid further confusion.  Also, if you are questioning the validity of my review, I have photos on my cellphone ([two] of which are uploaded on Yelp!) and a credit card bill. ;)"A surprisingly simple restaurant for the chic and cool Aria resort.  The food is what you expect from any good west coast steakhouse.  Its not inventive.  There are no cutting edge cooking techniques used in preparation.  Its not even uniquely plated.  Its simply quality food expertly executed..The Steak tartare is very good.  The quail egg instead of chicken egg yolk adds a much creamier texture.  The rice cracker crusted tuna is also good.  It is served with a siracha and citrus sauce that really brings out the sweetness of the fish.  The soy glazed short ribs are delicious!  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Perfectly tender.  Wow!  The steaks are very high quality and perfectly cooked but like Prime or Charlie Palmer Steak, Jean George is more like an elegant restaurant that happens to serve very good beef and not a true steak lover's paradise. One big plus; the steaks are cooked on a wood burning grill.Do not pass up the sides.  They are meant to be shared.  The broiled bone marrow is incredible.  So rich in flavor and perfectly accentuated by the lemon gremolata.  It is a must have.  The black truffle and comte fritter is also a good choice.  It is almost light and airy in texture.Service is excellent.  Prices are relatively low for a top Vegas steakhouses.The wine list is very good.  All top producers (traditional and cutting edge) are represented.  There is good vintage depth.  Still, I wish wines from lesser regions were better represented.  Simply grilled steak make the perfect platform to experiment with wines from Argentina, Chile, or South Africa.Highly recommended.I love food. All kinds of food, from the hole in the wall burger joint, taqueria, or dumpling house to the high end Patina group restaurants. I eat out a great deal (I'm well into my quest to eat at every restaurant in Pasadena) but I actually don't write many reviews.After my experience at Jean George Steakhouse this past weekend I knew I had to write something, so congratulations to them for getting my first negative review.The service was on the low end of acceptable, but that is something I can live with if the food is good. Sadly, it wasn't. Except for the tomato soup: that was fantastic.The bacon wrapped shrimp was too salty and greasy. The mashed potatoes were salty and very runny. The medium rare fillet showed up with a heavy char. These are very standard and simple to prepare dishes that I've had many other places and this is one of the reasons that I ordered them: they are a litmus test. If you use quality ingredients and prepare the dishes with care there's no excuse to not do them well. I mean seriously, who messes up mashed potatoes? Especially ones that cost $12.00.I asked the waiter to bring the manager over and I described and showed him the food. I prefaced my discussion by saying that I wasn't doing this to get a discount, I wanted to let him know of some things that were going on in the kitchen and that I expected much better.  I didn't insist on new food as that really isn't my way. He thanked me and went off. He didn't return and the bill was for the entire meal. This is clearly one of the options open to him. As was offering to make me a new steak or taking the runny salty potatoes off the bill. Instead he chose the option that really prompted this review.As I left the manager asked me to come again. Now why would I want to do that? This also showed a distinct lack of awareness or seriousness. I am telling my Vegas friends and traveling companions that we can do much better than Jean Georges Steakhouse.This is another great restaurant in Aria.  I have been wanting to try this for two years and I finally went tonight.  I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gelée with some crème fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gelée filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gelée,Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.Jean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!The girlfriend and I chose Jean Georges Steakhouse for dinner for our first day in Vegas.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 7:45 reservations.  The hostess informed us that our table would be available at our reservation time, but we could wait in the bar.  So we did, but decided against ordering any pre-dinner drinks.  Less than five minutes after our reservation time rolled around, the hostess tracked us down and led us to our table.  After a quick review of the menu, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairing. Our first course, Almas Ara Caviar over a Meyer Lemon Gelee with crème fraiche, and dill and served in a hollowed out lemon half, arrived at the table. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ It was beautifully presented.  More importantly, the contrasting tastes and aromatics of this successfully executed dish really kicked the meal off on an impressive note.  Unfortunately, our paired wine didn't arrive with the food, instead being delivered by our server halfway through our first course with basically no introduction beyond the appellation and varietal.  Our second course, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well executed and nicely presented as well, but the dish wasn't all that original in concept and didn't provide the "wow" of the first course.  Sadly, like our first course, our paired wine again didn't arrive with the food and again it arrived without much of an explanation mid-course by a different server than the first.  The third course, a roasted Chilean Sea Bass topped with grilled Maitake mushrooms and a miso-yuzu glaze, sounded outstanding in its description, but was the night's biggest miss. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#GetRHNqeg8V60PcU-iEc0w The fish was cooked perfectly, but its topping was excruciatingly salty to the point of being inedible.  It was so salty that even after scraping it off of the fish, it was still salty to point that it overwhelmed the delicately flavored sea bass.   At least by this course, the wine arrived with the food (delivered by the second server), as was the case with subsequent courses.  Our fourth course, the grilled Wagyu Filet Mignon with grainy mustard and warm potato salad in textures, was a great rebound as our steaks were dead-on perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#Uy27bZHUGqAet7HnHcT-pw  It was paired with the best wine of the night, a Cote du Rhone.  This course was the best marriage of food and wine of the night!  Our dessert course was the JG Candy Bar, which I can only describe as six deconstructed candy bars kluged together like a sweet, rich Frankenstein's monster. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#SmNL9RpX6i_VDuiZDsb_SA  It was paired with a Madera.While the food was, for the most part, well executed, and the wine was generally enjoyable, the service side of the house seemed awkward and lacking the depth of knowledge one would expect from a fine dining establishment like this one.  The gf and I aren't really wine snobs, but we do enjoy wine with our food.  If we enjoy a particular wine that we're served in a restaurant, we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home.  Therefore, it was a huge foul that the service staff wasn't more familiar with the wine that was being paired with the food since we really enjoyed the Cote du Rhone served with the filet.  In the end, I felt the Tasting Menu especially with the wine pairings was a poor value.  While we certainly never felt rushed, I got the distinct impression that Jean Georges Steakhouse was more concerned with getting diners in and out rather than providing a truly memorable dining experience.  What a shame.Is Jean George the best restaurant in the Aria? No way! Is it solid compared to some of its neighbors? Oh yes!I came in for my birthday with some friends from out of town. We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality. To start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.Now this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it. I might not have been blown away by everything, but it was a solid dinner.It remains an excellent choice for steak in Vegas but where's the Japanese beef?Straightforward starters.  A good tuna tartae.  Chunkier than most, lightly layered / mixed with avocado with soy ginger dressing. A crisp rice cracker a good textural foil.   The tempura calamari, light and crisp with very little residual oil.  Pairs well with it's sweet chili sauce.To the steaks, USDA Prime, extremely well trimmed, beautifully seared on a hardwood burring grill, even coking to exact temperature.  The Australian wagyu filet mignon, buttery with a cloying fatty finish.  Around A3 quality.  Tender but lacks any wow factor.  The star of the menu is the Angus 300 (it is not aged for 300 days but the name of the steak.).   According to the restaurant, the steak is raised in elevations in excess of 3000 feet and fed slowly for 300 days, finished for the last 100 without any hormones or antibiotics.  The steak is wet aged 14 days and finished with a 28 day dry age.  Very good, pronounced dry age flavor, nutty and buttery with a good umame punch.Standard USDA Prime cuts are right on par.  Excellent, porterhouse and rib eye.  Both tender with good beef flavor. For sides, props to the bone marrow with lemon remolata.  Rich and unctuous.  Toss the toast, scoop the marrow on the steak, add the granita and enjoy!  A beautiful pairing that brightens the steak and makes it even more wine friendly.  The black truffle and cheese decedent.  Aromatic, covered with shaved black truffles.  Works very well with the Angus 300 further accentuating its umame goodness.Finally, for non beef eaters, the roasted Chilean Sea Bass with a miso yuzu glaze and a side of roasted maitake mushrooms good eats.  Think miso butter fish with a side of great mushrooms, umame on umame.  Keep in mind, portions are smaller when compared to other top steakhouses.Service remains steakhouse proper and friendly.  The wine list remains excellent.  High Vegas resort pricing.*****scratches head***** No Japanese beef?I'll start with a brief description of the food, but then retell the story of the worst service I think I have ever received and how they tried to scam us out of $200.The appetizers and sides were pretty good, we got a variety of what they had on offer. Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best.I was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.The reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price. We told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely false and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then! We all left feeling frustrated and insulted.I liked it then and I like it now. It was truly one of the best steakhouse experiences I have ever encountered...several times.I was lucky enough getting top notch dinners for free here at Jean Georges Steakhouse two nights in a row. I definitely can't complain about anything as the foods were simply superb and on top of it, it didn't cost me anything. Thank you my awesome business partners! The first dinner, we had tons of food. We started with Nueske's bacon wrapped shrimps, calamari, and heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad. You may recall I hate overzealous servers who always boast everything they serve to be the best. This guy did exactly that. He told us it would be the best and lightest calamari we ever tasted. He also said the buffalo mozzarella was bar none and just the most incredible mozzarella ever. Surprisingly, he didn't lie. Holy shit, those calamari and mozzarella were amazing! AMAZING! I didn't mind him so much after I knew he was just telling the truth. My filet was perfect, accompanied by half a lobster tail, creamed spinach, mushroom, truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was anything you could expect from Jean Georges Vongerichten. The next day...though I was less enthused eating at the same exact place, I quickly forgot about it when I sat down and started drinking the house mule cocktail. Whoa! It was so strong and just pure alcohol but it was really good after several days of ass kicking meetings. Now, I looked forward to the calamari and the bacon wrapped shrimps again. They also ordered the ahi tuna tartare that hit the spot for me. I started to get sick of red meat at this point and decided to share a bone in rib eye with our host. We had most of the same sides as last night plus truffle fries. Mind you.. This truffle fries weren't like any truffle fries you ever had with a douse of icky truffle oil. This one had shavings of real black truffle on top. The mushroom was also a favorite of mine. It was mixture of various kinds of mushroom sautéed with jalapeño so it had a little kick to it. I ate the peppers and it burned as it went down my throat. Yum!!The rib eye and the filet were both premium for steak. They also offered a $270 6 oz of Kobe filet. Hahaha...insane!! Both dinners were ultra pricy and I was just grateful that I could enjoy these gorgeous delicious food without breaking my bank. It was also great to spend quality times with people I work with every day. Our server on the second night, Boris, was awesome. He was probably the best server ever and was on top of everything. He catered to our host so much and to all of us in the most courteous manner and at the end, after our host signed the whopping check and handed it to Boris, he shook our host's hand. It was so classy.I will probably eat here again next year when in Vegas and I can't wait!!Considered by some to be the hipper, younger brother to Jean Georges Vongerichten's stunning PRIME at Bellagio it may perhaps be a simple case of a saturated marketplace that has seen the New York Restauranteur's eponymous Steakhouse at Aria overlooked for rankings amongst the city's best, but recently reintroducing Chef Sean Griffin's talents to some of the best protein and produce available a nine-course tour of sixteen menu items on Friday showed the sort of creativity rarely associated with restaurants pigeonholed for grilled meats.Certainly more modern than the soft stylings seen from a fountainside table at Bellagio, the dark interior and wall-sourced lighting adding intimacy to booths while tables near the expansive wine rack are better lit from spotlights up above, music trends a bit 'bumping' at times but is never intrusive in the experience, just enough to drown the din of a 400+ person room.Acknowledging that my menu was part self-selected and otherwise carte-blanche at a discounted tasting-menu price bolstered by a few luxury ingredients and service beyond reproach, it was after greetings from Chefs, Managers, and Sommelier that the meal got started, a $16 Lemon Drop dressing up Soju in citrus beneath a salted rim with herbals greeting both the palate and nose.Almost empty for the first hour of my meal, but filling to 2/3 capacity by the time 7:30pm rolled around, it was as demi-portions of most of the plates that the menu progressed and with an excellent bread basket featuring warm pretzels and lightly spiced crisps clearly warranting overindulgence the menu evening thankfully started off lightly, two thin slices of wagyu draped delicately over cream-centered fritters with shredded truffles adding a bold and aromatic edge.Favoring the produce of Kerry Clasby for almost every plate in the place Chef Griffin presented course two as "a farmers basket from the Intuitive Forager," the smoothness of the cheese playing beautifully off peerless figs, grapes, apples, and pears with nuance and crunch added by a crisp made of rice flour and ground sesame seeds.Essentially incapable of failing with a perfectly seared slice of foie gras floated on brioche in a bubbling broth of top grade sake with notes described by the restaurant's Somm, it was onward to a surprisingly even better bird that the evening moved forth, the grilled tempura-fried chicken offering the utmost amount of crunch encircling juicy flesh as hot sauce dissolved in butter found its foil in tender spinach beneath.Next offering two protiens I'd suggested as 'dull' when asked why my self-seleccted menu contained no fish, suffice it to say that although the salmon was well cooked it was completely secondary to the quality of accoutrements including shaved truffles and lightly sweetened parsnips in two forms while the sashimi-grade scallop may as well have been raw at its interior beneath a caramelized sear while light heat accented the aromatic broth.Acknowledging jokes about ordering short ribs at a steakhouse, but worth tossing that rule out the window for the soy-soaked masterpiece that embodies Vongerichten's East-West fusion style, it was in three carefully sourced steaks along with sides that savories concluded, each medium-rare strip tender and remarkably different, the nutty dry-aged funk of the Australian hybrid my personal favorite while both the sweet potato and truffle topped pasta were both sides one may wish to hoard rather than share.Impressed by elaborate desserts at PRIME, but seeing the menu trend more upscale-comfortable on the Aria's second floor, one would be hard-pressed to name s better apple pie in the city than the cast-iron masterpiece with a sugar crusted lattice and although the almond cake itself was a bit more dry than one might have wanted despite the sorbet, figs, and balsamic a far better composition was found in the tasting-menu-only sundae, a case of the classic flavors of peanut butter and jelly reinvented with no layer upon layer of texture and intrigue. Undoubtedly underregarded in a city where steakhouses sometimes seem far too common, Jean Georges Steakhouse not only steps outside the tried-and-true formula of success but does so with some of the best ingredients in the city, a fact easily overlooked by the expense account or convention crowd but one that shows the work of a kitchen willing to take the extra steps to provide those paying attention a truly excellent experience.
Eagles Buffet=We came here Sunday for lunch.   Wow, what a great time we had.  Lots of parking in the lot and nice and cool inside,as it was a scorching hot day out there.   There was no line even though it was about 1:00pm. We were seated at the perfect booth for two.They brought water right away, then our drinks while we getting our food.You just do not know where to start. The selection is just like Vegas Baby.  Only $35.00 plus tax for 2. Which is called Sunday Champagne. We did not drink any alcohol, but you can get it if you like.  The food is fantastic.  Seafood, meat, chicken, Salmon was excellant!    It had a steady flow of people but, no line ever.  With Prime Rib and Ham, even an Omlette bar. Lobster Omlette.....Real mashed potaoes as well.Rest rooms were shiny and clean.  We will be back very soon.We have come here a few times in the past year, and we really liked it a lot!So we decided to come here for our END of the WORLD Dinner.Of course the world did not end because, I am writing this review, but the dinner was still great!The staff laughed when we told them why we were there. They said people had been saying that all day long when they were coming in for lunch and dinner.We had all you can eat Crab Legs with Clarified Butter. They were divine.I wish we could of found all you can eat lobster, but you can't have everything. We were lucky to find this place.Not only did I have crab, but also prime rib, trout and spicy catfish(totally fabulous). Their mashed Potatoes are real and the gravy is so worth it.I feel like I am in Vegas when I go to this place, I love it.Plus, they have fabulous desserts of all types.I love the fruit tarts, Mario loved the Banana pie. This place is so diffidently worth your time and attention. give it a try. Since we are all still here and loving life.
Noodle Exchange=Whenever I'm at Gold Coast, my choice is either Ping Pang Pong or Noodle Exchange. Usually during the colder season, I tend to opt for Noodle Exchange for their hot pots. SERVICETypical service you get at any other Chinese restaurant. Not too friendly, but they are quick to take your order, refill drinks, get you the check or anything else you need. FOODMy usual is their Beef Combination ($14.99). You get a choice of mild or spicy but I can't handle any heat so I always get mild. You get a medium sized pot with a tea bag (?) which contains all kinds of spices in it. I actually ripped it open one time to investigate what was inside, as if I was in a biology lab doing a dissection. This tiny bag had herbs, slices of ginger and other unknown spices that I had no clue of. Needs further investigation. Beef Combination comes with mushrooms, tofu, fish cakes, corn tomato, daikon, taro, noodle and fish balls. Beef is thinly sliced and is very similar to shabu shabu. You also get a choice of lamb or seafood combination hot pot but I have only ordered beef.  It's a decent portion and I always enjoy cooking at the table.CONCLUSIONCome here for the hot pot! Place is always packed and super loud but I am coming back again on another cold day.
Gallagher's=Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!I wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!A sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.We finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.The server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.Overall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer.
barMASA=Probably 2.5 Stars.I usually do not factor in price to my reviews.  I try to concentrate on the experience itself and give a rating based on that alone.  I do that because I always am aware of the cost of my dining experiences and am willing to pay for what I get.  However, in the case of Bar Masa, I had such a case of sticker shock that I had to factor it in.  I stopped in late one night after a poker tournament and ordered some Sushi. Salmon, Eel and Hamachi.When my order arrived it was one small piece of each for $8.00 each.  They were all very good, but I was still hungry so I ordered the special Mushroom Roll. It was one of the best Rolls I have ever had.  Thin, seared beef outside and a mix of exotic Mushrooms inside.My food was good, but at almost $80 for three pieces of Sushi, one roll and one small carafe of Sake, it should have been amazing! Another thing that bothered me is that even though this is a Sushi Restaurant, there is no Sushi Bar.  As a frequent solo diner I  like being able to sit at the bar and interact with other customers and the Chef.Service was prompt and professional but rather stiff and stuffy.  They are a brand new restaurant, so they are obviously wheelchair accessible. Since Bar Charlie is closed, I was hoping Bar Masa could match it in terms of quality and value.  Unfortunately, my experience did not reach that level.If your perception of Japanese food in Vegas is $24.99 AYCE sushi, tempura, and mayo baked mussels, stop reading.Let's get this out of the way.  Quality Japanese food is expensive.  A contemporary Japanese meal in Tokyo, at a Michelin one star can easily run $300+ without alcohol.  Freshness is a pillar of Japanese cuisine and sourcing the freshest products globally cost.Bar Masa uses the freshest ingredients including fish that has been out of the water less than 24 hours before being served. Small portions, beautifully presented.  Ignore the prices and order what sounds good.  From the Spring 2013 menu, the toro tartare with osetra caviar is a must try.  The firm, meaty fish explodes with flavor when it mixes with the salty, briny, yolky flavor of the popping caviar.  Not to be out shown, the chilled sayori (needle fish) with shiso flower is Spring itself.  The firm flesh of the fish lightly enveloped with a fish stock aspic, the hint of citrus and the flowery, herbaceous finish of the shiso.  The hibachi grilled, fresh unagi with kabayaki sauce is excellent.  Very high quality unagi, very fatty with no muddy flavor.  The Nantucket Bay scallops, firm and sweet.  Both benefit from the sweet, bitter smoke.For fried items, the in season soft shell crab done tempura style is excellent.  Everything you expect from a soft shell; creamy, oceanic goodness inside surrounded by a not oily, crispy coating.Finally, save room for the uni and trumpet mushroom risotto with shaved bianchetto truffles.  One of the most unique, creamy flavored ingredients of the sea pairing with the umame charged mushrooms of land.  A simple preparation but what a flavor punch.Yes, there is sushi.  Never tried it.  That's for sushi bars.Outstanding sake list.  Probably the best in Vegas.  Resort pricing.It's not for everyone but those wanting to experience quality, contemporary Japanese cuisine without flying 5000 miles, this is your chance.I didn't think I would have to read the reviews on yelp for this restaurant because its located in Aria. If a restaurant is in Aria you would think it's suppose to be an amazing place to dine at.From the outside it looks so fancy and nice. We walked in and got seated. To us, this place doesn't look very elegant or fancy. To quote my boyfriend.."This place looks like a warehouse with some tables and chairs." Lol. It really does but with some lighting hanging down.We really don't care about how expensive it is as long as it taste good. We ordered the Sashimi Tasting Plate, the Kobe beef and Uni. Surprise, surprise, the waiter came back and told us that they ran out of Uni. How do you run out of Uni at a sushi place with barely any customers?Our food came out and the Sashimi plate was a big disappointment. How can you say this taste fresh or even good? You don't have to be sushi expert to know this was so mediocre. The Kobe beef came out next and it doesn't look very appetizing. It tasted okay but it didn't "wow" us. My boyfriend says the only thing he liked was the steamed rice. Yes, you absolutely read that. At least with steamed rice there's no high expectations on what it's suppose to taste like. It taste like rice and you can't complain on how horrible it taste. With those 2 items and my cocktail drink, the total pirce came out to be almost $200 with tips.We are still hungry. So guess where I am? I'm writing this review at another restaurant while I am eating. This is my 2nd dinner. So sad.DO NOT COME HERE unless you want to throw your money to eat crappy sushi.- One slice of maitake mushroom and two shavings of white winter truffle on a ball of rice the size of your thumb - $8- The same ball of rice with a thumb size, quarter inch thin, translucent slice of king crab - $9- One small handful of simply grilled maitake mushroom that wouldn't be half a side in a steakhouse - $28.- Eight slices of a "California" roll totaling 6" if reassembled - $32- One heaping tablespoon of finely cubed toro with half an ounce of caviar $68If you balked at the portions or prices, barMasa is not for you.Before you judge, no, I do not believe the prerequisite for a great dining experience be an incredibly expensive menu or use of exclusive ingredients.  My most memorable Vegas dining experience came from a burger at In-n-Out.  That said, for those who are willing to try, barMasa delivers the best, most authentic Japanese cuisine in Vegas.The manager himself pefaces your meal by stating "this is a kaiseki like meal".  Kaiseki literally refers to monks holding a stone against their stomach to ward off hunger pains.  This is a meal of appreciation, NOT volume.The maitake truffle nigiri, the perfect bite balancing the earthy flavor of the maitake and supercharging the umame overtones.  The incredibly high quality, gently compacted rice providing a hint of sweetness, its seasoning providing the kiss of acidity.  The flavor of the mushroom goes on and on.The same is said for the king crab nigiri.  The very small piece of crab is the right size to balance all the flavors yet finishing with the incredible sweetness and oceanic goodness that is king crab.  Simply put, more crab would lessen overpower the dish and lessen the appreciation.The grilled maitake mushrooms finished with a pinch of salt, flawless.  Meaty texture and an incredible explosion of flavor with each bite.  A sip of sake whose flavor profile provides the same earthy, mushroom flavor, and the dish is perfect.The signature Masa toro tartare caviar so perfectly balanced.  Every day toro (not o toro) is topped with caviar.  The yolky, briny, salty flavor of the caviar brings out the gentle sweetness of the toro and heightens the fresh fish flavor.  The chef's decision not to use the highest quality toro is brilliant as higher fat would have marred the clean mouth finish.The list goes on and on, from an exquisite mixed tempura plate to a fried rice of duck and foie.   Each dish highlights a single, primary ingredient so brilliantly with portion sizes appropriate not to ruin the experience.  True Japanese sensibility.The largest selection of sake in Vegas backs the menu.  The sommelier is very knowledgeable with the offerings.  Typical Vegas resort markup.   Decent wine list but do try the sake.Service is very friendly and professional.Simply put, the best Japanese cuisine in Vegas.
Blue Martini Phoenix=So, I've been here twice.  It's definitely an older crowd, well older than me anyway and I'm in my mid-twenties.  That's not a bad thing, just an observation.  I met a woman who told me that if she was my age again she would not be hanging out at Blue Martini.  Another guy asked me if I was twelve, so you can see why I bring up the whole age thing.  On a side note- I was barely buzzed, so I don't think I was acting twelve.  Another thing I observed, three woman (not girls) dancing on a counter and posing "seductively" for photos.  They took at least fifteen shots of just their butts.  They were some classy bitches. What else, three people confused my male friend for a female.  Yeah, he really needs to cut his hair, he is just too darn pretty!  Seriously, his hair could star in a Vidal Sassoon commercial.  He even scored a ladies VIP card.  Good times.The night was capped by witnessing the saddest drunk I have ever seen.  I thought that maybe I had accidentally teleported to Vegas or Rocky Point, but no, I was still in a parking lot in AZ.  He had his pants around his ankles, a bloody knee and dirt all over his face.  I guess he fell down a few times?  He couldn't get his pants up to save his life, seriously, I actually tried to help him I felt so bad.  He kept mumbling something about medical school.  Ah, the children of tomorrow.  Anyway, someone finally claimed him.  What else?  The waitresses all wear bustiers.  I once went on a Thursday night and they had a live band.  The Blue Martini had a glow stick in it.  The bathrooms are pretty nice.  People will step on you on the dance floor.  I think one guy seriously shoved me out of the way so he could spin his girl.  He was a prick, but I Iet it slide... he was shorter than me.My douche-bag detector was off the chart from the moment we got inside... lots of fake people and Asian hookers. It is one of the few places this far north that offers live music and dancing tho (if you're into that). I think I would have enjoyed this more during the week when it isn't as packed and they don't charge guys a cover - I hear they let people sing with the band on Mondays - Live Karaoke anyone?This place is terrible, I have been here twice and I do not plan to come here ever again. The valet crap is a joke, everyone wants to flaunt their "so called" money and cars pffff! The guys at this place are douche bags, I think women have more luck meeting a "real guy" at a gay bar. lolThe bartenders are overbearing and slutty, the 2 times that I have been here, I have seen numerous bartenders slip phone numbers to married men right underneath their wife's noses! I mean come on!I have to say this place really sucks, tons of fake, fake, fake people. This place is nothing but a competition to the most elite, superficial,  people of the world  The ultimate epitome bar of Scottsdale hands down.I give it 2 thumbs downI've been here many times, but only on Wednesday nights.  Why?  Because my coworkers love to come here for Ladies Night.  It's a fun night to people watch.Tucked away in the City North development, the location is less than ideal to drive a lot of traffic.  So, it takes a lot of work to get people out here on a regular.  On Wed nights, they do a great job of doing that.The place gets packed and you have to get there early or make reservations to snag one of the comfortable, padded chairs/table setups on the 2nd level with a great view of the band/dance floor.The party atmosphere on Wednesdays is pretty cool, especially for Phoenix which is typically dead all of the time.  A mid-week party like this is rare.We've dined here a few times.  The Margherita Flatbread and Burger are both pretty good.  The food isn't why we come here though, so it's always an afterthought for us.The staff here is really attractive and can keep up with the pace of a nightclub atmosphere, so the service levels have always been high for us.Overall, a fun night out.  We'll definitely be back.Return Factor - 100%I've been here several times and it gets less and less fun every time.  Primarily due to the deteriorating clientele and over priced drinks.  $27 for 2 margarita plus the cover charge?  Mmmm...the drinks aren't THAT good!Plus, it's actually a swingers' bar and because of that there's always about 4 sleazy men for every woman.  The outdoor patio is full of smoke so forget about enjoying any fresh air.The music is pretty decent...soooo 2 stars.Dear blue martini:You're a bar, not a dance club, not a music venue, not anything special! So why the hell do you charge a cover and inflate your drinks to levels where I feel like I could have purchased an entire bottle for the cost of one rum and coke???Mayyyyybe if your wait staff was on the caliber of old town and mayyyybe if the average age of the girls I'm about to meet wasn't 40+ I'd raise this rating to a 2, but common, really?The live band is a nice touch if you're into 1970's style lounge lizard vegas performers.  This review will without a doubt fall on deaf ears but oh well, the people have a right to know.  Thanks yelp for being the only place north scottsdale checks on where to go out.  As for you, the owner, you pretentious Gordon gekko'ish sommmamabish, I hope you're laughing it up knowing I paid $88 for 4 drinks.  Here are the words out of your mouth: "gotcha"Blue Martini is firmly known at all locations as a trendy upscale lounge with a locals only mentality and the City North location on High Street in Scottsdale is no exception.Blue Martini has several distinct areas including, a center stage for live entertainment, a VIP lounge and a super cozy patio.It's a great after work place to chill and great place to hang out with friends.I met some friends for drinks and dinner and was very pleased. Blue Martini has 42 Signature MartinisI tried:Peach Raspberry MargaritaGrapefruit Smash (Ciroc Peach Vodka, St. Germain, Agave, Lemon)Appetizers:Shrimp MartiniShrimp & Crab DipFruit/Cheese Plate Flat BreadsSpinach Artichoke Dip (what I had)Crab Cake Signature Dishes:Seared TunaMaine Lobster SaladLemon Pepper ChickenLollipops Lamb ChopsThai ChickenBeef TenderloinDesserts:Ultimate Chocolate CakeWhite Chocolate Mousse CakeBlue Martini has some of the best live entertainment in Phoenix.I saw a band rocking the classic oldies.

Central King Eggroll=This place needs to seriously get their act together. They need someone who can speak clearly to take incoming To go orders. Also, I love being served quickly but, not at a price. I don't like the inconvenience of having my order wrong and not having the condiments that go with the food. As a side note --my husband also said the soup taste like dirty water and a few tree branches. I will not be eating here again. Try PT noodles they are not as big but, they are also not in the bad part of town and they have slightly better service. The food also taste better too!
Pita Jungle=I finally made it to this new location of Pita Jungle last week for dinner... While it has a different feel to it, I liked it just as much if not more than the other locations.  It's modern and spacious and has ample seating both inside and out.  Not to mention, you can always count on PJ for an affordable, filling, and healthy meal.I went with a group of five of us on a night that was actually pleasant (not too hot), so we opted to sit outside even though there was a ten minute wait to do so.  We sat at the communal table inside and ordered some hummus as an appetizer and then once our table was available, we moved outside.I tried something new this time - the sauteed garlic spinach.  I ordered it as an appetizer (i know, kind of weird), but it was the perfect healthy beginning to my macro platter entree.  While Jared would not kiss me that night (hello, garlic breath), it was worth it... I enjoyed my meal and our service was attentive as well - and that says a lot since our group went through a ton of water and iced tea.  Other items that our group had were greek salad with chicken, some seafood special, chicken schwarma, and curry chicken.  Everyone was satisfied and went home with a full belly.I learned that this location is a franchise and not the same owners as the original PJ locations.  I think they are planning on opening some additional locations as well.  That's fine with me - the more PJ locations, the better.  The "Jungle" continues to be an old standby for me, my friends, and family - no matter what location!I'm a jack vegan. Well, that's not fair. Most days I do it right. So everybody seems to think I'd love this place. LIke I SHOULD, for some reason, like it. I HATE IT SO MUCH. SO SO MUCH. There's nothing wrong with it unless you want your food to taste good. But if you're one of those morons who are into that, there's a little problem with Pita Jungle. Same with Schlotzky's. Everyone seems to like it. I have never had anything there that tastes good. But many wonderful people feel differently. I can't explain it but thank god for diversity in the universe.So, I might have been slightly wrong about Pita Jungle. Because of the Butterfly Effect, right after the ink on my PJ review dried, my buddy's wife wanted their takeout and since I hadn't been for a while, I thought it was only fair to the Yelp gods that I check my assessment's veracity. My decision to get the jalapeno and cilantro hummus was heavily influenced by my spritual/culinary guide, Richard Z. He's usually right about two things: My neurotic behaviors that lead me to straight to crestfallonically laced internal disharmony and food. It was tasty, indeed. And spicy enough to make me smile. But here's why I'm bumping up the stars...Our server said the funniest shit:My friend asked: How's the tuna melt pizza?Awesome Server: It smells terrible.Friend: Like Farts?A.S.: Like vagina (answers phone)- Takes order. Puts phone down.Well, not like my vagina. Dallas and Friend:... (staring blankly)Three Stars!
Cafe Siena=Another 24-hour joint I frequent off the strip, in the Suncoast Hotel and Casino.  I end up dining here before or after checking out the bands that play in the Suncoast showroom.  This café has decent Chinese food for late night eats and their breakfast menu is pretty extensive.  I remember the cheap graveyard specials...2 buttermilk pancakes-2 eggs-and bacon for $3.99.  They were actually cheaper than that back in the day.  Three solid stars across the board for most of the dishes I've had in the past year: -House salad-Club Sandwich-Fried Rice-Beef Broccoli-Wonton Noodle Soup -Steak and eggs special-Prime rib specialThe daily specials end around 10 pm and the graveyard specials were only offered during the weekdays from 11 pm to 7am.  I used to go here more often when they offered a midnight burger special for $3, including fries and a drink.  For that price, the burger was exceptional!  Service has been good for me lately.  For the past couple of visits, I didn't have to wait for a table as long as I did before...when that burger special was popular!  I guess more people opt to dine earlier at the new TGIF at the other end of the casino.Came In here with Dave's family for an early dinner.The service was kind of slow even though it was half full at 4pm.They serve Large portions for the food and my cobb salad was huge! The burgers that and the sandwiches our party ordered were okay too.Loud environment with annoying announcer on a blown speaker which makes it hard for you to have a decent conversation with your party. Overall -this place is okay.The casino cafe is an institution that has been a good value going back to when Bugsy Siegel opened the Flamingo on December 26, 1946. It is an institution serving all types of food at reasonable prices throughout the day.    The Cafe Siena is the casino cafe of the Sun Coast. It brings the old school casino prices to Summerlin. Their old school casino prices include daily specials; everyday specials featuring meatloaf for $8.99, rotisserie chicken for $9.49, and southern fried steak for $9.99; and Chinese restaurant specials for $8.49.  I am a fan of the casino cafe. They remind me of the New York Diners where you could order from a variety of entrees throughout the day. It comes as zero surprise that after hanging out in Sambalatte across the street, that in the last few weeks I'd spend time in the Sun Coast with a dinner in it's Cafe Siena.   This review is breaks down the two dining experiences I recently had Cafe Siena. It discusses the chicken parmesan and shrimp chow fun dining experiences. The chicken parmesan dining experience :    The two times I dined here, this large Cafe was relatively empty. It was unexpected considering that the Sun Coast T.G.I. Friday's is out of business. The hostess led me to the room to the right near the counter seating. There were so many entrees to choose from. What I really appreciate about the old school casino cafe is that the meal includes either a soup or salad. When I looked at the menu, I was impressed with the prices. This is where the old school casino prices meet Summerlin. There are your daily specials and just inexpensive pricing in general. But to me it was a no brainer. For $9.99, I was going for the chicken parmesan with spaghetti. What is interesting is that this is one of the few restaurants that I know of where spaghetti with meatballs and chicken parmesan are the exact price. Bottomless cola added $2.50 to the price. Up to the time that I ordered coffee, my waiter Greg was on the eight ball. The soup was good. The chicken parmesan was also good. My complaint is that half the plate was green beans and garlic toast filler. But, It was a large plate. The chicken parmesan over spaghetti was worth the $9.99. Toward the end of the meal there were some minor flaws with the service where I'd have to wait on the check. I'd appreciate Cafe Siena enough to return a couple of weeks later. The shrimp chow fun dining experience :   Cafe Siena has an impressive Chinese restaurant menu. It is my understanding that they have a separate Chinese restaurant kitchen. Their Chinese restaurant specials really are a good deal for $8.49. They include an entree, soup, egg roll, fried rice, and crunchy noodles with three sauces. I ordered shrimp chow fun with bottomless Coke. The meal started off with skinny crunchy noodles. Dipped in hot mustard and duck sauce, they were a tasty prelude to a good dinner. The hot and sour soup agreed with my taste buds. The shrimp chow fun transported my taste buds from Summerlin to the summits of the Red Rock Mountains. The bites interspersed with soft noodles, shrimp, scallions, and tasty sauce lifted my taste buds up where they belong. After the dinner, I ordered coffee. Cafe Siena serves coffee in one of those kettles where you pour it yourself. With coffee and cola added to the entree, it was worth around $15.Future check-in status:   If I were to rate my chances of returning here on a scale of 1 to 5, it would be a 4. Chances are that I will be near the Sun Coast in the future. In my opinion it is better than the Grand Cafe in Red Rock Resort. I have my mind set on trying either their spaghetti with meatballs, meatloaf, or shrimp udon. Come to think of it, with all these choices maybe on a scale of 1 to 5, I'll rate it 4 stars on returning here a few more times.
A Piece Of Havana=This is authentic Cuban! We were thrilled to find this place. The tastes took us right back to our childhood kitchen in Miami where our abuela cooked. The croquetas came out piping hot. The to stones were great. I had the masitas de puerco and they were great too. I asked for lime just because that was how we ate them growing up, with lots of lime. The boiled yuca was good, could have used a bit more mojo. My kids had a pan con bistec. It was the thin steak cooked just as it should, i am just not sure it was on real cuban bread. It comes with mayo and mustard so we opted to have it without. They ate it all though and really liked it. The Cuban coffee (espresso) was very authentic, the way they make it on calle ocho. We look forward to returning. So glad to find this place!Returning to A Piece of Havana to meet a friend for dinner, still an outstanding restaurant.I opted for one of their skirt steak dinners, which arrived accompanied by a few plantains and two scoops of very tasty rice. Not a huge meal, but a decent portion. The steak was cooked perfectly, though the steak knife was appreciated. It was melt-in-your-mouth though not cut-with-a-fork. Great flavor with some spices but also the taste of the grill.Service is excellent at keeping drinks refilled, clearing dirty dishes and generally staying on top of things without being annoying.As we were leaving, the live music was getting set up. I understand that they also do some salsa dancing here. This place would be a perfect date night.
Golden Corral=Ahh Sun City: population who cares...the place you live to die.  This food is for the dying soul.  so if you're ready to go....itadakimasu! (japanese for bon appetite)
m:brgr=Went here with a couple of business associates for dinner. While the wait staff was 18ish, flirty, and gorgeous, the food service was very slow. On a Monday night with place about 25% full, it took over thirty minutes for three burgers to arrive.I ordered the Kobe beef burger. It's $40 - for just a burger. If I'm paying that much for a burger, I want it RARE!! I want to taste what I'm paying for: Kobe beef.When ordering I asked for Rare. The response: "I'm sorry sir, we serve them all the same way." Ah, good! I thought. A proprietor who insists the burgers are cooked properly. I assumed it would be rare as that is universally recognized by most any foodie as most delicious.What she didn't say was "all the same way" meant EVERYTHING IS WELL DONE!!!  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!What a crying shame. To take delicious Kobe beef, grind it for a burger and cook it until it's a dried out hockey puck.Kobe Beef is bred for the FAT! The beef are massaged by hand and fed beer daily to increase the FAT. When the beef is cooked, the reason it tastes so good is because of the marbled FAT.Cooking Kobe beef well done melts all the fat, which makes it taste like supermarket chuck. There is no difference. This is a crime and I am dismayed - to put it mildly.For a well done burger, it was passable, but I hate well done. I don't know if it's a Canadian thing. The Canadian we were with flipped when I said I liked rare - going on about e. coli bacteria risk. Escherichia coli (e. coli) is a fancy word for shit. In mass beef processing plants which make ground beef by the ton, it occasionally happens that a (filled) cow intestine gets sucked in the machine and shit gets all over meat - e. coli galore.But - if it's really Kobe beef, that means it's ground in the restaurant kitchen from Kobe beef steak. That means there is little chance of cow shit getting in the mix.For $40 and Kobe beef, I damn well expect a restaurant to be confident cow shit won't get in their meat and can cook it to order - rather than playing it safe and sterilizing my burger.Fucktards.
Postino Central=Oy, Postino's. I wanted to smite you, because you took Kat's Deli away from me. I wanted to spit on you. I wanted to thumb my chin at you. I wanted to rattle my bobbles in your general direction. But, tonight, you made a lover of me in you. For shame, you bad bad boy. I met up with three other people tonight for a casual dinner; I brought the light rail because I imbibed in an absinthe gin martini at home while starting a cross word puzzle. When I arrived, I was greeted by my diner companions and a row of bruschetta. Both were lovely, but the latter were more filling. Since my late arrival, I'm not certain exactly what was ordered: there was one with bacon, one with tomatoes, one with goat cheese, one with prosciutto, among other. I macked them down double time, they were that good. But, I rather filled me up, so I wasn't able to finish my roast beef panini. Oh well, lunch for the following day isn't such a bad thing. All the food was wonderfully delicious. Postino also has a pleasant wine list and some great beers on tap (I had the Kronenbough 1664). As for the washrooms, I liked them. The sliding door made me feel butch, like I was tough enough to drag a large piece of frosted glass across the floor. Loved that they stamped their toilet paper with their name and the logos, but wouldn't want to be the first to wipe with that portion. I understand the neighbors in the Medlock District have issues with the street parking. Hey, I totally understand your concerns. But, having a jewel like Postino in your 'hood makes up for the inconvenience of losing your street parking. Being a reasonable walk from the light rail, I see this as a place I'll likely frequent.The original Postino Winecafe is a regular stop in my rotation of fave places... I love it both for lunch and dinner.  So, although it's a little further away, I just had to go try the new Postino, and I finally made my way there for lunch last week...Sure, the valet parking situation sucks (that's my one pet peeve with this place and I knew about it going in), but get over that and you'll have a delightful experience at Postino Central no matter what time of day you're there...The restaurant is brand new and beautiful - a clean, fun, welcoming atmosphere - just like the Arcadia location.  Service is friendly, iced tea and of course it's the same delicious food as the original location too.  During my recent lunch, I went with the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and added turkey to it too).  Yum!  It's delicious - I could eat that again and again and not get sick of it.  I also love their bruschetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of unique selections).While the Arcadia Postino is closer to home, I have no problem driving the extra couple of miles to go to the new central location.  (Either way, I'm a happy camper.)  I'm just excited that Phoenix now has double the pleasure (double the fun) of having two Postinos to choose from!As much as I love the original Postino, this one is equally amazing, if not a little better.The bartenders here are really sweet, and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave.  For the record...I slur my speech after a few glasses of wine, I wasn't really that drunk.They still have the amazing wine selection, absolutely delicious bruschetta (get the tomato jam and goat cheese, heavenly!), and great soups and salads.  And of course the paninis are a godsend.Though this one is a little farther, I think I will frequent it more often because of the bigger space and bigger bar.It figures two days after I finally write a review for Postino they start serving brunch. Brunch and Postino. Two of my favorite things. When I got the email that they were starting to serve brunch I had to try it out. (Not to mention it was the perfect day to sit on a patio and drink mimosas). I tried the fritatta, which more closely resembled a Spanish tortilla, and it was good. (Not as good as the tortilla Espanola at Sol y Sombra....sniff, sniff). My husband had the country toast, which was kind of like an open face Monte Cristo, except minus the French toast part. A classy Moons Over My Hammy , if you will. It was also good, although I wish that there was an egg on each piece of bread. The other brunch offerings include French toast, BELT (Bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato), a salmon dish (not quite a bagel and lox) as well as other egg dishes. They offer a few sides and starters- the walnut toast was fantastic. Walnut bread with brie and preserves? Yes please. In addition they also offer a huge pot of French press coffee, which my husband really liked. (It is Lola coffee). They have also recently expanded the patio, which I didn't notice on my last visit a few weeks ago since I was seated inside. It now has more seating space and a nice fireplace. (Which was going when we were there for brunch, a nice touch but completely unnecessary, it was quite warm). I am confident that Postino's brunch will make its way into our regular brunch rotation.Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!I'd say its pretty safe to say that I freakin' love this place. Came here with my man-friend the other day for lunch, and my only complaint is that they don't serve the brunch menu on the weekdays... Something to look forward to on the weekends though, because it is goddamn delicious. Not only is this place great for breakfast, lunch, dinner or HH.. its also got a decent selection of wines for sale, AND wine on tap.. are you kidding me? Love it.To accompany our Mimosas, because it was a champagne kind of day, we shared the prosciutto & brie panini along with their famous bruschetta  - you get to choose 4 kinds per order so we did the brie & apple with cheese spread, prosciutto with figs & marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto and the roasted pepper with goat cheese.. ahhhmazinzazing! All of them. F-ing mouthwateringly delicious. Certainly try a few if you happen to visit. Their drink deals are ridiculous.. $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer from 11-5pm, Monday and Tuesday its $20 for a bottle of wine and plate of bruschetta , and you get $9 off any bottle if you take it to go. They have a a groovy back patio that is wonderful for anytime of year since they bust out the heat lamps, 1 per table it seemed, plenty of parking and pristine bathrooms. I like the minimalistic decor.. and the fact that it was very light and airy.. literally the place was packed about 15 minutes after we sat down, and I never felt claustrophobic like I do so very often. Everything about this place makes me smile. Its just GOOD. Go here as soon as you can, I promise you wont regret it.OMG! Postino's went above and beyond for me on my birthday and I cannot even begin to thank them enough. See they do not take reservations on Sunday's because it gets crazy busy with their brunch and it is just a very popular day. Plus rain was in the forecast for Sunday which was going to make space even tighter. However I called up Postino's on Saturday and spoke with Troy # 1 and told him that I was coming on Sunday with about 20+ people and asked if there was anyway he could help me out. Hmm he says, let me get your number and I will call you back when I can figure out something. So about an hour later he calls to let me know that he can't reserve a table for 20 but that he can can hold at 4 top for me and as my party comes, we can seat them as needed and as long as their is not a wait. Deal!!!! So Sunday arrives, I go to Postino's and Troy # 2 lets me know that Troy#1 told him about me and my situation and that he was there to take care of me. :) YAY! so we were seated at our 4 top, and soon after, we were able to take over another table, then another, until we took over the entire back booth area as well as one 4 top that was close by. There was a couple, Sandy and Mike, that was sitting in the back booth who were so very sweet. We pretty much took over their area to the point that by the time they got ready to leave, they had gone from sitting in the middle of the booth to the very end of the booth. My friend Deb bought them each a glass of wine because they were so very generous and just all around great people. Now everyone told me how fabulous their bruschetta was and they were right. I only had a few pieces because I wanted to I talked to everyone and make sure that they were having a good time. But I will be back to enjoy an entire board by myself. Ok maybe not by myself but still, it was damn good. The wine I was drinking was also excellent as well. Hats off to my friend Deb for picking a fabulous red for me. You are the best. Special thanks also goes out to our server TJ who rocked it for us all afternoon. He made sure everyone was taken care of when it came to food, drinks, etc. Thank you TJ!!! I truly enjoyed myself and I will be back again VERY soon. Thank you again to the entire staff at Postino's on Central for making my 35th birthday extra special.Call me a cab bitches! It's official! Postino Central is my absolute favorite day drinking spot. I'm in love with all things vino. Some of you know this intimately. (some of you meaning anyone who's ever read any of my reviews) More importantly, I love $5 wine by the glass. Mostly because it ensures that I'm a fairly cheap date, but also because I like to try new things, so even if I hate it...hey, it was only 5 bucks.  The place isn't teaming with douchebags, which is fantastic. I think it's a prerequisite that you be easy on the eyes to work there...equally fantastic for both boys and girls, though it seems to be a predominately male crew...so, like I said...The atmosphere is solid. Bright, with an open airy feeling even if you aren't sitting on the patio. There is a Circle K conveniently located across the street, you know, in case you (or someone who shall remain nameless to protect his pretty dignity) are in dire need of a couple of Vitamin Waters and a gigantic box of Sugar Babies because it seems like a REALLY good idea after 3 pitchers of Odell's... until you start looking like a dog chewing peanut butter because you can't get them out of your teeth!!...Fuck!! There goes a filling..but that's a story for another time.The food is quite tasty and I'm a huge fan of Bruschetta. My favorites including the Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Salami with Pesto and my all time favorite, Tomato Jam with fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese. It sounds a little suspect but I promise you won't regret it.I've enjoyed every Panini I've tried with favorites being Prosciutto with Brie and Autostrada (my soppresatta mistress continues to haunt me) *sigh*I was forced into sharing dessert once, it was some chocolate cake extravaganza that was insanely good, though I don't remember the name. Good wine, good tunes, great atmosphere and delicious food + excellent company and slurred speech = good times had by all!Cheers!I went to @PostinoCentral for lunch today. cc: @PostinoWineCafe (How interesting that they don't even use the twitter for this location)I won't be going back any time soon. I am required to give at least one star. The second star was because the food was actually very good.You most definitely did not earn two stars.When I come to your establishment, it is not your place to determine that my not ordering something gives you license to treat me and my party like shit.Water was spilled on one of our group by one of the servers, and no offer was made to get a napkin, or help clean it up.Our actual server, who was adorned with diamond studs in her chest, gave the very distinct impression that everything she was doing for us was a chore.At the end of the meal, when I asked her to separate the checks, she nearly had a conniption. Excuse me for asking you to do your job, and not make assumptions about me or my party, simply because we aren't all falling over ourselves to buy each other's meal.I had the Nine Iron panini. It was pretty tasty. I had it with the salad, which was also delicious.Neither, individually or collectively, could have been good enough to overcome the deplorable treatment we received.Perhaps the fact that I wear a cowboy hat and boots is what gave the waitress the idea she had license to be an unreasonable bitch.Perhaps it's that we (our group) doesn't fit the wine-snob, or urban hipster stereotype.Regardless, you lost a potential regular. Nicely done.Wow. I can't believe I waited this long to check out Postino's. I mean what is wrong with me? It's like why did Liza wait so long to divorce her gay ass husband? Or why did it take so long KFC to come up with grilled chicken? Or why, why did it take so long for The Ghost Whisperer to be canceled? I ask you. Why? WHYYYY!!Putting that aside I have to say I was UBER impressed with Postino's on every level. I triple love the bar opening up to the intimate patio, the charming, airy and open dining room with the fireplace and cozy vintage sofas. Love it. Now let's talk BRUSCHETTA 101! OK. They have nailed it. Nailed it like Levi Johnston nailed Bristol Palin! My faves were the brie and apple and the ricotta with pistachios and dates. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the edge with a soft middle. Kind of like my Uncle Larry but don't tell him I said that. We over ordered because we definitely didn't each need our own sandwich. The Niner (I think that's the name) was gigantic and served on delicious focaccia bread...crispy bacon, juicy chicken...so so good. Side salad was, um, interesting. While I appreciate the pine nuts and the cheese I just wasn't feeling the dressing. Kind of sour. Not to worry. Nothing could spoil this fabulous foodie rampage. Service, at first a tad slow...was friendly and efficient. It won't take me long to return to you Postino's. I want to be a regular so that when I walk in everyone yells THOMAS!!!Really........FOUR stars on the previous review Kristi....realllllllllyyyy?The food and drink, as always, is on point. Occasionally, they make small changes to the bruschetta menu which I enjoy because hey, who doesn't like to try something new when you're pretty confident it's going to be AMAZING! Helloooo Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes!!There is some kind of crazy love vortex (minus the twisted trees) surrounding this Postino location. Seriously, everyone else disappears. Don't plan a date here unless you are prepared to eventually propose or accept said proposal. Don't say I didn't warn you.this place is my new jam! i can't get enough! we sat on the charming patio near the fire place and the patio warmers. it was so cozy cute back there! it felt like i was somewhere else, like a vacation. we did the bottle of the moscato d'asti. my friend wanted a pinot but i was so excited when I saw that they had my fav moscato that she let me order that for us.  what a great friend i have! for the bruschetta we tried these (rated orgasmic to just tasty):1. prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone- so good i bought the ingredients and made it for myself the next day. 2. tomato jam and sheeps milk cheese- the cheese was nice and salty and the jam was sweet. perfect harmony. 3. salami with pesto- this was good, i might not order it again but i might. i wasn't the biggest fan of the salami they used but it was good. 4. white bean with chopped tomato- this one was good but tasted like traditional bruschetta and we were looking for the funky. so probably won't order this one again unless i'm in the mood for traditional bruschetta. we also ordered the autostrada panini to split but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. we wound up taking that home. it was quite tasty.the only issue we had was when the bill came. they charged everything a la carte and forgot to apply the tuesday special ($20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta)  but they more than made up for it. they felt so bad, fixed it right away and comped our sandwich. love this place.Ok I love the food here, but the service does need some work.  Maybe I went on an off night, but the service was terrible.  We chose the outdoor seating, it was after 930 on a Saturday, and I noted the lower amount of staff.  I can say a lower amount of customers as well however.So my review is totally based on service, I would give it a 2 star, but the food is that good that I would come back; to Arcadia next time, since I still have the sour taste from poor service from this location.  The waitress did give me a box to take home what I did not eat, took my card to ring me up and never came back.  We finished our pitcher of beer, then we finished our waters and finally I could not wait another 10 minutes.  We waited 10 minutes after the waitress picked up the check and card.  When I got up and asked for my check, they handed me someone else's tab???Then I explained that they had my bill and card already??  So looking down and the table it was under all the these other tabs, like a disorganized table of bills and little clip boards?  Wow, even another employee asked my waitress if she helped another table yet at this point.  I could see the worry in his face.... To sum it up a customer should never have to get up and go look for a credit card after 10 minutes.  I was never rang up and basically my table was forgotten.  Maybe the waitress thought I was enjoying the outdoor seating at 11:30 at night, but at the end of the day I am not looking for an explanation.  I can only tell you that it has been a long time since I have received such poor service from a restaurant.  Next time I visit Arizona I am steering clear of this location for sure.  I might have to drive to Arcadia just to have a great experience of food and service.Postino, I love you.  I love absolutely everything about you.  My biggest concern is the anxiety I get when it comes time to order.  There are SO many things on the menu that I love, and I'm trying to maintain a girlish figure, so I can't order everything.  My absolute favorite lunch is the prosciutto/fig/brie sandwich on ciabatta with the mixed greens salad.  The fried shallots, pear, candied nuts, and grapes make it an unforgettable dish, and the salty-sweet combo in the sandwich is perfection.  Their lemonade is the best in town, and it is a steal when you factor in the free refills.  Of course, their wine list is extensive and amazing... but I just can't seem to give up my lemonade! The service is always good.  Unobtrusive, knowledgeable, and friendly... plus a little hipster (but not TOO much).  It is always on my most-recommended list to friends and visitors.  Their consistency and quality are always spot-on.  If you haven't been, then get yourself there pronto!I've eaten bruschetta all my life, but never had it in a form of a sampler.. pure genius!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/postino-central-phoenix?select=btNMXTdz7xbOOz2Ua7LCOQ#TIZbK4zS95CMvoIvyp0bFA1. brie & apples with fig spread2. smoked salmon & pesto3. prosciutto, figs, and mascarpone cheese4. burrata (love), bacon, tomatoAll this, cut into smaller bite sizes, and $14; a steal. The concept of bite-sized bread+toppings remind me of Fig & Olive in LA. But, I do think that Postino's just tastes better.We also got the Butcher plate with different meats, cheese, hummus, and olives. And the raspberry chicken salad. It was all very good.JY got the cucumber honey lemonade - SO refreshing and has a strong cucumber flavorI got a glass of Malbec. $11 for a mini carafe and it was great.Probably one of the best things I ate in Arizona!I had early dinner (5pm) here today with my parents, and we had such a good time!Parking wasn't a problem at 5 and also not a problem when we left around 6:40pm on a Thursday night. While the inside tables were full as we were leaving, the outside seating was very much available.The waitress who served us throughout the night was a sweet lady who called me and even my dad "honey."The brushetta ($14) was delicious - esp. the brie and apple, bacon & arugula. The tomato, basil & mozzarella was okay, but not stellar. My parents and I all had the split two ($10). The salads are pretty similar. My mom couldn't really tell them apart.The prosciutto with brie was great as was the soup of the moment (kale & sausage). After dinner, we shared a creme brulee ($7) that was not overly sweet - it was just right! The ambience of the restaurant was amazing - as the sun went down, servers placed candles on each table.Cons:1. No reservations (only for 8 ppl and larger)
Primanti Bros=I feel silly even having to review Primanti Brothers.  Come on - this legendary landmark (even though it has several locations, each are a landmark in my opinion) speaks for itself.  I almost always order the Capicola and cheese.  If I've had a few drinks, and it is past midnight and I find my way to Primanti Brothers I usually will order it with an egg on it.  But the older I get I find myself there at much more reasonable times!They claim that they are "Almost Famous".  I'm here to say that Primanti Brothers IS FAMOUS.  I mean, come on, Sophia Vegara just tweeted a photo of her Primanti's sandwich to her million + followers.  Primanti's has been on the Food Network God knows how many times.  Drop the "Almost", Primanti's, because you Are Famous.The original location is in the Strip District but you can find one almost everywhere now.  Oakland and the South Side are probably closest to the "authentic Primanti's" atmosphere other than the original location, while the newer franchised Primanti's in locations like Monroeville or Harmar are much more of a restaurant type experience.  I like my floors greasy and my sandwich with fries and slaw.
Gallo Blanco=I'm excited to be the first REAL review of this place.  We decided to stop by here in favor of Postino, as we have already been multiple times, and boy am I glad we did.  This is like the 4th or 5th, or maybe 12th different restaurant inside the ever-so-lovely Clarendon Hotel.  In what seems to be a revolving door of restaurant concepts in this rather charming space, I think we have finally found a winner.Gallo Blanco does something that not enough restaurants do.  They downsize their menu drastically to have only a few different options for lunch/dinner, and a few options for breakfast, plus a few assorted appetizers.  I much prefer a restaurant to have a few things on the menu that they perfect rather than a whole bunch of items that are only so-so.  The dinner menu offers a few entrees including steak and chicken and then there are tortas or tacos with your choice of delectable meat stuffed inside.  The husband and I ordered the cheese crisp (not what you think) and the pork sandwiches.  I would give the Spanish names, but I've got nothing for ya.  The cheese crisp was a fantastic giant fried concoction.  It seems like it was a large tortilla, or something, covered in cheese and deep fried wrapped around something round.  It was really good, I can't describe it much better, just get it if you go.  The pork tortas were so delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  it was mixed with some shredded lettuce, a couple slices of fresh avocado, and there was a delightfully tangy/spicy sauce underneath.  The bread was unbelievably tasty, slightly sweet with a perfect texture.  I was excited to actually have a true torta bun instead of your average run of the mill hamburger bun.  We decided to split the chocolate pudding for dessert.  It was served in a small tumbler.  The chocolate pudding wasn't a traditional pudding and was much thinner.  However, it went perfectly with the graham crackers and the truly homemade marshmallow fluff.  The marshmallow stuff was soooooo good and you can taste the quality.  A tasty yet simple dessert.What a great experience!  I only took away one star because the restaurant was far from busy but the wait for food was a little too long to be deemed acceptable.  However, our server was so sweet and charming, and her English accent was almost unbearably adorable.  It was her first day on the job but she was phenomenal.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and I hope we finally have a permanent resident in the Clarendon restaurant space.I am a woman that likes lime in her Mexican Beer. I mean, a LOT of lime. Gallo - you scratch me where I itch! They fresh squeeze lime juice and when mixed with your tecate, you are in heaven!Aside from the best beer in town, they also have amazing fresh squeezed watermelon & lime juice and iced coffee. The best news of all is that the iced coffee is $1.25 and I heard they order from Cartel in Tempe!I have been to Gallo twice now. The first time I tried the veggie tacos and took a bite of the veggie torta. Both were seriously to die for. Over the weekend I had the huevos rancheros for brunch, and those too were out of this world! They also have a tomatillo sauce that is super good. Not only is the food and drink amazing, but the prices are awesome too! I had breakfast, iced coffee and two beers for $17.  (I did hear over the weekend that they will be raising their prices soon, which sucks, but I would be fine paying more because the quality certainly justifies it!!)Even better news, you can get all of this POOL SIDE at the Clarendon pool! Ummm... you really cannot go wrong!I have no complaints about the service. The menu is small but varied, so as a hotel guest I feel like you could eat there a few times during your trip without feeling worn out of the taste.I am super stoked that Gallo is now in Clarendon, because I will spend my weekends delighting in that delicious Tecate while I munch on some $2 veggie tacos poolside!Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.I am going to hold back a star because I didn't get to take pictures off the rooftop.  A private party, with really obnoxious karaoke  singers, had booked the rooftop lounge.I was there for PFN and had drug my neighbor, Cindy Y., along.  I chose Hefeweizen and she was drinking the regular margaritas. To eat I had one each: pork taco, fish taco and carne asada taco.  All were good.  I thought the carne asada taco had more of a of a pineapple taste than I was expecting.  Cindy had a pork taco, fish taco and grilled corn on the cob which comes with parmesan and some other stuff on it.  Nathan S. who sat with us to eat had a pork torta that he was quite pleased with.  We both enjoyed everything and the prices were quite reasonable. In addition to the traditional restaurant and bar areas you can choose to sit out by the pool which is a large enough area to accommodate a couple of reasonable sized groups at the same time and still allow for mingling.  I would suggest maybe doubling the number of chairs and tables though.  They have a server assigned to the pool area or you can go inside to order.For a restaurant to make it in a small hotel in Arizona they have to have enough draw to bring local folks in during those months that are slow in the hotel business.  So far these folks seem to be off to a good start.I took my shop car rather than get to yet another downtown venue where parking my truck would be a hassle.  I needn't have worried, there was plenty of easy access parking in the lot and on the street.Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!Ok let me start off by saying I have eaten at the clarendon kitchen before it was thankfully demolished. My gf got such bad food poisoning she was barfing in a Harkins Loyelty cup on the freeway, because she couldnt make it to pull over. After emtying it several times out the window to refill it, she had a cold sweat for the rest of the night.I think she lost like 4 lbs and she is super tiny to begin with so by the next day she was skeletor... So naturally I was jealous, not really, but kinda.. no I kid, but seriously... So enough background on the horror this spot was. At first we were leary but when we arrived it was completely open and gutted, you could see the kitchen which for a germy like me that is a beautiful thing. The menu is small and slightly hard to read at first. We ordered the guacamole before I realized it was 7 bucks. When we got it it looked like the chunks would be too big for my gf liking (because I micro manage how she eats) after one bite this shit was definatly the best guac Ive had, for real. I heard about the mandarines which I actually hate, so I was a skeptic.. no it was delicious. I got beef tacos which were melt in your mouth. the veggie was pretty good but had mushrooms, I fucking hate mushrooms. Those sick ass little horse pissed on poop bi products. Aside from the mushrooms it was very tasty, i would get them again minus the poopy shrooms. Oh the best part is they serve the coke in a can and its a buck... finally someone gets that its a joke to charge 2.50 for a fucking soda.Awesome job, Ill be coming back to try some breakfast or hang out and try that beer you doctor up. If you ever ate at clarendon kitchen , dont be scared its nothing like that nightmare !!!!"It's like a jungle sometimes, It makes me wonder, How I keep from going under..."hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacosbut alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.I live across the street from Gallo Blanco and yoouuuu don't...na na na na na naaaaa! So I've yelped the delicious tacos and creamy, lumpy, salty beans and even the mango beverage I had last month that I wanted to swim in...and now I have to say I would sell my mother to the North Korean's (I hear they have two openings for hard labor camp) for the AMAZING corn on the cob and the chocolate pudding. Every time I eat the chocolate pudding, and let's not fool ourselves my yelpitas, it has been several, several times, I conjure up a particular scene from the American Pie movie. Nuff said.I really enjoy Gallo Blanco, whether it's for brunch or lunch/dinner.Is it a perfect experience? No way... not by any means. But it is a much better effort than what we all had to endure with C4 , Clarendon Kitchen, etc... Nothing seemed to stick.I will say I did not enjoy being dropped on by condensation from an AC unit a few weeks ago, but that is neither here nor there, because of our large party, and because I did not formally complain to the server/management.Every other experience has been how I like it. Servers seem a little new and lacking confidence so far. But overall, I like it. The food is decent. Not excellent, but done pretty well -- everything from the elotes to the guacamole.I especially enjoy the brunch and the value of it. Are you really serious? $5 brunch with chorizo egg and refried beans, done just right?!  Breakfast and dinner tortas served on soft bolillos are done decently here, although the crust could be a little more tough.Tacos are priced just right, cooked well and are worth the $2.50 each! Can't decide if I like the fish or the carnitas better. Anyhow, decide for yourself.Today was my first time here.  Yes, I know, I am a Big AL(big-ass loser.  You'd know this if you've ever taught middle/high school).  Anyway, I was meeting up with Tony, aka Lightrailblog for a late lunch.  I knew I wanted the elote.  I've been hearing everyone scream about the damn elote for months.  I started out with an iced tea (I am an iced tea FREAK!) that was flavored - I think mango.  Then I got an Arnold Palmer.  This was the BEST AP I've EVER had!  (Sorry, FEZ!)  It was made with freshly-squeezed lemonade and was plenty tart.  I also had huevos ranchers.  I like that they asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.  Server, Steven ("Esteban") was awesome...as soon as he figured out that everything I said was a joke. I mean, come on, am I *really* gonna put my ice cubes on your nipples?  Well, not in public, and not until you buy me dinner.  HA!Downfall:  THE FLIES!!!!  There were at least 4 flying around our table.  *shudder*so, i finally had my experience. the best food, i have eaten, thus far in my life. i literally couldnt even handle the amazingness of the cochinita. it was, well, amazing.while eating the elote i kept saying shut up. but no one was talking? thats how good it was. my friend asked if it was for real.  both of our faces were covered in corn juice and our teeth full of corn bits. oh, yes, it is for real. the service was awesome too. our waiter was so great. he let me 'taste' the agua frescas. ummm YUM! we ordered the chips and salsa too- the bomb dot com for sure. i need to go like everyday. and i will. jk i wont but i'll think about it daily.Call me a hater, but you all are brainwashed. Edit: changed my review to two stars to be a little more fair.I will start off by saying this is by far the best restaurant the Clarendon has had yet, though that isn't saying much considering their track record. The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You can't tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins, and they don't have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know "were here for dinner......"After being seated, our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo, a drink made with jalapeno, tequila, lime, and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious, but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. I'm a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything, but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding??? I ordered three tacos, and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita, which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also don't used tough, chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You don't put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality, but fell flat on it's face when it came to flavor, of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well, which also was covered in guacamole. You can't just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican, unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my "guacos" (not tacos) begrudgingly. My girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average, but I'd have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this, and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish you've managed to butcher, after the cochinita pibil. I won't even start on the rice, which was not cooked properly, was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED, and was borderline cold. Service here is good enough, but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about, all the way to the end when she asked why we didn't finish the guacamole and couldn't understand why we weren't licking the bowl, she just flat out was off. The meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be "cute" and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it, and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on it's own in the real world (outside it's "I'm to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me" atmosphere) it would fall flat on it's face, just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up.Alas! A meal at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that made me say 'wow'. Despite being led astray by MapQuest and getting lost for about twenty minutes on our way there we eventually stopped at a gas station and asked for directions which led us to the promised land. It was a fun detour though, while asking for directions we got to witness a senile homeless man get into a heated argument with a gas pump; which is always a lot of fun.First impressions are always a big thing, and Gallo Blanco made a pretty good one. Not knowing what type of place it was, we were quite surprised and excited when we turned the corner and saw a sheik and new age restaurant occupying the bottom floor of the Clarendon hotel. It looked swanky and fun... and honestly I was expecting something a little rougher around the edges; what a nice surprise. Upon walking into the restaurant we were a little confused about where exactly the entrance was, so we found ourselves standing around looking like lost children... luckily one of the managers immediately noticed us and personally helped us out and sat us down pretty quickly... really nice guy. Right when we sat down, they instantly plopped a pretty heavenly looking basket of chips with a plate of three different salsas on our table, I pretty much instantly fell in love. The chips were fresh as can be; they looked and tasted like they had just been freshly made minutes ago, which I wouldn't be surprised if they were. For our main course we got a little random smattering of stuff. Started out with the quesadilla then the roasted corn (it had some special name but I don't remember what it was) then for our main dish; three different types of tacos (beef, tuna, and pork) and huevos rancheros. Everything was amazing... just melt in your mouth good. The roasted corn which was rolled in some sort of cheese and hot sauce was just amazing; possibly the best roasted corn I've ever had. Even the dessert we ordered (banana crepes) was spectacular. Gourmet Mexican is not something I'm accustomed to... but that's the best way I can describe this place. The great thing about it, is that it's very reasonable... they sell many of the menu items a la carte; for example the quesadilla and most of our tacos were 2 bucks a piece... hell yeah! You get a lot of flavor and atmosphere for a really reasonable price, and I just can't justify giving this place anything less than 5 stars. Can't wait to go back!This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called "Picoso".Coda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual "interesting" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.This drink they call "Picoso" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word "memorable" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway.Living in a town known throughout the US of A for having decent Mexican food, and loving to eat as much as I do, you would think that I'd have pretty much hit all the high spots by now, wouldn't you?I guess not!I had not been to Gallo Blanco until yesterday for a lunch meeting.It's a long way from Old Town, and while I still have the reflexes of a cat (well, an older cat, anyway), some of the drivers I see in my cross-town jaunts just make me want to curl up in my sock drawer and weep for days!So I avoid the drive...no sense in letting the Beautiful Carin collect on my life insurance just yet:)When I got there and saw the place, I thought, "well Donald, here we go...another over-hyped joint...don't get your hopes up."But I tried to keep an open mind as my buddy ordered for us...Cochinita, Carne Asada and Tilapia Taco's that came in a little corrugated steel rack along with a couple of squeeze bottles of salsa (green and orange).Precious!I grabbed a pork taco...squeezed a little of the orange stuff on it and took a bite...and the angels sighed!Smack my ass and call me Pepe'...go ahead...I know you want to!I could not believe how delightful these tasty little morsels were...I mean stunningly good...all of them...including the Tilapia...so very, astonishingly good!And I couldn't believe that I hadn't been here before (which is why you can smack me on the ass and call me Pepe')...but I won't be away from here for long.My friend and I polished off  1/2 dozen taco's and then decided that we needed dessert...so we each ordered a Torta (a Naco and a Cochinita), and then split them so we each had  1/2...so very good!Not many people would suspect this about me, but I am something of a contrarian...perhaps even a little bit cantankerous...esp. about places that don't live up to the hyperbole.And then I write snarky reviews!But I can't get snarky about Gallo Blanco...GB delivers on all the promises!The menu is clever and innovative, deftly executed with ingredients that are clearly top drawer!The service we received at lunch was prompt and pleasant without being cloying.The décor and atmosphere are pleasant and inviting.But the real star of the show here is the food...or maybe I should say "the 5 stars"...Oh, I think I may have had better tacos, or torta's, but I can't for the life of me remember when or where it was!It takes a lot to get me out of Old Town on a regular basis (Honest to frikkin' God, the way some people drive, I'm astonished there aren't 50 fatalities a day in PHX!) but GB makes taking my life in my hands seem worth it.A new regular in the rotation...if I lived across the street like Thomas does, I think I'd eat my normal 7 meals a day here!gallo blanco makes me a saaaaaaaaaaaaaad panda. seriously whats up, dude? the service lately has been pretty crappy. way disappointed. i keep hoping it's an off night but that's turned into a pattern so i can't excuse it any longer. the food is still good, but it takes forever. and the worst part, the last two times i ordered cochinita tacos they were dry and one was just grissle. what the heck are yall doin back there? i want the old gallo back.Upgrading Gallo Blanco to 5 stars as it is now one of our favorite places to eat downtown.Even after switching to eating vegan, Gallo Blanco still rocks for us! I'd recommend:Chips & guacamole with no cheese (some of THE best guac in town)A couple veggie tacos (these come with no cheese by default)Other options:side of jasmine rice with green tomatillo salsaside of beans with no cheese+ moreBoth their red & green spicy sauces are vegan and delicious (ask for them!!).My previous qualms about their beer selection have been resolved. They have a tasty craft-brewed amber or pale ale on tap almost every time that we visit.As I walked into Gallo Blanco, I felt like I left Arizona in 2010 and entered a big city in 1975 with its incredible retro vibe. Making its home within the Clarendon, Gallo Blanco has quite the reputation in Phoenix, so needless to say I was excited to check it out. The atmosphere at Gallo Blanco is vivacious and packed full of restaurant goers most nights of the week. The bar is intimate as is the seating area. With a modern meets Mexico feel to it, the character begs for you to have a margarita and guacamole the second you sit down. Since it's crowded and not overly large, be prepared to wait if you visit in the evening during prime dinner hours. However, if you are forced to wait, they invite you to wait at the rooftop bar or by the retro pool and they'll call your cell phone when they are ready for you. Now let's move on to the food and drinks. Their margaritas as excellent. Not too sweet and not too thick. I could easily have 1...2...or 6 of them. The guacamole is tangy and tasty. I think I tasted some pineapple chunks in there and the taste had a nice kick to it. As for the entrees, I need to give Gallo Blanco another try. I liked what I had, but it wasn't what I expected. I ordered the honey chicken with tortillas and expected it to be almost fajita style. Instead, it came out as a full half chicken that I had to cut and make my own tortilla. Once I got through cutting through the whole chicken, the marinade and seasoning on the fresh tortillas accompanied by the sauce was quite tasty, but it was the process getting there that makes me want to try something else on the menu. We sat on the patio since it was a busy night, which was nice and quiet. Next time when I try something different in the cuisine department, I'd also like to dine inside as well. All in all, I had a good experience at Gallo and I give the overall evening four stars, but I will need to experience the cuisine there a couple more times to really rate it to a higher extent.Number. One. Fan.Yep, I said it. I'm their number one freaking fan. Where do I start? Location and History: inside the historic Clarendon Hotel. If you don't know the story of Don Bolles -- the Arizona Republic reporter who was murdered by the PHX mafia in the hotel's parking lot -- then acquaint yourself on some crazy PHX background. The hotel has some (rather poorly enlarged, unfortunately) newspaper clippings and photos on this throughout its hallways that lead to the bathroom. Anyway, look up the story, then drop some knowledge on your fellow diners -- they will certainly appreciate the space on a whole new level.Food: Reasonably priced and yum-yum. Tortas, street-style tacos, Mexi brunch, dessert (fresh fruit and crema is light, sweet and perfect end to, say, a giant carna asada burrito), I love it all. I cannot rave enough about their Ejote, or Mexican Grilled Corn. I make everyone I take here try it and have turned them all into addicts. Not to mention, their food is from local farms and much of it is organic...say, what?? For the price, the taste and the guilt-free experience, you simply cannot beat it. I have one note of warning, do NOT get sucked into the curiosity surrounding their Chicharron de Queso (which comes with the quip on their menu: "This is NOT a quesadilla, gringos"). It's basically fried cheese. Sounds so simple and weird that you think Well, it must be more than it sounds, to be on the menu! Nope, it tastes just like the bits of shredded cheese that fall out of your grilled cheese onto the skillet and get half burnt. But everything else I've tried gets a thumbs up. Live entertainment and extras: Flamenco music and dancing demos every Wednesday = awesome. Held inside the lobby (viewable from most seats in the dining room) or on the roof when it's cooler. Sunday cool baby night -- DJs and hipster mingling on the roof, complete with makeshift bar.Odds and Ends: The pool area and roof top. Pool area is fantastic with its brightly colored tile, water wall of glass and cacti. Soothing, beautiful and a great spot for out-of-towners to relax. Not to mention the City of Phoenix logo sculpture, which, as Bonnie G pointed out, is a great spot to snag photos with your visiting friends and family. The roof top area is just perfect -- a great view of the city, tons of comfy padded patio furniture. Between getting to tell newcomers about the cool history, take them up to the roof and introduce them to the Valley's best Ejote, this is my top "hidden gem" in Phoenix. I take my parents here and I take dates here, it's just that versatile and cool.  As such: Number. One. Fan.By far one of my Favorite Restaurants to eat Vegan at. I can't believe I haven't updated my review, the first time I reviewed Gallo I was not even Vegan, it's been a long time. The Veggie Tacos are out of this world, I usually order 5 or 6. They are pretty small in size but not in flavor. Fresh tiny corn tortillas stuffed with a varying mixture of grilled veggies like, onion, red pepper, green beans, mushroom, corn and spinach topped with guacamole and the best part is they are only $2 each WHAT!! That's right only $2 each. It gets better, during Happy Hour which is now 7days a week from 3pm-6pm, My beloved Veggie Tacos are only.......wait for it.........$1 each!! Not to mention the $5 (HH price) made to order Guacamole, loaded with roasted tomatoes, chunks of citrus and spices, (be sure to say No Cheese if you are a Vegan.) It's my professional opinion that this is some of the best Guacamole I've had, try it f you don't believe me.All this talking has got me craving it, I gotta go, See you at Gallo!I live within walking distance from the Clarendon and can't believe I haven't been here yet. Yesterday, my husband lured me into skipping yoga to go get some Mexican food here. We took the family here for Taco Tuesday and during happy hour. We ordered the $5 Chirraron de Queso (cheese cooked into a hard shell)(decent), $5 guacamole (holy hell this was good), $5 white sangria (decent), chips and salsa ($3.5), a kids bean and cheese burrito ($4) that was the side of my 3 year old's head, and 8 mix-n-match tacos (pork, carne asada, shrimp, fish, veggie). For taco Tuesday, they are buy 2 get 1 free, which is the deal we were given, but we would have saved more with the $1 off per taco during HH. I ordered a shrimp taco and pork taco. Both were delicious but the pork taco really tickled my fancy. The pork had that crispy bark on the outside which is my absolute favorite. Call it the Puerto-Rican in me but that is the best. I really enjoyed my meal and the server was great. I know I loved this place when I am trying to talk my husband into going back in a couple of days....***From the pancakes to the breakfast burrito and the chilaquiles, Gallo Blanco serves a good and very reasonably priced breakfast in a warm, casual and friendly atmosphere***Gallo Blanco Cafe & Bar is located in a hotel (Clarendon Hotel).  Hotel restaurants worry me a little.  But once you enter Gallo Blanco, you realize that Gallo Blanco is not your typical hotel restaurant and Clarendon Hotel is definitely not your typical hotel.The Clarendon Hotel seemed to have a funky boutique vibe to it.  The front desk seemed very casual and the little bit we saw of the hotel was fresh, casual and youthful.  There was a lot of interesting looking local art in the hallway and the men's restrooms were outfitted with urinals that were designed to look like open mouths (a Yelper posted a photo of it on Gallo Blanco's page).The Gallo Blanco has a very youthful coffee shop feel to it.  The restaurant is open and bright (big floor-to-ceiling windows).  The restaurant is very straightforward.  Square room.  Not much in terms of decoration (some art here and there).  Bright but not overly strong colors that give it a casual and hip atmosphere.  The seating is very functional too (no frills).  There is also an outdoor patio.We went for breakfast and it was reasonably priced.  Most of their breakfast items were $7 to $10 and the portion sizes were just right (generous enough but not over-the-top-big).We shared the breakfast burrito, which actually was pretty big.  The burrito was a flour tortilla stuffed with chorizo, potatoes, eggs, refried beans, cheddar cheese, and fire roasted salsa.  The burrito was flavorful and had a little bit of spice and kick to it (additional salsa was available on the side).  Everything tasted good and all the ingredients were nicely melted together.  The Chilaquiles Verdes were even better.  The tostadas were light and crispy; they were also flavored quite well with the green chile sauce.  We added some shredded chicken and it was good and tender (and not too dry).  The chilaquiles verdes were topped with some good sunny side up eggs.For something a little sweet, we went with their buttermilk pancakes and they were very good.  The pancakes were light and fluffy.  They also had a great brown color to them.  You get that fresh off the griddle flavor here that you don't get at a lot of pancake places.  The maple syrup was warm, sweet and good.I also had the fresh squeezed orange juice and it was pulpy and tasty.Service started off a little slow, but once we got our order in, the food came out very quickly and the staff was attentive.  The whole staff (from the owner to the hostess to the waitresses) were very friendly and personable, which added to the warm and casual atmosphere.Gallo Blanco Cafe & Bar serves a good Mexican breakfast.  All three of our dishes were good, which makes me curious about their other options.  I do not know when I will be in Phoenix next, but my breakfast was good enough here that I would consider making a return visit (even if I was only in Phoenix for a day or two).Parking is available on the street (free; no meters).Host was nice and the tacos were goodWhen first visiting Gallo Blanco in 2009, I would have definitely given it 3 stars. Service was very spotty and the HH was a lot more limited. Now, after visiting this place countless times for brunch, dinner and HH, I really do think it's an affordable, reliable and delicious destination that makes sense for a lot of different types of social situations - from a meal shared with my grandmother to a spontaneous HH with friends. As many reviewers have mentioned, happy hour is fantastic here, with tacos from $1 - $2.50 and great drink prices. Here are some of my favorite food and drink items (keep in mind that I'm a pescetarian, so meat didn't make it on the list!): *Agua fresca of the day w/ or w/o vodka*Picoso (tequila, pineapple and jalapeno) *Micheladas (make 'em bloody for a great hangover cure)*Bloody Marys (they make them with dill for an unexpected but fresh twist)*Elote (Mexican corn) with cotija cheese and cream *Shrimp tacos (amazing, juicy shrimp) *Chilaquiles (the sauce used to have chicken but they now offer a vegetarian version)*Chopped saladOne other awesome bonus is that the bar will wrap up food to go if you'd like to take up to the roof. Get your drink in a plastic cup and you're all set!Gallo is one of those trendy places to take your date to on a friday night; although I personally was here for luch. We stuck to the tacos, since thats really what I hear all the good things about from them and they did not dissapoint. A bit on the pricey side $3 for a 2 - 3 bite sized taco, if you come on tuesdays I hear they have an all day happy hour. The food was great so I didn't feel too bad spending $25+ on 5 tacos, chips n salsa, and a couple of soft drinks for 2 people. The service was neither amazing nor terrible. I will probably end up here from time to time on tuesdays to get the most ! for my $.I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review.  When I came here a few weeks ago, I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the "too cool to notice you" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer service.Here are the "highlights" of the night:1.  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm.2.  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which was not a problem for us.3.  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore.4.  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity.  Really?!?5.  Menus and water brought to the table.6.  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fiancé, who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order.  During this time, we saw other tables being tended to and waited on.7.  Walked out of the restaurant.  The hostess, servers, and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left. It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fiancé was trying to get someone's attention.  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool, hipster people there that night.  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix.  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life.  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit.People the world over have set aside Sunday as a time to fulfill religious obligations in a church or a temple or whatever. I, too, devote Sunday to a spiritual undertaking of sorts. Brunch: the most important of all Sunday traditions, and Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite houses of worship.I begin my service with a holy communion of mimosas. I reflect on the salvation that the blood of distilled grapes and fresh squeezed flesh of oranges provides to me. Then the divine Huevos Rancheros speaks to me through a chorus of heavenly flavors. The housemade tortillas, perfect blend of cheeses, and spicy tomato sauce brings me to my knees in a prayer of thanksgiving.The saints that staff this wonderful establishment are very helpful and attentive. They are always happy to bring out an additional round of mimosas or to explain any menu item. I will religiously attend brunch at Gallo Blanco because their food is amazing, and the wait is not as bad as other brunch hotspots around downtown.Amen!great happy hour prices. lots of photo ops inside and a great rooftop area for parties.One does not simply walk into Gallo Blanco, the cozy, authentic Mexican restaurant with some twists worth checking out.Learned this the tough way by seating ourselves at the bar...just as we prepared to order some refreshments, we were approached and asked if we had been seated by the hostess."What hostess?"She suddenly appeared at the entrance, where we were promptly unseated...and reseated to the same location in a minute. Please don't make people feel unwelcome. But you didn't come here for my take on the service, you wanna know about the food!I had just a little appetizer, the pork quesadilla. Yay, it was made with a corn tortilla. Yay, the cheese was good. And oh my goodness, the green chile they use is some of the best I've had. Ever. I crave more now. It totally makes up for the pork that was a bit bland. Just the right amount of heat...more than most Mexican places, but not enough to torment spice n00bs. I can already tell their menu has some pretty good stuff.The margarita left a bit to be desired. They're made with Sauza blanco , so I don't understand why they're so stingy with the tequila. The lime pulp at the bottom was a welcome addition, but this drink was too heavy on the sweet, and too easy on the sour. Next time, I'll try the prickly pear...or just go with the (spiked) aguas frescas--the watermelon was freaking delicious!Also, I'd never heard much about this Clarendon Hotel before now. But I've heard there's a roof up here. I don't know if it's part of the bar or not, but it sure would have been groovy, since I was chilling here during the eclipse. I'm honestly intrigued by this place, and will be back.It's hard to say much more after so many people have raved about the place before you, so let's keep it short and sweet. Good food and drink at great prices, served by really gracious staff in a comfortable, casual atmosphere. In a city where good Mexican food is found in abundance, the fare here easily stands above the rest. I'm getting a really strong craving for their tacos and elote  even as I type this review, so I presume there will be yet  another visit to Gallo Blanco real soon.I've been hearing about this place for awhile now and finally tried it out.  The boy and I put our name on the list for the restaurant and decided to venture to the roof top bar while we waited.The pool area is lovely, as is  the lobby.  Neat elevator. Gorgeous view from the roof.  Really nice outdoor bar.  Plus they have Hendricks, so I was set.  The bartenders were super friendly, we had a nice chat and headed back down stairs.We were seated outside and pursed the menus. We shared the chochinita and fish tacos, they were very good.  The boy got the Naco Torta, he enjoyed it.  I had the chilquiles verdes with a side of rice.  The flavors were really good, I just wish there had been more of them.  Easily rectified with a healthy dousing of the provided hot sauce, not love lost here.  Our server was efficient, he kept our waters full and the food came out correctly and on time.  Maybe a little over enthused about correct pronunciation of each dish, but I can handle it.I've had the pleasure to visit this place about three times now, and It hasn't disappointed me at all. Firstly, amazing colors through out the place, such lovely and joyful decor. Secondly, what freakingly amazing tacos!! The cochinita pibil is one of my ultimate faves, with the carne asada very close to a tie!! Thirdly, the cocktails!! Oh my! The muy buena Paloma Cocktail!!! But seriously, this place is great, I cannot emphasize enough how terrific this cafe is.I really adore and admire Gallo's style and taste in food, it's truly amazing, and closer to the actual modern food in Mexico, at least very similar to the South Central style. You won't see the overplayed cheese and beans plate here, no sir!  That's what makes me love them more, how they steer more into the actual True Mexican dishes, with a bit of a slight twist but still about the same in extraordinary flavors.Gallo Blanco is a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that serves up some quality Mexican cuisine.  No Tex Mex here, instead you can find street style tacos, a creative elote, and some pretty good happy hour specials.My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Gallo Blanco is adjacent to the Clarenden hotel, so if it's your first time you might miss it.  Inside you'll find an open and modern space that matches the food perfectly.  There's also plenty of outdoor seating and bright colors everywhere and a bar if you're looking for more than tacos.  1 Star.Service - Our servers were great.  Even though the food took some time to come out, they checked in often.  We sat outside on a cold fall afternoon, but our outdoor heater was out of fuel.  They were kind enough to move a working lamp to accommodate us.  1 Star.Food - Get the elote.  Gallo Blanco serves this up on a whole corn, placing the sour cream and spices on top.  You then strip the corn off directly.  It looks amazing, tastes great, and was a really creative way to serve elote.  I liked it more because it limited the amount of sour cream.  The guacamole was also great.  Fresh, and with pineapples mixed in.  They used big chunks too, and I thought it was great.  They tacos were good not great.  The beef reminds me of Korean bugolgi marinated beef.  It was sweet (which is ok with me).  Shrimp and fish tacos while fresh, weren't any more memorable that other places I've been too.  So while the appetizers were great, our tacos weren't as good.  1 Star. Will I Return? - Yes.  Kids eat free, and they have great happy hour specials.  I'd return for those reasons and the elote/guac.  Gallo Blanco is solid, cool, and definitely worth a return visit.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.
Restaurant l'Academie=We were walking by this place and decided to stop in because of how busy the front patio, which is right on the sidewalk, seemed to be. Glad we did. The prices weren't too bad. We tried the moules frites and snail gnocchi. The mussels were awesome. They were large and plump, not shriveled like at many places. The leftover soup was delicious. You get a large pot of mussels. As for the gnocchi, the snails and mushrooms went together very well. The snail was tender and flavorful. The gnocchi was a bit dense but overall still quite good.
Coronado Cafe=CAN YOU SAY DIRT CHEAP STEAK AND EGGS??!! Yes that's right graveyard special for only 5.95 a nice juicy tender 7oz NY Strip Steak, 2 Eggs however you want them, Fairly cooked Has Browns with Toast and Jelly. I went to vegas for a random adventure Saturday Night but since i was here I wanted to hit up South Point and get the $6 Deal. =D I recommend anyone to this cafe after your inebriated or sober after celebrating the nightlife in wonderful viva las vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!If I was Yelping 3 years ago, I'd be the Duke by a long shot.  When I first moved to Las Vegas in 2011, South Point was my home for the first couple of months.  So that meant a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the Coronado Cafe.  Now that doesn't mean that the Coronado Cafe is a "Must" stop.  It just means that I was too lazy to leave the casino when the belly was calling.  So here's my review...Service:  This really depends on the day, the time, and how busy they are.  I've gotten service as bad as 2 stars and as good as 5 stars.  Ironically, the service is actually better during the weekend nights when they are busy.  Busy here also means a lot more employees working, which means pretty good service. I found longer waits during the quiet morning/afternoons. The Food:  There's something for everyone here. The menu is extensive and there's even Chinese Food.  My Suggestions:  -Eggs:  No one messes up eggs, Coronado doesn't either-Clam Chowder:  Pretty good stuff.  Not New England or Morro Bay good, but good enough that you'll be wanting more.-Porterhouse for $12.99:  Bang for your buck!  This is somewhat dry, so if you're use to a Medium-Well, get a Medium Plus.  -Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Surprisingly, not too bad.  -Asparagus:  Not on the menu, but they'll make it if you request it.  Good stuff!-Salmon:  I've had good and bad salmon here.  But I've had more good than bad.  Nothing really special.  Taste wise it's okay, protein wise it's worth it. -Chicken Parmesan:  Just okay, but worth the try if you're in the mood.  Take my advice, avoid these:-Grilled Halibut Steak:  Flaky just how I like my fish, but it's too dry and really fishy. -Prime Rib:  Taste like cardboard -Any of their salads.  I've never had a fresh one hereOverall, I have to say that the food is just average at best.  However, Coronado fits everyone's budget.  The food is inexpensive and if you're in the casino, the restaurant is convenient. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (495/500)5 Stars for the best Late Night "Steak and Eggs"!  don't even know how many times I've come here the last few years, maybe 100 times?? But their Late Night specials from Midnight-6am are the only reasons I've come here. I do hear great things about their Chinese Food though so I'll have to come back for one of these days. Their Graveyard Specials beat out The Orleans in my opinions since it's a lot fresher and feel like they give you a bit more. Also service is pretty fast. My boyfriend always get the Steak & Eggs $4.95 now (long time ago during recession was around $2.95) and I always get the Sausage & Eggs $3.45 (used to be around $2.95 also). They also offer Biscuits and gravy for $2.95, Pancake Sandwich $3.95, Ham Steak $3.95, and even 1/2 lb Cheeseburger with fries for $3.95! Yummo!  I just don't come here as much since my boyfriend and I cut back big time on meat but we still love coming here once in a while for late night eats after going out :)
Samurai Sam's=I became addicted to this place a couple months ago. I have tried a bite of what others with me have ordered but for me I can't bring myself to order anything other then the "Garlic Chicken Bowl".  I got regular size and it cost $5.99. You can get it served over brown or white rice. I really like their white rice it is cooked perfectly. The chicken has such a great flavor. You can get dark meat or for an additional charge you can get white meat. If you like garlic and you like chicken I absolutely recommend trying this one! My man had the "Spicy Steak Bowl". He got the large size and it cost $7.39. He loved it. I tried a bite and the steak was cooked just right. For $2.99 more you can get double meat. Since we got combo meals it came with a drink and "Grilled Egg Roll". The egg roll was just OK. It wasn't something I would intentionally order on the side. They recently added "Pork Pot Stickers" to the menu. These were very dry and had no flavor. I have noticed they are pretty busy around lunch time. The manager said you can always phone your order in for pick up. I'm sure I will take advantage of that at some point.I really like that they make your food right when you order it so it is fresh. The place is clean inside.Near the soda fountain they have a tray with several sauces that you can help yourself to. They cater and have multiple catering or family style dinners to choose from.
Cafe Mix=I stopped at Cafe Mix for lunch.  For a newer pad site restaurant I was somewhat impressed with the warm atmosphere.  I ordered a Gyro special which came with choice of side.  I went with the Greek salad which was pretty good...fresh, crisp lettuce, nice dressing and authentic kalamata olives.The Gyro itself was good, plenty of meat, tzatziki dressing, lettuce and tomato.The service here was prompt and efficient if not overly friendly.If you're in the McKellips & Greenfield area there are not alot of food choices and I would say this is probably one of the better ones.Please see my glowing of this restaurant on 4/13/2013. So I am on the Eastside for a meeting and in the mood for a good lunch. This place has good food. I walk to the counter, order a shwarma pita and a coke to go. Pay my $9.27 and throw the change into the tip jar. I am told to sit on the to go bench and wait for order. I thought, odd, 3/4 empty restaurant and I have to crowd onto the bench. O well, no biggie. Wait for my order handed the sandwich and I change my mind. Sit down at one of 15 empty tables to eat and the snotty cashier barks at me across the room that next time if I am going to stay I have to order it to stay. I said pardon me, why does it matter, she responds, those are our rules. I state, there will not be a next time. I then place my uneaten sandwich and coke on the counter and walk. One of the managers catches my eye, waves me over. I ask him if I am welcome to eat in his restaurant.   He states that they have rules because of the liquor board. I am stunned by his illogical statement. I was not drinking alcohol, so what does the liquor board have to do with my pita and coke. He offers nothing. I say, ok I understand, turn and leave. Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy Johns to order another lunch (far inferior in quality) stand and wait. Then the snotty cashier shows up and tries to give me ten dollars. I say I do not want the money, she argues. I ask her why she is harassing me. She continues to argue with me. I tell her to leave me alone. Bizarre. A little bit of feedback for the owners. 1. You can not get in trouble with anyone if you are not breaking the law. It is not against the law to eat food out of to go containers in restaurants. 2. The reason your dining room was not packed at noon is because of your lame service. 3. I will never return even though I really dig your food.
Panera Bread=I've been coming here for years, so it's time for an update. Panera is a great place to get to when you want to drink coffee (free refills!) while you suck down some internet and maybe try to get some work done. Quite a lot of tables, many of which do have a power outlet nearby.The "pick two" is the best way to get a variety of flavors and textures for your meal. Choice of a smaller salad, a reasonable bowl of soup and a half of one of their signature sandwiches. But for breakfast, I prefer the toasted everything bagel (you may want to ask them to put it through twice) with cream cheese is a good meal. Especially since the coffee is refillable.During the busy lunch times (11 to 1), the wifi will cut out after a half hour. This is your cue to start tethering your phone. Though if the place is filling up, it's not polite to take up a table and not be eating. Give folks a chance. There are also a couple tables outside in the sun that still reach the wifi (but no power).The kiosk ordering system is great. Skip the line and you can still get your order in and pay. Panera now accepts NFC payments as well from your phone!Tip: If someone is taking up an entire four seat table by themselves and there is no other space, you're perfectly okay to ask if you can share.
ARIA Cafe=One of the best looking cafes in Vegas located in the newest casino on the strip. Unfortunately, for a cafe with a limited menu, it seemed to be overpriced for average food.  For the price of the open-faced Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, it wasn't worth it.  Definitely had better elsewhere for much cheaper.The Chillaquilles didn't look or taste like it should.  The texture was soggy and the flavor was dry.  The complimentary bread with cream cheese-tastin butter was better.  At this point, my cousin just couldn't wait to "walk off the disappointment."The BLT, however, was satisfactory with thick slices of smoked applewood bacon, arugula, and tasty basil sauce.If it wasn't for the BLT, I would've given a one star rating only for the attractive decor and new vibe of this place.Just like my recent meal at Studio Cafe in the MGM Grand, Cafe Vettro really personifies a lot of Vegas dining.  There definitely seems to be nice restaurants in Vegas, but there are just as many restaurants that are below average.  What makes matters worse is that these restaurants can be really bad and still turn a profit.  These restaurants get so much traffic from the casinos that no matter how bad they are, they will always have customers.This 24 hour cafe (located in Aria) is very big.  There is not much to the decor, but it is comfortable.The menu features breakfast (served all day), sandwiches, salads and plates (including fish, beef and pasta).  The sandwiches are priced below $20; the plates go over $20.The complimentary bread was some pretzel bread (with dried fruit).  I do not know if it was purposely served cold, but the bread definitely would have been better if served warm.I went with the barramundi because it did look decent when I saw a waitress carrying it.  The barramundi (kind of like a sea bass) was pan seared and served over fingerling potatoes and garnished with edamame (kind of an odd pairing) and a thin cream sauce.The fish was flaky and moist.  Mine was not as seared as the one I saw.  It was okay.  The veggies and sauce were bland and boring.  Some of the veggies were cold too.  My friends mentioned that some of their food was cold as well.The waitress was trying hard, but the service at Cafe Vettro was not that great.  It took a while to put in the orders as well as to receive the food.  It was hard to flag down a server too because it did not seem like they had enough staff.Cafe Vettro may have some other stuff on the menu that is better, but from what I had, I probably would not give it another shot (maybe I would try it for breakfast).  I think on my next trip to Vegas, I really need to plan out each meal (no matter how small) to avoid having another subpar (and overpriced) meal like the one we had at Cafe Vettro.I was extremely disappointed in this sad excuse for a restaurant, especially because of its location in the gorgeous Aria resort. The decor is absolutely beautiful! The food was mediocre at best. The service was just bad...First of all, my party of FOUR was directed to our table after a few minute wait... There were only THREE chairs and three place settings. We awkwardly stood in the middle of the restaurant until someone carried over another chair from across the room. The fact that they were so unorganized even after keeping us waiting is unacceptable for any restaurant, and very unprofessional.I ordered the late breakfast of two eggs, sausage, and asked what their substitutions were for the hash browns and toast. This seemed a foreign concept, because our waitress had no idea. I asked if they could substitute for cottage cheese, as many other breakfast places do, and she said she'd have to ask the chef. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger minus the bun, and she couldn't perceive that idea either. Most restaurants are willing and able to make substitutions for guests. This restaurant made me feel really uncomfortable even suggesting the idea.After all of this confusion, the service was really slow. It took ten minutes after being seated at our table for the waitress to come around to take our orders. The food itself was sad. My thirteen dollar meal could have been better put together by McDonald's. I tasted my BF's burger. It may have been one of the most unappetizing ground beef patties I've ever tasted. It was overcooked, hard, and bland, except for a chemically smoke taste. My poor honey suffered through that, for $15 no less. My BFF had the biscuits and gravy, and left half of her meal. She NEVER leaves half of her meal. I happened to remember the price of what everyone ordered (probably because it was so high for what you get), which was a good thing, because the price on the menu was not consistent with the charge on the bill. Apparently they recently changed the menus, so the prices increased, but we all ordered off of old menus. Either way, the manager was unhelpful and unapologetic fixing their mistake. That type of attitude is not what I expect in a premier Aria restaurant.Please, Aria... PLEASE clean house in that restaurant and hire competent management, an interested head chef, and well-trained wait staff. The facility is so gorgeous and needs to be appreciated with cuisine complimenting its beauty, not distracting us from the unacceptable service and food.Very solid performance on two separate occasions while on a recent trip to the Aria Resort and Casino. We were able to score some Bloody Mary specials and lord knows I needed them and while we were at it we ordered breakfast. There was no line to speak of to get in and the service was really very good. We were approached immediately after seating and the food was good. For the morning after or if you're just craving steak and eggs, this is a good go-to spot for a good meal and good service.Given how late the clubs/bars close, you'd think the Strip would have tons of choices for late night eats.  Although, the hotels probably figure the late night crowd won't be sober enough to care.  Which, admittedly, isn't the worst bet to make in Vegas...Located at Café Vettro's old spot inside Aria, I can't say if ARIA Café is just their new name or a true replacement.  Either way, it's easily the nicest 24-hour café I've been to in Vegas, with its open space, huge windows, and modern décor.  Service was pretty nice as well, but the kitchen is slow.  Even though it was mostly empty when my buddy and I walked in for a late lunch, it still took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out.Wanting something light yet filling, I ordered the GRILLED CHICKEN CIABATTA, served with Pepper Jack Cheese, Poblano Chilies, Guacamole, Tomatoes, Spicy Mayonnaise, and a side of Fries ($15).  While it sounded great on the menu, the sandwich fell short.  The chicken was okay, but the relative lack of guacamole and mayo, coupled with the thick ciabatta bread, made for a dry, dry sandwich.  I ended up leaving most of the bread behind, but at least the fries weren't bad (a little salty).Although my particular dish wasn't terribly priced, we saw several on the menu that were.  It may be The Strip, but $20 for Beef Fried Rice?  $22 for FIsh n Chips?  Thank goodness for our reseort credit.  ARIA Café might not be bad for breakfast or after clubbing/drinking (The Henry at Cosmo is better), but I'm not sure I can say the same for lunch or dinner.Aria Cafe is the "new" and improved Cafe Vettro.  I really have no idea why they changed the name of this place when everything about this place is exactly the same.  Whatever.Aria Cafe is a 24-hour eatery with your standard eats.  I would only come here for late-night eats!  There's not too many late-night or 24-hour eateries on The Strip.  The food here is on the pricier side.  I had a watermelon juice with my lox and bagel and it fetched me a pretty pricey bill considering nothing I ate had to actually be cooked or warmed.  Regardless, the convenience of having a 24-hour restaurant does work out nicely when you're drunk or tired from clubbing and just need some food to soak up the booze.  Wish the wait staff had more personality but hey, I'd probably be sick and tired of drunks and tourists too!The decor and ambiance does not match the service, staff and food.Wifey and I decided to grab breakfast here since we were staying at the Aria. This is one of the few times I didn't check the Yelp reviews and I should have.First impressions were impeccable, spacious and gorgeous. The architecture was modern, open, sleek and almost looked like a club. It's nicely located in front of the hotel and you have an unobstructed view of the porte-cochere with its large glass windows. However, looks can be deceiving. Most of the people that were working here appeared to be on the verge of retirement and all lack life. What I mean by that is they were moody, slow and grumpy. No one smiled even when they were taking our orders and they were all just going thru the motion like robots or slaves. I guess those are harsh words, but it really felt like the staff came from a nursing home. So I ordered the Steak and Eggs while the Wifey had omelette with a side of coffee for the both of us. The coffee was bland and weak and my Steak and Eggs left a lot to be desired. I've had better at Denny's compared to this place. Wifey's omelette was just so-so. No, we weren't impressed, but what made it memorable for us was Hunter Pence. Yup, this was after they won the 2012 World Series and he was sitting behind us. We got to take a photo with him while I was wearing my Niners' gear. Funny thing was that I was all decked in Giants' gear the previous day. So back to Aria Cafe - you need to up your game, son."It's raw!" - Gordon RamsayI've always wanted to hulk-smash a dish of food and yell that when it comes out raw.  I figured Vegas wasn't the place to do it, already dressed to go out for the night, didn't want to get kicked out of Aria.  Ordered the calamari, chicken sandwich and spinach artichoke dip.  Although chicken and dip were good the calamari was so undercooked it was hard to chew.  I hate throwing away food, but I literally could not shallow that calamari.  Shame, calamari is my Kryptonite too.  If it's on any menu, I'm ordering it don't care if it's Dairy Queen!Bring your shadesIf you eat here for dinner don't forget your sunglasses, it's like going to a vegas pool...without the pool. Actually...don't ever eat here for dinner, its more of a lunch or late night spot.  The sun blares through the glass facade which is an entire side of the restaurant and there aren't any shades on their windows so your S.O.L. Half of the guests were literally wearing sunglasses while eating dinner. Felt like I was at an LMFAO concert. I guess if you're there to check out girls/guys that's a good thing though ;)A typical hotel Cafe. We came here twice while staying at the Aria Hotel Casino.  The Cafe itself looks beautiful. Very modern with large windows throughout the restaurant, thus providing enough natural  lighting for most of the restaurant. The furniture is also modern like with comfortable chairs, quartz table tops, and posh benches around the booths.Now for the food. I thinks it's mediocre at best. The first time I ordered their Deuce Breakfast. It had two of everything such as eggs, toast, sausage, and bacon, pancakes, with my coffee. I thought the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side. The quality and what was served for $16.00 plus my coffee. The food was more on the bland side. Yes, the eggs and my sausage wasn't too good. The bacon was good, but had too much fat in it. The second time there, I ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs. I think that order was $20.00. Again I didn't think it was worth it. Proportion wise was fine. Enough for an individual to be content. However, the whole dish was bland. Tasteless sauce, and flavorless meatballs had me use plenty of salt and Parmesan Cheese for the spaghetti. I finished it only because I was hungry and didn't want to drink alcohol later with an empty stomach.Overall the cafe was a really nice place. The service was decent, while the food took around fifteen minutes. The waiter and waitress kept filling our glass with water and asked if everything was okay. They were nice! But the quality of the food needs to improve. I thought it's a bit pricey for what was served, and especially when its worst than cafeteria food.Anyhow, a great place but mediocre food. It can use an improvement please. Three stars.
San Gabriel Mexican Café=After trying their Salsa, Guacamole and Ceviche at the Yelp Event, I couldn't get it out of my mind, it was so good, so I went to have lunch here today! Let me tell you How Amazing our food was!!! To start I ordered the custom Guacamole, they give you a list of ingredients and you check which ones you would like, I chose everything except onions and word to the wise, do yourself a favor and make sure you get the pomegranates (see pics) WOW OH WOW, that was the Best Guacamole I've ever had, seriously!!! For my entree I decided to order the Acapulco Shrimp Ceviche (see pics) It was Delicious just like it was at the event. I also ordered the Chicken Taquitos (see pics) OMGosh! These were absolutely the highlight of the meal, definitely not what I was expecting and I mean that in the best way possible! Freshly stuffed with shredded chicken and bacon and then rolled and fried to a golden crisp, yet they were so delicate and flavorful. I would go here again and again just to order these babies! My hubby ordered their cheese enchiladas with two fried eggs on top, which they were more than willing to accommodate him with even though it was not on the menu. (Sorry No pics), but he LOVED every bite, only problem was he wished they had been served with a bit more of their tasty charro beans. And despite getting the generous discount card from the event last night (get $15 off $40) We didn't even hit $40 dollars ordering all that! I think their prices are very fair, especially for the quality and amount of food. My only complaint was, the place was still Bombay Spice-ish, decor and music wise. -1 star Please go get some decorations to liven up the place and give it some character along with playing some more fitting music, I'm not talking mariachi or anything but some Island beats would have been better suited than Loungey dance music. **The Food was a definite 5 stars for me though**
Cafe Milano=I visited Cafe Milano tonight solo for a quick dinner before seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Benedum.  I approached the counter and first asked if they had any dinner specials, which they didn't.  In light of that, I attempted to order a mini (6") pie, which the woman behind the counter told me that I didn't want, since it was "retardedly small."  I told her I usually order two slices of pizza, and asked her which size I should get, and she said the small, and maybe even the medium.  "Really?  It's just for me." I said, and proceeded to order a plain small ($8.12 w/ tax).  I'm glad I used my common sense, since I wasn't looking for leftovers since I was going to the show afterward.  Indeed, when the small showed up, it ended up being about twice as much as I usually order.The pizza took about 10 minutes to prepare, and was served piping hot to me at my table by the woman I'd ordered from.  Another odd exchange with her ensued when I asked her for parmesan and oregano, to which she responded they didn't have the latter (what pizza place doesn't have oregano or Italian seasoning?!?), but she could bring me parsley.  In terms of quality, I found the pie resoundingly average, with a sweet, non-crispy crust, a bland sauce, and nondescript cheese.  This pie was on the level of a Mineo's--and that's not a compliment.  However, it was at least filling--which it better have been, given that it contained twice as many slices as I usually eat--so it sustained me through the show without a problem.Overall, I was underwhelmed by my experience at Cafe Milano, despite that I don't exactly have high expectations of pizza parlors.  I was particularly put off by the high-pressure upselling tactics of the woman I dealt with--perhaps the sales techniques of Christos next door are rubbing off on Milano's employees?  In any case, next time I'm looking for a casual, inexpensive pizza slice or pie in the Cultural District, I'll look elsewhere.
McDonald's=This is for Deb:I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink.I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good.The ice in my cup was really, really cold.This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location.yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser?I saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go.Big mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore.Do quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.
The Cheesecake Factory=The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza.   Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.   Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times.   When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes.   Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars.   The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude.   Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee.I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in like three years, so my roommate and I decided to break the three-year-long hiatus and try it out for dinner once again.We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table.They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy). As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness!My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route.Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner.
Bitz-ee Mama's=This was one of those places that I wanted to like, just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerstone of the downtown Glendale scene. I wanted to like this place so much that I didn't write this review based on one visit, nor two, but three strikes you're out!There isn't much that Bitzee Mama's does well. In fact the only redeeming trait might be the salsa (but even that isn't enough to bring me back of my own fruition). The service is "OMG - I CAN FEEL MY HAIR GROWING" slow. The food is nothing memorable - if you even get what you order (once I ordered a cheesesteak and I just got the cheese - I kid you not, no meat). The prices are actually high for what you get - and check your bill because once I was charged $47.38 for a soda and sammie which I actually had to argue about with the manager (I was pretty sure I could take her, but dang that's just not right).Mama's may have been a staple in the past, but her age is showing and she desperately needs a calgon moment!
American Fish=came here for Happy Hour:  $5 on all food from the lounge & bar menu, $7 on selected cocktails, $4 on selected beers, $7 on selected wines by the glass.truffle mac & cheese - so you think Element Cafe (Pasadena,CA) has the best Truffle Mac & Cheese? you haven't tried the one here at American Fish.. it is SOOO delicious! Although it was a tad bit salty, but it was okay because the truffle flavor was so strong that made the whole dish so flavorful. That first bite of my mac & cheese w/ mushroom and peas, a BURST of truffle just waken your taste buds. It was so good that  I had to order seconds for this dish. oysters on the half shell - you get two in one order; the oyster was so fresh! the mignonette & bloody mary granite was perfect for these oysters.tuna tartare - you get two small pieces; in my opinion it was not worth $5. The cut was so small that i can barely taste the freshness of the fish. All i can taste was the sauce they complemented with. It just overpowered the fish.tuna tartare - it was mixed w/ pine nuts, arugula, olives and topped w/ a sunny side-up quail egg. This was pretty good. Although i think the presentation was more worth it than the taste.sea salt baked blue prawns - you get two prawns with uni aioli and pickled cucumbers. This was just okay; nothing special. main lobster corndogs - you get three bite size corndogs. Basically, imagine a corndog, but instead of a hot dog, you find a mashed up of lobster meat that's made into a paste/ ball. Real lobster meat in here, none of that imitation stuff. prime rib sandwich - not your regular sandwich, it was more like a bruschetta. Thin slices of prime ribs were placed on top of a ciabatta topped w/ horseradish, arugula, and tomato. fish & chips - wow, i've never tasted such fresh fish & chips before. The fish just flakes off, the batter was not heavy at all, it was very light. The fries was delicious because they were malted-vinegar french fries! mmmmm!I'd definitely come back for a light snack off from the happy hour menu.If you're reading this review and you see a little box on the top saying they have happy hour with $5 appetizers, I suggest you get your vegas going booty to Michael Mina's American Fish to get their Lobster Corn Dogs, Truffle Mac and Cheese, and their Fish and Chips.  I figured I'd try this place while trying to find a nice restaurant to take my girl out for our 5 year.  Not that we went here but I found this place by visiting Michael Mina's website and saw that they had a happy hour.  Walking up to American Fish in Aria is kind of intimidating.  Not because it's a huge restaurant but because you're surrounded by super classy and expensive looking everything!  We were told we could choose to sit anywhere in the lounge/bar area but were warned that the tables were small.  They knew we were there for the food on happy hour so they suggested (and helped) pushing together 2 tables to fit everything.  Lobster Corn Dogs - said to be the favorite 3 out of 4 people we were there with.  Myself included.   They (I think) mince lobster meat into a 1.5" sausage shape, dip it in corn dog batter, and deep fry it.  The lobster meat is all there with very little filler if any.  Good taste, great texture, and good dipping sauce.Truffle Mac - I tell you, this makes me a Mac Fanboy.  ZOMG SO GOOD!!!!  The perfect, harmonious blend of cheese and truffle oil made us order a second round.  Mainly because my girl loved it so much.  My only complaint is that it is a little salty.Fish and Chips - I was still hungry so I figured I'd fill up on the chips.  Little did I know, I'd be eating perfectly cooked fish with a light batter around it.  The fish and chips both had a hint of malt vinegar which was a VERY nice touch on the chips.  Those three dishes were the ones we said were worth it.  If you like raw oysters, that may be worth it too but they're not my cup of tea.  Everything else (especially the sashimi) on the happy hour menu is just okay.  The mediocrity includes their beer selection.  Anywhere that has PBR for $4 / can is just wrong.  However, those 3 dishes.  Magnifique.American Fish offers a nice little happy hour from 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Sundays through Fridays.  Happy hour offerings include a selection of appetizers for $5.00 each, along with a handful of cocktails, beers and wines coming in at $7.00 each.  Note that the appetizers are small, though!  About two-three bites per appetizier kind of small.  Between two kinda-hungry people we ordered six appetizers and two desserts, so even with happy hour pricing expect each person to pitch in $15-$20 (before drinks).So, you end up here during happy hour, and you're wondering what to order?  Well, whatever you order, be sure to save a tiny bit of room for dessert.  You have to try the cheesecake!  This cheesecake has the softest and creamiest consistency that I've had.  It'll melt in your mouth and make you want to eat the whole thing when no one else is looking.  But that would be mean, so you really should order one piece of cheesecake for each person.  Honestly, it's a hard dessert to willingly share.  As for the rest of the meal:Foie Gras Poppers - These are small.  Like, the diameter of a quarter small.  Tasty, but imagine if you got a cheeseburger the size of a quarter; small bun, small meat, small cheese, right?  How can you distinguish the flavors?  This is actually the first time I've tasted Foie Gras, so I couldn't really tell you how it tasted!  It was good, but I don't know why exactly.Tuna Melt - This was another treat.  For some reason my tastebuds only like tuna if it is sashimi/sushi.  Tuna sandwich, tuna melt...no thank you!  But this tuna melt had some very good white cheddar that mixed with the tuna to make for a delicious sandwich.Shrimp & Grits - It's shrimp!  With grits!  Truffled Mac & Cheese - This was tasty since the truffle had a very pronounced flavor.  Not overbearing, but it had enough presence to give it a pleasant flavor.  None of that, "This taste like regular mac & cheese!" business here!Fish & Chips - It's fish!  And chips!Prime Rib Sandwich - It's not really a sandwich...since the prime rib is sitting on top of a piece of ciabatta bread; not bread on top.  Still, the prime rib was quite tasty.  The horseradish didn't have much kick, if you're into that sort of thing.  I know I am.  Overall American Fish offers a pleasant happy hour.  The drink selection at happy hour pricing is rather limited when compared to their entire cocktail menu (three cocktails, three beers and three wines make up the happy hour selection).  Still, it makes for a nice alternative to a full meal on The Strip.Items selected:2010 Brut CremantBee's KneesCorn Bread, Grilled Garlic Ciabatta, Butter, Olive OilBlack Cod Tostada with Cilantro SlawNew England Lobster Roll with Toasted Parker House Roll and Old Bay ButterMichael's Tomato Soup with Maine Lobster Grilled Cheese and Micro BasilShrimp and Grits, Serrano Ham, Shellfish Broth, Jalapeno CreamSeared Scallop and Foie Gras with Pain Perdu, Candied Fennel, Charred Blackberry ButterGrilled Lion Fish with Yukon Gold Potato Chowder, Steamed Mussels, Pork Belly CroutonsCrawfish Hush PuppiesLobster Whipped PotatoesLemon Pound Cake with Melon Sorbet, Compressed Melon, Blueberry Tapioca with Pop RocksWhite Chocolate Bread Pudding - Caramelized Banana, White Chocolate Ice CreamWarm Beignets with Chocolate Mousse and Lime SugarChocolate Peanut Butter Torte with Salty Caramel Ice Cream, Peanut PralineMascarpone Cheesecake with Huckleberries and Vanilla CrustDouble EspressoHaving made friends with folks in the Mina group and harboring a great respect for the chef himself after many stellar visits to his restaurants in various cities my final dinner prior to becoming an official resident of Las Vegas saw me seated at Aria's American Fish for a self-selected tasting menu based on classics and seasonal specialties, the newly reorganized kitchen working in full view and servers happy to engage in discussions of sourcing, preparation, and approach.  A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.The Service: Our server is very sweet. However, hard to track her down. Only 1 server at the bar area. The Food: HAPPY HOUR MENU ROCKS!!! $5 for all the food. Very nice presentation. BUT... very very very small portion.New England Lobster Roll - GOOD!!! Crispy at the bottom, creamy on the top.Beef Tartare - weird texture, didn't really like itKing Crab Louie - soso, taste like devil eggSeared Scallop - Tasty scallop but wish there is one more pieceValrhona Chocolate Custard - creamy chocolate... yumm!White Chocolate Bread Pudding - THE BEST!Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.
Paris 66=We went here Friday night and had fairly high expectations for Paris 66. I was looking forward to a decent crepe!  We were immediately greeted by one of the owners in the cramped entry. She advised that our wait would be approximately 30 minutes, although she mentioned that she hadn't been in the back for awhile and didn't know what was going on back there. She did take our phone number and said she would called us. Great! We wandered around nearby businesses. Fine. We went back 30 minutes later, being very optimistic. When we arrived, we saw that our position on their notepad, (yes, they have a very sophisticated way of tracking their wait list), had not changed. So, either no one had come in since we were last there, or they had been seating customers as they came in. We were told by a different host that our wait would be just 30 minutes. When we explained that we were told that 30 minutes ago, she became flustered and said we would be seated as soon as possible. So, this time, we decided to wait in the cramped entry next to the glass display case looking at yummy food. Now let me say, they have made great use of the space in these very confined quarters. The kitchen is right inside the front door, (you can see crepes being made outside thru the front window), the chef and cooks are bursting with energy, working at a hectic pace to prepare the orders. They are warm and friendly and greet all the customer. A cash register is also located here, along with the dessert case. Tables are small and packed close together. Walls have a weathered finish, the lighting thru out is ambient, the fixtures are beautiful, all the walls are covered with old fashioned posters, post cards are under glass on the tables. Very nice. The exterior and interior finishes are very, very nice. We were offered a dining room table or a table on the patio. We happily took the patio, the fresh air was very nice after waiting by the kitchen. Not a lot to look at outside, but it's very relaxing there. We got a nice table in the corner next to large pot of flowers. Service was sub par. Our server waffled between her fake accent and Yinzer girl. Okay. We were not offered a beverage. She wasn't well rehearsed on the menu, except to say "we are out of that" twice. We also noticed that she struggled to open the wine of customers that BYOB'ed. Another thing that seemed odd was, mid way thru our dinner, one of the owners came busting out the back door with a table. She placed it in the middle of the patio, a server came out with a high chair, they moved it around a couple times and then customers came outside packing their own meals and then stood around and then decided to find their own chairs. Kinda strange. I ordered La St Germain, a buckwheat crepe with ham & swiss served with a small side salad. I thought it was a bit tough and dry and couldn't eat more than 1/2 of it. Also, it was contained very little ham or swiss, however the salad was nice. BJ had Paris-Brest, a salad served with scallops, shrimp, mussels and pesto. The scallops, (only 2) were well prepared, the shrimp (4) were tiny but well seasoned and the mussels (4) were over cooked and very tough. It was supposed to be served with bread, but none found it's way to our table. BJ also had the carrot & vanilla soup, which was nice. I so wanted a crepe for dessert, but after the savory crepe, I was afraid to try one of the sweets. Instead, we shared an apple tart. It was perfect, served with a bit of creme anglaise. The crust was very flaky, the apples were perfect. Our server gave us spoons to eat the tart, so that was a struggle. I'm sure Paris 66 will do well in Pittsburgh and I wish them well. However, I was not at all impressed with our experience.Well...I really wanted to give Paris 66 another try.  I felt like I'd missed something great here.  All the elements are here.  It's an adorable French bistro.  Cute setting and the menu looks amazing!  Last time I only had a salad so I was ready to go all out.  Great thing was, the lunch menu offered a 3 course meal for $14.99.  It included a coffee or iced tea, choice of soup or salad, 5 different main plates and then a handful of desserts.  Not a bad deal for those who want a taste of it all.  I decided to pick the warm goat cheese salad and Bastille Crepe. We received our ice teas and we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Then one slightly unenthusiastic apology from the waitress saying "something was messed up" with our order. Others beside us kept on ordering and getting food.  An HOUR passed by with no food. We finally had to summon over a manager who apologized and then 10 minutes later the salad appeared. A SALAD. It takes an hour to make a salad? I don't know what really happened... but I know it shouldn't have. It wasn't busy at all. Only three other tables in the dinning room with lots of different servers around. It was really irritating and I was HANGRY (hungry + angry)!We then received our main dishes about 10 minutes after that and my crepe was a total letdown. It was a beautiful looking crepe, but frankly, it tasted like condensed cream of mushroom soup on top of some spinach and a crepe. Plus it was lukewarm. Major fail! Our waitress then starting to do the "save face so that I can still get a tip" act and gave compliment after compliment to us. For all of this, during a lunch that we were EXTREMELY patient with (good thing we didn't have a strict lunch schedule), they comped us a couple macaroons...which in my opinion, there should have been more!  I've worked in the restaurant biz and personally felt for all of that, our meal should have been comped. Worst of all, the manager never even came back over to ask if everything was okay. Poor costumer service. Too bad, I had high hopes.It was Pittsburgh Restaurant week and I was beyond excited to try a few new places.  We booked reservations to two places, one being Paris 66 Bistro  and this was the H's pick.  I checked out their prefixed menu online and thought yea this could be really good.   Parking was tricky, but they have a valet at a very reasonable price of $3.00.  The restaurant is quaint but nicely decorated.  They have white table cloths but cover them with paper I guess to save the effort of changing the linens every few hours.  When I say every few hours I mean that was about the time it took us from start to finish to complete our experience.  Not a positive.After being seated we glanced the prefixed menu, which we had already decided upon and waited.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our waiter finally appeared, not sure what took him so long, but he seemed stressed.  We ordered drinks wine for me French Martini for the H, and immediately put in our order.  I requested the escargot and asked about the Boeuf Bourguignon which was one of the options for the entrée the other was salmon.  Our waiter immediately began pushing this lamb special they were having.  He stated he would not order that and he didn't like it.  Compared it to a well done stew.  Um ok.. I said what about the salmon?  He said that was better than the beef but still not one of his favorites and wouldn't suggest it, but he said the sauce was really good.  What the heck?  He was pushing the regular menu and or the special, even stated the food on the menu was much better than the not so cheap $45.00 prefixed meals.  . We didn't allow this to alter our intentions of ordering off the restaurant week menu but I did decide to go with the salmon over the beef.  We both got the goat cheese salad for the appetizer, H went for the beef regardless of the waiters disdain for it, and I got crème brulee and he chocolate mousse.To the most annoying part. The wait!  We waited for everything!  Our initial drinks took 15 minutes and when done  we waited forever with empty glasses.  The best part is I pushed the glasses to the edge of the table as to be noticed easily as our waiter passed several times, yet he did not stop to address it.  No actually he sped up as to avoid us calling him out as he dashed past our table.  I would have considered them moderately busy, not hustling past tables that are in need of drinks busy!  So we probably waited about 15 minutes before he finally stopped to get us a refill.  The refill process wasn't quick either, and we noticed that the servers made their own drinks.  Hmmm in a management perspective I think this is a bad idea.  But hey if it works for them, which it don't, then oh well.  He brings the drinks and in the process of setting them down he catches the H's on the tacky white paper covering the table cloth and spills a good sip or two of his martini.  The waiter blames the spill on said paper and says the next one's on me.  At least 30 more minutes, and still nothing. We came hungry this wait was excessive.  About 45 minutes in we got some bread and he dropped off a complimentary bowl of zucchini foam, quite tasty.  An hour in and finally my escargot show up.  H wouldn't even consider trying these puppies and good thing cause they were tiny.  They were quite good, but drowned in butter, garlic, and parsley that that was the primary flavor so I can only describe the escargot texture like a portabella.  Again very good, just wonder what they would have tasted like without all the disguisers.    Hour and 15 in, salads show.  I have never waited so long for a side salad, yet it was quite delectable.  The goat cheese mixed with the fresh veggies and delicate dressing made a very well balanced salad.  The problem, it was a small portion so we ate it in less than 5 minutes leaving us hungry and waiting for entrées.  So another 35 minutes pass and they show up.  The H really liked his beef so I am glad the waiter didn't deter his opinion, however it held the same challenge as the previous courses.  Small, tiny, teeny, itsy bitsy.  My meal held a little more bang for your buck.  The salmon was done nicely, though this sauce that was spoken of was hardly apparent.  The rice and asparagus that accompanied the dish were perfectly cooked.  In the course of eating again we were out of drinks and the empty glasses again sat at the edge of the table, where I would learn they would spend the rest of the night since he hustled past plenty of times without stopping.  Our final course desert arrived, Tasty we both enjoyed.So in the end would I go again.  Unfortunately probably not.  The food was quite flavorful, but the portions do not represent the price tag, and being dodged for drinks in the almost 3 hours we were there was frustrating.  I would think that would be a no brainer, hello we want wine and cocktails, we drink more your tip goes up, sadly no.
98 South=9/1898 South is open for business again!  When did this happen?A friend and I stopped in for a drink and checked out the band and two singers for a bit.  I really liked the female singer- she had lovely strong vocals and danced energetically along to the song.  I only heard her sing once, and her other partner sang to the style of Frank Sinatra, my friend's favorite, for the rest of the time we were there.  I decided to try the mojito, while my friend ordered a Miller Light.  The bartender, with big blonde hair and a very ample, um, countenance, handed me my drink after a few minutes and had to ask what my pal was having again.  While she retrieved his bottle from the fridge, I tried the mojito.  I wished I hadn't.  It was VERY HEAVY on the mint syrup.  I'm used to drinks made w/ muddled fresh mint, but if she had used a light hand on the syrup, I probably wouldn't have minded.  I had asked if she'd re-do the drink, and she said "sure," but not w/out showing her dissatisfaction.  She returned w/ two glasses- the revised drink and leftovers from the original, should I "want to have more alcohol."  As she handed him his beer, he gave her his credit card, to which she SHOUTED back a "What do you want to do with this!?"  He was so taken aback, he had repeated the question and almost retorted back an apt response, but decided against it, just to help speed the transaction along.  I'm just glad that my companion enjoyed the jazz accompaniment, bec. I felt so bad he had to pay $12 for that terrible mojito drink, which he had me abandon after taking a photo of it.  Lesson learned: Just like with food menu selections, I should find out how they prepare their drinks.  (I really did think that a nice place like this wouldn't cut corners and use such saccharin-sweet syrups...)---10/16Just received an email from "Iolanda" who wanted to clarify that a.)  98 South only serves Bud Light.  Our bad.  My friend did order a Miller Lite, but did have to settle with a Bud light.b.)  98 South does not use mint syrup- only fresh mint and simple syrup.  Whatever they used, it was very heavy with too-sweet syrup.  So bad was the experience for my friend that he swears never to try another mojito again.  Not even one made by yours truly- ask the people I served at a party months ago... I can make a decent mojito!c.)  She swears her credit card statement went "What do you want me to do with this?  Go shopping?"  Sorry, sweetie, but my friend and I both disagree.  In the end, my friend paid $12 for a lousy drink I had to abandon, and you still received a tip, bec. my friend is still a gentleman.  d.)  Our bartender's name is Iolanda.Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!
Volcano Grille=Been passing by Volcano Grille a lot these days and the Husband and I finally decided to check them out.  (Didn't hurt that they had a gift certificate on restaurant.com either.)  We definitely were surprised with what we got.First off - Volcano Grill is a fast food Japanese restaurant.  Walking in, there's the counter and register right in front of you.  You put your order in and pay first, then grab your condiments and take a seat.  Our food was brought to us in to go containers despite the fact that we were 'dining in'."The Plate" options include your choice of protein (filet mignon, shrimp, wild alaskan salmon, shredded crab, chicken breast, or vegetarian); choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein; choice of cucumber salad or ginger dressing salad; and choice of grilled vegetables or 3 chicken gyozas.  Your price is determined by the protein choice.For the two of us, we choice three plate options.* Filet Mignon Plate with Brown Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and Ginger Dressing Salad ($9.85) - The beef was tasty and the grilled veggies mostly consisted of napa cabbage.  * Shrimp Plate with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Generous with the shrimp and tasty too!  The gyozas were enjoyable as well.  The cucumber salad is a pickled salad.* Wild Alaskan Salmon with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Although it wasn't bad, the salmon was our least favorite.They did get the orders mixed up a bit (wrong side or wrong salad with our protein choice) but we did get everything we wanted.  (Not a big deal since we were sharing, more of a concern if you're picking up for a bunch of different people.)  Although the price says $9.85, I think he may have rang us up for a higher price.  So double check.I also ordered two regular soft drinks ($1.49) but he rang us up for two large ones ($1.79).  Which wasn't a big deal since we were dining in and they have the cool iced tea machine and soda fountain to help yourself to.  In the condiments section, they have a bunch of different 'special' sauce that you can help yourself to.  Ultimately, you don't need them, but they are nice to have.  (Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Sweet Onion Chili, Japanese Salsa, and Spicy Miso)They pride themselves on a menu that has nothing over ten dollars, which is true.  They also offer a cheaper "The Bowl" option, which comes with white rice and grilled vegetables. Overall, the food was good.  It's more of a lunch option, not some place you'd go out for dinner though.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.  This is far from a teppanyaki experience though! 3.5 starsThanks to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place. Wherever my job takes me, when lunch time comes around, I do a search of my bookmarks and Volcano Grille is what came up so off I went!This place is kind of hidden in a small plaza on the corner of Warm Springs Rd and Tenaya. If you are not paying attention, you can easily drive right by it. I guess the plaza they are in is still pretty new because some of the suites are still unoccupied. So I go with the Bento Box. For 3.99 you choose 2 sides from Yakisoba, Fried Rice, White Rice, Brown Rice, Veggies, Gyoza, or Salad. Then you can pick 2 to 3 meat choices each for a charge. Steak is 3.49, Salmon is 3.49, Veggies are 2.49, Chicken is 1.99, and Shrimp is 3.59. I chose double Chicken, Brown Rice, and Salad.Everything I had on my plate was good and you can tell that it just came off the grill. If you want to, there is a Sauce Bar where they have different sauces you can put on or dip your meat in. I recommend that you get a small serving of each in the plastic cups they provide so you can taste each one. That way you can discover what sauces you favor the most and just get more of that. Also, don't be shy to mix any of the sauces. So far my favorite sauces are the sweet garlic and the spicy teriyaki. I mixed those two together and man, I got the best of both worlds in one cup. Service is decent. I was greeted accordingly and was explained the process once I told them I was a first timer. Had to wait for my food a bit but I understand it takes a bit of time to cook it. Of course, if you have lots of people here, it will take a lot longer for your food to get to you.The ambience of the place has a laid back relax and take your time eating kind of feel to it. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs not to mention more outside.Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The only thing that I think could improve would be the meat portions. I doubled my chicken but when I got done, it seemed like I could have eaten more. Other than that, it's a solid 4 stars and woudnt mind eating here whenever im in the area.
Zyggyz=I like burritos.  I like Indian food.  I like ridiculously surreal moments.Zyggy's offers a little bit of all of them.Zyggy's Rolls are like burritos, wrapped in paratha and filled with a variety of meats, or paneer (cheese) or aloo (potatoes).  I couldn't pick, so I went for both paneer AND aloo in one roll.  Because I'm greedy.  And awesome.Now, for the atmosphere.  First off, the old Basil Thai has been painted with nearly neon paint creating some super exotic, fanciful jungletastic cruise.  A woman looking frighteningly like Aishwarya Rai is painted on the wall chatting with a creepy looking guy.  Screeching monkeys and howling tigers are painted on the dim walls as well in bright colors.  Now imagine this space--filled with bluegrass music.  That's right, kinda jungly background, competing against the joys of twangling banjos.  Greatest thing ever.Until you realize your'e being served by super hippie white guys with long blond dreds who are working in a pseudo Indian restaurant and snapping along to bluegrass twangs.  What the hell is this place?Awesome, that's what it is.The food is delicious, spiced to your specifications, and fantastic.  The restaurant is a terrifyingly bizarre mishmash of everything, but it comes together.  So go eat a semi-Indian burrito contraption surrounded by painted monkeys, a Bollywood starlet, and white boy dreds all about.Awesome.
Native Grill & Wings=I'M SO HAPPY FOOTBALL SEASON IS HERE!and i practically live here... at native ny'er.no, i'm not a regular here because this is the best sports bar in town... and no, it's not because they have amazing food or anything.it just happens to be located across the street from where i live, and tragically (yes, tragically) arizona NEVER televises my NINERS or GIANTS games, so i'm forced to set up camp here like some deranged sports lunatic. i can only imagine what the staff thinks of me. i've shown up with my 2 yr old nephew in tow, with out of town friends, my brother, a gaggle of girlfriends, a rowdy group of guy friends, even a date or two. i even stopped in once by myself because i HAD to see the NY jets/eagles preseason game on my lap top. (yes, i bought the Preseason Pass on NFL.com, soooo worth it) i probably could have watched the game on my lap top at home, but didn't want to.so here's my take on their food. it's bar food. it does the job. the wings are too bready, but the beer is always cold. the bartenders are the best of the best. i forget his name, but one of the bartenders is really hilarious. he tells the funniest stories and always remembers exactly what i drink. bonus points for a heavy pour.and the best part... besides that it's cave-like dark and has about a million massive TV's? the arctic-blasting air conditioning! is always turned WAY UP. seriously, on a 112 degree day, it feels like heaven. they do have a nice patio area with misters, but it's still been way too hot to sit out there. perhaps now with the temps dropping and fall approaching, the patio will be a great place to watch games. we'll see.yeah so, if you're ever looking for me and can't seem to find me, odds are i'll be here. at the bar. like some crazed sports chick, clutching my beer and yelling at the TV.ok this review must come to an abrupt end. the patriots/bengals game is starting, i gotta go. GO PATS!
Johnny McGuire's Deli=RATING: I would rate this place a 3.5!WHERE: In Town Square, right next to Blue Martini!WHY: Sandwiches are for OLYMPIANS (ie. There is a sandwich called the olympian), haha.WHAT: So with all the times I have been to Town Square, my family and I decided we were hungry right after we got out of a movie! We debated as to where we would eat and try out, and one of my cousins recommended this place! I'm glad he did, because I this would make it my first time, and I love trying new places! =DI had the Naked Evader sandwich!! This sandwich included grilled pastrami, swiss cheese, and veggies!! It is usually made with mustard, but instead of mustard I wanted to sub it for mayo. So, the downside to this story was I didn't get my order to my liking! BOO! The worker who was taking my order also didn't ask me what size sandwich I wanted! The service was a little closer toward the negative sign.Overall, this place was just goo- not great. It was roughly about $10 for a sandwich, a little pricier than normal. The sandwiches weren't as meaty as I would have expected either.*NOTE: If you do decide that you love the place, if you purchase any of their apparel (shirts are $15, beanies are $12) and wear it, you get 25% off your entire order!
Lin's Grand Buffet=Dined here just this past Saturday evening and well let's just say that this place has officially managed to restore my faith in buffets.Typically I'd never go to a buffet, reflecting on that "tried one, tried em' all" mantra.NOT THE CASE HERE^^^^!My family totally peer pressured us into accompanying them to Lin's Grand Buffet and admittedly after the 4-5 hour drive out from So Cal, ....we were seeing mirages and envisioning Flintstone sized T-bone steaks appearing upon the side of the road...Walked into this place and GOOD GRAVY!!! I became vague and delusional from all of the food choices. There was a bit of a wait but it expired as we simultaneously paid upfront for the meal. Shortly thereafter we were seated and then it went down like four flat tires!!!Picture Ontario Mills Mall (if you're in Southern California) or the Minnesota "Mall of America". There's absolutely no way upon visiting you could ever fathom conquering each and every store within a one day visit.That was my sentiment here. I felt DEFEATED.From the salad bar complete with mussels and shrimp....down to the orange chicken, soups, teriyaki steak....then over to the Mongolian station which sits adjacent a steak preparer, whereas you can request your cut of steak and have it prepared to your liking.This place has EVERRRRYTHING!!!!! Seriously. Californians are getting so reamed....paying more for less. Nothing in So Cal has come close to this place well unless the name is followed by "casino" and even then, you're paying twice as much accompanied by the cost of parking.Hands down, I would definitely be willing to travel completely out of my way to come back here. I had 5 plates of food (and provided a star for each plate, lol) and left stuffed yet ....I still don't feel remotely as if I came close to sampling everything.This place is the TRUTH!
On the Border Mexican Grill & Cantina=I think the only thing I can say I am guilty to like is their empanadas and cheese sauce but how to you eff up fried dough stuffed with meat and some melted cheese?I came because I'm hella bored with the foods around the house that I frequent and we haven't stepped into a On the Border for a while. Big mistake. Look now I can't quite possibly prove that my cousin did not give me a stomach flu the night before with his BBQ, but no one else is sick.  Yes, I wasn't feeling great before eating, but it was mostly related to being hungry. I was in pain a few hours after and was throwing up and riding the porcelain bus so frequently that I wish I had a padded toilet seat. It's day two and I haven't eaten and I'm just sipping on pediatric electrolyte....Slowly, because drinking too much causes severe pains. This place is no bueno!A letter going out to On the Border CEO Clark in todays snail mail.August 21, 2013Stephen V. ClarkChief Executive OfficerOn the Border Corporate Headquarters2201 West Royal LaneSuite 240Irving, TX 75063Mr. Clark.I thought I would write to you today to let you know that I have been a loyal customer of your restaurant chain for many years. When I travel on business and get to my hotel I usually look to see if one of your On the Border restaurants is in the area and at least once a week I will wind up having dinner there or just hang out in the cantina for a while. Most often on business trips I visit your outlet in Kennesaw Georgia where my company is located.When I moved from Connecticut to North Las Vegas in the fall of 2011, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of your restaurants not far away in Centennial (5630 Centennial Center Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89149). I actually found out about this particular On the Border because I received an email from your corporate office regarding a free lunch for Veterans Day or Memorial Day 2012 (I can't recall exactly which one.)And this is where my problems with your organization began and why I will no longer visit your restaurants.1. I went to the Centennial location for the advertised Veterans special; I sat down and asked for the Veterans Day menu and I was summarily told that this particular establishment does not follow corporates advertising and marketing campaigns. I was not pleased, however, I still ate there that day.2. The week of August 4th 2013 I took my son to your restaurant. My son is 3 months shy of his 21st birthday and he is an active duty United States Marine (at the time on leave from Okinawa Japan.) While here in the Las Vegas area, my son has never had an issue sitting in a restaurant cantina or bar as long as he is not consuming alcoholic beverages. On this particular occasion we were going to order lunch while sitting in a booth along the windows as far away from the bar as possible. It was not long before we were summarily kicked out of the cantina into the regular seating area. I was informed that since he is not 21 he couldn't be in the cantina. Well, it was annoying but if that's your corporate policy, I figured we would get over it.3. At least twice a month my wife and I visit this location for Taco Tuesday. The day before my son returned to his Okinawa unit (August 13, 2013), we returned to your Centennial location for $1.25 Taco Tuesday. I walked in the restaurant and mentioned to the manager about what happened the week before, that we could not sit in the cantina, but we wanted Taco Tuesday. He told us he could not serve us Taco Tuesday specials in the main restaurant and that since my son was not 21 and could not go in the cantina, he could not take advantage of the Tuesday special! He wasn't very pleasant about it either.After I gave your manager a piece of my mind, my son and I did an about face and ate at one of your competitors locations down the street (in their cantina no less!)As stated above, I will no longer visit any of your locations, local or otherwise.Sincerely,
Fat Daddy's Down Home Kitchen=While waiting on a phone order of sweet potato fries from Gallagher's yesterday, I discovered a restaurant on the other end of the block sporting a "Grand Opening" banner (where Moe's Southwest Grill used to be).  Yay!  Another venue offering soul food with candied yams on the menu!!  Since none of the employees could answer my food allergy concerns that afternoon, I'd have to call the next morning.Earlier today I was able to get my food issues cleared and decided I'd have a late lunch (or early dinner) of BBQ platter with three meats (choice of beef brisket, chicken on the bone, pulled pork, or rib tips).  I ordered the meats dry since the BBQ had allergens.  Dinners come with two sides and cornbread, so I chose candied yams and brown sugar baked beans and asked that the cornbread be packaged to go.(Before I placed my order, I asked if I could sample the meat since the last time I tried BBQ meats on the dry side, I found them quite tasteless; the cook was more than happy to hand me a sample of the brisket.)Liked the brisket; the meat was so tender and moist and  tasted like a smoky version of corned beef.  The chicken was good, too, but the meat was still red and slightly raw when I sliced into it for a peek underneath.  I showed it to the server who started to say that the chicken is usually served that way, but she took it back for more time in the oven when I asked.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very charred when it was returned to me.  I was able to salvage most of it after scraping the burnt skin off.  While the first two meats were delicious on their own, w/o BBQ sauce, the rib tips did not fare so well.  I liked the texture of the meat, but it definitely could use more complexity. While I was able to determine that the dessert menu (outside source so info on ingredients wasn't easily available) is pretty much off-limits to me, I am not in the least disheartened...  The candied yams and brown sugar baked beans (both made from in-house recipes) were so delectable and sweet, they're almost like dessert, but with added benefits- vitamins, fiber, and protein!  Mmm... LOVED the spices used to flavor the yams.  Yes, there are the usual suspects of butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar, but I detect something else... almond extract!  Go and have a try yourself and see if you can help me detect what these flavors are :)  And the baked beans!  Red peppers and hatch green chilies really make this side dish sing!  Beans, beans, the musical fruit...  Breakfast menu is served all day [steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy (thickened w/ cornstarch), scrambles, and country burritos, to name a few], and lunch and dinner menus [fried chicken and (Belgian) waffles, burgers, wings, BBQ tacos and wraps, sandwiches and po'boys, chicken fried steaks, etc.] start at 11a.  I'm already looking forward to taking my grandmother and cousin here on my next weekend off!Notes to owners/manager:  1.This easily could've been a four-star review, but I thought it poor form to send back a badly-charred chicken.  I didn't think it was wrong of me to send back the bloody leg... (Ring!!  "Hello, Salmonella poisoning, How may I hurt you?") 2. I was told that the addition of sweet potato fries is being considered- please don't take too long to decide Yes! :D (With a good dusting of cinnamon-sugar, please!)3. Please change your font printing on the front and back take-home menu covers.  The current choice (white print on black and superimposed on a white background) is almost illegible.4. Kudos on having DEDICATED fryers for your fried fish (batter contains corn), chicken, and other meats (fried pork chops and chicken fried steaks)!!  Not only do dedicated fryers limit the flavor transfers of these varied meats, but they also benefit your patrons that may have food allergies (fish, spices, and other ingredients).It was a busy and rough day at work and I needed some comfort that only some chicken and greens could provide. I was craving some soul food. I spotted Aileen's write up and rounded up some of my coworkers for some hopefully yummy food. We arrived at the storefront location and immediately noticed the nice decor inside. This is a walk up and order establishment with a very large menu. Be sure to grab a menu and step aside so you can read the whole menu or you might miss something. I finally decided on the chicken and waffle combo and was given a number to sit and wait. I was told that my fried chicken would take a little longer because all their chicken is fried when only when ordered. My friends received their orders and the table was already full of food and my food was still coming! My fried chicken and waffles with a side of collard greens and red beans w/rice arrived. It was a lot of food! I wish it was a lot of AMAZING food, but it wasn't amazing. It was middle of the road, and unremarkable. Now don't get me wrong, sometimes middle of the road is all you need to get the job done at lunchtime! I just wished for a little more spice, zip, and flavor. My fried chicken was freshly fried but the batter was just..batter. My chicken was also rather dry. My red beans and rice were almost bland. I found myself pouring hot sauce on all of my food. I guess I just wasn't wowed. It wasn't poorly made, but it wasn't made with lots of seasoning which I expect from soul food. I would like to give Fat Daddy's another try. I love supporting locally owned business, especially when they're situated among large chains! Looking forward to another look-see!10/09Had an impromptu breakfast here with a friend.  The plan was for me to show him how great a breakfast one could have at The Farm at South Mountain's Morning Glory Cafe, but my car overheated and lost power at 32nd St. and Baseline, so I asked him if he would please find out if "Down Home Kitchen" is still open for business.  Thankfully,  he came back to report that "Fat Daddy's Down Home Kitchen" is still open, but that it was "totally dead in there."  Poor FD.  I told my friend that I wasn't surprised since a few of the people I know that have tried FD's found the prices to be too high for the quality of food offered.  However, we were hungry and circumstances forced us to try having breakfast here.Price-wise, my friend couldn't complain.  He enjoyed his breakfast of scrambled eggs with sausage, bacon, and cheese, although he did accuse me of dragging him to an early grave :(  He wasn't complaining, he said, since he liked grease-spoons,  just sayin' is all :)  Seems like he's better at choosing the better entree (see Joe's Farm Grill), since my biscuits and gravy with extra sausage links, gratis (many thanks to our server, who received a very nice tip!) were among the most undistinctive I've ever tasted, especially after having, for two consecutive mornings, the best biscuit and gravy dish at Scottsdale's Daily Dose!Perhaps next time I'll just order the fail-safe candied yams and brown sugar baked beans...
Festival Buffet=First to Review?I wish someone would have taken the time to save me the trouble..Very small selection, lackluster at best. The fried chicken looked yellow?WTF!They have seafood,BBQ,Mongolian,Chinese,Mexicano,American,Italian and a 6 item salad bar.plus a dessert station.The big attraction is the Mongolian which is made to order-NOT for me.I tried a little of everything and was pretty disappointed but I filled up on eclairs & cheesecake.It beat having to stand in line 2 hrs @ Green Valley Ranch but I wouldn't go out of my way.
Siam Garden=West Charlotte is a bit of a restaurant desert. Off of I-485 this way, there aren't many places to eat. And this is a relatively new strip plaza, so when I pulled over to let Yelp find me a late dinner, I was pleased when this popped up.I chose the fresh spring rolls with shrimp to start. These were prepared very quickly and were pretty good. A nice portion of shrimp in there with a bowl of cold peanut sauce for dipping.But before I'd even manage to dig into a second spring roll, my Pad Thai with chicken arrived. Good texture and plenty of chicken, but the flavor was rather bland. No heat at all.There were a couple of other tables, but they already had their food when I arrived. So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy? Or should I have spoken up?
Market Grille Cafe=Everything here is made fresh onsite by awesomely surly Greek kitchen-studs who mutter "OPA!" with phoned-in enthusiasm whenever someone puts a tip in the jar. But I don't care how surly those motherfuckers are -- they make some BOMB-ASS food!On my visit, I had saganaki (a/k/a flaming fried cheese), lentil soup (!!!) and a pomegranate chicken wrap. Everything was EXCELLENT! My friend also had soup and a gyro platter, and the total was around $45.I will DEFINITELY come here again. Solidly-unpretentious-yet-pleasant atmo, excellent Greek/Mediterranean food, and super-reasonable prices. OPA!!This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!The downside:There is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.The cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.The ultimate self-serve fountain station costs $3.00 per person. The ambiance is nice - no complaints there.For the best experience at Market grille eat here for dinner. Lunch service is more casual and quick with customers ordering at the counter, but dinner consists of table side wait service. Pumpkin fans have to try the pumpkin mushroom soup. Perfect for the cold weather, the smooth, creamy soup has a pronounced pumpkin flavor in this vegetable-based soup. The Greek salad that accompanied my entree was perfect for sharing. The chicken skewer entree comes with one skewer full of moist, well seasoned cubes of chicken and a veggie skewer with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The Greek trio entree was perfect for sampling the spanakopita, moussaka, and pastitsio. The spanakopita was excellent with its flaky layers of pastry covering gooey cheese and spinach. The moussaka showed some great flavors with beef, eggplant and potatoes covered in a béchamel sauce. Rice, typically an afterthought with most dishes, was buttery and soft with a lightness that is all too rare.Dinner prices are affordable, service was friendly and efficient, and the execution of all our dishes was spot on. Market Grille may have made its way into my rotation of inexpensive dinners with one of the best Mediterranean meals I've had lately.
The Bar At Bermuda & St. Rose=Great bar!! This place has it all. The food is seriously good... like seriously delicious. The staff is overflowing with super hot girls that are fun and friendly. Some are a little feisty (I'm talking about you, Staci), but that just makes the place that much more fun. I love coming in here for a quick bite and a few drinks... usually that turns into taking a cab home. Those are the best nights. This bar seems to have a good mix of fun drinkers and quality gaming. There's definitely room for both. I highly recommend the braised pot roast and the jalapeno mashed potatoes. Some seriously good comfort food. The prime rib sandwich is pretty amazing too. So far I've never had something that wasn't delicious. Great atmosphere. I'm not sure if wings are on the menu, but I've ordered them and they were really good. Kudos to the kitchen.
Wazuzu=The asian fusion food at Wazuzu that I ate last night was AMAZING! Off the Wazuzu menu, you can order thai, japanese (sushi), and/or chinese. I am still day-dreaming about the melt-in-your mouth dishes! I went with my cousin, aunt, and uncle on our last night in Vegas... Here's what we loved:- pork potstickers: four big, juicy potstickers with yummy dipping sauce. These were so amazing that we had to get a second order!- thai beef salad: very spicy with great thai flavors. I mostly ate the veggies rather than the beef... this dish tasted SO fresh!- pork & shrimp shumai: four much small pieces; these were a bit too small in my opinion but very good and came in a cute little box- pineapple fried rice: pork, chicken, and prawns served within fried rice served in a pineapple. Most tables seemed to order this as I saw a lot of pineapples going by. Pineapple fried rice is always good but this was the best I've ever had!- bbq platter: tons of chicken, pork, etc in a chinese bbq style with a yummy dipping sauce- salt and pepper prawns: good taste but I would have preferred non-fried prawns (I didn't know these ones would be fried...). The prawns were huge though!- green tea and red tea mochi balls: I LOVE mochi and these were great ones!The prices were a bit high ($10-$14 for appetizers, $13 - $26 for a main) but really very reasonable for Vegas especially for such unbelievable food! The servers were all very nice though not very talkative and the venue overlooking the casino is nice and comfy. I thought that Red 8 at the Wynn was great but Wazuzu at Encore is even better!Highlight here is the crystal dragon. You can't miss the main feature and its beautiful, sleek & shiny and its truly a piece of art. The food is ok and at the end you're left with a large bill. You can get food for a fraction of the price just down the street in Chinatown and it tastes much better. With that said, you are at Encore and nothing is cheap here.When I worked here I would comp everything & that ruined me for life because I was so spoiled. I so miss those days! Now if I'm paying over $20 for a sushi roll it better be amazing. As I said, the food is good but not mind blowing. I've had better sushi, pad thai & bbq buns. If you find yourself at Encore or Wynn, splurge a little more and go to Botero, SW or Wing Lei. Yes these places are pricier but I've never had anything at them that was just good. Society Cafe and La Cave are also good options if you're not interested in splurging even more.The service is great everywhere at these properties and every restaurant; even the casual ones are gorgeous.
Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen=This place was pretty good.  One of those "safe bets" when it comes to pizza restaurants.  Nothing really out of the ordinary, but still much better than any chain.   Of course it's in a strip mall, hello this is Arizona remember.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good, but it ain't no Cibo!Experience all the pretension of California Pizza Kitchen with none of the service or pizza! Seriously, how snooty and obnoxious is it when the drinks section lists only an assortment of bottled waters and Italian sodas, then at the bottom in small print: "If you simply MUST have it, we also carry Cola, Lemon-Lime, and Dr. P." As though they are doing us lowly soft drink partakers a favor by sinking to our level. Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their "cola" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo). We only came here because we won a $50 gift card, and I would never come back. The hostess was nice, but the service ended there. Our server was snippy, looked angry the whole time, screwed up our drinks twice, then snapped at us when we tried to correct her. Our pizza was only barely cut, we mostly had to rip it apart ourselves, and the busboy kept trying to take our plates before we were done and without asking. The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory, but not very good in practice. There were very few options in the way of regular pizza if you didn't want to try one of their many "theme" pizzas (bbq chicken pizza, pasta pizza, enchilada pizza, etc). We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza, which was tough and undercooked, and the "Meaty Meaty" pizza, which was okay, but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza. Overall, it was a free meal, and we left full, but it was uncomfortable, and only moderately tasty. I would certainly not come here again and pay,  given their extraordinary prices (a large and small pizza, two sodas, and a garlic bread appetizer for $52???), mediocre pizza, and lousy service. Definitely skip this place.
Liverpool House=Je dois avouer que Liverpool House a été un deuxième choix, car originalement, c'est au Joe Beef que je voulais aller. Une fois que j'ai réalisé qu'il faut réserver au moins un mois en avance pour Joe Beef, mais que juste à côté il y a ce joli petit resto, créer des mêmes personnes, je me suis dis que ça valait la peine d'essayer. Le résultat a été super et je suis heureuse d'y être allée au lieu.On a essayé d'un peu de tout. La salade de betteraves, l'entrée de calmars farcis de homard, les pétoncles grillés, les côtes levées, le brownie et les beignets à l'érable. Tout était simplement dé-li-cieux! La cuisson était parfaite, les portions généreuses sans être gigantesque, et les saveurs....oh....les saveurs....j'y rêve encore! En plus, le service est l'un des meilleurs que j'ai vu. Pour notre vin, la serveuse nous a même emmenée des bouteilles pour goûter selon ce qu'on a commandé et nos préférences afin que l'on puisse choisir le bon verre. Je n'ai jamais vu ça ailleurs, et c'est  une touche spéciale simple mais extrêmement efficace pour gagner une place spéciale dans mon cœur.
Local Breeze=First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very "breezy" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces. LB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6. I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience! First impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood.4 stars for now because it's not palette and because my food was still hot. 2 huge things that make local breeze pretty damn good. Mimosas are strong so I'm buzzed. I orders a BBQ burger with a side of 2 fried eggs and crafted my own egg burger. Fucking bomb. Should be on the menu.i will continue to give Local Breeze my patronage, but i will say...the first cold plate of food i get, i'm outta there.Moving forward, you will probably be able to find me here every Sunday with my laptop day drinking to my hearts content. They have a fabulous patio with comfortable furniture and a relaxed vibe and one kick-ass mojito. I also REALLY enjoyed the chopped salad (veganized, of course).My only complaint is that it is way too expensive. Hoping that they run some awesome weekend specials so I don't break the bank hanging out!Oooooo just a quick update: BICYCLE DISCOUNT: Be Green! - Ride your bicycle to Local Breeze for Brunch and receive a 10% discount on your entire check.This place holds a lot of sweet sweet memories for me.. first dates, second dates, fun bags, binge drinking after my car got broken into, St. Patty's day pre-gaming.. I love Local Breeze, allow me to count the ways..Its like this.. You walk in, and BAM, you're immediately on vacation. The atmosphere is so super chill, and quite frankly one of the most random places I've ever been to. Fantastic (enormous) patio with cozy chairs next to fire-pits, tiki torches, bag pits, waitresses that seem to constantly be stoned, an owner who tells me that I have a beautiful head, decent breakfast and also a great dinner. Last night we had the filet Mignon and the biggest Caesar salad Ive ever seen in my entire life. I'm not kidding, there was literally 5 pounds of salad on my plate, it was shocking.. I could have fed that psycho Octomoms entire family with my leftovers. Ive had several things here and have never been bummed.. the hummus plate is the jam, a mound of delicious crispy pitas, 3 different types and all of them equally delicious. Burgers are juicy and huge and fn' BOMB. Breakfast is tasty, but slightly overpriced in my book. Full bar included, and who doesn't love that? On top of it all, the parking situation doesn't completely suck.. lots of street parking is available in all directions.Only complaint is this.. one morning I came here and wanted this crazy alcoholic coffee concoction my buddy told me about, its basically 10% coffee and 90% booze.. 4 different kinds of booze, and rather than granting my wish, she told me I was crazy and that the drink would cost roughly $30 because of all the different shots that are in it.. are you effing kidding me? If I EVER pay $30 for a drink it better be some decent Whiskey or there better be gold dust and muscle relaxers flying out of it. Okay, that's a little extreme..  but seriously, I'm not gonna pay that. Now that I really think about it, everything there is a little over priced, but the people and atmosphere totally make up for it.Anyway, I heart Local Breeze, and i'm totally looking forward to making many more memories here. Check it out!What a lovely way to end an amazing weekend. I will definitely be returning, and next time it will be on a Saturday instead of a Sunday so we have time to get our day drink on. (They close at 3pm on Sunday) Best Bloody Mary I've ever had. This is not a typo. Perfection! We only had one because of the very busy day of shopping and dodging Auburn fans that lie ahead but trust that this will be rectified soon. We ordered the Sawmill Gravy with Biscuits and the Vegan Sandwich with fries. Both were incredibly tasty, meaning I ate half of my sandwich and stared longingly at the biscuits and gravy, giving in at the last minute by stealing repeated bites. I'm not vegan, I can do that.The table next to us had some sort of french toast concoction that looked out of this world. (Yes, I was the creeper eye raping your french toast. My apologies.) I'm not a huge fan of sweets, especially at breakfast/brunch time but I'm putting this on the list of things to try. Clearly, a list that will grow along with my waistline. nom nom nom The owner is sweet and greets you in a very genuine way upon entering. Not some 16 year old emo kid that doesn't know how to make eye contact. Score!  The service was a little slow, as mentioned in some other reviews but somehow it just kind of flowed with the laid back feeling of the place. The decor takes shabby chic to a new level and has a very relaxed vibe. Kinda makes you want to smoke a big fatty and drink mimosas all day long. Not that I've ever done that...  Places like this make me happy that I live where I do instead of the dreaded 'burbs'. It's nice to see parts of downtown flourish and I will continue to support these establishments by way of alcoholism and emotional eating. Especially if someone else is picking up the tab. You have earned a way into my heart Local Breeze!Back to my belief that service needs to weigh heaviest on expectations in the "service industry," I've got to share an experience at Local Breeze from a recent visit.  My friend ordered a salad without the bacon, but the kitchen apparently missed this request and made it the normal way.Fair enough.... accidents happen. But as we then tried getting the server's attention to fix the situation, he was less than responsive. Finally, after my friend had picked around at her salad for a while and the rest of us finished our meals, the waiter insisted on bringing a new salad. My friend declined the replacement since it had already taken so long and asked, instead, that it be removed from the check. After much ado from the service staff/manager, this was the agreed upon solution.But when the check came, there was a miscellaneous charge of $6.... That was for the portion of the salad that our friend ate. Serious!?!?!? The restaurant would not back down from this position, so they got our $6 and will not likely get another dime. Ever.Too bad... Local Breeze otherwise seems like a nice place with decent food. If only they were better at being a restaurant, I would fully support them.
Scarpetta=Having been to the OG location in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, my expectations were going to be high!  I've been a fan of Scott ever since I've tried out some of his recipes from Bold Italio.  Whom I refer to as the anti Mario Batali.  Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms. I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.  The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!This restaurant is in a great spot with nice window views of the Bellagio Fountain ,  Hip and Happening for a Upscale Trattoria and based on how packed it  has hit the ground running on the Strip.Scarpetta serves the best bread basket I have ever seen. And I don't say that lightly.I would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.I might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway.__________*I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt. Now I've got nothing.Cutting edge Italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the Cosmo.  Scarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.For starters, raw is best.  The tuna "scusci" is excellent.  The tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  The raw yellowtail dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  Finally the wagyu tartare.  Wow, the use of the hazelnuts and Parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  For pasta, its gotta be the duck and foie gras ravioli.  Other yelpers said they loved it.  It really is good.  The pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.Top mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped veal loin, served with sweetbreads.  The flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.The wine list is very good with a nice balance of Italian wines (not just super Tuscans).  Vintage depth is OK.  Prices are in line with Vegas resorts.Service is very efficient.Overall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.Recommended.A-OK is what Scarpetta was. I was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-Scott Conant. I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.We have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.Let's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.Here is the breakdown:Hamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.Tuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.Polenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.Black Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.Tasting Menu:Fritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.Spaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!Dessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!We tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting MenuThe bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!Overall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.So Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kiddingI think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon requestStracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-PBlack Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oilOne of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? HmmmThe BF and I had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and Scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. I love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. We were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which I happen to like). People said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  I cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the Bellagio show. It defeated the purpose a little bit....STARTERSWe started off with the raved about bread basket. There was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. If I could order that at the lounge I would. There was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. They give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. Caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.ROASTED SEA SCALLOPS- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. It was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. There was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. It was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with marsala reduction - was one I was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. I've had the spaghetti before in LA (and did not weep) and now that I actually know the Scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, I wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. This was tasty, but it was just a bit TOO rich for such a big plate of it.  Some may love a whole heap, but I'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. We're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..ENTREEMEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO - Came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. If came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.BLACK COD - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. It had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. I've always had black cod aka butterfish in a Asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. The BF preferred the Branzino and so did I.DESSERT ZEPPOLE - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. These were rich pillows of heaven. I love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best I've had. Will come back. Just for these. BROWN BUTTER HAZELNUT CAKE - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. I'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. It had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. This was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. Service was decent. There was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. Service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. A little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. I guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. It was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. I see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so I would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...I don't know if I would do a "all out" dinner here again though.The night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. Overall, Scott Conants place is solid for the Strip and I'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend.I *thought* I knew Italian food.  I thought I had pizza and pasta figured out.I was wrong.Thanks to my dinner at Scarpetta, my appreciation for the sophistication of Italian cuisine is vastly more than it used to be.In other words, Scarpetta gave me an education in fine Italian dining that I'll never forget.It all happened on a Sunday night, which was the only night of the week when I could secure a table at Scarpetta -- a restaurant notorious for its difficulty in scoring a reservation.  After walking through the narrow entrance hall on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel, I was greeted by a spacious and elegantly appointed dining room.  I was lucky enough to have a window seat directly overlooking the Bellagio fountains.I quickly received a menu from my kind and gracious server, Giampaolo, and found myself drooling over its mouthwatering options.  While I waited, Giampaolo brought by a breadbasket with sides of citrus-inflused olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese.  The breadbasket was superb -- especially the stromboli with cheese and succulent salami baked inside.I wasn't in the mood for wine, so I started by ordering of their signature cocktails -- a St. Germain/prosecco spritzer.  Sweet and refreshing, it was a lovely start to dinner.For an appetizer, I had the yellowtail crudo.  The raw fish was extremely fresh and beautifully seasoned.  I especially enjoyed that little punch of sea salt that hits you after the rest of the fish is gone.  (Who said that Japanese restaurants have a monopoly on raw fish?)The real show-stopper was the entree -- duck and foie gras ravioli.  I don't claim to be a foie gras expert, but this dish was revelatory.  The ravioli dough was delicate and flavorful.  The duck and foie gras filling could only be described as pure decadence.  The sauce drizzled on top provided a beautiful contrast.  This was one of the top dishes that I've ordered in any restaurant -- ever.After the ravioli, I was too full to order dessert, but Giampaolo was still kind enough to bring over two complementary petit fours -- a cinnamon biscotti cookie and a chocolate truffle.  Both were outstanding.Everything about Scarpetta is outstanding -- from the service, to the ambiance, to the extraordinary food.  If I could, I'd get my culinary education here every day.No words can describe how happy this experience made me. I was in Vegas for a slightly belated celebration of my birthday, and a timely celebration of my friend's. Scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and I am so glad! The restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. The waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything. But who cares about that? The food... it was ridiculous! To begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but Scarpetta bread is next level! There were some regular rolls which were bomb. But there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! I thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but I figured I was hallucinating. Nope! It was phenomenal. The bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. All delicious!So I could have left happy at this point. But my food slayed me. I think I may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. I ordered the Black Fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). Need I say more? It tasted better than it sounds. It was more than worth the $42 it cost. I also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and black cod (also amazing). But lets be real...I won.As a dessert we shared:Bombolone - Basically an italian doughnut. There were five. Two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was BETTER than nutella! Never thought I'd say that. It also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.Amadei Chocolate Cake: The richest most delicious chocolate cake you'll ever have. The inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. It also came with toasted almond gelato. Also heavenly.I implore you to try this restaurant when in Vegas.I was lucky enough to spend a semester studying abroad in Rome and Sicily, it was easily the greatest experience of my life. Ever since I have been on never ending search to find an Italian restaurant that can match the authentic flavors that Italy is famous for.... the search is over, Scarpetta is that restaurant. Squid ink pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, yet it's almost impossible to find on a menu in the states. Scarpetta does it justice. The "black fettuccine" is cooked to perfection and topped with king crab, squid, shrimp, and lobster corral breadcrumbs... ho l'acquolina in bocca. Scarpetta also has the best Italian dessert I have tasted in years. The bomboloni is heavenly. They are nutella filled donuts lightly fried and served with banana gelato. They conjure up memories of sitting on the banks of the Tevere river eating bomboloni and people watching in the Italian sun. La vita è breve, festeggiare con gli amici, l'amore come non c'è domani.Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.While it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic décor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience.On Saturday night we were invited to Scarpetta  for dinner by an old friend. We had dinner reservations at 8:30 pm and it was hard getting into the Cosmopolitan Hotel because of all the traffic. We got seated right next to the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountain. The menu is very simple. We had the following:Softshell crabs             3/5 stars the crabs were extra large. Deep fried and kinda                                                         greasy.Polenta                           5/5 stars off the hook good. excellent must order!Heirloom Tomato Salad 4/5  stars   good fresh and dressed well.Yellowtail sashimi           4/5  stars   4 small thinly slices pieces. Normal sushi fare.Duck Foie Gras Ravioli     4/5 stars OK not the gastronomic orgasm as other yelpers                                                              mentionedSpaghetti                           4/5 stars excellent al dente, Barzano Fish                     5/5 stars best entree' of the night well cooked.Cheese cake                     4/5 stars OK small poker chip sized.Strawberry Souffle'           5/5 stars AMAZING ! light great strawberry flavor with a                                                              dollop of vanilla ice cream. If you can get a seat next to the window over looking the Bellagio Fountain and the Las Vegas Strip the meal is well worth the prices. Service was excellent.Scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  Bellagio Fountains. To get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. Ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. They also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. Starting with the notable wine list, I decided to pair my dinner with a glass of Malbec.Shortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.Our server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail. For our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak.The yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. The duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. The steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. Since we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  The food timing was excellent! I wish I had more room for dessert but I was too full by the end of my meal.Overall, i enjoyed my dining experience at Scarpetta.a bachelorette party visit to scarpetta was by happenchance.  ok, i was wearing sky high heels and since there is no golf cart service to shuffle the ladies around...i canceled the she/morton rezzies for new ones at scarpetta which the group agreed to after checking out all the lovely shoes at the cosmopolitan!  plus who doesn't want to dine in style with housemade pasta?i think the folks here were trained at the school of Le Bernadin since they were on pointe with service.  you aren't supposed to notice how many interactions you actually have but they scored big.  i notice but i'm a foodie fanatic.LOVED that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.  boo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).bread:insert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.appetizers and entrees:- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.wine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  we would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.tip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required.With so many cooking competition shows out there, I've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  Certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others I'm not as familiar with.  Chopped's Scott Conant was one of the latter, but I can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...SCOTT CONANT IS BAD ASS.Although it may not have been the original Scarpetta in NY, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  I'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with The Spence in Atlanta and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.  Honestly, everything we had was terrific.  It's also easy now to see why Scott Conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - Scarpetta's ranks as the best I've had thus far!-- BREAD BASKET...Complimentary(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#hYFt6DlCGHA332ECJChzLQ)Not normally something I would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  That is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  Well played Scott Conant, well played.-- ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS with Morels, Sugar Snap, Watermelon Radish and Pea Froth...$23(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#V_vEStj9d5Uur3sAloUvZA)My friend and I split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  The scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  The pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.-- DUCK FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with a Marsala Reduction...$27(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#rJ2lg-UKLTLOss3CPgcrYQ)Simply fantastic.  I was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  The ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  Although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!-- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI with Brown Butter, Horseradish, and Toasted Breadcrumbs...$26(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#x9WaFDf-qarVghjn7g-iYA)My friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  The pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  The breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.-- STRAWBERRY SOUFFLÉ with a Rhubarb Compote and Vanilla Gelato...$11(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#UUgJpj3_-6a9_rBmpTbrSA)Not to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  I thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the soufflé had a perfect consistency.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that YOU MUST GET THIS.While the meal itself was amazing, I thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  For some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  It seems other Yelpers have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter Christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.Beyond the food and service though, Scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  The dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the Bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#3OL0vvlkTy4YgBuGuBi7cw).  Unfortunate I was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  Scarpetta, I'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to Vegas.  And considering how often I seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.Bravo Scarpetta!!!Amazing view. Flawless service. Scarpetta is one of those restaurants that will sweep you off your feet. The view that you get while dining here is just breathtaking. I could begin by talking about how delicious their appetizers and main courses are but I would rather talk about their desserts. OMG. Their desserts are to die for. Their strawberry souffle is out of this world. It was light and fluffy as souffles should be but not too sweet. Melts in your mouth the second it touches your tongue. Light and slightly sweet...thinking about brings me joy. The vanilla ice cream adds to how amazing devouring this warm delicious souffle was. We also had the coconut panacotta with guava...silky smooth and just so so good !!The Amaedi Chocolate Cake is what every chocolate lover craves when they think of dessert. Warm melted chocolate in every bite with ice cream on the side *-* Please prepare yourself and do not over eat during dinner. You do not want to skip dessert!!*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***Another restaurant that I've wanted to try now marked off the list.  The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.I was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.I was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.For the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.For the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.For dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!Service was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.You know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? Like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? It's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. This describes my dinner experience at Scarpetta, when I delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced black cod. A bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. My lawd. This must be a dream. It's too good to be true!BAM! Snap back to reality. As I used my fork and knife to draw another piece of that tender cod to my mouth, I spotted a thin black line. Hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. Let me tug at it some more. Lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. The hair was embedded in the cod's skin! I politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if I would like to replace the cod with a different dish. I just wanted another cod. I wanted to return to that euphoria I was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when I discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. Like Forrest Gump says, sh** happens. I understand that, but I'm at Scarpetta. This is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in Las Vegas, owned by the famous Chef Scott Conant. It's not something I would expect to happen here. My waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. I totally appreciate these gestures. Yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. I noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. The meat of my second cod looked a tad raw and it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. There goes my foodie high. Womp womp.The kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. I know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod ASAP since my boyfriend already finished his entree. However, I was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. This could have easily been a four or five star review. We asked for a table next to the window and the views of The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains were stunning. So romantic and beautiful. My boyfriend and I started our dinner with the Tuna "Susci" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. This is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. It was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. We couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. It's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. He said it was good but not amazingly tasty. He was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. The complimentary Amedei Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. The chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.It wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. The rest of the items are pretty solid. The view is the best thing Scarpetta has to offer. And maybe that black cod...when it is cooked properly.This is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas food scene. This is not your father's Olive Garden - this is a fine dining Italian food experience. Side note - it's not inexpensive. I'm happy to say that someone else picked up the tab for my visit and encouraged me to order whatever I wanted, so I did.The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant like this - the entire staff is attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  I had some questions about a few of the dishes and my server didn't give me the old, "hang on, let me check" or the bald faced lie.  I started with the creamy polenta mostly because I've never had creamy polenta before. It was good. Not what I expected, but it was quite tasty. An excellent starter.Since I wasn't paying, I ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.Although I was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and I hated to see it go to waste.  Wow - just Wow.Excellent food and service in a beautifully appointed restaurant.  No, it wasn't cheap but it was well worth the price. Note - they also have a gluten free and vegetarian menus.It was pretty much a perfect evening!We celebrated our 11 year anniversary here & not sure why it look so long to get here as we've tried everything at The Cosmo except for this place! Walking in was a little awkward because you go down a very narrow space & pass the bar to get to the beautiful main dining room. It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood, very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture, lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it. The view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana soufflé (AMAZING)!Now for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles, sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...Had a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did.I've been to Scarpetta in Beverly Hills and enjoyed the food there so I was delighted to see another location at the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar. Ordering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.I'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting.Scott Conant's Scarpetta boasts lavish, dimly lit and woody decor, complete with a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains from the Cosmopolitan. Be sure to make a reservation and if there are only 2 of you dining, request to sit by the window. All of the staff are well-trained and highly professional, delivering an upscale dining experience from start to finish. My sister and I came for a quick dinner before the club and didn't want to get too full, so we only indulged in the starter bread and 1 entree each. The bread basket is exquisite and features 1 piece each of Sourdough, Ciabbata, a salami Stromboli, broccoli Stromboli, and another that I cannot remember. It is accompanied by a white wine olive oil, mascarpone butter, and some type of tapenade. I ordered the famous Spaghetti. As far as I know, this dish only contains 3 ingredients. Noodles, tomato sauce, basil. Yes, the noodles were a perfect al-dente with just a little bite to them. Yes the sauce was fresh and light, sticking to each noodle. Was this worth $24? No. For only $2 more (and more deserving of the price tag), my sister went with the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. The ravioli was optimally thin and there was almost no sauce, making the meat the star. It was a rich dish and could easily be shared if you're also getting an appetizer.   I'm happy to have had my Scarpetta experience and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance, but I don't see any need to come back here for the $24 spaghetti, which is why I settled on 4 stars.So after the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon I decided it was time to carb up! Wait, do you do that before you run? My beautiful girlfriend flew into town to join me and Scarpetta was the perfect place to take her for dinner seeing we were staying at the Cosmo and it wasn't too far of a walk for my trashed legs!  I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. Scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! Thanks
Victory's Bar & Grill=Victory's Cafe is a total VICTORY in my book!We popped into Victory's Cafe to grab a quick bite to eat before a movie.  When we got to the host stand, we were greeted with a big hello and a huge smile.  What a great way to start the meal!  We were seated immediately and had our drink order taken within a minute.  The guy who took our drink order was so happy and friendly.  Our server came over to us within another 2 minutes.  She was friendly and welcoming too, as well as good at her job!  Seriously, everyone in the joint must be on happy pills because they were all so nice.  I am just not used to this at most of the local casino cafes.  It is so nice to be around happy people!The menu here is pretty large with a lot of variety.  They also have a lot of different specials going on throughout the week.  The prices were all very reasonable too, especially when you see how much food you get on your plate!  Almost everything was under $10 for a full meal.We went with the Rueben and Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwiches.  Both were awesome!  I'll start with the Rueben.  It was a triple decker style club style sandwich.  It easily had 1/2 a pound of meat alone on the thing!  It was a super duper tasting Rueben and one of the best ones in town that  have tasted.  The Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich was fantastic as well.  It came with a huge fried chicken breast covered in a spicy Buffalo sauce.  The chicken was cooked perfectly!  It was golden brown with the perfect amount of crunch.  DROOL! The Buffalo sauce was just hot enough to make your nose run a little and give you that oh so good burn on your tongue.  I had it with some blue cheese dressing and it sealed the deal on my love of this sandwich! Now for the beauty that is now as a french fry.  The sandwiches could come with all sorts of sides like potato salad, veggies, and of course FRENCH FRIES.  Seriously, is there even a choice when french fries are an option?  Not in my book, baby!  The fries were thing thin style fries with some sort of coating on them, similar to beer batter.  My fries were the definition of perfection!  They were prepared wonderfully, with a slight crunch on the outside with a little bit of fluffiness on the inside.  Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!!!We aren't regulars at the Cannery, but I see us eating here every time we come to this part of town.  Well now that have have relived last night meal, my mouth is watering for my next meal at Victory's Cafe!
China Cafe=The food is usually good but I stopped going there when I found a roach in my food..
Elements Fine Casual Dining & Cocktails=This is easily the best gourmet restaurant near my home.  Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.  Walking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P    My wife got the "Jumbo Shrimp Marnier": shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.I got the "Prince Edward Island Mussels": sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!They don't call the main course "entrees" on their menu.  They're called the "main event".  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy "Macho Man" Savage versus Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.  The osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.  We even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.  Catherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.  I plan on supporting this restaurant more frequently in the future, one martini and mussel at a time.A pleasant and cozy room that seemed to cater to an older (and at least while we were there, douche-free) local crowd.  The tables are too close together to give it a romantic/intimate ambiance and the cushion on my chair kept wiggling and sliding just enough for me to conjure notions of the princess seat-surfing with her dining pea, but overall the place has a very comfortable vibe.We arrived when they opened at 5:00 and found they have a happy hour where you can get $2 off of martinis and appetizers between 5:00 - 6:30 PM at the bar and at a table.  While over 450 martini's selections is libation information overload...for me, we finally decided on the Ginger Lychee & Girl Scout Cookie.  And these are big people martini's at 3 1/2 ounces, complete with apropos garnish...a lychee & a girl scout cookie!Our server, Alex was exceptional from start to finish.  The first clue was his infinite patience as we tried to order a drink through what seemed like a process of studying for a SAT exam coupled with possible wrong multiple choice anxiety.  His service was impeccable; the perfect blend of knowledge and natural and accommodating service, pure perfection.We had:Chicken Pesto Bruschetta - totally delectableKobe Beef Short Rib over Gorgonzola Polenta - even more totally delectableThe Carbo test was a total success, delicious home-baked bread with butter & and the tastiest chutney I have ever had.Chicken Jakarta - Chicken Breast with Fresh Vegetables in a Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce Served over Basmati Rice - YUMLuiguine Elements - Tossed with Andouille Sausage, Caramelized Vidalia Onions, Mushrooms, Demi-Glace - the pasta was a tad soggy and overall a bit bland and disappointing.  There was a free dessert offer via Yelp, which we took almost begrudgingly because we were so stuffed.  We ordered chocolate lava cake (nice, but a bit dry) and they brought us a complimentary sample of Crème brûlée (absolutely outstanding, totally phenomenal ).We will be back!Superior quality menu, superior martini selection, superior staff.The owners (Catherine and Jose Luis) and staff deliver a dramaticly-flavorful culinary experience. There are several notable attributes of this restaurant that earn 5-stars: consistency, nuance, care of presentation, portion size (as in "just right!"), and a focus on individual attention to everything they do. Attention to detail, attention to detail, attention to detail. Plus, these folks have a wonderful success story on their website of how they came to be such a wonderful restaurant.I have been visiting Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar since just after they first opened four years ago in 2009 (back when they only had about 300 martinis on the menu, now it's over 450 and counting). The dinner menu has been perfected and has been delivered perfectly every time. "Sea Bass Ponzu" is a favorite, as is "Mini Osso Bucco", the "Goat Cheese Salad", Jose Luis's chutney with freshly-baked bread... the New York Strip is high-quality.I have brought some very important people to me to this restaurant, as I can depend on a wonderful experience every time. Catherine makes her own desserts ...Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, Strüdel, the molten chocolate cake.. everything I've had is fantastic. Chef Jose Luis is the mastermind in the kitchen.Full bar available. Seating is limited, reservations are a "really good idea". This is important to remember: this is not a mass-production, cookie-cutter place. This is a small group of highly dedicated people trying to deliver the highest quality experience. "Cozy" is a good adjective to describe this restaurant and bar. Happy Hour specials. And though I never seem to get the opportunity to visit as often as I'd like, I'm greeted like I'm family every time.It's nice to be part of a community. Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar welcomes me as part of the community. 5-stars is as good as it gets. Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar is as good as it gets.Wow, I'm so sad to write this update. I was a regular here, Jose Luis & Kathryn were amazing. I had a bad feeling when they sold to new owners, the food may go downhill. The new owners did make some changes, they are now open for brunch on the weekends, and they stay open later. We went for Sunday brunch today, the menu looked decent, I ordered chicken & waffles on a recommendation. When they came out, it literally looked like Eggo waffles with two chicken fingers laid on top. I was hoping it tastes better than it looked. Nope. It tasted exactly the way it looked. I tried my best to eat it, but it was really bad. The server ended up taking it off the bill for me because she felt bad. You can definitely tell that the kitchen is being run by a cook who came from running some shit holes downtown (Hennesey's and Mickey Finnz). The only thing I can hope is that Kevin, my favorite bartender doesn't leave. He makes amazing cocktails. I guess I can't go there to eat anymore.What a shame. I would have given this place 6 stars with the old owners José Luis & Catherine. Bread came out cold, with a subpar marmalade. That doesn't set the tone right for dinner, however I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. I heard the "Chef's special" described, without mention of any price & I opted for the lobster ravioli. I was assured it would be a good choice from the server. My Partner in Crime ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. Food comes out... Disappointed already with the outrageously small portions relative to the price (the lobster ravioli was roughly $22 & the sea bass was $32). So, as the dish is laid out in front of me, I'm thinking, "this better explode with flavor in my mouth." It didn't. The lobster ravioli was okay, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. The Chilean sea bass wasn't good either. A bit dry and flavorless. Chilean sea bass is typically an excellent choice, but the sauce that accompanied this dish wasn't anything to write home about. Lastly, the wonderful and passion derived dessert program Catherine created is gone. No more chefs tasting option nor are the wonderful made-from-scratch creations. They don't even have a dessert menu. Me and the PIC ended up going to grimaldis for their cheesecake. This place gets 2 stars only because of the new "martini flights" they offer. I had been here about three times before they switched owners. Sadly, I won't be back. Check came out to $90 (including 20% tip) and the experience was nothing special. I will still continue to support local & small businesses whenever possible (& when it's warranted).I lovED this place so much, I forwardED their 20% off promotion for lunch to my whole department, I strongly recommendED all my friends, family, and clients this place, that's why I have to write this review.I came to this place for Happy Hours and dinners. Always a pleasure especially the dinner on Thursday, 12/26/2013. The holiday special: Surf and Turf (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs) and lemon base seasoning sea bass WERE phenomenon!!  I therefore took my friend who loves fish and seafood here tonight and ordered the same things. I called before we arrived to make sure they still serve (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs). Before I ordered, I confirmed with our server, Barry, for the sea bass. Barry told us sea bass is always on the menu.I hate to say that, but the fish was chewy and definitely not sea bass. I showed Barry the picture I took last time as I am a Yelper and never skip the picture of good food. Barry was not attentive and told me next time just to show the picture first and the kitchen will make the same fish. -- If it's a dish always on the menu, why do the costumers need to show the picture to make sure getting the same food and quality??The disaster hasn't ended. The steak was way too raw that we didn't even finish a quarter. The king crabs were warm in most of part but with dry and FROZEN part. Our server, Barry, only had 3 tables at that time, and he spent 98% of his attention on one person of one of these 3 tables. After I reflected him about the fish and showed him the picture and after he witnessed the untouched steak, he just avoided my table!! Barry apparently doesn't care about the clients like the previous servers I met here before.The only right thing for tonight is the food runner, RIGO, who is awesome, professional, and much more attentive than Barry. RIGO greeted every table he served, made sure the guests were satisfied, and RIGO was the only person who asked us about the untouched steak. -- Thumb up for RIGO!!  I am not going back to this place no matter how much I lovED it when there is no consistency of food and welcoming service. I have better way to spend my $100 + bills.I'm honestly shocked at all the positive reviews here.   Came about a year ago and had a good experience and thought I'd bring the husband and some friends this time.    We sat for twenty five minutes with NO acknowledgement. According to the menu there are new owners. Message to the new owners: in a half full restaurant your size, the waitress should be over to greet within two minutes .  We stared, we waved and got nothing.  Left without even getting water.I have eaten here before it was pretty good but after watching the owner be a jacka$$ on Hungry investors I won't return ever. You don't ask someone for help then think your a god and treat them like crap when they are trying to invest.This has been a bookmarked place for over a year and I finally got around to trying Elements last night.  I had an early show on the Strip, so we went a 4 PM when they satarted dinner service.  I had made a reservation using their website and our table with menus was waiting when we arrived.  Our server was Mimi and she soon brought us iced teas as we studied the menu.  Bread service came quickly and there were three choices.  I did have to ask for butter.I ordered Jakarta chicken for myself and my wife ordered the vegetable pasta. We started with a bowl of tomato basil soup that was very tasty.  The tomato was very rich and had a flavor that was unlike most tomato soups.  I would go back for some more soup.Our main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green sautéed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.The options for dessert were limited.  I opted for the carrot cake and my wife got the chocolate brownie cheesecake.  Standard desserts but very good and a nice way to end the meal.Another Groupon successfully used and a fine meal.Superior quality, superior food, superior ambience. As the ownership has changed through the years, so has the menu. And the drink list has been complemented by some of my own original creations (Proud Orange, Frothy Apple, The Dancer, Katie's Citrus Kick, Kayleeburst, and the best of all: Man O' Th' World).  I will forever cherish my experiences at Elements and return as often as I can. This is a perfect place to enjoy happy hour ( 5-7pm everyday, even Martini Mondays $5 any martini) and Sunday Brunch.You will enjoy this unique, intimate, satisfying venue.Came here for Lisa H's birthday brunch- group of 10 was helped by server Rigo. We made reservations and they were not busy, but that they only staffed one server for Sunday brunch. Rigo was managing four tables in addition to our 10-person party! Menu for brunch is limited, and made more limited by their waffle maker being broken. Many at the table opted for the breakfast burrito or the benedict (available with filet, crab, or salmon), but I chose the BRIE GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO SOUP. Menu description states the sandwich includes tomato, but I received only a generous amount of cheese resulting in a basic and one-note sandwich of just cheese and bread. The tomato soup was sweet, oily, and rich, did not necessarily pair well with the sandwich. Highly suggest adding a side salad (a Caesar is $7 and huge) to cut the richness.  Of the three people who opted for the breakfast burrito, only one ate more than half, which I found noteworthy.The main appeal for brunch is their $10 bottomless Mimosa or Bloody Mary deal, with mandatory entrée purchase. They have a full bar and patio seating. Found it odd that the black linen table clothes are covered by butcher paper? Not sure what aesthetic they're going for. Interior is smaller than exterior of corner space suggests.After what seems like yet another ownership change I revisited Elements for brunch. I didn't partake in the mimosas or Bloody Marys and stuck with brunch items. The food was ok. There is not a lot of variety on their menu and I was fairly happy with my bagel sandwich. It was basic but decently priced. The rest of the food was not memorable either. The prime rib was drenched in sauce and no one in my party left blown away by the dining experience. They have live entertainment and the service was friendly and more attentive than on my last visit. Despite its convenient location I don't see myself making this a regular on the brunch rotation.
Garcia's=The Mr. wanted enchiladas, we were in the area, I agreed to try this place out, neither of us had ever been.He proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told, everything is pre-made with onions!...WTF!! I wanted to leave but he decided to try the Fajitas, I got a tostada and tortilla soup. Not even picture worthy. Tasted like premade crap, and La Victoria canned beans!SO let's just play a fun game with the name here:Sounds Like: Garcia'sBARFcia'sGROSScia'sDiarrhea'sI think you get the picture.......I would not recommend going here...
Posh Improvisational Cuisine=Posh is one of the coolest restaurants I have experienced.  The menu consists of all the protein they have available that day and you get to mark off what you do not like.  The number of courses depends on how much you would like to spend.  This place is so fun because you really have no idea what you are going to get.  I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place.WOW. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We went early Friday night and each got 4 courses with wine pairings. You get a small menu with a list of proteins. You mark off what you don't want to try and list any dislikes or allergies. You know I had to put down that I don't like corn. I went with the chef's choice and Mike went with the carnivore selection. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. The meat, seasonings, broths, and vegetables were all divine. We had heirloom tomatoes, duck with green beans and squash, baby octopus with snap peas, kobe beef with artichokes, and kangaroo with fingerling potatoes and shitake mushrooms. Sorry, if I can't remember exactly what was in the meals, as I was too busy devouring every bite. And why didn't anyone ever tell me that kangaroos where so tasty? I pretty much licked everything off both of our plates. Dessert was also very yummy. I had a chocolate pate. I don't remember what Mike had as he had finished before I had a chance to get a second bite. The entire staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar and chatted with Josh, Zac and the amusing Kirby. It was fun watching them make all the dishes. This was such a great dining experience. The lollipop at the end of our meal and cookies to take home were a special treat. I'm sure Mike is already regretting bringing me here because it's not a cheap meal and I want to come back. You have to try this place. You can find complimentary valet parking off the garage at Rancho Vista Dr.While getting new gear for this year's Native American Recognition Days Banquet at the Scottsdale Mall some friends and I suddenly got hungry - we kept trying to tigure out what to eat when I broke out my cell and texted KGB (542542) and asked "I'm at the mall in Scottsdale, AZ. Where is a unique yet nice place to have dinner near here?" Moments later I had my answer "Posh. How do we describe Posh? with two words: Improvisational Cuisine". We were hooked!I, the ever knowing yelper (yelpita to Thomas S.) have already heard of Posh and threw it on my list of places to try... became uber excited and lead the way. the parking is kind of odd just follow the signs from the road! And valet is free!! YAY!! We would've used it but the guy wasn' there!We were met by our uber cute server (dang! Forgot his name sorry!) and chose to dine at the counter. They liked it but the chairs were a lil uncomfortable for me. I kept almost falling the whole meal.I sampled a few wines and chose the rose` for a pre-meal drink. The "quiz" before the meal was different. I'm sure other reviews explain the Posh concept - in a nutshell: there was a short list of protiens, diners are asked to cross out anything they DO NOT want to dine on & then list ingredients they do NOT like or are allergic to and based on your answers - your meal is formulated improvisationally (is that even a word?) We chose the 5 course meal with wine (except for our DD) I said that I wasn't feeling the frogslegs and that I was down for anything including throwing an extra $15 for frois gras.After we turned in our surveys, the chef came and spoke to us. I mentioned his use of White Tepary Beans. Tepary Beans are a staple in our culture and its surprising to hear about it being used in haute cuisine. Turns out he purchases his beans from TOCA (Tohono O'odham Community Action)'s farms which funds cultural activities for the Tohono O'odham Nation... tiiiight! On to the food...There were three of us dining and that'd be 15 dishes!! soooo for this review, I'm only going to be describing my meal.First was an amuse bouche of Lychee in a light oily sauce. Very good, nice and slightly sweet but a good start. Next came a salad made of cabbage & wild boar bacon (that was marinated over night in DUCK FAT!). The salad was good, small but overwhelmingly flavored with onions. I wrote on my survey that I DETESTED raw and strong onion flavor... so why serve me an onion filled dish?! It was good, which is why I didn't send it back but after a while I couldn't hang and ended up not finishing it; but I LOVED my friend's popcorn soup! the BEST way I can describe it is: imagine watering down grits with chicken broth & adding popcorn as a garnish. Course 2 was a lightly fried fluke with sauteed baby bok choi. Very good - extremely light. The wine paired with it was ah-mazing! The panko coating was a little too oily but the fluke was still great! I would have like to have seen it be oil poached. My friend had a stuffed quail that was better than Thanksgiving dinner!! I couldn't believe it was so good, I wanted to switch plates!3rd course was the frois gras... the apex of a great meal. wonderfully seared and served cold... it was my first experience with frois gras... and it was sweet & delicious. It was paired with a sliced strawberry, spun sugar and a light sauce. ITs paired wine was the sweetest I ever had and complimented the dish perfectly.4th was pan roasted lamb with some kind of greens. This was a little disappointing. As my friend and i recieved the same dish! WTF? Half the fun of this place should be that everyone at the table recieves something different! I asked my meat to be cooked to medium and this was medium-well (boo!) the sous chef even commented saying that the doneness of the lamb made him cry on the inside... I was like "uhhhhh - then why did you over cook it?!" The dish was good, the lamb tender and the greens nicely flavored, kind of heavy on the bacon/pork fat flavor.Finally dessert. A chocolate pate` with more spun sugar and blackberry sauce finished my meal. Imagine taking a chocolate truffle and striping it of its semi-soft chocolate coating and forming its insides into a baby triangle and u'd have my pate`! As we were playing Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock (shout-out to all The Big Bang fans!) over the bill we were given flash frozen lemon custard lollipops (yummy!) and a small bag of cookies and brittle as parting gifts. They were great to nosh on during the giggle-filled ride home. Over all - the meal cost over a $100 a person & was VERY good, there might have been a few errors here & there but we still left buzzed & satisified! To my yelpers I say: Its a pretty penny and the add-ons do add-up but if you're looking for an amazing meal & have cash to spare give Posh a try. Just be sure to sit at the counter for the ultimate foodie experience!My, OH-My!This was my first visit to Posh and I can not wait to return. From the ambiance, service and cuisine this was a stellar experience.Nestled in a condominium complex, this wonderful 26 seat food bar gives front row viewing to the complex culinary skills of the kitchen staff. With additional table seating if that's your preference.We were greeted warmly and seated at the food bar. After completing the questionnaire regarding allergies and preferences, we ordered the five course plus the foie gras supplement and included the wine pairing. Each serving was presented to the two of us precisely at the same time then described in detail. The dining experience started with an amuse bush of persimmon salad. Then I was served a lovely salad that combined blood orange, avocado, chocolate, hazelnut and watercress into an amazing combination of flavors. Next was the perfectly cooked scallop with mustard, chanterelles, shallots and thyme. The third course was the foie gras that was a visually stunning presentation as well as being delectable. This was followed by confit of wild boar bacon, duck crackling with maple glaze on a butternut puree. A selection of cheeses was served as the fifth course that mingled creamy and savory flavors.  A clever twist of a snicker bar made of a chocolate pate with cognac caramel sauce was the finale.This was an extraordinary experience and I look forward to returning. Thanks to chef Josh Hebert and the entire staff at Posh!I was indeed intrigued by the idea of Posh Improvisational Cuisine... and although I'd been wanting to try it for awhile, I waited for a special occasion to do so.  I finally made it to Posh last week for Jared's birthday!  (And yes, I selfishly chose the restaurant since I wanted to try it!)It was me, Jared, our friend Larry G who was visiting from Jersey, and my brother met us a bit later... we took both Joel L's recommendation and that of "Josh from Posh," who called back to confirm our reservation, and we sat at the bar.  The experience was more than just a meal... it was foodie heaven, entertainment, and like nothing we'd ever experienced before!  We were there for several hours and the time flew by... in that time, we laughed a lot, got to know the extremely attentive staff, ate our fair share of 7+ courses each, and drank some of us drank a glass of wine to go with each course...I started taking notes of the courses as they came out, but Jonathan, one of our servers, insisted that they could email me a description of what I ate after the fact instead, so I took him up on it!  Here it is:Amuse Bouche:  cucumber caviar with pickled grape, (everyone had this)1st:  Belgian endive, blood orange vinaigrette, goat cheese and candied pine nuts2nd:  Shrimp chorizo, kimchee broth, baby bok choy and shaved fennel3rd:  Atlantic fluke, sesame oyster aioli, roated fingerling potatoes and mustard greens4th:  Foie gras torchon brulee, fig consomme, spun sugar and duck cracklings5th:  Sonoma duck breast, soy ponzu gelee, oyster mushrooms and carrot coulis6th: Roasted venison loin, ginger cucumber salsa, pommes anna and carmelized shallots7th:  trio of cheeses, Tomme de savoie, robiola, humbotl fog(everyone had this) Yes, I ate all of the above in one sitting and then some!  I also tasted several of the other courses that my dining companions had including Jared's 2nd course of Black Cod and his 5th course of Braised short rib... not to mention the various desserts we all shared (Buttermilk panne cotta with fresh fruit, Trio of homemade candy bars, and Honey and Mascarpone tart with ancho chocolate ganache).  They even provided us with little goodie bags of sweet treats for the road.Everything was expertly prepared.  I didn't take a bite of anything I didn't like... even the foie gras was surprisingly tasty although I only took a small bite.  Don't hate me for that, please!We were all beyond impressed with our experience at Posh and although it was a splurge, it was totally worth it for a special occasion.  We'll be back!if i have paid for this meal, i'd be pissed, period!but since i was among work colleagues, i faked my smile, i toasted my glass, i ate my meal in small bites, and filed just a little tiny complaint to our waitress at the end of my meal. Me: "I understand you are a improvisational cuisine restaurant, so you pretty mudh dictate what is being offered to my 4-course meal. yes?"Waitress with smile: "Yes"Me - afraid my colleagues might hear my complaint and judge me as hard-to-please bitch - wispered in my best manner:  "not that i am complaining, but i clearly indicated on my direction list no veggies.  Can you please explain to me why i started up my meal with a salad and ended it with a carrot cake?"Waitress still in smiles:  "I am sorry, we should have paid more attention to it.  Here is some chocolate."suuuuuuure..  and that frigging chocolate bar is something to compensate for my goddamn 4-course $100 bucks meal??!  I have had Salad! some Veggie mixed crap, more veggie mixed beef, and at the end, CARROT cake!  you gotta be effing kidding me!!and let me tell you, that foie gras tasted GAMY!  GAMY!!I have decided, this is the perfect place to bring a much-hated-but-you-can't-say-no-date, storm out and stiff him with the check!The concept at Posh restaurant is "improvisational cuisine". I think of something improvised as being made up on the spot, done without preparation. What an exciting dining experience that would be, albeit fraught with danger for both the chef and the patrons. But don't go to Posh expecting that. The days menu is set long before you arrive and all you get to do is check off on a printed list what proteins you dislike so they won't be served to you. It's disconcerting to be asked to think about food you don't like at the beginning of a meal. Your other decision is how many courses you desire and if you want wine pairings: from $45 per person for 4 courses ($77 with wine) to $110/$165 for a full tasting, which is more than 7 courses.     Our meal started off promisingly. We shared a nice cocktail called a Cosmonade ($9) made with Hangar 1 Citron, Chambord, and lemon. An amuse bouche of papaya sorbet with mint "caviar" was delicious (this tiny spoonful doesn't count as a course).  My first course was an heirloom tomato salad with haricot vert and a few shavings of cheese. With something this simple  the ingredients need to shine, and these did not - the tomato, while ripe, had little flavor, and there was so little cheese it's impact on the dish was negligible. Ken's vichyssoise with chive oil was pleasant enough. For me, the fish course was sea bream with bok choy. The fish skin had been blasted with a propane torch which rendered it beautifully crispy. The Asian-y sauce on the vegetable was pretty salty, a harbinger of things to come. Ken received shrimp (they were called some fancy name) served with gnocchi, baby garlic, and a blastingly peppery aioli. The shrimp had been way overcooked, rendering them rubbery and tasteless.      On to the meat course. Mine was venison served on farro (which is an Italian whole grain), with a rhubarb gastrique. First I took a bite of meat - it was flavorful but tough. Then the farro. I gasped and almost choked. It was that salty. The insipid gastrique was totally overpowered by the other elements of the dish. Ken was kind enough to swap plates with me, and his braised short rib (hardly a seasonal dish) was at least edible, though also oversalted. Interestingly enough it was served with fingerling potatoes, making this the third dish in a row served to Ken that contained potatoes (assuming that the gnocchi had been made with them). When our waitress, cooly professional throughout, asked if we enjoyed this course, we mentioned the salt issue and she said she would inform the kitchen.     Finally, dessert. We were both given chocolate cake, cut into unattractive chunks. Mine topped with cubes of apricot, and Ken's with plum. Neither of these fruits complemented the cake, which contained a distractingly large amount of pepper. The drizzle of chocolate ganache was tasty. At this point we were seriously considering going to Crudo to have dessert since we needed a satisfying conclusion to the evening.Just then our server brought us a complimentary cheese plate, an apology for the salty food. That turned out to be the high point of our experience (along with the amuse bouche). The cheese selection was excellent, and the buttery grilled bread outstanding.But for $130 you'd expect more, wouldn't you?     I strongly suggest that if you want a an exceptional "tasting" experience you should visit Crudo Cafe. You even get to choose the foods you like to eat, not those you don't.This place is amazing! We decided on the 7 course meal without the wine paring. We started with vodka martinis and I asked if they had blue cheese stuffed olives and the waitress said she would make some, fresh! The olives alone were amazing. The best blue cheese I have had in a long time. The courses were all fabulous. I think the wild boar bacon was one of my favorites. I also loved the red cabbage jelly and curry soup. The prawn dish was a little disappointing. The prawns were overcooked and chewy, but that is my only complaint. For dessert we requested something savory as we are not really into sweets. Wow, we made the right decision. They brought us a cheese plate with the best cheese I have ever had on it. There was a Humbolt Fog goat cheese and the star of the dish, Epoisse Du Borgogne. I have never tasted anything like it. The waitress wrote down the cheese names and told me where I could purchase it. I love it here. It is a wonderful experience. We spent 4 hours (we told them there was no rush) a lovely laid back dinner and drinks. Go, savor and fall in love!Never in the history of gastronomy has there been a more clean-cut love-it-or-hate-it dining concept as POSH Improvisational Cuisine. I was literally dragged here by friends who had enough credit left on their cards and who wanted to show me how "out there" Scottsdale could be. POSH is different. Really different. You don't order. You check off a long list of things you like and don't and they concoct something on the fly for you. You'll never know what you are about to be served or what it will cost but you can assume it will be strange and so expensive that you will be able to watch your FICO score drop.This is a place that is trying to be the snootiest restaurant ever while pretending to be a relaxed, friendly environment. I did see some normal people but I saw a lot of the types one sees in North Scottsdale and San Marcos, Ca. You know the type. Those out to impress - mostly themselves by being different. Really different. If art is what you like instead of food, this is the place to be. It is all about presentation and dulcet tones describing what has just been put in front of you. It really is a beautiful presentation, but I have no freakin' idea what it was even after asking for the explanation to be translated "into a language". Descriptions are a lot like a real estate brochure: "Spacious, upscale, beautiful, wonderful, elegant" without any hint of substance. It tasted like tuna that had been marinated in a puddle and hit with some soy sauce. The teepee of veggies that hovered above it was interesting. I didn't know whether to eat it or wrap a tortilla around it and re-enact the night before the battle at the Little Bighorn in miniature. I just don't get or like the concept so perhaps I am being unfair to this hole in the wall on Scottsdale Road in a building that looks like a bombed out munitions factory from Dresden, Germany, circa 1944. People live in that place? It reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". Yeah, big bucks to live above the store. I get it. It's Scottsdale and this is "trendy". Do a foreclosure and resale search of that zip code and you'll see that at least seventy percent of the building is up for sale, often with notations such as "Fully furnished" and "Motivated seller". I bet they're motivated. It all fits with the wannabe nature of POSH and the people it seeks to inculcate.  POSH is a restaurant where only the truly adventurous need apply after checking their credit worthiness. It's a niche restaurant and I'm clearly (and happily) not in that niche. For a totally unique and almost otherworldly dining experience, this is the place. They have NO competition in this area. They are without peer when it comes to originality and invention on a scale beyond comprehension. This is the area where POSH shines. If AZ88 is your thing, this is AZ88 on a combo of crack and meth. I did not care for this place but I am sure the feeling is mutual. While I feel the food merits one star based on goofiness and price, I'm giving POSH two stars just for having the cojones to push out this concept on Scottsdale and not to crack a smile when delivering the check.I find my reaction to Posh similar to Will Ferrell's reaction to Jersey Boys in the criminally overlooked 2010 feature film "The Other Guys". It's not great, it's FANTASTIC. You guys totally undersold it! Wow, what a restaurant.Actually, the basis for that comparison stems from feeling the need to assuage the fear that "I'll pay so much money and won't get enough food". I just bought tickets to see Jersey Boys in Vegas. You know how much the tickets cost? $76/each. More than a 5 courser at Posh PLUS a couple glasses of wine. Jersey boys was about two and a half hours. Five courses at Posh, if you're really enjoying yourself and your company, can easily take that long. The difference is that Jersey Boys does not feed you (well, it does, but in a different way). Point being, going to Posh isn't a meal, going to Posh is an experience. And, in my opinion, it's worth every penny.I've been several times, including taking my Mom when she was in town from Cleveland, Ohio. Needless to say, she freaking loved it. Not that she's an inexperienced diner. She's from New York and considers Mario Batali a God among men, but according to her, dining at Posh was like being a judge on Top Chef. She didn't specify which judge but I'm going to go ahead and veto Padma because she is just unbearable. But I digress.I've been exposed to foods at Posh that I wouldn't have had anywhere else. I don't want to screw up the proper dish descriptions so don't take this too literally but I've had chilled cucumber soup with a lime-chili oil, ahi tuna sashimi with wasabi and soy pearls, mother effin sweet breads (which everyone told me I should mark off but I didn't because I've never had them, and even though I might not necessarily ORDER them, I'm glad I tried them), and of course the creme brulee torched-style foie gras which is quite simply the most decadent thing I've ever eaten. And I've had bacon flavored ice cream. Again, I'm sure I'm butchering these courses but it's from my hazy wine memory and just trust me, they were all good.While I think you would be fine with five courses (it's my typical order..since the first is always a soup or salad and the last is a dessert), more courses is always better. I mean, you're already there. Might as well give them as many opportunities as possible to blow your mind. Trust me, they will.If you haven't gone, you should go. You won't regret it. Same goes for Jersey Boys, but that's a different review.01/05/112.25 stars.Took my cousin for a five-course meal, and I unfortunately must write that I was NOT very impressed.  Yes, I have food allergies, and yes, maybe I should've just thrown caution to the wind that evening*, considering that I was going to spend $60 per person, plus a glass of wine for me, and a 20% tip, but after all the hype, I expected more flavors, more ambience... just something more than the experience I ended up with.  After speaking with our server and asking him if they served grass-fed meats or animals fed an all-natural diet, not commercial grain feed, it was at the kitchen's discretion to stick to serve seafood for me.  I wish I was told what my options were, instead of just the chefs' decision not to serve me red meat at all, or we might've gone elsewhere.  We may have just decided to stay there, who knows?  It would've been very CONSIDERATE of the chefs to have let me make that $150 decision.  I have no complaints about the dishes my cousin received-- they were delicious and nicely-presented, and she enjoyed each and every one, but to pay $60 for five uninspired courses, starting with the salad, to the same type of fish for every course, but with different vegetables, and then just undressed berries for dessert, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g#Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g it was a very disappointing meal for me, which is why I haven't had the inspiration to write about the entire experience till now.  (Probably one of the best decisions I've ever made, for I surely would've ranted a year ago...)When I pass this establishment every time I go to Camelview, I can only shake my head... :(Amuse bouche http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6Kg#bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6KgCousin's salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9A#BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9AMy salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXw#znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXwOne of cousin's dishes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQ#Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQFish course http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndA#keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndAWe each got one of these http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkw#5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkwFrog legs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMw#MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMwAnother fish course.

Well, at least she had a terrific time!  :)I can only give my opinion of their monthly Wednesday late night menu, so take this for what it is; I've not been here for lunch or dinner.Excited to find out about their uber secret, (monthly?) late night ramen gathering, five or six of us decided to make an evening of it. Starting out with one of their Gin cocktails was a delicious decision, and I sipped on it while sharing a couple of items from the menu. I like cabbage and was excited to try out the Okonomiyaki; a grill top  cooked 'pancake' of cabbage, a few other add ins, topped with super tasty sauce, bacon, and a few other items, sans the shrimp cause of an allergy, it is worth ordering again. We shared an ordered a the Goma ramen, pretty tasty, similar to other ramen, but notably better. Unfortunately there were a few hangups with the order, some holier than thou service from the waiter that evening, and issues refilling drinks.After the meal I chatted with the chef for a minute or two, he told me they were thinking about doing their Ramen menu during lunch soon, but I haven't seen it happen just yet. Overall the experience was fun but that was mostly from getting to watch the chef cook and hanging with our friends!Happy Yelping Phoenix.Tuesday Nights at Posh is ramen night, and I joined up with the International Supper Club UYE to try them out! I'm glad the ISC choose the ramen night because I have wanted to try it for months! I went with the Goma , it had bok choy, shishito peppers, scallions, sesame seeds and char-siu pork, it also came with bonito flakes, nori, leeks and bean sprouts, I also added an onsen egg.  The broth had great flavor, the pork was perfectly cooked and tasted so good, next time I will add more to the bowl, and the egg gave it a creamery texture. The noodles were perfect! This was a great bowl of ramen, the only thing next time I will ask for it to be a little bit spicier, the hotter the better for me. I am already craving another bowl of ramen, soo good!Service was great and friendly, and we were a big group and they didn't add on gratuity, so always check our bill and add the tip accordingly. So don't forget Tuesday nights at Posh is ramen night, and it won't break the bank, with a bowl being 12 bucks, because I added the egg it made it 13, but really that's  a steal, it's a huge delish bowl of ramen!Tuesday night ramen night!This place was very busy tonight. We got there shortly before 6pm and although we were seated right away, service was real slow for ramen night.  By the time we left around 7:30pm, i noticed several people were waiting for tables.It's near the Fashion Square Mall, garage parking underground make it easy to visit this resturant. Plenty of sign around, I found this place no time.Ramen has four flavor choice. I went with Goma.  Broth was very close to Japanese miso ramen. I didn't try miso as I was told it taste too much like miso soup miso, not ramen miso.  Shishito peppers distinctive smell was trying to fight against ramen broth, althought they added nice spice but I thought they could have picked different peppers to add spiciness to the soup if they wanted.Noodles were cooked just right, this type of noodles went really good with the broth they had for goma ramen.I added onsen egg for additional $1. They know how to make real onsen tamago. It's jusst soft boild egg but to master the timing and create just right softness and runny yolk, one really need to know how to cook egg right, and they do here.Their chashu was also really good as well. They used good quality pork belly for chashu.I like the decor of this resturant, and clean bathroom is always nice.Rare to have really good ramen in Arizona but this one is really good. Next time I want to try shyoyu flavor.This is mostly based on the ramen and not their other dishes. And ramen is only served like 4 hours a week. However, I think I found the best ramen in Arizona. I say Arizona because the other places in Arizona aren't that great.Posh actually gets it right in flavor, texture and other things. I have had ramen in CA, WA, and even Japan. This place at least creates a ramen that let's you know that they know what they are doing.Is it the best I have ever had? No. But it's pretty darn good. Especially here in the desert. I had the Miso ramen with the onsen egg (it was delicious). The chasui pork was so yummy as well. It melts in your mouth and sort of melts in your chopsticks if you don't hold it right. The flavor of the broth was great. It wasn't watery. You can tell that the flavor is blended into the liquid.I wish the parking structure was easier to find (I parked at Macy's at Fashion Square) and I wish it wasn't so darn expensive. We are talking about a $12 base price! I guess when you have the good stuff and no one can match you in taste, you can raise the prices a little bit.Overall, BEST ramen in Arizona as of right now this moment. 4/19/2015.
Tang's Japanese Restaurant=We had been out and about doing some shopping when lunch crept up on us. My daughter likes to say hi to Bobby (the dog statue) whenever she gets the chance so we decided to pop into Tangs which is right behind this grand statue. The place looks small but has an upstairs area, plenty of seating. Very relaxing environment. The menu is a bit confusing and the items are quite expensive unless you opt for the lunch menu which consists of ramen soups that all look quite similar and not too appetising, in my eyes. My partner got the lunch ramen bowl which had a very tasty broth but literally had 2 super thin slices of pork lunch meat. I got a mish- mash of items to share with my daughter. She ate well but overall quite an expensive meal for not so outstanding flavours or food. In general I would say pretty run of the mill Japanese. Not really that special but will do the job if you are willing to part with a handful of cash.
Buffet At Asia=Never again.  RUDE. RUDE. RUDE.My boyfriend and I came in a half an hour before closing so we already knew not to expect much. We walked in and the ladies at the front counter told us to look inside at the food because they would not be bringing any new food out, which was fair enough. We said it was fine and they gave us a discount which was nice of them since we did not expect them to do so. They quickly showed us to our seats and then we took off to the food. After rushing to bring back our food to the table our server asked us for the receipt and I told her that we paid at the front already but if she wanted my receipt was somewhere in my bag and I would gladly find it for her. I knew all the servers were eager to get out of there, they were all sitting in the back and looking at us so I was looking in my bag in a hurry and it took me a few minutes to find it (it was in the side pocket of course lol). During this whole time she looked at me with a disgusted look and kept talking to her coworkers in Chinese. I swear she was thinking we never paid in the first place. I finally found it and she was like.. 'it says one' and then gave me another disgusted look. I told her it was a discounted price for two meals. Bad communication from front counter to servers I guess. Anyways, the food was pretty good. The sushi was not fresh of course as well as other food but it was closing so I wouldn't mark down for that. All in all, the food was over all, good!It was the servers that really made me upset about this place. When the table next to us all left, one of the servers rushed over to the table, counted the tip of three dollars and threw it back on the table. She shouted to her coworkers 'three dollars' and other words in Chinese and started laughing. Her doing that in front of all her customers was not cool at all.We left in a hurry, since all 15 workers were staring at us hahaha. No 'thank you' or 'good bye'. Weird. LOL whatever.I am writing this review as I am sitting here. James and Sandy are the worse servers I had ever encountered.Food is okay but for $9.20 is still a ripoff. Sushi is warm. Like my boyfriend says if you don't have unagi, you should not serving sushi. How can you serve warm watermelon that tastes funky?Service is by far the worse I had ever experience at any restaurant. my bfs family wanted to switch to a seat where we don't have to bug each other to go in and out. From that,  they moved us all the way to the otherside. They gave us attitude while we moved out drinks and food to the seat without thier assistance.Then when I was done,  they passed back and forth helping everyone next or around us. Now I'm getting an upset tummy.
The Three Sisters=So I have ZERO idea what this space is like when it's not a Fringe venue, but when it's a Fringe venue, it's pure chaos.Purse, freakin' chaos.First off, the outside, which is a giant patio area with a screen for football and rugby matches. Everyone crowds together, especially as it gets later in the day, and things go to hell. At some points, you can't even move from entrance A to door B in the back. Yikes.And then the venues themselves to see shows, small and filled with people. We had to line up at least 15 to 20 minutes before any free show to make sure we can see it, and even then sometimes it wasn't enough.And in the spots, the bars were almost never manned, so you had to go back outside into the chaos to get a drink. Yikes. No thanks. But I will say this: their selection of Fringe shows was top notch and easily some of the best ones we'd seen! What a lineup here. Whoever curated this one deserved a pat on the back.And it is a fun venue. There is so much energy and life here and it's kind of contagious. So know what you're getting into and enjoy it, it's a ride.
TGI Friday's=This location inside the Gold Coast is really cool. The bar area has indoor/outdoor seating and flat screens everywhere you look.It's mostly boothes in the place but plenty of seating so no long wait to be  seated. There is stuff hanging on the walls everywhere from a frankenstein head to a bicycle to random signs.The new menu has smaller portions and just one side but the prices for really cheap for a casino steakhouse.I always get the Jack Daniel's Flat-iron steak cooked medium-rare and they always get it right. 1 point.I learned long ago the ribs are nothing special but the kid isn't picky so he got a 1/2 rack with side for $6!!Sweet potato fries and cajun lime shrimp skewers were right on point as Guy FIeri-would say(his face is plastered all over everything in this place)The service was a little slow and I noticed for others eating there it was a little sloppy. The table next to us had a plate full of ribs brought to their table and left-they didn't order it and when they told the  waiter he picked it up and took it across the room to the other table. GROSS!!!!!!!!I wish I could just get their Jack Daniel's sauce to go then I wouldn't have to spend $50 to get a good steak.The food was just okay on a late Sunday night.  We had the sliders, chicken strips, green bean fries, and buffalo wings.  Didn't care much for the chicken strips though.  They were on the sweet side and breaded too much.  Since it's happy hour all day and night here, all of our dishes/appetizers were half off. Unfortunately our happy hour ended early.  We had a server who was rude and lifeless, not at all happy.  We never saw her smile and she was always rushing.  It really looked like she hated her job....which reflected on our dining experience.
Cartwright's Sonoran Ranch House=When I was told that Cartwrights serves 'game meats', I was worried that it would be the type of place where I would need to avoid making eye contact with taxidermied animal heads mounted on the walls. To my relief, there was neither a buffalo nor elk head in sight to gaze at me accusingly. Instead, the interior reminded me of a rustic and comfortable yet upscale ranch house. I especially liked the ambiance added by the fireplaces within each room. Although they were not lit (hey, it is summer in AZ) I can imagine how welcoming they would be on a chilly evening. Oh, the menu! It had a little bit of everything - seafood, steaks & game, poultry & pasta. It was hard to decide what to choose, since so many things looked good. I went with the salmon prepared Mediterranean style. Wise decision! It was beautiful - pan-roasted with artichokes, leeks, garlic, roasted tomato & spinach, atop pesto-tossed angel hair pasta. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. My friend, more adventurous than I am, chose the buffalo tenderloin. Prepared medium-rare, it came with wild mushrooms and a peppercorn sauce that was beyond good. I had never tried buffalo, and was pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste. Of course, my positive opinion could have been influenced somewhat by the mini-cauldron of mac & pepper-jack cheese... The wine list is impressive, with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes. I have been on an AZ wine run lately, and chose the AZ Stronghold Nachise (a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah). My friend went with the Rutherford Ranch cab (great with the buffalo!), and we were both happy. What a nice way to spend an evening meal. Our server was outstanding - attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable too. I already know what I want to try next - filet mignon and the S'Mores dessert are calling to me!I really do love this cozy steakhouse! First of all, I love Cave Creek. It's got cowboy charm and fun everywhere you turn. Whether it's live bull riding, eclectic shopping or simply setting up shop at a coffee shop, the town has character. Cartwright's falls into this category of character and charm. It's a fine dining steakhouse that welcomes "cowboy couture" complete with wranglers and a cowboy hat. Walking in, I was welcomed by the wooden beams and old Arizona charm. You would never expect such character inside, by looking at the restaurant from the outside. Now on to the food, oh the food! I ordered the steak sandwich which melted in my mouth! It was tender perfection at its finest. The sandwich is open face with a steak smothered in blue cheese placed on top and complete with a big onion ring. Every bite was better than the next. I am the first to admit that I gobbled up every bite and didn't look back. Before the sandwich, I had the tomato and mozzarella salad which was a fresh way to start the meal. The tomatoes tasted like they were straight from the garden and accompanied the fresh mozzarella perfectly. We ended our feast with my favorite type of dessert...the s'mores! However, these aren't your typical s'mores. These are s'mores with a culinary kick! They came in a skillet pot with a chocolate souffle at the bottom and marshmallow on the top. The server then lit the marshmallow on fire and let it sit until it was burned enough for us. Once we were ready, we blew out the flame and consumed the delicious dessert. Order this dessert. It's sinfully amazing and I continue to dream about this dessert until the next time I get to visit.I still love it here but I found out tonight that they changed their menu and they have removed their steak sandwich. I'm heartbroken because I love this sandwich and hope they bring it back! Their food is still amazing though and I love their atmosphere.
La Brioche True Food=La Brioche is something that must be tried, but they have some big flaws and it's not something everyone will like.First off, they have the best Croissant ever made.  Period.  I've been to the "actual" La Brioche in France, and I still like the Croissants here better than anywhere else, so that's saying a lot.  The Chocolate Croissants are equally as good, so don't skimp when you go there.  The Croissant has a nice hard shell (not hard like stale bread, good hard), and a creamy-butter taste that you'll be longing for after you leave.  Plus, almost zero flakiness like most other quality Croissant makers.Secondly, the restaurant itself is fairly new (they used to have a small bakery down the street), and they did a nice job with the furnishings.  It looks very victorian vintage, with a unique color layout and pleasant dining areas.  There's also an outdoor section when it's nice outside, and a comfortable waiting area when they're busy.Those things said, they have a HUGE problem with service.  At the old bakery, there was 1 or 2 curmudgeon employees who were extremely rude no matter how you approached them.  At this new restaurant, there's now a handful of people who share that behavior, except they also have inexperience and no tact to add to the list.Additionally, the food items are hit or miss.  They all have a little something off about them, and the presentation is pretty basic considering the steep prices.My Recommendation -   Stop in and buy a few Croissants, don't stay for lunch.I thought I had figured out how to have a good meal at La Brioche: take out.  I very much enjoy the organic burger and some of the omelets, and, with take out, I had been able to avoid the horrible service.Alas, no more.  I called in an order for my usual burger with avocado and swiss, stating I would be right over.  I arrived, paid for it, and waited.  And waited.  I checked, only to find that the person who took my call had indicated that I would pick it up one hour later than I had said.  No apology from the staff involved, barely an apology from another staff member, and certainly no gesture like, "Please, have a pastry on us."I am done with True Foods.  Madison has a number of other restaurants with better food and much, much better service.Incidentally, while waiting for my missing order, I discovered how to get good service at True Food: have a relationship with a staff member.  A young women who was apparently attached in some fashion (girlfriend?) to a staff member received lavish attention from that person and other staff.So, unless you are related to someone who works at True Food, look elsewhere.I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon.I don't get the allure. Is it the furniture? The water pitchers? When I go out to eat I want food that tastes great. It's why I have decided not to cook and actually leave my abode to go spend money somewhere else. And the food I've had just doesn't wow me. Now I've only been for breakfast, so maybe things really get exciting around lunchtime? Add to this the fact that servers are a bit aloof (I find myself having to repeatedly ask for things) and the insane prices for eggs (I get the whole true food thing, I do) and it's just not a place I'll find myself returning to soon.If I could sum up La Brioche in one word it would be: Overrated. I've been to La Brioche more times than I've liked because I have an aunt in town who loves it and we go together often. Also, I used to work at the UWHC and would go to lunch with coworkers there sometimes.I like that La Brioche is attractive. Their decorating style is cute and reminds me of an eccentric old lady's house. The hot pink wallpaper on the back wall is the bomb. I also like how the egg dishes come with mixed greens on the side instead of carbs. Here is what I don't like about La Brioche: -It's EXPENSIVE. Last time I was there a couple months ago, I took a new employee out for lunch. We both drank water and ordered a sandwich each. The sandwiches come with green salad on the side. My sandwich (a BLT) in particular, was tiny. It was more like the size of a half-sandwich from a place like Panera. The bill came to something like $30 dollars with tip. I thought this was ridiculous, and I didn't think the service, food, or atmosphere warranted that price.-The eggs are bland. At least, the times that I've had omelets and such there, the dishes contained little flavor, and were in desperate need of some salt. I'm also pretty sure based on flavor (or lack thereof) that they use non-stick spray to cook eggs as opposed to using butter. This is a cardinal sin in my book. Butter is not to be feared, but embraced!-The service is friendly, but SLOOOOW. The aforementioned lunch with my department's new employee took over an hour from the time we ordered to the time we got our bill. For two sandwiches. Nothing even had to be cooked! This is not good if they hope to appeal to people on limited-time lunch breaks.-Finally, and this is picky, I'll admit, but it really rubs me the wrong way that they have signs up on the wall (and a note in the menu)  that prohibit the use of laptops and cell phones. I get that they want the place to retain an elegant vibe, but at the same time, it irks me, as a functional adult, to be told what I "should" do, especially in such a passive-aggressive manner. Also, La Brioche, if you're going to take over an hour to bring people their bill from lunch during a workday, they will probably have to check their email at some point to avoid getting fired, and thus being unemployed and unable to eat at your expensive restaurant.Overall, I guess I'd give La Brioche 3 stars, but that's being extremely charitable.While  I've never had an appalling experience here, I've NEVER been wowed, and I've definitely been annoyed on several occasions.The breakdown:Taste of food: 2.5 starsLocation: 3 starsService: 3 starsValue: 2 stars
Mi Peru South American Grill=I want to give this place six stars because it's so good, but I apparently don't have that option. Sucks. I love this place, guys. I really do. They have really good food here, and it's truly the best Peruvian food I've had in Las Vegas, on par with El Rocoto in California. Not only that, but it's nice to go to a Peruvian place that has a real restaurant feel to it - some Peruvian places are a little bit more dumpy, where this place is really dressed up. Win for this place, my friends. But I won't bore you with details of the decor (it's tasteful), the staff (friendly and polite), or parking (plentiful!). Let's talk food. The food here is great. That's all there is to it. Please, please, please listen to me when I recommend that you get the jalea for your party. Trust me. It's so good it'll knock your socks off. Plus, the dish is huge! I order that just so that my date/family/whomever-I'm-eating-with eats that and leaves my plate alone. Plus, the red diced onions?! I could eat those as a dish. Whatever you eat, you need to drink chicha. It's a purple maiz drink, which makes it sound gross. Except it's the exact opposite of gross! It's an epic win! If you're not feeling that adventurous, try the Inca Kola. My non-Peruvian friends tell me it tastes like bubblegum, though I say it tastes like happiness. Also, try the lucuma ice cream. I really have no way of telling you how good this is, other than to tell you it's amazing. Everything here is good. The lomo saltado, ceviche, jalea... everything. It's really good food! I'm trying to think of more things to say that will tell you how good it is, but I can't. Because my work schedule was nuts for a while, I haven't been here in forever. I need to come back here soon, so you'll probably see me here when you come!mi peru is one of the best peruvian restaurants i have ever been to. you can taste the authentic quality taste in their dishes. my friend and i enjoyed both of the dishes we got. mi peru offers a lunch special on MONDAY- THURSDAY from 11am- 3pm. 5-6 dishes are priced at $8.95. we got the papa a la huancaina and the arroz con pollo. the potatoes and egg is always delightful with the yellow sauce. my favorite was the arroz con pollo dish with the rice and chicken. the dish came with a side of pickled onions that made the whole meal. the chicken was so moist and flavorful and the rice was really good. im only in vegas for a little time but i wouldn't mind to come back to try the other dishes. the server also gave us some fried corn kernels with the green sauce which was great!the ambiance is quiet with low music and the furniture is very traditional. service was great and always made sure everything was going good. i would definitely recommend coming here for a nice lunch or dinner.
Asmara Restaurant=I crave Ethiopian food.  I crave the spice factor, the flavors that only Ethiopian food can give.  And this week I gave into that craving.We've tried quite a few Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas, and decided to try a new one this time - Blue Nile.We arrived on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was empty.  We weren't deterred because most Ethiopian restaurants are always empty when we choose to dine.  It's the timing!You definitely have to pay attention when you're looking for this restaurant.  The outside is nothing to rave about, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  We had our choice of tables and the waiter asked if we were okay with the basketball game on.  We were and once he realized that the Husband was paying attention to the game, he asked if we wanted to move closer to the TV.  We declined but appreciated his offer.  (Note: No language barriers here!)We now know what we want these days without needing to look at the menu.  Their menu is pretty short - only 13 items on there!We chose the Vegetarian Combo "A combination dish of pureed split lentil cooked with onion and hot pepper in zesty spicy sauce, green pepper, collared green sauteed with garlic and cooked cured cabbage, potato, and carrots." ($9.99) and Kitfo "Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice...raw, medium, or well-done." ($10.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-las-vegas?select=u5U9roXHFQ1IWpfU1UGZJw#BSv57_OeogGrShN-lmwVMwThe Vegetarian Combo arrived first and we were starving, so we just dove right in.  We couldn't wait for the Kitfo to arrive although it did shortly after.  (It did seem like we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food...not sure if it's because we were famished or it actually took longer.)  The Husband commented that it looked like we got less food in the combo than other places and looking back at some of the other places we've eaten, I do have to agree.  However, the amount of kitfo we got was quite generous.  We had leftovers!The waiter explained everything we got - which was actually Yellow Lentils, Chickpeas, Collared Greens, Red Lentils, Fresh Salad, Cured Cabbage, and String Beans.  (No potato or carrots as mentioned in the menu description.)  Each item was good, but I do believe that the lentils have been a bit more flavorful at other places.  The kitfo was super flavorful though!  We did ask for it to be medium and it was more medium rare, which we still ate.  It also came with a homemade spinach and cheese concoction to help with the heat.  I didn't really notice that much heat coming from any of the food, except when we chose to add the much needed hot red pepper seasoning.We needed more water and injera bread, and did have to wait to be noticed first about needing those as opposed to it arriving before we were out.Overall, it was good.  There were some things better here than others and vice versa, but we'd come back. We usually never have leftovers, so that was a first.  I think I might be craving it again next week...where to next?3.5 stars.
Autostrada=Yay - a FTR for Gabi K!Located on Market Street at DC Ranch, Autostrada is the latest concept in Chef Aaron May's "collection" of unique restaurants in the Valley.  Autostrada, which means "an expressway or highway in Italian" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.I had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.We waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.Once seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  Next up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could've stopped here, but we kept going.For the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... I didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I'm not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.We finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.As you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  With the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I'm sure they will be a success.  Buon appetito!After much delay, Autostrada is finally open, surprisingly with little fanfare.   The couple we were meeting had trouble finding the new Italian osteria in DC Ranch.  Apart from a large red "A" vinyl on the doors, there was no other signage.  It's located at the intersection across from The Armitage.The menu is simple and straightforward at very palatable prices - nothing is over $18.  Food is encouraged to be shared family style.  All of which sounds like a great concept in a recessionary environment.None of the antipasti piqued our interest so we jumped straight to the pastas. Fettuccine with scallops and mushrooms ($17) and orchiette with pork sugo and peas.  The marscapone sauce on the fettucine was deliciously creamy although a touch heavy handed.  The pork sugo was a bit too sweet and the dish just fell flat for us.For the main, we shared the roasted sea bass with fennel and tomato ($16) and NY strip steak (pre-sliced for easy sharing) on potato and sunchoke puree.  Both were solid dishes.  Steak had great flavor but oddly it was not sliced across the grain and had a little gristle.Our favorites were the contorni (aka sides). The tiella - baked layers of eggplant, zucchini & tomato topped with parmesan was packed with flavor and delicious just as Gabi said.  The baby artichokes were fried to a nice crisp on the outside contrasting nicely with the tender interior.For dessert, we chose vanilla bean panna cotta with sliced strawberries and the marscapone tart with poached pears and spiced walnuts.  Again both were solid dishes.The interior has an industrial cool vibe to it with a long metal bench running along the wall and a stainless steel walled kitchen that runs across, separated by glass so you can get a full view of the action from most of the dining room.  There is an equal if not greater number of seating outdoors including tables for up to 8.Autostrada serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Over Easy and The Lodge fame's latest dining destination.
Scramble A Breakfast Joint=Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!Scramble has become a new favorite spot for breakfast... and clearly from the number of people that are packed in on any given visit, I am not alone. This is one of those places that I had to ignore my first impressions. My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level. Between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!). Now for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique... My only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; ) On-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place. This is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!For my favorite person in the world's sake, I wanted to write a raving review of this place. Sorry Christina P, I just cannot do it. Honestly, not one thing impressed me. In fact, I did not particularly care for my three cheese omelet. The hash browns are pre-made with bacon, so I could not order them being a vegetarian. The pancakes were really thick, and I only like thin things. The outdoor patio is nice. Unfortunately it was super windy the day we went. The prices are relatively reasonable. It's not good, it's not bad. I'm sure I would eat there again if I was in the area and needed to eat really bad, but I wouldn't make the trip up there again.I love, love Scramble! I don't know what it is about the place! Is it the sleek and simple decor? Hmm, is it the friendly, attentive service? Is it the supa yum food? Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint! I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day! On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying. My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home. Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food. I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!I  know I will be going back to Scramble.. I can definitely see this becoming one of my go to places to meet friends, or get breakfast on way across town or just to treat the family on the weekend..  After the recent UYE here for Foster Kids ( A group I hold especially dear)  I really can't wait to take others here..Scramble could be  a great place in my list of restaurants because of a few reasons ..1. Located on 7th street  near many of my friends  who live in Central Phoenix or Moon Valley  -great for the girls to eat before going on a day outing 2.Food is served with a walk up line and  served fast ..that means not fussing with waiter, or  waiting for service and you eat good but quick3. The food is tasty  , while maybe not rich  or decadent or over the topthe food is great tasting  but without leaving you feeling like you need a nap. Food quality is good , it taste like they just made it in Grandmas kitchen without adding a lot of grease. 4. It's got that modern coolness thing  going on ...Atmosphere does say something specially when you are meeting friends... Thanks Scramble for your unique niche in my mental list of places to eat breakfast....  now if you only served Brinner every night!Egg whites and oatmeal and brizza oh my!I've been hearing about Scramble for months now and I finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today.  I loved it...The oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion's brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!I love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.  I wish I lived closer to Scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Even though it's a bit of a drive for me, I will be back... especially to check out their upcoming "breakfast for dinner" charity events on Wednesday nights.  (Stay tuned for info on the Yelp events calendar).You've got a new fan in me, Scramble... see you again soon!If anything could get me up in the morning, a shop like Scramble is it. I finally had the chance to try Scramble and it's apparent that I've definitely been missing out! On your typical Saturday morning, breakfast joints can be overpopulated and require a 45 minute wait which normally dissuades me from visiting and causes me to just skip ahead to lunch instead. But this morning, I visited Scramble and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that not only does Scramble have plenty of seating to accommodate the mass crowds, but it's an order, pay and seat your self style restaurant so it cuts out the dreaded wait time. Everything on the menu looks delicious, especially the brizza! I ended up opting for the veggie scramble with sun dried tomatoes, peppers and cheese and accompanied with roasted potatoes. But the sourdough french toast sounded so delectable that my friends and I decided to split that as well. I'm glad we make the choice to go big or go home because the french toast was worth every bit! The service was relatively quick despite the crowded restaurant and the food was delicious and steaming hot upon arrival. While visiting, I noticed a sign announcing that Scramble is offering unlimited pancakes through the month of October. Sign me up for that! I also enjoyed the serve yourself unlimited coffee and soda fountain. It kept my thirst quenched while filling my belly with the tasty food. Like I mentioned, the restaurant offers plenty of seating and the atmosphere itself is clean and modern. But be prepared to sit in a less than comfortable seat. The restaurant would deserve an extra star if they had better seats and possibly more booths. But, like I said, the atmosphere was great and I like the fact that you can sit either inside or outside and enjoy the view of the desert mountains. I can't wait to find my way to CenPho again soon so I can visit Scramble and try other items on the menu!So we took a gamble when selecting Scramble so please forgive my Scramble ramble. Ugh. So much potential. Friendly staff. But so so food and though friendly, an untrained staff. Upon entering I like the open and airy room. I like the railing along the east wall with great views of the mountains. But. Wait. What are all these people standing in line for? The host I'm sure. WTF? It's an order at the counter sit down with a number on your table kinda place. Ugh again. Not my thing. Like camping. Or hiking. Or that second Narnia movie. I'm with two people and they are ordering up their grub. Scanning the menu. Asking some questions. At one point my friend was ordering a blended coffee drink. The shelves behind the cashier were loaded with frape type powders. I couldn't believe I heard her say "Oh. Yeah. I don't know how to make those!" LMAO. I had grabbed some bottled Vitamin water so I was in the clear on potentially prepared beverage fiasco. When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward. I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey. Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes. Lastly he realized as he scanned his check that his omelette he ordered didn't come out because it wasn't even listed on the bill. So Scramble. You got potential kid. I felt the heart in the room. Just didn't get much from the brain.A few weeks ago, I probably would have hooked Scramble up with a 5-star update, but they did something to piss me off and the service has been a bit sour lately.I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man??? The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted. I have to admit, the french toast and the English Muffin (when cooked right) have a special place in my soul! And there is nothing better that vegan butter  being readily available.More knowledgeable cashiers, quicker bus service on a busy day, and a re-introduction of the chili garlic sauce and you will have me back. As for now, I'm so mad about the discontinuation that I cannot even look at you!This was The Breakfast Club - UYE 2nd meet up, and this time Scramble was picked for the place, it was at 10am on a Sunday, one thing I can say is that people must love Scramble because it was busy from the time we got their to the time we left.As sometimes I do, I did a little research on the menu and I knew exactly what I wanted to try. The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish, I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash, visually this dish looked freaking fantastic, however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen, barely any egg whites and small yokes,  the ham was good, had great flavor, I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread, taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen, just seemed like dry corn bread, oh and the hollandaise sauce, have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce, oh high hopes for the sauce too, because cilantro, it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff, I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect! But the hollandaise sauce didn't have the hint of cilantro, and the sauce itself was lacking flavor, so I will continue my search for the great hollandaise sauce in the valley.  The sweet potato hash, ok I had no idea what to expect on this, it was bland like it needed some salt and pepper, but it was fresh, it had mushrooms, zucchini? and onions sautéed  mixed in with  slices of sweet potatoes, never thought of doing a sweet potato like that, now I know, going to have to try it at home! I ordered the cinnamon roll too, just to try it, again visually great, but the roll was dry and hard and inedible but the icing was perfect. Service seemed to be ok, for some tables they were on it and others it was eh, maybe they could work on that too.I don't think I will go out of my way to come back, I came, I saw, wasn't thrilled, back to the east valley I went.We were looking for something light, quick and good before hitting up the Phoenix Zoo and my sister had the perfect suggestion: Scramble.  She said there wouldn't be a wait--unlike most breakfast places on a Saturday morning. I was a bit puzzled when we pulled up and the line was out the door--my sis explained that it wasn't a line to be seated, but a line to order. Scramble is different than any other breakfast place/diner I'd every been to in that you place your order; pay; grab a seat; and then they bring your food out to you. After about 10-minutes we got up to the cashier and placed our order.Santa Fe Benedict- The two perfectly poached eggs come with Ham, Chipotle Hollandaise sauce and Jalapeño Cornbread instead of the typical English Muffin. I can't describe how good and innovative this dish is--exactly the kind of thing I was looking for in my trip; the perfect breakfast. 5*Toluca Brizza- If I thought my Santa Fe Benedict was innovative, then my wife's Toluca Brizza pushed the limits. The Brizza is a Breakfast Pizza, and I can't believe I've never seen this before. The Toluca comes with Chorizo, Eggs, Monterey Jack, Bell Peppers and  topped with a Jalapeño Cream Cheese. It's delicious, packed with toppings and big enough to share. My only complaint was the dough was a bit too dry for my liking but that's just a minor gripe. 4.75*Service & Ambiance- Upon first arriving we were greeted by a manager at the back of the line, and again when we left; he was super-friendly and asked intelligent questions about our experience. The service inside was good, quick and efficient. Scramble is very clean and modern looking. They have lots of TVs broadcasting different channels; I'd advise that you pick a spot to sit where there's something on you want to watch. 4*Value- Scramble is a great value with an average of ±$10/person with a beverage (e.g., coffee, OJ, etc); otherwise each plate is around $8.Scramble is very avant-garde in that they don't do breakfast in the typical way with the same old ingredients. I'm always looking for something different and progressive in a restaurant and Scramble is definitely that. I wish them luck and I sincerely hope that the Phoenicians who visit really appreciate what they have. As for me I can only hope that something like this pops up close to home, but in the meantime I'll be sure to visit whenever I'm in town. I give Scramble a huge thumbs up!We go to Scramble 3-4 times a month for breakfast because the food and service never disappoint us.We some times just stop in to get the jalapeño cornbread to go because it's so yummy, but, especially on a lazy Sunday morning, Scramble is a great place for breakfast or brunch.I really like the Toluca brizza, but my boyfriend prefers the Santa Fe Benedict.Because Scramble uses such fresh ingredients, EVERYTHING tastes great.The servers are very sweet and attentive, and the atmosphere is really homey.Scramble is our go-to spot for breakfast and brunch.  ENJOY!
Kai Sushi and Steakhouse=When I first came here, I was very skeptical but little did I know that I would actually love this place!  Prices are very good.  Quality of food is excellent.  You can definitely taste the freshness of the fish.  Although, they don't have a lot of selections when it comes to their all you can eat sushi, it's still the place I go to when I crave it.  They just started it so that can be one of the reasons they didn't add all the sushi on that menu.  They have the best Green Mussels ever!  My all time favorites are the chef's specials like the Island Roll...I love it!  I haven't tried anything that I didn't like.  The staff here are very nice.  The atmosphere is great.  Very clean restaurant.Throughout my life I have been fascinated by all things Asian. I as a child I saw my first Japanese Spinning Sex Basket. My father brought it home on my 3rd birthday...he had no present for me...unless you call a slap and "don't ever come in my room again" a present. Knowing him...I do. Years later he passed out and his Swisher Sweet fell out of his hand and burned down our trailer...for the 5th time.  I cried for the chair that had made it through 4 fires, 8 wives, 9 waitresses named "Rose" and a guy in a dress...named "Rose"...and it was gone. Craftsmanship, luck...and an incredible amount of lubricant has protected it over the years.  My father wept. He cursed God. He flogged himself with the red plastic track for my toy cars.  He ran away...neither me or his badly burned 9th female Rose ever saw him again.  I heard he spent decades trying to replicate the feel of that basket. an obsession that nearly killed him. Rose despite his burns was a good stepmother to me....until...well...that is another story.Rex remembered...he remembered the squeals of delight...the screams of ecstasy...the snapping of the chain and the cries of help from my father and his companion of the day. He was insastiable...and animal...I was insatiable...and animal. I read everything i could about the Pacific rim...i nicknamed my anus "The Atlantic Rim"...I was a scholar of all things Asian. I even bought pictures of tigers on black velvet...very Asian.  I had two true Asian loves...Margret Cho and sushi.  Margret left me for some film director...I was crushed...but my search for all things sushi never subsided.  I would go to the finest sushi houses. I would eat canned tuna straight from the can. I was hardcore.In these times of want and woe....I want roe...as much of it as I can eat.  All you can eat sushi is usually like having a naked dance party in a Weight Watchers...never good...and not good examples of what fun you COULD be having...if you were in a different situation.  Kai Sushi and Steakhouse is like having a naked dance party in the backstage area of the Victoria Secret modeling show.  It is heaven. It is perfection. It is better than Margret Cho in my father's basket. My dream of good all you can eat sushi is realized...great all you can eat sushi for under 25 bucks!!  If this is dreaming...don't wake me up.I will start out with something not necessarily brought up first when reviewing all you can eat sushi...they have the best mussels in town! Bar none. Amazing. A touch spicy. A touch sweet. The best ever. Their sushi rolls are perfect. Great mix of some sweet, some crunchy, some with acidity, some with a combination.  The best roll...the Lion roll. Second best...the Stacy roll.  Everyone i had, in the many times I have been there, are great. The fish is so fresh, the roll is perfectly built, the sauces are spot on.  It is a miracle they do this for all you can eat.  They even do substitutions!!! I listened to a person ask to have a Stacy roll with cream cheese...and they did it! The salmon roe is excellent and the sashimi is very good as well...because the fish, and i can't say this enough...is so fresh, so tasty, that anything that is made with this kind of care is going to be good. The tempura is perfect in the roll, out of the roll...and most importantly...for the soft shell crab. The soft shell crabs are included and they are great...you would think perfect...OH NO...not until you get the Charlie handroll.  The Charlie is the single greatest roll in all of Las Vegas...and the best I have ever had. People who come from NYC, Philly and other major cities have sat in silence with me and ate bite after bite in sheer amazement. The crab is crunchy. The sauce is creamy and spicy. It is the single best thing I have had in my mouth since the time I met Emma Stone. Amazing service. Great people. The sushi chef is helpful and funny. The free refills of soda keep coming. The drinks are made strong and good! The menu is full and very little isn't included. Much more than most all you can eat sushi joints.Go. Eat. Think of Asia. Think of Rex. Think of the basket. Be in the basket with Rex...but he won't be with you.
Mez=Pretty classy and a great way to celebrate our anniversary!They have a private location for dining and we were treated like VIPs. The decor is very modern and upscale. We spent an hour and a half visiting and dining and never felt rushed.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The service was great! The hostess was very friendly and had our table ready when we arrived (reservation was right on). Our server was friendly and helpful in describing different entrees. You definitely want to dress up when you go here. It's a classy place for a date night or to celebrate something special!
Archie's Deli=We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise, AZ. What was our horrific crime? Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer, one that my husband has ordered there, and received, at least five times. Today, the manager refused to do it, saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant. Everyone who? It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty. We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah), as we always did, but he blew up and told us to get out!We are clean-cut, polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's. We tip well, love the food, have a good rapport with the staff, and never cause a problem there. This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's, and that manager has seen us before. Thanks to his nasty attitude today, we won't be back, and that's a shame. Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches, great latkes, and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages. The sandwiches are big enough to share, but we always buy two and take leftovers home. It's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup. Now he lost our business. $60 every other week adds up, Archie's. In this economy, isn't customer retention important?Think long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here. We won't make that mistake again.
Carl's Jr=Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger. food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho). also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good.location - ummm could be worse. needs a refresher, remodel. employees - very nice. not bitter fast food workers. brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip.corner of Washington and 24th street.
Sandella's Flatbread Cafe=Sandella's is a fine choice for fella's.  You can order pretty cheap but they will try to upsellus.The flatbread pizza was good but it ain't gon' make ya jealous.The amount of sweet potato fries will underwhelmus.The place is a decent choice but no one will say "Hell yes!"
The Buffet at ARIA=The buffet itself isn't horrible but the service is pretty bad. Came here on a Sunday night and they were way understaffed. People were confused as to where to sit and the hostesses didn't know which tables were open. Out drinks weren't refilled as the poor waitresses was running around trying to take too many tables on. Food: It is allright. You obviously can't compare it to the Bellagio or the Wynn but it's decent. The garlic naan was SO GOOD! It has to be good since it was actually made in those cool stone clay pans and made fresh right on the spot. The shrimp is very large and fresh. The crab labs weren't bad. Dessert: Ok well you know it has to be good since it was designed by Pastry Champion Jean-Philippe Maury. I literally tried everything! Not too sweet and not too decadent. I really only came here cuz I had food credit from Aria. I guess it's not bad for the price. I believe it was around $27.00 for dinner per personHow many nice restaurants are there in Las Vegas on the strip alone?  A lot.  How many did we eat at?  ZERO!  Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.So Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.The buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.  The "free" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Minus two stars alone for the senseless slaughter of crustaceans.  If you can't prepare it well enough to at least be edible, don't bother offering it!With all of the buffets on the Strip, there isn't a lack of destinations to choose from.  However, considering how much I like Aria, I figured that their buffet would have to be on my list of spots to check out.  After all, if their buffet can match the hotel, then it must be pretty decent right?  So, after checking out their menu and being decently satisfied, some of my friends and I ended up coming on a Thursday night to give them a shot.  After paying and making our way in, I already started to get an ominous feeling though.  Now, I don't know about you...but I generally get worried when I start having doubts before I even make it to my seat.  Why so worried?  Well, although the spaciousness of the dining area might have had something to do with it, the buffet seemed pretty empty to me.  Though I didn't expect it to be a madhouse like how it is at some Asian buffets, I figured there would at least be a steady stream of people shuttling back and forth between the food and their tables.  In this case, not so much.   Refreshing as it was to be able to reach for the serving utensil without someone right on my ass waiting for me to finish, it made me wonder if all those missing people knew something I didn't.  Like most Vegas buffets, they have a decent variety of selections to cover just about every diner that should pass through the place.  From the usual buffet staples to Asian selections to Mexican food, they cover a lot of territory.  The question isn't so much what you want, but what is worth eating - like your choices, the quality varies as well.  For the most part, the food is fine - nothing terrible, but nothing that drives you back up there for seconds or thirds.  The Mexican food was pretty bad, though I like the chips and guacamole/salsa bar.  Then again, at a Vegas buffet, that's probably not the sort of thing you want to be chasing.  Among the few things that were of note, I thought that the prime rib was better than average for a buffet.  The seasoning on the outside was pretty good, and it was still juicy and tender.  The star though, if you're a fan, is the fresh crab legs they have.  Haven't seen all of the buffets in Vegas, but it's one of the few that I recall seeing crab legs at, and it's certainly the best that comes to mind.  They were very fresh and tasted great, and it's always handy when they slice it all the way through so it's easier to pick the meat out.  Hassle free crab legs?  Sign me up please!All in all, the buffet isn't terrible, and it's definitely worth checking out if you like crab legs.  Just that in Vegas, with so many other choices (relatively) close, you're probably better off heading over to Cosmopolitan or Wynn.Any buffet that calls itself "The Buffet" is either very comfortable with what it is (a buffet) or is trying to sound like "THE buffet" (kind of like the pretentious alums of THE Ohio State). In the case of "The Buffet" at Aria, it is the more humble laidback version. The light, bright, and open atmosphere of the buffet and simple, yet delicious dishes means The Buffet is a good choice when at the hotel, casino, or City Center. This isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in Vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.It's only $21 for lunch. If you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. The good stuff (aka Gourmet with Lobster) is only served Friday and Saturday dinner. If you are used to Las Vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and salads will seem very familiar. Nothing really stood out or sucked. I liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. Maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. Of course, desserts are a highlight of any Vegas buffet and the same is true at Aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.I was at the Aria buffet in its first incarnation and I liked it a lot.  I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.It's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!A few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.Now the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.This isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!Black M-Life membership means free buffet!  So dinner at The Buffet?  Why not!If you're expecting to be treated like royalty, get real.  This is a buffet.  Drinks refills will be slow but at least the food quality is great and nothing suffers from being overly-steamed or super frozen.  There's a wide variety of offerings here.  There's mini sub-sections for Chinese food, Indian food, Italian food, and so forth.  They have your standard fare of snow crab legs, Alaskan crab legs, king crab legs, prime ribs, pasta bars, salad bars, fancy desserts, et cetera.  I like how they have sugar-free items and gluten-free items so if you're on a strict diet, you won't be misled.I'm not sure if I would have stopped in if it wasn't for the M-Life membership perks but I will say that they make a delicious panna cotta.  Delicious!Given that the Aria Hotel and adjacent Crystal Shops are jaw dropping in their design, the buffet is especially disappointing.  Not much that you want to eat and, I am sorry to say, the seating area was quite dirty.  The tables remind me of the waiting area at the local auto club.  The extra star for this otherwise two-star review belongs to the Naan -- it's just awesome.  Made by hand as you watch and cooked in this heated earthenware pot ... oh man.  Who needs dessert?  However, should we be spending $40 for a casino buffet just for the Naan?   Nein.I was in Vegas the past few days, and had the choice for a comped dinner buffet at Aria, or a lunch buffet at Bellagio. After reading reviews for both, I chose the dinner buffet at Aria, and I was not disappointed.First, let me say this: I did not go to this buffet to eat gluttonously. Instead, I took small portions of several items (6 trips, which I will explain in a bit) so I could sample more items.I added on the bottomless alcohol package for $12.99 and paired different drinks with different "rounds" of food. I will notate which drink I had. I had one beer, one Pinot Noir, and one Champagne. I also had a glass of club soda, which I used to cleanse my palate between items.And yes, I took notes while eating dinner!Round 1 - Stella Artois Beer-----------* Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'd never had truffles before and I love mac & cheese. This was delicious. The sauce was light, and not overpowering, and the truffles were tasty!* Jasmine rice - This was from the Asian section. It was good - not dry at all.* Prime Rib w/ Creamy Horseradish - a bit dry for my liking.* Meatball w/ Marinara and Parmesean - I had two of these - and they were so good. The marinara sauce was a bit spicy, which was a nice and welcomed surprise.* Multigrain roll with cranberries - I thought this was a standard multigrain roll. When I bit into it, I saw there were cranberries. Bonus! Round 2 - Stella Artois Beer -----------* Carnivore Pizza slice (pepperoni, sausage, bacon) - It had been sitting out for a bit, and was a bit cold.* Pineapple Sausage - This was from the Asian section - quite tasty, I liked the fact the pineapple was mixed in with the sausage. I'd never tried anything like it before.* Chicken Pot Stickers - Cold, hard, and stuck together. Very disappointed.* Vegetable Pad Thai - Good, but not a lot of spice/flavor. But good.* Beef w/ Veggies - Similar to a Mongolian beef, w/o peppers. Was a bit cold.* Provolone Cheese - Wow, these were pungent!Round 3 - Stella Artois Beer-----------* Beef Steamship - Like the Prime Rib, this was a bit dry. Perhaps I should have tried the au jus (in retrospect).* Lentil Orzo - Cold pasta salad - orzo, lentil, and tomatoes. Freaking delicious!* Portugese Sausage - One of my most favorite items all night - spicy, tender, and delicious.Round 4 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City-----------* Clams - I tried clams for the first time....and I liked them!!* Sirloin Oscar - Served with crab meat, bernaise sauce, and asparagus. This was grilled to order and was the highlight of my meal. Great char and flavor on the steak. I got mine Mid Rare+ (between MR and M). The Bernaise sauce was phenomenal. The crab was delicious as well!Round 5 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City-----------* Pork Belly - Nice crispy skin, very tender meat.* Chorizo Rope Sausage - Hello flavor explosion! Spicy and tasty!* Au Gratin Potatoes - Very good - mild flavor, not overly cheesy.Round 6 - Prosecco Champagne - La Marca, Veneto, Italy-----------* Red Velvet Whoopie Pie - Nice tender cake, great cream filling. Nuts on top.* Creme Brule - nice glaze, but too creamy inside for my liking.* Coconut Macaroon - Nice toasted outside. I could've eaten so many of these!* Brownie - Rich, chocolatey - it's a brownie! But seriously, this was wonderful.* Oreo Gelato - One word: divine.* Cinnamon Crunch Gelato - The show stealer of the desserts. Oh. My. Gosh.Regarding drinks, the Pinot Noir was really good for being, what I assume, to be their house Pinot. The champagne was delicious as well. In fact, I will be looking to purchase a bottle of both the Pinot Noir, and the Champagne later this week if I can find them.While some of the carved items were dry, I will admit I did not use Au Jus, and I can only imagine the difference that would have made. There are so many choices here: Italian, Latin, Indian, Asian, Deli, Seafood, Carvery, Desserts, and much more. I did not even remotely try everything on the buffet, nor could I, as I would not have been able to eat it all. But I will try more items the next time I go back.Do yourself a favor, and have dinner at the Aria buffet the next time you are in Vegas. Despite some of the items being cold, the service was outstanding. This place gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.Alright I have stayed at Aria a few times but never really wanted to eat The Buffet when I was ever in Vegas. During my last trip here we actually got free buffet dinner so we decided why not! The inside and the look of the place seemed pretty nice but in general the food was just not that amazing. Some of the plates were empty most of the time even though I got up about five times and went and walked around. I thought the service for the ladies that got us drinks was pretty nice and she was quick about it! But food wise I would say go somewhere else and it is not worth it to eat here! I didn't really think they had a lot of variety and the food wasn't tasty or something that I could even remember.Dear Aria, Thank you for including a buffet promotion with my recent stay. Overall, I do and have enjoyed your buffet during my past and current stays. The buffet is moderately priced, has a variety of culinary options (in particular a great pick for seafood lovers), and is extremely convenient. What takes away from your buffet and will impact if I return is the buffet line. For lunch, we waited over 40 minutes to get into the restaurant. Per the wait, I can only assume that all of the other patrons had a promo too. Waiting in that sort of line without a promotion is nonesense. ClaudiaPS. I wrote this review while waiting in line.The buffet here is okay. I have tried better elsewhere  with a larger selection of ethnic foods. Since we were hungry and a little hungover from the night before, anything that looks appetizing was good.I basically stuck around the section with all the crab legs. Now you know what I eat the most. Lol. They were fresh as it was packed around ice. The beauty of these crab legs wasn't about its size, but how they're already cut in half for you to easily consume. Delicious! Other items I've tried was the roasted beef (not prime rib), roasted chicken, smoked salmon,  spicy tuna sushi roll, broccoli, pepperoni pizza, their dim sum sieu mais (dumping), the tossed green Cesar Salad, and finally their fresh fruits.I don't know why they call their beef "roasted beef" rather than using the fancy prime rib. Maybe it was a different area of the cow? But that huge roasted slab of meat did look wonderful.  But I think they should have let the meat absorb the marinated flavor a bit longer since it wasn't too flavorful in the mid cut. Believe it or not, aside from the crab legs, I probably enjoyed the salad and the fresh fruits the most. It look so fresh that I had to indulge. Yep, I need my greens and vitamin C. It kind of sounds like I'm an oinker for eating so much which I actually am, but really I only took a small proportion of everything to try out. Yes, I was stuffed from the variety.The buffet is well kept and very clean. I wouldn't worry too much about getting food poisoning since they deal with huge volumes. So the probability of something getting spoiled is rare.Again, the food is mediocre. But come and enjoy anyways. For us, nothing beats a free comp meal.  Haha.I've been to Las Vegas now 10 times over the years....I've had meals all over the place, and visited many buffets.  I like a good buffet every now and then.  I redeemed a few MyVegas vouchers for my friend and I.  Buy 1 get one free buffet, and two unlimited beverage passes.  I DO recommend the buffet, I do not recommend the additional $12.99 beverage pass, unless maybe you're going with options like beer, or sangria...options I didn't try during my brunch.  I guess I'll start with that part of the experience.  My friend and I tried a bloody mary - when I asked what the difference was between the two kinds, it was just one was spicier than the other, and they ARE pre-mixed, so nothing special.  We weren't thrilled with them so we got the mimosas...which weren't any better.  The orange juice seemed "fresh" with a tad of pulp, but not sure about the rest...it wasn't light or bubbly or anything.As for the food... we stopped in for brunch.  There weren't a whole lot of breakfast options, but what they had was good...as for the rest, they had EVERYTHING! Italian, seafood, sushi, salad bar, asian, you name it!!! And I can't say enough NICE things about the dessert options, along with a tasty gelato section which had flavors like peanut butter pretzel, and cinnamon toast crunch.I will say, if you're in a bit of a hurry...and have the drink pass, you do have a 3 hour time limit.  We didn't plan on having a 3 hour brunch anyway, but the service was a bit slow on the beverages so I'd keep that in mind if that was an option you were considering.Overall, the Aria is wonderful...the buffet is as well, lots of options and very clean!Monday lunch was $26 for adults. The selection of food was pretty good-----a lot of variety in cultural dishes. The desserts were better than expected. The server was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area.
Island Flavor =Wow. This place is amazing! A few people at work keep telling me about this place. I swing by on a Thursday around early evening time to try it out. The inside of the restaurant looked like a place I would see in Hawaii. It wasn't over done but it was nice. The place looks like it could fit 100 people easily. What did scare me was the place was empty. Well, when I first walked in, I did see some ladies sitting on a table... but to my surprise they were the cooks and help just sitting around waiting for hungry patrons like me.After telling them I wanted to order to go, they handed me a regular menu menu with daily specials and let me at it. They had the typical things you would see on any Hawaiian restaurant menu. What thing I did notice is that they didn't have any Spam entrees. After a good five minutes of looking over the menu, I decided on the following:Beef Teriyaki Steak - (Bottom sirloin marinated with our special Asian sauce then broiled to perfection and sliced thin - $8.75) Wow. When they say Steak, they mean it! I have never seen Beef Teriyaki so large. Its like regular Beef Teri on steroids! Check out my pictures on how huge the portions are. The beef was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order this again.Hawaiian Style Roast Pork - (Cooked local style with Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped with our rich homemade brown gravy - $8.25) Yum! What makes this dish work is the homemade brown gravy. The roast port was tender and soft. Large portions as well. Great dish. I would definitely order this again as well.Korean Chicken - (Golden fried drumettes $ wings tossed in our delicious Korean sauce - $8.75) Yay! This dish was awesome as well. When I first cracked open the box, I just saw crispy chicken wings. I scooped some rice and pick up a piece with my fork and placed the chicken on my plate. I licked my fork and damn.... it was over. Just the taste on the fork was really really good. I had to dig in. So many flavors hitting my taste buds! I love this dish! Would definitely order again.Each dish comes with two scoops of rice and a side mac salad. The mac salad was good as well. Overall.... I love this place! The food is awesome. The portions are large the price is comparable to other Hawaiian joints. I would seriously recommend this place to my friends and everyone else who reads these reviews. You will not be disappointed. Pictures included!We try to keep the review short today!  This place is "Brok' da mout!"  Forget L&L or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ...you want the closest to genuine Hawaiian food?  You gotta come to Island Flavor!  Even the owners from Hawaii!  Big Island to be exact.This place is phenomenal for local island food, the portions are local too...HUGE!  We had enough leftovers for another meal that's how much food you get.  Island Flavor is actually only 4-5 miles away from my house but we never came around to eating there.  Finally tried it because of my coupon from Restaurant.com.  Be sure if you go you are hungry cause these folks don't skimp!  You walk out hungry, you definitely went to the wrong place.  Four of us went, and four of us walked out stuffed with a doggie bag in tow.  If you don't like white rice (what kine' Hawaii local are you?) then don't come here you crazy carb-conscious workoutaholics!Hawaiian food is usually a mix of cultures, Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino all combined.  Island Flavor's food made me fond of days spent home on Maui.  I had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of  Teriyaki Steak and Teriyaki Chicken.  Their homemade teriyaki sauce was just right, not too sweet and not too runny.  Perfect for mixing with your rice and macaroni salad.  Macaroni salad with pepper and tabasco...yum!  The steak was tender even though it wasn't a very expensive cut (sirloin) and cooked great with a lil' pink inside.  Chicken thighs were big and moist.  The gf had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork.  There must have been 3 large rows of katsu, enough to share!  They were fried just right too, not heavy or soggy at all.  The roast pork was juicy and the brown gravy wasn't from a box, very succulent.  The kids shared a Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Korean Chicken and Kalbi Ribs, and Chicken Katsu Loco Moco ($8.75).  The Korean Chicken is so ONO!  Those golden fried wings with their special Korean sauce was addictive!  Very good!  The Kalbi was great as well, their marinade pretty close to what I remember as a kid, lots of sweet from the sugar and soy sauce and grilled on an open flame.  The Chicken Katsu Loco Moco was a big gut-buster.  A massive portion of rice (like 4 scoops) topped with chicken katsu, two eggs (sunny side up in this case...alright!) and their homemade brown gravy.  It's like heaven and hell on a plate at the same time!  Definitely not a calorie or cholesterol counter.  But oh so yummy!  They serve lots of other things local Hawaii people love, Kalua Pig & Cabbage, Poke, Spam Musubi, and Pork Won Tons.  They also have oxtail soup, saimin, and burgers.Needless to say, we did not finish all of our food and ended up taking half of each of our dishes home.  The leftovers were good reheated too the next day.  Just don't heat up your macaroni salad!  No good on that one.A return visit to this neighborhood gem definitely did not disappoint!My mom was easily sold when she saw Oxtail Soup on the menu!  (No more waiting for California Hotel's Market Street Cafe's late night menu to be available!)* Oxtail Soup "Fresh beef oxtail cooked with ginger until tender." ($9.25) - Sure, it's a bit more expensive than Market Street Cafe's, but we're saving on gas money here! And it's available during the day - big plus!  It comes with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad, so that's always nice.  The oxtail was tender and flavorful, which is super important - and she got a bit more oxtail here too.  It has honking slices of ginger in it, so it has a gingerly broth flavor.  But the best part of all - we don't have to deal with the grumpy service we got over in downtown.Meanwhile, I was super excited that I came on a Friday to order: * Aloha Friday Special "Lau lau served with poke, lomi lomi salmon, haupia, steamed rice, & macaroni salad." ($9.75) - For under $10, I got a lot of food.  The customary two scoops of rice and scoop of mac salad AND poke AND lomi lomi salmon AND dessert!!  And the pork lau lau was ono delicious!  You can't go wrong at Island Flavor, we're glad it's in our neighborhood and definitely hope they stick around.Their only downfall - they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!  (And three weeks in a row, the Husband has wanted to go and I had to remind him that it was Sunday or Monday.)As everyone mentions - portions are really large. For the money, you're getting quite a bit of food. I loved the homey atmosphere and our waitress was very sweet & friendly. Fried poke salad ($10.25) - I was feeling adventurous. I can't say I enjoyed this very much but I guess it's more just my weird tastes. So I love seared tuna and I imagined it'd be like this. The problem with poke is each piece is a different size so the cooking is really uneven. Some pieces were burnt and grey and dry, some were pink and pretty, some weren't cooked at all, etc. I should have realized this before I ordered but that's my loss !Hawaiian mixed plate - we got this with double rice, kalbi short ribs and kahlua pork. My husband was so ecstatic - the first place we've found where you can get the pork with no cabbage mixed in! This was tasty but not as fatty and wonderful as the pork in Hawaii. The kalbi ribs were incredible, husband declared them best ever. Delicious! We'll return - and we'll be getting a big ole platter of kalbi short ribs next time !ALOHA LAS VEGAS yelpers!just moved to Las Vegas and I found myself craving Hawaiian food!Found I.F. on yelp and got super excited!Called in my order and picked it up.I had the mix plate- pork/kalbi, kona coffee mud pie, and shoyu poke.It was my guys 1st time having hawaiian food so I talked him into getting the hamburger steak. I grab 4 spam musubi's at the counter.We loved the food! I'll def come back for more! Take out or dine in. casual. indoor seating.Big serving! My whole order came out to around $50 fpr 2 people.If you love Hawaiian food, stop by Island Flavor!Aloha!- Miss Yelp 2011Aright so I moved to Vegas recently, but so far this is one of my favorite places to eat.  I came here for lunch yesterday with My T. and Thao T. and I have to say it was pretty dang awesome.  I haven't had lunch yet, so I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.Aright, I'm going to give you the low down.  The portions are big here, so I would suggest you go with a couple people, and you guys all try each others' stuff.  These are the 3 things we got, and I'll probably get them again.  1.  Korean Chicken - I have had wings like this once before in my life, and it was called Dry Fried Chicken at a restaurant in San Francisco called San Tung, and they are legit.  I wouldn't make a meal out of this, that's why I'm saying share.  Juiciest wings ever, and that Korean sauce is wicked2.  Kalbi Short Ribs- Again, it's a lot of food, so most people would die if they had this whole plate.  They are so tender, you can pull them off the bone.  I want it now.3.  Baby Back Ribs (can't find on menu for some reason, maybe new item) - My least favorite, but fantastic in the least.  It just doesn't compare to the top 2 items I mentioned.  Owner served us, he's a great guy.  So humble, very chill vibe in the place.  You can tell it's really Hawaiian.  I will come back.You're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youTropical food in L-VDesert oasis, you seePortions big on plate lunchOh how I loved it a bunchYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youPardon the way that I eatSuch island flavors on meatChicken 'yaki sweet and sourChopped steak I quickly devourKalbi ribs were just fineHOISIN RIBS so divineYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youI love you 'FlavaYour food is outta sightI need you 'FlavaOn a hot Vegas nightI love you 'FlavaTrust in me when I sayOh Island FlavorYou beat all the buffetsOh Island FlavorYou truly do amazeAnd so I Yelp! you 'FlavaLet me Yelp! you...You're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of youHaupia cake so creamy lightGuava cake a delightOpakapaka salad so freshBrought goosebumps to my fleshYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my mind off of you I love you 'FlavaYour food is outta sightI need you 'FlavaOn a hot Vegas nightI love you 'FlavaTrust in me when I sayOh Island FlavorYou beat all the buffetsOh Island FlavorYou truly do amazeAnd so I Yelp! you 'FlavaLet me Yelp! you...Yelp 365 Challenge #150/365 (Operation Rice / Las Vegas Adventures)FOR THE WIN!!!In my previous review, I shared that we had an all day that was busy at the Adventuredome then watching the Fountains at the Bellagio. By the time that we reached our vacation rental it was past 8:00 and I asked everyone what did they want to eat for dinner?Everyone replied, "Anything with rice"So, of course, I opened up my trusty Yelp app and typed in local food.Well, waddaya know...there was a local food restaurant, "Island Flavor" RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.If I wanted to weep with joy because I didn't have to drive very far!I wanted to weep further because their menu made our stomachs growl happily.I called up the restaurant to place a takeout order. I shared with her that all the plates were all rice instead of salad. She was really friendly and then asked if we ate brown rice too? I though they ran out of white rice and it didn't bother us to where I shared her that we did. But, she said, "No, I'm going to give you that in a container on the side too." After placing the order, she shared that they close at 10 and if I got there before then and the door was locked, I could just knock on the window and they'll open up for me. If you live near Durango, this place is very easy to find. Sure enough the door was locked but they let us in. After we paid for our food and was loading it up in the car, she came out and told us to wait because they were also including haupia with our plates. YES!!! I didn't win no jackpot but we got some good eats from Island Flavor!!!When we brought the food in the kitchen, everyone just wanted to swoon not only because there was rice but the portions were HUGE.Loco Moco: The hamburger and eggs practically filled the entire plate oozing with gravy.Kalua Pig and Cabbage: This plate was HEAVY because it was loaded with kalua pig and cabbage.Kalbi Short Ribs: Oh my heavens...if you were ordering this plate in Hawaii, you would have three regular size pieces that were cut on the thin side. But, Island Flavor didn't give me three...they gave me FIVE THICK PIECES.Along with these plates, they included shoyu and whatever brings warm fuzzies to a local person who loves local island food. Breakdown of Island Flavor:Food: The menu is extensive. Poke maybe on the pricey side BUT since this is the desert, you have to expect it. Overall, the menu caters to everyone who is visiting or moved to Vegas from the 808 state. I thought it would be like L&L or Loco Moco but nope, their flavors are more of the homecooked style that makes you miss your family back at home in Hawaii.Customer Service: FILLED WITH ALOHAPrices: Reasonable especially because the portions are HUGELocation: Easy to findRestaurant / Ambiance: Just right, clean and family friendlyRecommendation: FIVE STARS...it is a must go-to for anyone who never tried but wants to try local food from Hawaii, 808 visitors or 808 people who moved to Vegas and just misses the food from the islands.Very disappointed! If I had reviewed this before I'm sure they would of gotten 5 stars but after tonight's visit they deserve only 1 for overall service. I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door. Today's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. After the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. Finally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! My blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape. I about had it so I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door made me lose my appetite!After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures of the island, local grinds served, I convinced my work to order lunch for pickup, boss to pay for it and so glad I did. I ordered a katsu chicken loco moco which was infused with great island flavors, which consist of plenty steam rice, katsu chicken seasoned well with a nice breaded crunch, topped with  2 over medium eggs and indulged with rich, carmel gravy along with tasty mac salad on the side. Like Whoa! Did I enjoy every bite, food coma if eaten at one seating but worth it, OH YEAH! Don't know what eveyone else ordered because I was focused on my food but I know everything was a hit since everyone ate what they had ordered, leaving no leftovers for me to pick on the next following work day.Dont know about the in-dining experience yet but the ordering was easy, pickup was fast and the food was a hit. Can't wait for another Island flavor food experience.I often complain about the lack of good eats in the depths of SW Las Vegas.  Sure, we have a few decent spots on Rainbow but i feel like we deserve more place in my neighborhood.  I've probably eaten at about 8 different Hawaiian places in the vegas valley - I give my local place, Island Flavor, the GOLD !First of all, the employees are great - great attitudes, great services and consistent food.  The space is pretty simple - i'm pleased that they recently remodeled the space that resulted in adding more table space.  I've been told by a couple of the employees they make more $$ on catering than the restaurant itself.  I've been in a few times while they've prepped the food for catering events - it's a sight to see !Anyways, the food - large portions, very reasonable prices and good 'ol stick to the ribs style grub !  My personal favs ?  The pork loco moco ( awesome !! ), the korean ribs,  the mac salad,  i REALLY dig the gravy ! and most of desserts.It' all good !!This place has great reviews from Yelpers, so I went with Chad S. to see what was up.  We arrived around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and there were only two tables open, as the place was busy, always a good sign.  I already knew that I wanted Kalbi, so no need to really peruse the menu.  Our friendly waitress took our orders and then our food arrived quickly, which was a great thing because we were hangry.  I was very pleased that I got four big pieces of Kalbi and there was meat on them bones, not a lot of fat, which can happen with this dish.  There were also two big scoops of white rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I ate one scoop of the rice and didn't touch the mac salad, but only because I am trying to be more protein-oriented and eat less of the bad carbs, but you gotta have some rice with your meat, right?  The kalbi looked and tasted like it just came off the BBQ in someone's backyard; after three pieces, I was fully satisfied.  I'm just sad that we couldn't get any of the Spam Musubi before we left.  They have musubi in a warmer next to the cash register so you can buy some to go; they sold out while we were eating.  Oh well, it just gives me an excuse to go back.  Aloha!Came here on a packed Friday, but we were still seated fairly quickly and got to enjoy some chill island music and vibes from the person performing that night. He did a great job making people laugh, having some playful banter and just keeping the overall mood light and fun. Be sure to tip the performer too if you find yourself grooving along :D. I got the Laulau which is usually only available on Friday nights. It contains haupia (coconut-flavored) and smoked fish flavors, but I happen to be a really big fan of those seemingly conflicting tastes and would definitely order it again. The other Hawaiian staples all look delicious here and their portions are huge! You'll definitely have enough food for breakfast or lunch the next day and I would recommend everyone at the table getting something different so you can get a taste of everything. I've also been craving POG since I was last in Hawaii, so I was excited to see that they give 50 cent refills here! I was super appreciative that the owner took time to talk to us on a busy night and welcome us since it was our first time here. He even apologized for the not-so-long wait, which was actually the most enjoyable wait I've ever had at any restaurant. This is definitely a great place to bring friends and family, without the hustle and bustle of the strip.I don't particularly enjoy writing negative reviews, especially for a place that I once loved and highly recommended. Because we absolutely loved their kalbi short ribs, we decided to order a party tray from them. (1/2 pan size kalbi short ribs = $80) Imagine my disappointment when several of the short ribs were blackened, as in burned. They sat on the bottom of the tray and went unnoticed for awhile. We were wondering why our guests weren't eating them and that's when we saw the unsightly pieces. My mom went to the restaurant later on that week to let them know. They took down our phone number and said they would call us to talk about it. No one called. A few months later, my mom returned and went in to talk to them and again was told someone would call us to talk about it. We were told that usually the owner would have checked out our order before it went out, but on that particular day, she came in after we picked up the order. Therefore, she never saw the order go out.  Again, no call from them.Because I was so disappointed with that experience, the food and the lack of customer service, I decided to just not eat there anymore.After almost a year of protesting, we finally decided to order food from there again. I initially tried ordering Pork Lau Lau on a Friday, but was told they didn't have any. I ended up with the combo Kalbi short ribs and furikake shrimp. My short ribs were blackened again! However, the Husband's order of short ribs were just fine. Also, the shrimp just didn't taste that great anymore. My Mom always orders the oxtail soup and always comments on how fatty their version is. You can see chunks of fat on theirs that probably should have been trimmed a little. (I'm all down for a little fat, but theirs is just too much.)Their tuna poke salad, both raw or cooked, was pretty damn good...especially the dressing. But it's since doubled in price and not really worth it anymore. Overall, I'm pretty sad that Island Flavor isn't in our repertoire of food choices these days. Quality and service had just gone down since they first opened and I get a sour taste in my mouth when I think of them now. With their current 4.5 star rating on Yelp, they won't be hurting for business I'm sure.I would drive all the way back to Las Vegas, just to come eat here! It was such a random find...we were driving to Vegas and I was really craving some poke and somehow found this place because it was still open by the time we reached the area. Located off the strip, in a small strip mall with plenty of parking. Upon walking in, I knew we were going to have a nice hawaiian meal. Almost everyone there was hawaiian and there was a guy singing and playing his ukelele. First and foremost, the service here is beyond amazing! The lady running the place is the sweetest. She's fast and efficient, makes great suggestions and she cares so much about her food! And the food...oh my goodness!!!! So yummy. We ordered the shoyu poke as an appetizer. And it was such a large amount...I definitely had my poke fix:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=liUDL0_QkxmQ6GZwxsd8YA&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggI ended up ordering the chicken furikake, which I've never had before but it was suggested:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p_62gNsitkBL2YWYKZDETw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggIt was probably the best thing I've ever had in a long while. It was so good!!! My sasquatch ordered the kalbi short ribs:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hvuk6dldYcVr1aajI25Rrw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqggHe was so hungry he started eating them quickly. The nice lady who was running the place saw that the short rib was slightly undercooked. She was so concerned, even though he didn't mind much. And she ended up putting in a nicely cooked new piece into our to-go boxes. She was so sweet. So definitely it was a 5 star experience for me. The food. The service. It's worth the drive! I miss this place already and wish there was something like this in LA!Food was very good and the portion size is huge so try sharing the dishes. I had teriyaki chicken plateAloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors. With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order. The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating "lechon", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is true to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!Guys at Island Flavor: "Oh, back again, huh?"  Ummm, I totally Yelped this place a week before going to Vegas and came here twice in three days.So I totally live for plate lunch.  Note that my profile's "last meal on earth" is Hawaiian plate lunch, and my home city is surprisingly short on Hawaiian restaurants. (So short the number is zero.) So I had to get a fix in! Or two or five.The meals here are so big that it just hurts. There's a reason why 90% of the bouncers at XS are Samoan. They don't get that kind of mass needed to punch creepy misbehaving guys in clubs by eating salad. I've made 5 meals out of my 2.This is the most legit Hawaiian food I have had in the lower 48. Everything is seasoned well and tastes sooo bombbbbb. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. Service - 5/5 All the waiters working here are legit! Either they got island accents or fake them like bosses. Love how genuinely nice they are. Service is not over-the-top or fake. Just nice people being nice and bringing me tasty things. (If you split a plate, don't forget to tip like you ordered two entrees! These guys won't make sheet otherwise!)Food:Basic menu is on website, but they have a paper insert with daily specials. So if you're calling an order for take-out, ask them if what the specials of the day are! Also, the desserts aren't on the menu. They are listed on the table (see picture). Aloha Friday: Come early so you can get a seat! This place is jam packed on Friday! They have the most amazing family come out and play bass, uke, and guitar while singing traditional Hawaiian music. I grew up on an island, and it felt like coming home. I didn't realize I was getting my soul healed while eating lau lau.- Lau lau- 5/5 wrapped in delicious leaves, juicy, and the perfect saltiness when you eat it with rice!- Lomi salmon- 2/5 This was almost all tomato and no salmon :( I guess it counted as my vegetable of the day?- Mac Salad- the guy asked me "Are you sure?" when I said I was fine with the mac salad and white rice. Was he expecting me to sub a vegetable instead? Please, bee-atch. I'm not from California.- Kalbi ribs- 5/5 These are BOMB! Way thick slices and grilled with a nice caramelization on them! They don't skimp, and the pieces are super big! - Furikake chicken- 5/5 Super crunchy exterior so that it stands up to the glaze and stays super crunchy. You know how Panda Express orange chicken gets all soft if it's been sitting there awhile? No flaccid chicken here, folks.- Haupia cake- 5/5 I used to work at a bakery on island, and we made haupia cake. Theirs here is even better. The cake itself is perfect density, and the flavor is dynamite.- Kona pie- 2/5 Ehhhh eat the haupia and guava cake instead! The coffee flavor isn't strong, and the other sauces they schlepp on the plate overpower any coffee taste.I'm glad this place isn't in my home city. I'm not looking for employment as a Samoan bouncer at XS quite yet, which is what I would probably be if I lived in Vegas and continued eating here. Fill up on aloha spirit, leave happy, and then go take a nap.This was my first foray into eating Hawaiian food other than just trying some of these items from a buffet.  Three of us came here to share plates and try a number of different things.  Items ordered:1/2 portion poke furikake styleChicken katsu and kalua pig mixed plateKalbi short ribs and shrimp mixed plateRoast pork loco moco1 musubi Banana bread puddingChantilly cakeGuava cakeHaupia cakeKona coffee mudd pieThere were three standouts in the savory items ordered--kalua pig, kalbi short ribs, and roast pork loco moco.  I've been a fan of kalua pig and this did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were grilled perfectly with the meat being very juicy.  I thought the marinade was a little sweet and I didn't care for the flavor of the small container of sauce we got in a small container.  The loco moco was good as far as the pork was concerned and the gravy was good.  There was just so much rice that everything else got lost in the rice.The two combination plates we got both came with two large scoops of rice and one large scoop of macaroni salad.  There was just an overwhelming amount of rice.  The macaroni salad was quite good.I enjoy poke but this was different than other poke I've had.  The tuna was crunchy in texture and not soft like other times I've gotten poke.  I don't know which is the way it's supposed to be.  The furikake flavors were good.  I'd skip the musubi.  A whole lot of rice with only a small piece of spam inside.  For the sweet items, we got smiles from the server when we started ordering.  At one point he said, "You do know we have large portions?"  With a laugh, our order continued until we had four slices of cake and a banana bread pudding.  Standouts here were the banana bread pudding and the guava cake.  My favorite was the guava cake.  The Haupia was nothing special and the chantilly was a bit disappointing.  Understand that I would not turn down any of these if offered to me, but I wouldn't order those.  I found the Kona coffee mud pie disappointing.  Stick with the guava.Now I know why my friend, Candace C, says in her review that ..."this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-­elastic-band-before-­coming kind of food."  Service was OK.Items Selected:Half-Pound Furikake Style PokeSpam Musubi Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pig mixed plateKalbi Short Ribs and Furikake Shrimp mixed plateRoast Pork Loco MocoBanana Bread PuddingChantilly CakeGuava CakeHaupia CakeKona Coffee Ice Cream Mud Pie No doubt a neophyte regarding Hawaiian culture as well as cuisine it was with two friends that I sat down amidst the spacious confines of Island Flavor for dinner Saturday night, and going in with modest expectations based on what could be gleaned from reviews of those more accustomed the results were at times precisely what I'd hoped for, and occasionally far better than I'd originally been led to believe.Admittedly at least 'familiar' with some of the styles comprising the genre, a number of Asian influences  noted amidst fried and roast meats with rich sauces rarely lacking in salt, it was just moments after 5:15 that I entered the sparsely decorated space and with the room half-filled by a mix of ethnicities that included several island natives it would not be long before drinks were filled and menus were navigated, a three-course feast soon to follow as  light mid-tempo music echoed from speakers overhead.Well trained in service, the majority of the staff clearly longtime employees of the restaurant and happy to answer questions related to portions as well as preparation, it was with a duo of cultural staples that the sampling of Island Flavors began, and although neither would have been a preferred order if dining on my own both the snappy tuna and  Spam Musubi proved mostly what was anticipated, the former loaded with umami while the later, perhaps fortunately, saw the saline pork product mostly lost within the roll of warm rice. Warned that portions run large despite costs that hover around $10 per plate, it was onward to three entrees that the evening progressed, and although the fried shrimp were a bit overcooked while the chicken was mostly flavorless without sauce, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in either the smoky shortrib or tender kalua pig, an equally well cooked piece of pork found strewn amidst rice beneath two sunny-side eggs and a rich brown gravy that, on its own, could have likely served a family of four.Leaving at least four cups of rice behind, along with a few bites of macaroni salad that was actually quite enjoyable with plenty of creaminess packed in each bite, it was with an "all-in" approach that sweets were ordered up, and despite warnings and raised eyebrows from more than one staff-member the finale to follow was almost entirely worth the indulgence, the $5.50 Mud Pie a bit of a disappointment due to gritty ice cream while each cake from nearby Andrea's was presented at a bargain $5 per large slice, the faintly coconut Haupia not unlike something one might find at a wedding while the chantilly and guava came across sweet yet balanced, the quivering bread pudding taking a far less subtle approach with each banana-packed spoonful making a strong case for best in the city, or at the very least a good reason to come back.Purporting no expertise in Hawaiian cuisine, but hoping to learn more in the coming months and years, Island Flavor represents a tremendous bargain to those looking for something familiar yet different with service and setting far superior to most eateries broadly grouped as 'ethnic,' the desserts a particular strong point even if they are mostly outsourced.
Fireside Grill=#104I arrived at the Fireside Grill after a really HOT day in Arizona last May (yes, it took me a bit to post my review).  I was looking for something refreshing and comforting to relieve me from this tough, hot, steamy day.  A friend suggested the Fireside Grill in Fountain Hills.  Sounds great.We entered the place and the bartender/manager Louis greeted us in a super friendly manner, welcoming my group to the establishment.  We took a seat at the open bar area and began watching TV--they were showing the Baltimore situation as it unfolded.  Louis asked me what would I like to drink as I looked over the menu.  I ordered a drink and began to ask Louis about the menu.  He offered several suggestions; however, I (and my companions) decided on a few items:The Southwest Chicken SaladThe Cobb SaladThe Pasta and MeatballsThe Southwest Chicken Salad was incredible.  It was served in a toasted tortilla bowl with beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, olives, avocado, and sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The Cobb salad was good, not amazing.  This salad was replete with tiny chunks of turkey, bacon, thinly sliced egg, fresh blue cheese and whatever dressing we chose.  It was a large portion, but kinda boring.  Finally, we had the penne pasta and meatballs with marinara sauce.  This pasta dish came with garlic bread layered with melted cheese and a small side salad.  The place is clean, and open, looking out onto a pool and the valley.  Live music was preset with a singer.  Many regular guests were there as Louis knowingly greeted several customers as they arrived.  The service from Louis was impeccable.  He was attentive, friendly and informative.  Stephani Smiles for Fireside Grill ;)
House of Leng=2.5 starsThis is my sister's go-to resto for Chinese in Charlotte, and I can see why: House of Leng's serves tasty rice and lo mein dishes, as well as fantastically crispy and flavorful chicken wings, and it's next door to her favorite nail salon.  Whenever we get a mani/pedi, which we almost always do when I fly in for a visit, we usually do take-out at HoL before heading back to her home.I'd probably rate today's visit 3- or 3.5 stars had my take-out order not taken more than the eight minutes I was told it would take for the wings to cook, which the guy even apologized would be the reason I'd have to wait a bit, and had I received the shrimp lo mein entree (for Mom) I'd asked for, rather than the shrimp lo mein combo that Mom found after we'd already arrived home.  (Btw, the wait for the order was around 25 minutes.)Still, Mom and sis enjoyed the meal (the eggroll looked so delicious and had a very delectable-sounding crunch!), so three stars will do.  However, I wished I didn't have to suffer the blame for HoL staff getting the order wrong...
HK Star=This place is flippin fantastic!!  A new restaurant from a bunch of ex-KJ Kitchen employees.  The menu is quite similar but the atmosphere and service are certainly a step up.  They don't have their liquor license yet so people were coming in w/ bottles of wine and 18 packs of beer!We went with the ginger lobster, crab and fish maw soup, sauteed green beans, jellyfish and squid in XO sauce and they gave us a cold chicken dish on the house.  Every dish was insanely good w/ the lobster blowing everyone away at the table.  I think this might be my new favorite Chinese restaurant in town!!!Went solo for lunch today at HK Star. It was an impromptu decision to get lunch here, since I was originally planning to go get dim sum with some classmates afterclass. But being the first week of school, things were hectic and things rarely goes according to plan.Anyway, I figure since I was in the area taking care of errands, I will drive a few more blocks to try another new item on the HK Star lunch special menu. I have typically ordered the more expensive items, so decided I want to try something from the $4.95 portion of the menu.  Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting, and I have never ordered it and would like to find out what exactly is HK Style Chow Fun.When the waiter came, that was what I told him I wanted "Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" (#8 on the $49.5 lunch special menu - okay I didn't say the #8 part of it).  He said theone with the gravy. I have never ordered it, so I said sure. He also wanted to confirm that I wanted Chow Fun, because on the menu the Chow Mein option is also available, and I said yes.  He looked a little confused to me, and I repeated the order again in Mandarin "Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" and off he went to punch in the order in the POS.Minutes later, a generous plate of chow fun with gravy and vegetables, shrimp, chicken and fish arrived.  I was hungy for the past 2 hours so I took a quick picture and dug in.  The food was delicious, and I was thinking this is a great deal for $4.95. I ate the entire plate of chow fun without being interrupted by the wait staff.  It wasn't until the very end when I have ate everything that the waiter who took me to the table brought over the check.When I saw the bill, I realized the fantastic deal was a mistake, because they have made me "House Pan Nood, sub Chow Fun", which I interpretted as House Pan Friend Noodles made with Chow Fun and asking me for $6.51 for my lunch. I was annoyed enough to write a comment on the bill that I "asked for Hong Kong Style Chow Fun" and left my $7 for lunch. I figured besides taking my order wrong and delivering the food and provided no additional service, such as asking if everything was okay or if I needed more tea or water, that was what was earned.So downgrading my rating to 4 stars solely on the poor listening skill, not knowing the menu and non-existent service.  I feel had I called my order ahead and the regular waiter took my order, I would have been given what I ordered. Or my experience today at HKS was due to being stuck with the crappy waiter that some other Yelper have complained about.  Hopefully next time the ordering process will be better, and if I sense any confusion in the waiter repeating back my order, I will just have to point to it on the menu to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.Came in for dinner after experiencing LA Reve. I was reluctant after my last experience  here at lunch but I was craving seafood. It was a Tuesday evening so the parking lot wasn't crazy like a weekend.They were running a special  - purchase 3 entrees and get lobster for $10.00 a pound. Ended up ordering clams with basil, rock cod stir fried with Chinese veggies, Mongolian beef and lobster with green onions and ginger. All the seafood was fresh tasting and solid (They brought me the lobsters live to approve). My least favorite was the Mongolian beef which was spicy to my surprise. The waiter who was a younger Vietnamese gent spoke perfect English and was funny conical but was on the spot with service. What a difference compared to my last visit.Overall a enjoyable solid meal for less then half a La Reeve show ticket!I don't normally eat Chinese food. But when I do, I prefer something good.Sorry, I couldn't figure out a satisfying conclusion to that catchphrase. But Chinese food isn't something that I tend to crave. It doesn't come to my mind as really must-eat since it became mundane territory with wedding banquets and dinners with relatives growing up. Long story short, I've rarely eaten it in Vegas.However, an opportunity came today when several friends gathered at HK Star for dinner. It was my first time here, so I mostly deferred to others for ordering. We ended up having more than enough for all of us.- "Spicy" jellyfish ($9.95): always seems like more of a textural experience for me than something that I seek out for a special flavor, but it was crunchy enough and came with pickled onions. I didn't really detect any heat when I ate it. I'd skip it unless you specifically like jellyfish or want to try it.- Minced chicken with sweet corn thick soup ($9.95): they bring out your large bowl and then ladle it into smaller bowls at the table. Much better than the last corn soup I had, but let's not dwell on it. Definitely solid flavor in the corn, egg, and chicken in this soup.- Honey walnut shrimp ($14.95): I specifically ordered this. The shrimp were cooked fine, although they could have been more crunchy. Good flavor, not overly drenched with sauce, and plenty of chopped honey walnuts. I usually prefer whole walnuts, but these were fine.- Deep-fried flounder ($23.95): my favorite dish of the night. Tender, delicious fried fish that you'd expect to get from a Chinese restaurant.- Chinese broccoli ($9.95): I'm not a vegetable aficionado really, but these were crunchy and juicy. They are worth an order.- Seafood, dry scallop and egg white fried rice ($14.95): tasty enough and not overly fatty, but I wasn't that impressed when considering the price. My friends definitely loved it though.- Roast duck ($19.95 for a "whole" order): a little less sweetness than you might find elsewhere, but juicy and flavorful.- Lobster, breaded and fried ($94.27 for 4.5 lbs at current market price): They pulled a lobster for us to look at when we were ordering, then took it back to the kitchen. It came out tasting pretty good, and it was cooked properly except for the claw piece that I had (too mushy there), more of the salty flavor is in the breading than in the actual lobster meat. I would probably try a different lobster preparation next time.- Complimentary hot dessert soup: delicious and not overly sweet.They probably have a pretty big kitchen in the big. Despite a fairly crowded dining room, our dishes all came out quickly and in quick succession, requiring some careful manipulation of the Lazy Susan and the other free table space to hold all the dishes satisfactorily. A server helped out a little over halfway through by giving us fresh plates and taking away the old ones with bones and mixed sauces. Decor is certainly on the nicer side for a Chinese restaurant.At the end of the night, I felt satisfied with most of the dishes. I have no problem coming back here for Chinese food should the craving actually strike.
Arcadia Tavern=Looks like I get the FTR on this one... hooray!Recently opened in the last few days, Arcadia Tavern took over where Red Tomato used to live on 48th Street and Indian School.  The space is awesome and has an outdoor patio, spacious bar area and restaurant as well.  Plasma TVs are all over the place, so there is definitely something for everyone to watch... perfect for sports fans!  It's family-friendly too - I think there is complimentary wii for the kids!  In addition, for those over 21 that have one too many, they've got cruisers you can ride home and bring back the next day if necessary.  This is the perfect neighborhood tavern for those that want to hang out - day or night.  The staff is super friendly and totally on top of their game - we had no complaints dining there on one of the first nights they were open.  Attentive service, reasonable prices, and fabulous food in a laid back, fun environment - that's my kind of place!Jared and I met friends at Arcadia Tavern for dinner... We started with chips with salsa and guacamole and the meatball slider app for the table - both were tasty and we cleaned our plates!I went with the roasted veggie salad as my entree (love that although it's bar food, they offer healthy options).  I had them add chicken for protein and even though I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken, I was a fan of theirs!  Jared had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with seasoned fries and the others shared a salad and a Tavern Burger with tots.  I admit it... I stole a tot and it was yummy - reminds me of the good ol' days of school lunches!We skipped dessert even though we heard that the Arcadia Chocolate Chip Cookie (Baked in a skillet warm and gooey, served with chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice cream) is worth the splurge... I have a feeling we'll be back soon to try that and to visit our new favorite local tavern.Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.I was going to write a two word update.And those two words would have been "Tot Cho's"...a thoroughly delightful creation that they serve at the Arcadia Tavern...Tater Tots with nacho stuff all over them:) Yeah, that's right...nacho tot's!The Beautiful Carin and I beginning to make a nuisance of ourselves here:)Fixtures, denizens, habituates...The patio has become a bit of a "home away from home" (but with drink's that I don't have to mix myself:)We keep showing up:)Last week, Carin correctly guessed the number of golf balls in the vase in the entryway, and she won us free drinks and food:)Matt (the owner) is thinking of adopting us (although that would technically make Carin and I brother and sister...both creepy and hot at the same time:)We haven't had a bad meal or bad experience yet...tonight they had a Jimmy Buffett (or Boofay, for my friend Ryan) clone , softly playing guitar and singing during happy hour:)I am happy:)Stopped by Arcadia Tavern tonight around 9:15 pm and it was packed... Granted, it was a perfect evening to be outside for an August night in Phoenix.  The entire patio was full, the bar area had not an empty seat, and from the looks of it, the restaurant was doing some decent biz as well.  Jack Young was the singer/guitar player rockin' the place with tunes from Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffet, and more.  I'd already eaten dinner, but Jared shared a bite of his miso salmon (with rice and asparagus) and it was delicious.  I'm writing this update partially to let it be known that this is just one of the new menu options along with chicken parm, steak salad, edamame, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, caprese, chopped, and cobb salads.  I guess the feedback made its way to management... I am pleased with the new variety of healthy choices.  Robert, the Chef, came out to say hello - or perhaps we caught him red handed having a drink at the bar... either way, it was nice to see him. I'll be back on my own sometime soon to order my own miso salmon... and if not me, you'll likely find Jared drinkin' a Guinness at the bar.  Cheers!I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...REVIEWUninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.Fish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:Fish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk. Anatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop. Tots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Olé for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.I want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream "short-term, dabbling in the industry business model".Will update after another visit. Maybe.I sometimes feel as if I am wildly misunderstood by restaurant staff.  Yes, I appreciate specials on booze. I learn them, I study them, I remember them. Give me a day of the week and it's likely I will be able to list of 3 or more booze specials going on in any given area at any given time.  This is not because I'm cheap. This is because I'm a lush.  My bar tab is going to be high, no matter how much the drinks cost, so just get me as drunk as possible and you will be rewarded handsomely.That said, I was super stoked to find out that after ditching our former trivia location, we were going to give Arcadia Tavern a try for their Tuesday Night Trivia.  Partially because trivia is super fun. And partially because, upon doing my due diligence, I learned that not only are Tuesday nights $20 Wine and Pizza Night, but they also offer 1/2 Price Any Bottle of Wine Mon-Thurs from 9 PM- Close!  Guess what day is in between Monday and Thursday? TUESDAY! It's like I hit the booze special lottery! Upon sitting down we immediately got our wine and pizza on.  This special is not nearly as awesome as Postino's $20 Bruschetta and a Bottle deal, also on Tuesday nights. For one, only 2 bottles of wine are offered, whereas Postino gives you a choice of ANY FREAKING BOTTLE OFF THEIR MENU.  Secondly, it's limited to one per table. So if there's 4 of you and you're all a little hungry and a lot thirsty and would like to split 2 pizzas and a couple bottles of wine, you only get to use the special once. Kinda lame, but I guess I understand (though Postino does not limit you whatsoever, and that is why I love them).So we start trivia, eat our pizza, drink our wine, have a couple beers and 9:00 rolls around . We grab our waitress and ask if we can begin partaking in the excellent half-price bottle special they have going on Mon-Thurs from 9:00 PM to close.  We were told that no, we could not.  We apparently already used our special for the day when we ordered the Pizza and Wine special. This perplexed us.  When you go to a restaurant for happy hour. And then, say, happy hour turns into happy 4 hours and you happen to still be at the restaurant by time their nightly specials kick in, do you not get to partake in both? And do you not call it a Happy Booze Sandwich?  Ok maybe you don't, considering I just made that term up, but I doubt anyone has ever been denied cheap booze on account of previously imbibing cheap booze at the same establishment. We also wondered if we shot ourselves in the foot ordering the pizza and wine deal at 7:00 PM when we could have waited until 9 and had half price bottles ALL NIGHT LONG. We asked the waitress and apparently we did not, because in Arcadia Tavern world "Half Price Bottles of Wine from 9PM to Close" really means "One Half Price Bottle of Wine per Table from 9PM to Close".  WTF? How they expect to compete with any other special at that time with this lame ass promotion is beyond me. We have Vig down the street with $5 martinis, Postino with $20 Bruschetta and a Board. Hell, even Zipps will give you $3 premium pints from 8PM to close and this is AFTER lubing you up with $3 Zipparitas from 3-7.Basically, I was fully planning on putting Arcadia Tavern in constant rotation on my weekly booze session calendar, but they clearly can't handle it. I've been here a couple time and the food and service has always been okay, so I guess I'll give them 3 stars. But I'm still going to the Vig on Tuesdays.My friends have all said this place was great, and I was really excited to check it out. Well, it may be really cool, but we had an awful experience with one of the managers from the second we sat down. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and we were quickly carded (we're 24, but look about 18) which was fine.  I never, EVER mind being carded. I was a server for a long time so I get it. But the manager walked over and proceeded to interrogate my boyfriend like he was a 15-year old who just snuck into a rated R movie-- just because his ID was a little haggard.  He peaked smugly back and forth from my boyfriend to the ID making rude jokes and belittling remarks. Once he was done with the investigation, and after he had scanned the ID (why he didn't just scan it in the first place, I do not know), he hesitantly handed my boyfriend his card back like he just gave a toddle chocolate. SO MUCH ATTITUDE.So I angrily asked him why he had to be so rude about it. "I understand that we look very young but I don't know why you had to make him feel uncomfortable. I get carded often, but I've never had anyone be so rude. You were very belittling." And then he replies, "Seriously? You think I was being rude? That's totally not true. I'm sorry you THINK I'm being rude."And then he proceeded to argue with me on whether or not he was being a polite person. I was a server for four years on mill avenue, and I have never, ever treated anyone that way while carding them. And the thing is, if some one IS of age, you do not want to piss them off because, DUH, they're buying your product. They're giving you money. So why have attitude? The manager never actually apologized or offered to remedy the situation at all. He just judged us as teenage hoodrats instead of young working professionals that we are. So we left. Go ahead and give this place a try, but make sure you look rich, dress well and have 15 forms of ID available. You don't want to be judged.  Oh and stay away from the short, stubby manager in glasses with a smug grin-- he'll make your skin crawl.Arcadia Tavern is one of my top five favorite places to wash sports in the Valley. With a bar on the right side and restaurant style seating on the left side, it's a solid sports bar for either a family or young professionals looking to have some cocktails and bar food.  Since I am kid-less, I normally hang out on the right side. If people complain about walking into empty bars in the Valley, then head over to Arcadia Tavern because on a game night, chances are you won't be able to find an empty seat there. But don't let that deter you because it's worth staying for a seat to open up. I like Arcadia Tavern for several types of occasions: if I'm looking for a place to watch the game, to have some food and drinks before going out or to eat lunch on a weekend afternoon. The patio is great and when the weather's nice, it's a must visit. Arcadia Tavern is in a random location within Arcadia but it's perfect neighborhood joint with so many houses nearby. Parking can be a bit tough so you might want to park across the street and walk. As for food, this is your classic neighborhood bar so it has all American food. The burger is great and I normally go for the BBQ chicken sandwich. If you're a fan of nachos, give those a try. So if you're looking for a neighborhood bar with TVs and a fun atmosphere, you should check out Arcadia Tavern.Listen, if you love bars that cater to locals and also are super accommodating for first-timers, this is the place.  Great options on tap, super sweet and prompt bartenders and honestly really good food.  This joint is an A plus...go!
Society Cafe Encore=We stayed at Encore and we decided to have lunch here. Boy, did we choose the wrong place.1. They have a thing called "stop-seating", where they take a couple of parties, seat them, stop the line from moving for 30 minutes, then repeat. Why they do this when they have a bunch of empty tables available for seating? I have no clue.2. The menu is very limited and when we finally ordered, it took more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive, AND we weren't served any bread baskets, when other tables clearly had. How long does it take to make some scrambled eggs and toast? Definitely not 30-40 minutes. The toast were also completely burnt, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer. My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy. My main dish, a Ham & Cheese sandwich, didn't come out for another 20 minutes.3. The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 20 minutes for our bill.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, and 90 minutes of that was spent waiting including waiting to be seat). If the food was delicious, all may have been forgiven, but the food was mediocre and pricey considering quality and quanitity.I'm never eating here again.If not for photos, and reviews posted by Betty and Cindy, I wouldn't really be able to go into detail about what we ate here. I was not hungover, but completely buzzed all throughout dinner. However, I do remember that my tastebuds were happy about what was consumed. I didn't really have much of an appetite, but everyone seemed to force me to eat each of my 3-courses. We started with mac 'n' cheese bites, which were the perfect combination of two of my favorite comfort foods: mac 'n' cheese and tater tots. The dipping sauce (I think it had truffle oil in it) was so yummy. I chose to go all out on carbs and got the trenne pasta with prosciutto for my main entree. I think this also had truffle oil in the sauce. The triangular penne pasta was delicious. For dessert, we had the donut balls. I'm pretty sure the caramel sauce I had with it did NOT have truffle oil in it.Our server Todd (thanks for refreshing my memory, Cindy), and the Assistant GM Patrick were both very accommodating and friendly. Even though they had taken off the petite filet mignon from the $36 prix-fixe menu, they were still able to offer them to us since the concierge had told us it would be available. Although we missed out on a fabulous dinner at Mix at Mandalay Bay, I'm glad we went with Plan B and came here. Again, thank goodness for photos.Any restaurant that can successfully host a wedding party and actually provide good food - from the hors d'oeuvres to the appetizers to the main entrees - definitely deserves at least 4 stars. In fact, I still dream about the appetizers: buffalo wing "lollipops", the best crab cakes I've ever had, and fried mac-n-cheese balls (drool-worthy pictures provided). The cafe itself is chic (almost excessively so) and the friendly-yet-aloof service is exactly what you'd expect at a fashionable cafe named Society. Overall, I had a great experience there and definitely want to go back for a regular dinner and some more of their yummy mojitos.*EDIT*Misti Y. made me realize that I should clarify something: it wasn't MY wedding =)I have not been so excited for a meal since I ate at Alex. Wynn really, really has it going on for us vegans. I heard through the grapevine that multiple outlets in the Wynn now serve s fast food-esque meal - cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake made with coconut milk ice cream. And it's $9. Upon hearing this, my husband and I practically ran out of the door. With a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this meal out at Society Cafe. It has an open atmosphere to which you can people-watch which is fun. The seating and design of the cafe is impeccable - gigantic, bright pink sofas, black & white, and soft lime green is a very soothing yet hip palette to me. When we walked up to the hostess, she immediately asked us if we wanted a vegan menu. Very nice that I didn't have to ask! We were seated and greeted by our server Michel, who upon hearing our order exclaimed with genuine delight that we were really going to enjoy our meal. This made me even more excited! He also automatically told us he would bring out vegan bread and butter. Upon doing so he remembered a second kind of bread, some pretzel sticks, were also vegan which he brought out too! Great customer service for sure. The fast food meal was adorable. The cheeseburger (which looked like a 100% doppelgänger for a certain famous golden-arched restaurant's burger) was wrapped up in foil; the fries were in a cardboard sleeve. The two hot items were in a cardboard half-box, all served on top of a white rectangular plate. And the chocolate shake was in a Wynn plastic cup with a really thick straw which was great for drinking. The burger I adored, although I passed off the pickles to the husband. I think the Gardein patty might have been slightly overcooked, or it might need some light seasoning... it wasn't as juicy as it could have been, and was a little bland, but overall I liked it; I really want to know what kind of "cheese" they used! The fries were delicious, and the milkshake was TO DIE FOR. I could seriously have that every single day. IN LOVE! The meal was beyond delightful, and the customer service was wonderful to boot. Michel really made the experience pleasurable, and answered every question quite knowledgeably. Even when he wasn't sure, he asked and got back to us in a very timely manner. We asked him about a dessert area in another part of the hotel to which he got the hostess (her name escapes me, but she was brilliant) who divulged that she was a vegetarian and tried her best to get us some answers, and spent some time chatting with us. She was very nice and extremely helpful and both her and Michel went above and beyond to make our meal lovely. I think this might start to be a weekly thing for me. Not only is this meal affordable, but the Wynn has really turned into a haven for vegans. Not once did I get an eye-roll, or was made to feel like I was annoying or asking too much. I felt really accepted at this restaurant, and I love that even the staff enjoys the food and can really talk to it with their customers. Society Cafe really pulled out all of the stops even for our humble meal, and I can't wait to come back for more!High SocietyAfter reading up on all the restaurants that grace the Encore property, I was pretty much set on stopping by this trendy cafe during my next Vegas visit! ::ENTER BACHELORETTE PARTY OF 8::Alas, the bride-to-be decided that Society Cafe was the place for us to dine before we head down the hall to party it up @ Surrender Nightclub. I made a reservation for 9pm as we did some last minute errands & got ready for our extravagant Saturday night rendezvous. Limo driver, you're FIRED for dropping us off at the Wynn entrance. Oh well, I guess we could use the walk through the casino from indulging in the sinful meal we were about to consume. Upon arrival, we checked in at the host stand and waited an additional 10 minutes to be seated. No biggie.Service was nice and professional. She took care of us but we could have definitely seen her more often. It's all good though since we were graced with the presence of the "food runner/server assistant" to grab dishes off our table. Now for the food.. our table ordered several different menu items as well as some chef specials. Let me tell you what was a hit and what was a miss during our Saturday night visit (excuse me for not knowing the real names)..HIT: *Fried Mac & Cheese: the truffle dipping sauce was amazing!*Beet Salad w/goat cheese: Yes, its tiny but the warm goat cheese hit the spot*Caprese Salad*Filet Mignon w/Bearnaise sauce: top notch filet but the Bearnaise wasn't as exquisite as I'd like it to beNot very good:*Vegan burger: it was just real plain and not very fancy for being here*Mushroom Pasta: two friends got this dish & said it was not good and very buttery- BLAH!*Lollipop chicken wings: ehhh! Not worth the 12 bucksThose dishes were worth mentioning for your reference. Anywho, I do like this place even though my main entree wasn't very yummy. Next time I'll have to try another option on the vegan menu or stop by during Happy Hour!***Society Cafe Encore offers a good and upscale breakfast; their steak and egg sliders are expensive but satisfying***I am not sure if Society Cafe Encore is Encore's cafe, but it is a lot different from the other casino cafes I have tried.  Society Cafe, which opens up to the casino, has a much more distinct and striking decor.  Society Cafe has a mix of traditional elegance and modern decor (the kind of mishmash decor I've often seen in West Hollywood places like The Bazaar or the now closed XIV).The decor raised my expectations for the food and the breakfast menu featured many nice sounding dishes.  There was an abundant use of premium ingredients throughout the menu.I went with the ultimate steak and egg sliders, which were featured on The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The sliders consisted of filet mignon, scrambled egg and creamed spinach on bacon and cheddar muffins.  The sliders were good.  Even though the individual components were not excellent, they did combine to make a satisfying sandwich (but maybe not an exceptional sandwich like the fried egg sandwich at Huckleberry in Santa Monica).The scrambled eggs were moist and I liked the creamed spinach even though I wish it had more flavor.  The filet mignon was meaty and savory though I wish it was cooked more medium rare or at least medium.  While the filet mignon was not dry, I would have preferred more juiciness (I do understand this type of temperature in a sandwich though since you don't want the redness of the meat to combine with the muffin to make an unappetizing color).While the bacon flavor of the muffins was not that strong, the muffin was still cheesy and flavorful and had a good combination of softness as well as a crisp and distinct edge.I also had the pain au chocolat (the order was actually 2 small chocolate croissants). The mini chocolate croissants were similar to the ones at Breadbar in Century City.  The croissants were flaky, crispy and chocolatey (I think the pain au chocolat at Breadbar has a more even chocolate flavor--a noticeable chocolate flavor with each bite).  I liked the pain au chocolat at Society Cafe Encore much more than the same pastry at Bouchon Bakery (in the Venetian)--more flakiness and more chocolate.Service was very good.  My waitress was very personable, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.Prices were high for breakfast, but that is common on The Strip where restaurants tend to be anywhere from 15% to 40% more than what you would pay in a city like LA.  Still, Society Cafe was not that much more expensive than some of the other casino cafes and the difference in quality was very noticeable.I enjoyed Society Cafe Encore and it was my best casino cafe experience in Las Vegas so far.  I would definitely consider coming back on future Vegas trips to try other menu items.I am not sure what the parking situation is, but I imagine Encore offers both valet and self-parking.This is still the best breakfast bet at the Wynn. We got a smoothie, a green juice and steel cut oats to go for our car ride home and everything was fresh and healthy. Just what I needed! There aren't very many healthy options while you are in Vegas so this is a gem when you are in need of something healthy in the morning!Society Cafe advertised their daily happy hour on the casino floor and since we stayed at Encore, we figured this would be a good stop to get some drinks and food in us before the gambling and all-night partying began.Their HH drinks are two-for-one of either domestic beers (no thanks!), mojitos (classic, pineapple, or watermelon), or their Society sangria (red with rioja and Grand Marnier or white with cava and Remy Martin). We started with the white sangria, which was phenomenal. Too often white sangrias are simply too sweet, but this sangria was well balanced in flavor, the cava gave it a nice fizz, and the Remy gave it a good richness and oaky notes. We ordered another round of those and for our third round we opted for the watermelon mojitos. Those were refreshing and tasty, yet I preferred the white sangria.For HH food, they offered a list of 4 appetizers from which you can pick three, as well as a flatbread, two different slider options, and fish & chips. We picked the Pulled Pork Sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#o_dYFC2NbX9J2Fdfi4FeTQ) topped with virginia slaw and butter pickles and served with a side of sweet potato fries. The sliders were juicy and delicious, the slaw and pickles giving the mini burgers a good crunchy texture to offset the soft meat and sauce. I loved the crispy sweet potato fries and the mini bottle of ketchup that they serve on the side is just frickin' adorable! From the 4-option list of small appetizers, we picked the Mac 'N Cheese "Bites", the "Lollipop" Chicken Wings, and Grandma Rose's Meatballs, deciding to forgo the Crispy Rock Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#SifqxmBDGINvsYDstK_Qew). However, they punched our order in wrong and we received the rock shrimp instead of the meatballs. That was quickly rectified, although after seeing the caper aioli that was served alongside the shrimp, I was sad they took the dish away to swap it with the meatballs rather than letting us have both. The Mac 'N Cheese Bites were definitely our favorite. Greasy pasta and cheese made into little tater tot battered looking things and served with an insane truffle dipping sauce. Once all the Bites were gone, we started dipping our sweet potato fries into the sauce. I then proceeded to dip my finger into the sauce to make sure none of the heavenly concoction was wasted. The meatballs were pretty decent, but the tomato sauce lacked excitement. Maybe some spice could have helped elevate it to the next level. The buffalo chicken wings had a perfect spiciness to them and I'll never say no to cold blue cheese dipping sauce!Having read about their amazing pretzel bread on other Yelp reviews while sipping on our cocktails, I asked the bartender for some. She said they usually only serve it with dinner, but she made an exception and got us an order. The bread was warm, had a good saltiness in the pretzel dough and was paired with an amazing mustard butter.I would certainly come back for the food and would definitely come back for more sangria! The decor here is stunning, making want that interior decorator for my place! Cream walls and ceilings, black & white curtains draped everywhere and nicely accented red couches make this place super chic and modern.Since I was staying at Encore, it was only appropriate to have a meal at Society Cafe.  And that appropriate time for me would be for breakfast.  It was a very good way to start off my day before heading out to the Strip.Right off the bat I already knew that I would be picking up their Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders.  It totally stuck out from the rest of the menu and it's pretty obvious that that's what they want you to order.  To go with it, I went an interesting choice and decided to try one of their blended juices, The Green Monster.The Green Monster - Cucumbers, Celery, Spinach, Fennel, Green Apples, Parsley & Ginger. CHEERS!!! --  http://bit.ly/Z3dr2FThis was a very invigorating juice blend but it was pretty tasty as well.  Not sure if it was exactly the right pairing for the Sliders, but it did the job.  Plus it also made up for the lack of fruits and veggies I didn't have the day before.The Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders - Filet Mignon, Scrambled Eggs, Creamed Spinach, Bacon Cheddar Muffin --  http://bit.ly/11dtlDUJust reading the description is good enough to build your appetite.  At first I was a little discouraged when the waiter said that you only get two, but when you look at the picture, you could probably understand why.  These sliders were big!  The fact that there were mini filets inside just upped the ante with any typical burger slider.  These were really good.  The filets were cooked perfectly that they weren't tough when you bit into them, but instead were really soft and easy to chew.  The bacon cheddar muffins were awesome and the creamed spinach and eggs helped the sliders all come together.  They were definitely Ultimate!!Overall, solid restaurant and worth dining at if you're staying at Encore or Wynn.  It definitely made for a great breakfast!Society Cafe Encore offers a slightly more casual venue for brunch. It's a more open and airy sort of area, and service was less formal than somewhere like Tableau. Sirloin and egg sliders:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HMGpW7k88K5ScfnkWh93CQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I'd heard great things about these sliders, and our server recommended them to us as well. I liked the cook on the sirloin and it did taste like quality beef, but the overall concoction was much too heavy for brunch. The bread on the outside was even fried (I believe?), and it felt like a heart attack slider. I might order these again as a late-night munchie, but perhaps not as a breakfast or brunch dish..Egg white frittata with goat cheese:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dzq0RXzFcYAU-eZEYAosnw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The egg white frittata was cooked very well, as egg whites have a tendency to harden very quickly, but these were still soft and springy. The goat cheese was maybe what kept the frittata soft, but I couldn't taste too much of a distinct flavor. There was a nice ratio of filling to egg whites, and it was a pretty generous portion. Souffle pancakes:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c7ZzGBK0KKXSMdNuApwbUw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I haven't ventured too far into pancake territory, as I'm usually a French toast addict, but the addition of "souffle" was too tempting to resist. The pancakes themselves were very well-shaped, and I was surprised by how stiff they seemed on the outside. The interior was a little too dense for me to say that it was similar to a souffle, but the adjusted sweetness of the pancake was palatable. Society Cafe Encore was my last stop in Las Vegas before heading home, and it wasn't a bad meal to leave on. I would be open to venturing back to try some other dishes next time.
Emperor's Buffet=For a $14 buffet, that too in Vegas, you would expect some quality. The Breakfast Buffet at the Imperial Palace provides none of that. Avoid this and the lunch buffet as well, at all costs. Seriously, I don't have write anymore for this review; it's just a waste time for you and for me. Just avoid this place, at all costs. It's just that terrible. Why isn't there an option for 0 stars? It's finally deserved. One of the previous reviews is absolutely right about Burger King being delicious compared this; and that's the most barf-able fast food joint of all-time. I've never missed $14 so much in my life.Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #3 of 7 12:00 PMThe 3rd stop in our single day tour of the Buffet of Buffets lead us to the Imperial Palace and the Emperor's Buffet.  Located on the 2nd floor above the casino, the buffet is the smallest in size and variety of the seven.  Our expectations were pretty low, so we weren't going to fool ourselves into expecting any pleasant surprises.After browsing the buffet line for a while, I decided to try out the Desserts.  Nothing on the main buffet line looked appealing to me and I wanted to save a little room for the other 4 remaining buffets.  The Desserts were OK.....the Cakes were very dry.  I'm glad I passed on most of the items here.Overall, it's the lowest rated buffet in the Buffet of Buffets.  Will it fill you up?  Sure.  Will you feel satisfied?  To each their own, in my case, no.  To end on a high note, the employees here are friendly.Return Factor - 2%
Tiny's Country Cafe=Apparently I am a victim of a disapearing review. I reviewed Tinys about a month ago, right after they opened. Back then I tried the Meatloaf dinner, corn bread and salad. The meat loaf was dry but good. The corn bread was dry but goodThey slathered brown gravy over it and made it great. I will not hold the dry food against them as it was soon after grand opening and there were not too many diners in and out yet. Today I had a egg salad sandwhich, and frys. It was nice because sitting at the counter I could see him make the egg salad fresh. I asked to add a little pepper and mustard because I like it like that and he was more then happy to do so. I have yet to try breakfast. Maybe next week.As the name would indicate this place is fairly tiny. Upon entering every table was taken, so my husband and I sat at their counter area. We were greeted and given menus right away. I knew I would love this place when I asked for iced tea I was given the option of sweet tea. I love sweet tea and it's hard to get some in Arizona. My husband ordered coffee, but our server made the mistake of giving him sweet tea as well, but my husband didn't complain as he is a southern boy who loves his sweet tea.Both my husband and I ordered omelettes. He the Spanish and me a Denver. Both omelettes were very tasty and so fluffy they were like scrambled fluffy clouds. The hash browns were great. They are not frozen or from a bag. The potatoes are fresh cut and delicious. Tiny's also has their own yummy homemade salsa, which I pour on just about anything I order. Our server never left us with empty drink cups or even half empty. Most anytime she walked by she checked on us and refilled our drinks. The counter area is a good place to sit as you get to see the food prepared right in front of you and experience the hustle of the cafe. I will definitley be back for the wonderful food and spot on, friendly service.Since this review my husband and I have been to Tiny's a number of times. We love it here. The service and food are always spot on. On our last visit we ordered the milk toast which is buttered toast with cinnamon and sugar in a bowl and served with hot milk. It's almost like the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but way better. Maybe it sounds odd, but it's worth a try. We also ordered the hillbilly benedict which is biscuits with eggs, bacon and their homemade gravy poured all over it. It's delicious.
Lemongrass=***There were some good dishes at Lemongrass (as well as a few items that did not feel outrageously priced); there were also a few mediocre things at Lemongrass; if you do your research though and order popular items at Lemongrass, you are probably in for a satisfying and maybe even not too pricey lunch or dinner for Las Vegas***I saw in a taxi that Lemongrass is the only Thai restaurant located in a major resort and casino on The Strip.  Lemongrass is located in Aria and it is open for lunch (it was surprisingly busy for lunch despite its location; it is kind of located in the back of Aria, which I would assume would not get much foot traffic).  Lemongrass features an all-day menu consisting of satays, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees featuring all kinds of proteins (beef, chicken, lobster, prawns, pork, tofu, sea bass, and crab), curries, rice dishes, and noodle dishes.  Like a lot of Thai restaurants, Lemongrass features a big menu so maybe it should not be a surprise that some dishes are good while others underwhelm.I thought their chicken wings were very good.  They were not battered, but the outside was crispy while the inside was very juicy.  The chicken wings had a good flavor too--a fair amount of spiciness.  The chicken wings were served with a sweet dipping sauce.The Pad Thai Ghoong also had a good amount of spiciness too and the spiciness was more than I would expect with pad thai so it was a nice surprise.  The pad thai also featured good noodles, a generous portion of prawns, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts.  I did feel that the portion of noodles was a tad small.The fried tofu with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onions, scallions, and oyster sauce featured really good deep-fried tofu.  The tofu had a great and distinct edge while the inside was soft and very creamy.  Unfortunately, the sauce was very lukewarm in temperature.  Even if the dish had been served fresh and hot, it might have needed more heat or flavor.  In addition, with the tofu and the cooked vegetables, the dish felt too soft (there needed to be more crispiness or crunchiness).The yellow curry with chicken, onion and potato was quite watery and bland.  I really liked the potato, but the chicken was shredded without care and overly dry.  It was disappointing given the quality and moistness of the chicken wings.The beef satay was not that good.  The texture of the beef was a tad chewy.  The flavor was okay though.  The satay came with garnishes of peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and ciabatta bread.Service was good--pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.The restaurant has a mostly dark decor.  The room is comfortable.  And despite being very close to the casino, the restaurant feels very blocked off with walls and such to keep the smoke from wafting over to Lemongrass' dining room.Prices vary.  Appetizers are in the $10 and below range while several main dishes go for $16; there are several courses in the $25 range and portions vary with some dishes feeling generous with proteins and others feeling stingy with proteins or noodles.Lemongrass probably has enough good things on the menu that you can have a good lunch or dinner here.  You need to do your research before coming here.  I thought the chicken wings and pad thai were both good, but the other dishes were mediocre.  I imagine there are other good things here and there are probably a few reasonably priced dishes as well.  If you know what to order and get the kitchen on a good day, Lemongrass can probably be a satisfying and not too expensive lunch or dinner on The Strip.Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Aria offers free self and valet parking.Unlike many reviewers here, we were staying at the Aria on a group rate, so did not have a "meal credit" to blow.  We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, as after spending all day at her conference, the wife had to "send a few emails, and quickly look at something for work", which destroyed any chance of date night.  We weren't inspired by the Aria's in-room dining options, and know that Thai is often a decent choice to offer alternatives with her gluten allergy.  Make no mistake, we didn't expect a terribly authentic Thai experience.  The signs were a broad menu that included udon, sesame chicken, and pho, and the fact that their signature beverage is a Watermelon Caipiroska.  I'm not sure why their menu covers so much of Asia, as there are separate Chinese and Japanese dining alternatives at the Aria.  But, that's neither here nor there, as we were after the usually-GF Thai stuff.Because the wife was going to be busy, we just were going to pick up and bring it back to the room.  We both went downstairs, in case there were questions my wife would need to answer.  The young lady working the hostess stand on a Sunday night was, honestly, more friendly than we expected.  She walked us through our allergen questions, quickly dispatched our order, and before we could comment very long on the what looked like young, fit, and well-dressed platform-heeled blonde twins going to the secure Tower Suite elevators with what looked like their very affectionate dad, she came out with our bag of goodies.We just went with a straight up chicken "Phad Thai" (not used to that spelling).  I didn't find it overly spicy, nor did we ask for extra hot sauce to customize it with.  Even though it took a bit of time for us to get back to our room, the food wasn't "stuck together" like some report here.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed, and come back downstairs to grab a pizza slice or something for my dinner later, but the ($18) entree was plenty to feed us both.  So, for the ability to handle my wife's gluten allergy without worry, the nice hostess who helped us, and conveniently and quickly feeding us both for about $20, we were pretty happy.3.9 starsThe best thing about this place is that they open late EVERYDAY! That's a big convenience for us staying at Aria Sky suites, the restaurant is located right next to the Sky suites tower. We ordered some simple items and a Goose Bloody Mary to go. After too much partying on Saturday, both hubby and I were extremely tired and in serious need of some Asian food! We ordered garlic wings, wonton noodle soup and hot & sour soup, all hangover cure food of course! The hot and sour soup had no shredded pork in it, just generous amount of veggies in very sour and fairly spicy hot soup, that was all I needed at the moment! Hubby loved the garlic wings and wonton egg noodle soup, extremely flavorful and very delicious! We felt so much better after some super yummy Thai food, glad we decided to take advantage of this opening late restaurant, we really had no energy to get out of Aria hotel to find comfort Asian food at midnight. Ps. was too tired to take photos.
Indian Spices=Supremely delicious! Went here for dinner with a friend before a show at the cabaret. It is a very unassuming looking restaurant and was not very busy. It took our waitress a little time to get over to us, but we mentioned that we had a show and she made sure to bring our food out as quickly as possible. We got the samosas, which were huge and delicious. We also shared the chicken tikka masala and the chana masala at spice level medium. I love spicy food, but if you don't I suggest going lower on the scale because even at a medium, these dishes had some serious kick!  I loved the chicken tikka masala. So much so that I took the leftover sauce over rice home just so my hubby could try it! We also got the garlic naan and poori. Both were delicious and helped to scoop up the delicious food. The portion sizes were also very generous for the price and my friend and I were each able to have a to go container from what was left over. I can't wait to go back!I stopped by with my friend on Fri. night for dinner before seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum.  Between the convenient location in the Cultural District, the good reviews from other Yelpers, and the reasonable prices, this place seemed like a potential winner.  Unfortunately, however, the food and atmosphere left something to be desired.The a la carte dinner menu is pretty extensive, and includes most of the usual dishes offered at Indian restaurants.  Because I'd tried samples of chicken makhni (butter chicken) from friends at another Indian restaurant in Oakland and really liked it, but had never ordered it myself before, I decided to order it.  Bad move!  The sauce was less creamy than that served with the dish at the other restaurant (see photo), and the chicken was of poor quality--all dark meat, with several pieces of gristle that I had to pull out of my mouth while eating (as discreetly as possible, of course, to avoid grossing out my friend).  This version of the dish was disappointing, to the point that I only ate a bit more than half of it before abandoning the rest.In addition to my entree, I ordered a mango lassi, as I usually do at Indian restaurants.  Even this was a disappointment, given its thinness in comparison to versions I've had at other Indian restaurants around town.My friend ordered the malai kofta, a vegetarian dish consisting of potato balls stuffed with paneer and vegetables in a light cream sauce with nuts and raisins.  She let me try a bite or two, and it tasted much better than my chicken makhni.  If I'd ordered this dish, I probably would have finished it and left with a much better assessment of the food than I did.  Indeed, my friend did so, and expressed satisfaction with its quality.Aside from the quality of the food, I was rather unimpressed with the ambiance, which I'd describe as a notch below no frills.  There was no music, the wall decorations were pretty sparse, and the tables were unadorned except for menus under the glass tops.  Moreover, the place had a slight aura of griminess that was apparent from the odd odor that I encountered upon entering.  Service was okay, and the food came was served in a reasonable timeframe, so I have no major complaints there.Overall, I've had better Indian food in superior settings at other places around town, so I probably won't return.  It seems as though most people come here for the lunch buffet, so it's possible that the quality is better than their a la carte cooking.  If you do order a la carte, I'd recommend sticking to the chef's specialties (the malai kofta was one of them), and avoiding the chicken makhni, for sure.  If I went solely by my own experience, my rating would be a 2, but my friend seemed pretty pleased, so I'm averaging to a 3 to better reflect our combined judgment.
Sassy Sal's BBQ=I am always on the look-out for a new BBQ place and I found this one at N Durango & Farm just around the corner from Mountain Ridge Skatepark.Their claim to fame is "Vegas-Style" BBQ. Looking at the menu everything is very reasonably priced and they have beef,pork,chicken & links plus burgers and all the standard bbq sides and red skin potato salad.It's a real small place next to DQ and it has 6 small tables is painted purple and has a flat screen on the wall to watch while you wait & you will wait.Well I tied the beef brisket,pulled pork & hot link sandwiches plus mac n cheese,coleslaw & red skin potato salad.$5.99-for a sandwich & 1 side.-What a deal!!all the sandwiches come covered in cheese, onions and sweet bbq sauce -that's VEGAS-Style?!They smoke their meat so it was real tasty I dont get why they smother it in a sweet bbq sauce. The pork sandwich was the best with coleslaw on it and the bbq sauce mixed real well.The link & brisket were good but I'd rather skip the VEGAS-stuff. Mac N cheese was weak, potato sald was alittle runny but the colslaw was quite a suprise. real good.This place has good prices & good meat-just know how to order it without sauce & it's a winner.
Barro's Pizza=My FAVORITE pizza! And although I do enjoy the toppings (such as hot wing, kona, Barros special & mega meat), I would say it is greatly because of the delicious crust :DI've read others reviews where they say there's nothing special about it, but I would beg to differ. It is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside & it doesn't give me an upset tummy after eating it, lol. They also have gluten free crust for those who prefer it. This is also the only pizza place I know that sells it's pizza dough! You have to call ahead of time so they'll have it packed for you, but isn't that cool?  For lunch they sell pizza by the slice & have different pizza's available on different days of the week. The only thing I don't like is that they have such a great relationship with all the local schools (which is good) that during the school year they sometimes reserve the entire restaurant (which is bad), leaving no seating room for any walk in guests. That doesn't quite seem fair. I love kids, but I love to eat my pizza sitting down too, lol! I'm terrible that way ;)So instead of the regular Friday Papa Johns pizza for dinner, we decided to give this place a try!Location & Aesthetics - located on W Greenway Road by the corner of N Reems and W Greenway by the Walmart Neighborhood Market.Parking was a bit difficult to find as the parking lot is shared with part of Walmart Neighborhood Market, and it was a Friday evening. The restaurant was clean on the outside and inside.  The restaurant (eating area) itself is spacious however the area where you order at the checkout immediately upon entering is a bit limited in terms of space.As we entered, there was a lot of people waiting around - some waiting for their orders that was placed, some picking up their orders, some who can't decide what to order and are looking at the menu, some in line, and some who can't decide what place they are in line.There is a three-seater bench/chair with two extra single chairs placed in the waiting area in case you wish to sit and wait for your order which nobody was really taking advantage of.The place was hopping which ought to tell you something!Menus - the menu was self-explanatory and up on the wall.  Very easy to read.  Plus there are copies of the menu on the counter top in case you want to grab one and have a more in-depth perusal.Service - We were there to place an order to go as when we attempted to call prior to place the order, we encountered an error message on the phone.  Thankfully there were 3 cashiers on deck trying to whittle down the crowd milling around at the checkout/cashier area, and they were working fast and efficient to take orders.  Despite the craziness of it being a Friday evening, they were very friendly, patient, and answered any questions we had.I asked about the phone situation and was told that on Friday's, their phones can get busy as they have 5 lines and they do get filled up quickly so it's best to keep trying and hope that you get through.The cashier even offered us water while we waited for our order!Food - We order the large chicken supreme (Chicken, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Onions, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese) with a side of 12 wings.  With the 12 wings, you can't mix-and-match however with the 24 wings you can which was no biggie.  The 12 wings was ordered as mild but still had a little kick to it which again wasn't a problem for me.  The wings were hot, juicy, well seasoned, flavorful, and very tender (not too tough) to work off the bone.  You do have a choice of original (bone) or boneless.The pizza pie was heavenly!  The pie was piping hot and pulling it apart, one can see the beautiful strings of cheese attempting to hold itself to the pie.The crust/dough was soft, buttery and moist, and not very dry.  The pie had lots of cheese, and adequate and equal amounts of ingredients on each slice.  The chicken was well seasoned, soft and tender.  The ingredients like the green peppers, onions, and mushrooms tasted fresh!I think I've found our new go-to place to order pizza from now!  Absolutely love the food and their service!
Gyro Time=Astoundingly expensive for the quality and authenticity.Look, if you've never been to a country where Gyros are served out of clapboard carts, you won't know what I mean when I say "THAT AIN'T NO GYRO!". There are always tons of people streaming in and out of this place, and a Gyro, Fries and Drink is ten bucks (!!) for just a totally un-authentic gyro meat.  Apparently nobody but me noticed. And what is *up* with the pretend "tzatziki". Could you *borrow* some garlic and dill from someone? Holy cow.The only reason this business gets two stars is because there are no undocumented workers (nee: illegal aliens) in sight...just high school kids. Blech. I tried really hard to like this place. I've eaten there at least a dozen times over the last couple of years. Always the same experience...except this last time. Apparently, they "lost" the nozzel to the Pepsi dispenser in someone's drink and one of the high school girls was walking around asking people if they were drinking Pepsi and would they look in the bottom of their cup. *(sigh)*
Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill=I enjoy Sammy's.  My family & I eat at Sammy's often.  I was meeting a colleague here for lunch and have never been to this particular location.  I think it's one of the newer locations in town.The service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.Since it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.They were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.In any case, the lunch was enjoyable.Will I return?  You bet your Sammy's I will!Came here with my man to check out their HH since we were hungry but didn't quite know what we wanted to eat so what better than a whole bunch of different apps/tapas to satisfy our cravings??? -Duck Tacos: my boyfriend hates duck but he liked these... Probably because there was really no duck taste to them but they did taste good.. Crunchy with lettuce, tomatoes, creme fraiche and cheese.-Crispy Tofu: light crust comes with a delicious ginger dipping sauce.-Mediterranean Plate? With hummus and baba ganoush.. I didn't have any but it looked nice-Chicken Lettuce Cups: love the butter lettuce that comes with but the chicken filling was too salty -Chicken Satay: not bad, not great-Truffle Fries: definite truffle taste to it... Yum! Service was great from server to the food runner! They even brought out a couple different dipping sauces when we just asked for ketchup! HH prices range from $3-$7 .. Great deal! HOT TIP: DAILY happy hour 3-6!!! Including $2 off all wine and beer~My co worker and I brought a client here for lunch on a Monday. Located in a large strip center where parking is no issue. We arrived before the noon hour so the place was bare and we got a choice table.After receiving our beverages our friendly waitress took our orders. I went with the chicken and hummus wrap and picked the side of cole slaw. Our food arrived promptly and my wrap was healthy tasting but flavorful and the slaw was decent too.We were in and out without a hitch and I would recommend Sammy's for a business or personal luncheon.
Little Asia=Nope.Just...no.Slow service, inconsistency in dishes, sometimes lukewarm food, pervasive blandness, and ingredients that have been sitting out too long are what await potential patrons standing awkwardly in the doorway unsure of when and where to sit.  Given the sloppiness evident from a seat in the dining room (so to speak), I don't even want to know what other rules of running a decent restaurant are routinely ignored in that kitchen.Simply put: Forget taste, I don't trust the kitchen here not to make me sick.I'll be a happy Oakland resident when this place closes and something else moves in.  Right now it's just taking up space.
Garcia's Mexican Restaurant=I used to love Garcia's. Then after 2 really bad experiences (we are talking raw chicken bad), I didn't go for close to 3 years. Decided to go back about 4 months ago because I had a coupon and was hoping they had fixed the problems. Now after 3 visits, I can say they are back!!! I always get the Pollo Fundido. Chicken wrappted in jalapeno cream cheese and deep fried. YUM! I love their chips and salsa and bean dip that they serve. The service has been great each time since we started going back. There are usually $5 off coupons out there which is a great added bonus. They have great fajitas as well but I have a hard time straying from my pollo fundido! I am so happy they are back to really good food and service. Reasonable prices as well!
Qdoba Mexican Grill=Maybe if I write a review like Dallas G, I'll get ROTD.  Here goes:"Who am I but a slave to the forces of nature?  As a slave, am I free to pass judgment on those slaves toiling aside me, dawn till dusk (at which point I go and fornicate with whomever may be willing)?  No, I am not, and as this commonest of men will tell you, no one should ever cast such noble servants of the world order to the depths of a poor Yelp review.So I say five stars to any old establishment that can churn out even the most mediocre of food!  Qdoba is just such a place.  Good people with good intentions, making decent food for other ants in the giant ant farm we call life.  Go there, enjoy yourself, bask in the glory of it all."But I am not Dallas G, nor would I want to be, because he is vegan and that makes life inordinately difficult.  It also means that his burrito had probably 900 calories fewer than my burrito, which was essentially the same except with two cups of queso sauce and a bunch of steak.Of course, with queso and steak means that there will be at least a modicum of taste, and that is true--but I say that the food is average there, and only deserving of three stars, because I don't know if it was the salsa or what, but there was a strange flavor that permeated the entire burrito. Not a bad flavor, but not a good flavor--it almost was like eating two pounds of roasted tomatillos in a burrito.Finally, I begrudge them for having water that came straight from the bottom of an overly-chlorinated pool.  Qdoba is decent, worth a meal once or twice a month, max.  But order a real drink.
Ice Tango=I have to say, Ice Tango holds a special place in my heart... Maybe it's because Ice Tango gave me my first taste of tart yogurt, or maybe it's because the employees are super friendly. Perhaps it's that the toppings always look fresh and appealing.  But I think the real reason is that Ice Tango fro yo is just delicious!  It's refreshing and fat free and I just can't get enough!I stopped into the new old town location today for the first time, and I loved it!  Jared does too!  I had the coconut flavor and it was love at first bite.  This location also offers a soft serve gelato and granita (sorbet like dessert) as well.  I'll be back for sure!Maybe I'm not as much a fan of the self-serve concept afterall... I think I prefer a serving size as I request it - not my amateur serving getting way too big since the fro-yo comes out way too fast and I'm not used to it!  And then you have to pay for it... 38 cents an ounce adds up!I stopped back by and treated myself to some fro-yo last night.  I stayed awhile to do some work while I was there as well (since my power was out at home).  In listening to the other customers while I was there, it seemed like everyone was having similar experiences.  Regardless, it was good to see the place packed on a Tuesday night.  I guess I'm not the only Ice Tango lover in this town.So, just to clarify - I still love the product and the friendly service and the delicious toppings, but I think I'm safer financially and diet wise, heading to the the other location!So what is the dealio with fro-tang?It's a question that keeps me up at night, pondering...pondering.I needed an answer, so when I got out of the office and went for a walkabout in Old Town for lunch a couple of days ago, my route took me past the fro-tang palace in Old Town, Ice Tango!I thought (as I made my fateful decision to walk in) "frozen yogurt...how difficult can this be?"Plenty difficult, as it turns out!I was greeted by the guy who lost on American Idol (apparently, maybe a dead ringer), as I walked in. He pointed to the 10 rows of soft serve machines and said "you can try any flavors you want" and indicated a stack of exquisitely tiny paper thimbles, in which I was supposed to put a small serving of fro-tang to try out.I had no idea what the fro-tang was going to taste like, so thought "good idea"...I could not have been more wrong.I approached the first soft serve udder, with a label that said something like "creamy tang-fro" and gave it a short pull.2 1/2 cups of creamy tang-fro cascaded over the sides of my thimble and onto my hands (desperately cupped to keep the yo-tang from hitting the floor and marking me as a non-pro tang-fro jockey).I didn't really get a taste as I dumped the thimble and the extra 2 lb's. of yo-fro in the trash bin.While unsuccessfully trying to clean my sticky hands with a wad of napkins, I decided on another approach.I walked by the 30 different soft serve machines looking at lables in a hopeless attempt to find my standby...vanilla...no go for vanilla fro-yo.I did find some sort of chocolate blend, but it was in one of the 6 or so soft serve udders that were not in working order (swirling, cold, but the udders just wouldn't  give:)I finally settled on Mangy Tango (or was it Tangy Mango?) and Coconut Something combo.I got a small cup and by now well aware of the awesome dispensing capabilities of these hard core soft servers, I pulled the lever on the combo udder for 1 second...1 second!My little cup was only 1/3 full:) Just right! I added a spoonful of strawberries to the concoction and took my prize to the counter to pay for it.Adam (probably not his real name) motioned that I should set my tangy treat on the scale...he was going to weigh it and I was going to pay $.38 per ounce for my sweet confection:) Good Deal! I didn't have that many oz's:)$4.27? Adam, do you want to weigh that again? Are you kidding? Who do you guys think you are...Sprinkles?I asked Adam how they hide the ballast in the cups. Adam looks at me like I'm not all that funny...but I am:)I would tell you that I have never had better fro-yo-tang, but I had never had any of the stuff before.The Mangy Tango part was OK, but the Oil-Can Coconut had a chemical taste and I tossed about $3.49 worth of tang-yo into the trash(:So, no bro, on the fro yo from the tango.
Stage Deli=Ate the summer barley soup. $5 for a good sized bowl of warm goodness smack dab in the middle of the casino? Let's not get too judgemental, people. That's a good deal for a meal literally steps outside of Hakkasan to end your drunken night of shuffling and/or fist pumping.There were plenty of veggies, chicken, and barley (duh, it's called barley soup)... And I liked it! Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I'm a soup gal. I probably wouldn't order anything else anyway.Haters gon hate.The MGM poker room and Stage Deli's sandwiches go together like peanut butter and jelly.  But PB&J sandwiches aren't offered at Stage Deli.Thoroughly confused?  Here's the explanation:When playing poker at MGM (and clocked in with your MLife players card), you'll earn $1 an hour at the $1/$2 table, or $2 an hour at the $2/$5 table.  That might not sound like much, but it actually adds up pretty quickly and unlike regular MLife comp dollars, these NEVER expire.  After wracking up those dollars, see the floor man for your running total, and to redeem a voucher for discounted or FREE food at Stage Deli.  He'll even have a Stage Deli menu available with all the item pricing (including tax) so that you can have that voucher printed out for the exact desired amount.Sometimes during a long poker session, you might not feel like taking a long break for a fancy lunch or dinner.  A quick, simple sandwich might hit the spot, and that's exactly what Stage Deli offers, in addition to soups, salads, breakfast, drinks and desserts.The service is extremely fast, moderately friendly, and the sandwiches are reasonably priced ($8.95 to $10.25).  All meats are delivered from the East Coast.  The taste is...  Acceptable.  Do expect to dress your sandwich up a bit with the provided condiments, and donn't expect to be blown away by quality or uniqueness.  Speed and simplicity should be what is appreciated at Stage Deli.
BT's Burger Joint=Bill W. brings up a very good point in his review.  I ate at BT's around 8:15 on a Saturday night with my fiance and was extremely disappointed.  I took notes on a receipt as I sat and ate because I was so horrified.  Let me preface this review with two things: 1, I worked in food service as a cashier and as a shift supervisor for 8 years and 2, BT's was not busy whatsoever so there is absolutey no excuse for the following! -The first thing I noticed was that the floor was filthy.  Receipts, food, paper products, etc.  It probably didn't help that line cooks were throwing small food items FROM THE LINE at one another.-The glass on the cooler had dried splatters from the milkshake machine on it, it probably hadn't been wiped down for at least a month.-There were rags everywhere...counter tops, spray bottles, in the gloved hands of a line cook (gross!)-The manager was worthless.  I didn't see him do a lick of work except to clear a total of 2 tables in the 45 minutes we were there.  He was obviously more interested in texting than running a restaurant.  He also walked by our table at least 5 times and never once made an actual table visit.-One employee in particular had sagging pants (this isn't jail) and ate directly from the line.  This same employee brought the bag of ketchup out to a table and proceeded to fill the ketchup bottles at the table, something I feel should be done in the kitchen.-I know for certain drinks are not allowed to sit at the register.-Not once did I see any line cook change their gloves.Needless to say, I will not visit BT's again.
The Common Market=This use to easily be a 5 star place for me - awesome location, great atmosphere, super drink selection (beer & wine), and something way different than your usual marketplaces. I spend a lot of time and money here since I live in the neighborhood. BUT...  I have had some major issues with customer service lately..why the heck are they hiring mean people?! When I made a comment about a product they were out of - the person at the counter literally shrugged...I mean really you cannot have an actual response? I wasn't making an off-putting comment - it was more disappointment than anything else. I noticed on another occasion a girl told her boyfriend " wow that guy must not like me" ...it was the same guy being rude to another customer. Then on a separate occasion I waited 20 minutes for a deli sandwich ...as I watched several people walk up and take their sandwiches home I finally had to ask where mine was. I was told " some asshole took yours"- and then he slammed my sandwich down on the counter in front of me. Well excuse me, last I saw you had to hand the sandwich to that "asshole" -so you actually just gave my sandwich to the wrong person. I was honestly stunned by the response. I would have been fine if they at least told me why I was waiting so long (before having to ask) or here is a novel idea offer an apology. I love the venue but with the attitude I've experienced lately - I will have to start looking elsewhere.
Sourdough Cafe=Only 1 other review? This place is a locals late-night hotspot! Cheap specials and decent food.As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, $3.99 Steak & Eggs, $2.99 Strawberry Shortcakes!BEST spot to eat after drinking, YES! Fast,Cheap & Filling.I had the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs,hashbrowns and wheat toast.The wife had the NY steak and scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and a biscuit w/gravy(instead of toast)Mine was real iffy, too fried-gravy was too thick & lumpy, hasbrowns were good,eggs were a little runny, toast was soaked in butter.Steak is a little fatty-NOT real New York Strip steak, biscuit was tasty & flaky but again gravy was too thick.The service was a little slow only got 1 refill the entire time & it wasn't very busy at all at midnight.Overall it was $20 for 2 people and we left full. It was cheap,fast and OPEN!They have great specials! If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat then look no further, Sourdough Cafe has great prices and decent food. You can save a few cents if you obtain a players card. I always order the steak and eggs special which costs $4.49 with the players card, normal cost is $4.99, that's a whopping savings of $0.50 cents! HahaLike I said, the food is decent, the steak isn't  thick, it's actually pretty thin but still delicious, seasoned right, juicy even when it's cooked well done. My eggs over medium are always cooked to perfection, hash browns are okay, they're a bit oily, the meal comes with your choice of toast (white, wheat, or sourdough) all buttered up. I strayed away from the steak and eggs once and ordered the pot roast, it was very dry so now I stick to what I know is good.The cafe itself is clean, the service isn't the greatest. We were seated promptly and the bus person brought our waters out right away. The waitress took our orders quick as well but she brought out our food and we didn't see her again until she brought out our check. She checked on the table next to us various times but we were invisible to her, she asked the table next to us if they wanted to have dessert before she brought out their check. We weren't even asked that, what if I wanted some dessert? Lame. Maybe I should have spoken to her in Spanish since she was more attentive with her Spanish speaking customers. After your check is brought to you, you go up to the cash register to pay. The cashier was very friendly so kudos to her!
Sage=Jeff, the bartender at Sage that helped us, is a pretty awesome mixologist. He isn't afraid to just hear an ingredient and make up a delicious concoction for you to try. He knows his ins and outs of liquor flavors, mixers, fruits, and all that jazz. When Misti Y and I stopped by she was able to sample a most refreshing mixture that contained canton, fresh muddled raspberries, and ginger beer among other ingredients. I myself had the Tea Rose cocktail. This is made with tea vodka, rose water, St. Germain, and is garnished with roasted pine nuts. It's as interesting as it sounds and while I don't think the flavor is for everyone I also don't think it was so offensive or strong that you couldn't drink it if you had to.Misti and I also shared a tuna crudo and cheese plate for snacks, both of which I really enjoyed. The cheese plate had 4 varieties on it I believe and it wasn't an overwhelmingly large selection so if you're sharing between more than 2 people you may want more than one plate. Overall though I can see why Sage is such a hit for yelpers. I'd love to come back and try proper dinner and more cocktails the next time I'm in town.KK and I are in Vegas right now, since Wednesday, for a conference. It's always a big dilemma for me when in Vegas. Do I revisit the place I know I love, or do I try the millions of new restaurants that have opened since I was last here?On this trip, we've been doing both.One of the new places we simply had to go to was the Aria Hotel; this much, I knew.  KK made a reservation prior to our arrival to dine at Sage, Aria Hotel's posh restaurant.The decor at Aria is nothing short of beautiful.  It's a great mix of romantic balanced out w/ modern and sharp. One entire wall of blue light extends an element of fun and lively, but the conservative hardware used to design the place makes it intimate and romantic. Never before have I seen a restaurant that gave so much space in between tables -- privacy was never an issue.We arrived early to our meal after a happy hour at Social House at Crystals, and the host sat us immediately at a corner table.  The server was nothing short of perfect as far as attentiveness and friendliness.We ordered a bottle of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and read over the menu.  Everything read beautifully.I chose to have the sweetbreads and flatiron steak; KK chose the eggplant soup, Kusshi oysters, and pork loin.The amuse bouche of the evening was a sterling silver spoonful of smoked salmon -- totally underwhelming and entirely too small to form a real opinion regarding this dish.But then began a wonderful procession of food.I tried KK's eggplant soup - and never before have I tasted eggplant so delicious!My sweetbreads were delicious and perfectly cooked. The taste was not masked by sauces - and it was accompanied by thick slices of pork belly.  How could one go wrong with that?KK's pork loin was absolutely delicious. I usually refrain from ordering pork loin due to it being dry, but however Sage cooked it, it was phenomenal.The true show stealer, however, was my flaitiron steak.  I can honestly say that never before have these lips of mine come together with flatiron (not a normally impressive cut) cooked and seasoned so beautifully, with shaved truffle atop the beauty of this dish.  I had asked for it was "medium rare, but err on the side of err" to which the server replied, "So, rare plus?"  I agreed, and this was PERFECT.  I licked the plate clean.So why four stars?Well, it's the oysters.  I know and love Kusshi oysters but these were subpar -- I've had better elsewhere.  If you're going to dress them yourself and not offer the typical horseradish and lemon, then you best be sure that you dress them well.  The kitchen, however, didn't make such an impressive creation, and any restaurant that doesn't serve their oysters properly cannot be given 5 stars, in my opinion.We had originally intended to return to Social House for dessert, per the request of the general manager of Social House.  However, given how great Sage's food was, I was inclined to try at least one dessert.  When our server told us about their french press coffee, well -- he had me at "French".Strangely enough, neither KK nor I remember the pannacotta we ordered.  I do remember the coffee, which was quite delicious, but not the pannacotta.  Very odd.  We simply shared the dessert, then ran back to Social House to try their new coffee and desserts.Sage is an outstanding new restaurant. For such a new place, they had their act together. The front lounge is phenomenal, and the back restaurant is nothing short of impressive.  The meal is expensive, but well worth every dollar.On your next trip to Vegas, be sure to check out Sage at the beautiful Aria Hotel.  Running around the Aria Hotel from place to place, bar to bar - and having great company was without a doubt one of my best Vegas memories to date.Great new American food in a modern, cool setting.The ambiance provides a strong contrast to the simple, well edited, delicious food.  First the lounge menu; the crab and sweet corn fritters or the fig and blue cheese tart are both so good.  It makes me hungry just thinking about them.  Both pair so well with an extra dry Hendricks martini!From the ala carte menu, the foie gras custard brulee is incredible.  What's not to like after all; its paired with cherries and cocoa.  Yep chocolate.  The Heirloom beet salad is also excellent.  The Braised veal cheeks also deserve special mention.  The flavor is so delicate and the meat so tender.I was skeptical about trying the restaurant when I first read the menu online feeling that the combinations of ingredients seemed a bit off.  I was thankfully wrong.Most people come to Vegas to gamble, to party and to sin.Truth be told, I don't gamble and I can party much harder and sin far worse in my hometown of Los Angeles than I can in Vegas.My sin in Vegas is gluttony. Add to that worshipping at the temple of Michelin, whose bright stars cast a long shadow over Vegas, and idolizing the three French gods of cuisine who have set up outposts here (Robuchon, Savoy and Gagnaire), I'd say I have my fair share of penance to pay.So it's surprising, then, that the best meal of my recent trip was neither Michelin starred nor devised in France.It was at Sage, Shawn McClain's contemporary American ode to the farm-to-table/artisanal/sustainable/seasonal ethos.Now, let me be clear, those terms hold no particular draw for me. I'm just as happy for my produce to be exotic, my fish to be endangered, and my truffles to be out of season. And this is Vegas, a neon outpost in the desert, a place where money trumps ideology and possibly the least sustainable city in America.No, what brought me to Sage was that, after the buzz had quietened and the dust had settled on the new CityCenter's more talked about restaurants -- Gagnaire's first US outpost Twist and Bar Masa/Shaboo's $500 hot pot -- Sage emerged as the most interesting new restaurant in Vegas.Not that Shawn McClain doesn't come with accolades. Esquire magazine's "Chef of the Year", James Beard winner for "Best Chef Midwest" but it's safe to say he's not a household name outside of Chicago.Yet.The restaurant space itself is everything you'd expect in Vegas from the newest Dubai-funded casino on the Strip. Opulent, expansive, classy and swathed in plum and gold. This is not a restaurant you wander into from the casino floor.This is a destination.And the service there was impeccable. Probably the best I've received in ANY restaurant. Ever. Friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, and generous.Vancouver Island Kusshi Oysters | Piquillo Pepper and Tobasco Sorbet / Aged-Tequila MignonetteI love kusshis by themselves but the piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet was stunning. A perfect cold and hot complement to the briny oyster. With a nod to Mexico, the mignonette sauce was made with aged tequila rather than vinegar.Heirloom Beet Salad | Duck Prosciutto / Point Reyes Blue Cheese / Roasted Walnuts / Celery VinaigretteOne of my favorite dishes of the night. Simple in its preparation, the beets were soft and flavorful, the vinaigrette perfectly balanced, the blue cheese creamy, and all sitting atop slivers of duck prosciutto.Foie Gras Custard Brulée | Bing Cherries / Toasted Cocoa Nibs / Salted BriocheOne of the best mouthfuls of food I've enjoyed in '10. I love foie gras, I love creme brulée, and I can honestly think of nothing better than combining the two. Except perhaps shaving a torchon of foie gras onto it and serving it with a sweet and salty salted brioche. Absolutely craveable and made all the better by the complementary glasses of sauternes paired with it.Crescenza Cheese Mezzaluna | Grilled Mushrooms / Braised Black Kale / Parsley EmulsionOf the two pasta dishes we tried, this was the stronger although nothing extraordinary. Still, the pasta was pillowy and well made, the mushrooms adding a nice, meaty texture to the dish.Roasted Sweetbreads | Glazed Bacon / Creamy White Polenta / Marinated ChanterellesI'm a big fan of sweetbreads. The breading on the sweetbreads here was less crispy than I would have liked although the polenta it sat on was very good, having soaked up all the juices of the sweetbreads and bacon. Bacon is one of those things I'm really getting over although, thick cut like this and glazed, it was a welcome addition to the dish.Maine Lobster Ravioli | Lemon-Olive Oil Puree / Baby Spring Peas / Mascarpone / Fresh MintThis dish was a disappointment. The sauce overpowered the taste of the delicate lobster to the point that I wouldn't have known I was eating lobster if I hadn't read it on the menu. Overall, oversalted and rather leaden.SmoresRemarkably beautiful and satisfying at the same time. Did it remind me of childhood s'mores? I don't know. I didn't grow up here. But the bruléed marshmallow was suitably sweet and sticky and the gingerbread crisp a great savory counterpoint.To finish the meal, the kitchen sent out cups of hot chocolate infused with citrus. A fun and whimsical way to end the meal and the citrus finish was a nice touch to the chocolate.So there you have it. Yes, there were a couple of missed steps but whether it was the gorgeous space, the opulent and classy ambiance, the wonderful service or the company of great friends, this meal transcended its faults and was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.Possibly the meal of the year so far and definitely the dish of the year for the foie gras custard brulée.For me, Sage is the best bet at CityCenter.And, as I said, I don't like to gamble.Full review in the blog.  Highlight courses below.I must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.  High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word "sexy" comes to mind immediately.  With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a "casino restaurant."  Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.Beginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.  Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.  Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.Already abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.  Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.  Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.As good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.  Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.  Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.  Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.My sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.  Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.  With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.  Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.Warm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.  Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.The first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.  Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.Hands down, Sage is probably my most favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. From the service to the food, you won't regret it. I have been here a couple times and I am amazed at what they can with just an egg. Saturday night we had the signature tasting menu with wine pairing and was excellent. We had plans to go out after so we asked to share our waiter was nice enough to allow to do so.Amuse Bouche - Sunchoke soup with tarragon -- great start, chilled and light.First course - WAGYU BEEF TARTARE -- Crushed Caper Aïoli/Slow Poached Egg/Crispy Chocolate. My favorite dish of all the courses. So light and went down way to easy. (paired with a vouvray.) perfect match. Second course - MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS -- Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms/Salted Caramel Reduction. I never knew that Dayboat scallops have a more sea flavor. I loved it. The dish was very asian influenced almost teriyaki flavor.  Third course - IBERICO PORK LOIN -- Brussels Sprouts/Crispy Confit Shoulder/Smoked Dates. Almost bbq flavored, you could taste the smoke. Final course - WARM CARROT CAKE --Roasted Coconut Sauce/Candied Ginger/Cream Cheese Ice Cream. I normally am not a carrot cake lover but this one will change your mind. Light, moist and rich. The best part of this restaurant; the Absinthe cart. Who wouldn't love an entire cart of Absinthe?!!  ha ha! Our server suggested the Germain-Robin, USA. This is the lightest out of all the ones listed. Great for beginners, such as myself.It food is unforgettable and so the absinthe. ;)  I can't wait to go back.An excellent dining experience, without a doubt. Sage is one of those no-brainer restaurants where you know you're going to have a great meal and not have to stress about it. My folks were in Vegas and they like to go to fancy restaurants from time-to-time and Sage was on their radar. All I had to do was get ready and show up, which is how I like it :)We arrived about 15 minutes before the reservation and decided to have a drink at the bar. Sparkling rose, please. I ended up guzzling down about 4 glasses of this stuff over the span of our meal. Can't get enough of the bubbly. Our server was quite jovial. He even tolerated my Dad's cheesy jokes, which automatically promotes him to Sainthood. More good news? It was Restaurant Week, which means there were even more delicious dishes to choose from beyond the regular menu. I ended up splitting the ribeye + bone marrow + foie gras special. Not my *favorite*, by my favorite +1's eyes lit up when they rattled off some of his favorite foods together on one plate. How could I say no?  Food was excellent. Rich, decadent - everything one could expect from a meal of duck liver, red meat and the marrow. It even came with a side of creamy pureed potatoes. Dessert? It was OK. Actually, I don't even remember what we ate. I was more into my glass of sparkling wine than anything else. And after two hours at the table, I was itching to go somewhere else.Why 4 stars instead of 5? As much as I enjoyed the experience, it's not going on the "Best Meals Evar" list. There's absolutely nothing wrong with Sage, it's just not a restaurant that I would pick again. Perhaps I'm not classy enough or my palate is not as refined? My parents loved it, though, and that's all that really matters, since they were the ones picking up the check ;)4.9 stars!Decided to come here for dinner before seeing Sade and John Legend at the MGM Grand.  My cousin was also in town, so we met here a couple hours before the show.Ambiance was tones of gold and lavender lighting with dark accents.  The entrance was through glass wine displays that opened up into their bar lounge then main dinning area.  Ambiance:  5 stars!I arrived first and sat at the bar and ordered a fancy cocktail, whose name escapes me, but contained a smoked peach whiskey.  It was fabulous!  The bartender shares that they smoke their peaches, infusing that flavor into the whiskey.  Pretty amazing.  Knowing we had an 8 pm concert, the staff asked twice throughout dinner how they were doing on time.  Nice to know they know, you know?  Service:  5 stars!My cousin arrives and we delve into the menu and opt for the $79 Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings (that went perfectly, btw).  Although it wasn't the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu we were intending, we couldn't resist the urge to splurge.We started with an amuse-bouche of some fish inspired concoction that was a nice start.  The prix fixe allowed us some room to decide among 2-3 choices in each of the four courses.  First course:  1)  Wagyu Beef Tartare of crushed caper aïoli, slow-poached egg and crispy chocolate.  I don't like raw meat, but this was fresh and extremely flavorful.  An intriguing pleaser despite our aversion for raw meat:  4 stars.2)  Foie Gras 'Brûlée' that was more like a tartlet rich with creamy goose liver:  5 stars!Second course:1)  Glazed Pork Belly with sweet corn tortellini, Porcini mushrooms & crispy pancetta:  5 star brilliance!  Probably the best dish of the night.2)  Maine Dayboat Scallops with braised Oxtail, Wild Mushrooms in a salted caramel reduction:  5 stars!  Succulent medallions of scallops adorned in a beautiful sauce that turned out to be my cousin's favorite dish.Third course:1)  Iberico Pork Loin with milk-braised cannelloni with baby eggplant and Creminelli Mortadella.  The fact that my cousin offered me none is testament of its superiority:  5 stars!2)  48 Hour Beef Belly with golden chanterelles, Padrón peppers and California plums:  5 stars!  I'm a big sucker for belly meat, so this outrageous dish won big time in my book.Dessert course:1)  Peach Praline Profiteroles or roasted peaches with praline gelato and peach jus:  4.5 stars.2)  Crunchy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Tart with cassis sphere & in a toasted marshmallow sauce:  5 stars!  Give me chocolate or give me death!  A high brow example of a low brow standby.A great experience, exactly what I wanted to mark my ten year return to Vegas (no joke!)Tally:Ambiance:  5 stars!Service:  5 stars!First Course:  4+5= 9/2= 4.5Second Course:  5 stars!Third Course:  5 stars!Dessert Course:  4.5+5= 9.5/2= 4.8Wine Pairings:  5 stars!5+5+4.5+5+5+4.8=5= 34.3/7= 4.9 stars#Yelp 365:  050/365My sister made reservations for this place based on the reviews.  Thought we would fine dine it out the last night before we left the sinful desert.  Sage definitely did not disappoint.Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - $79.00/person for Chef Mcclain's Signature MenuSeafood - Yes, oysters, Pacific Yellowtail, tuna, cod, scallops, black bass, troutMeats - Yes, beef, venision, veal, chicken, etcVegetables - Yes, salads.Dessert - YesFruits - YesOther - (1) Located in the Aria Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Chef Shawn McClain creates "The New American menu laced with Mediterranean contexts."  (4) McClain has received the 2001 James Beard Foundation Best New Restaurant and 2006 Best Chef Midwest awards.Appetizer:Chicken Sausage (Complimentary) - A-Ok (3 Stars) - Quarter sized slice of chicken sausage served with jam and green bean.  If I was blind tested, I would not of known that it was chicken.  It definitely had the texture of a sausage but it was not as tasty as I thought it would be.  The only odd thing is that it was served cold.Bacon bread and Sourdough (Complimentary) - So they have a guy walk around offering bread and you get a choice of bacon bread and sourdough.  My sister's fiancé is a bread fiend so he asked for both.  I did the same not because I love bread, but I was worried I would leave hungry since these fancy places tend to serve small portions.  Trust me, get the bacon bread and it's for obvious reasons.  The bread comes with silky smooth butter and sea salts.First Course:Wagyu Beef Tartare - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Wagyu beef tartare with crush capered aioli, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds, and crispy chocolate.  This dish does come with a side of toasted bread.  Tasted great!  The texture reminds me of pate.  The soft, raw beef along with the slow poached egg made it really creamy and went well with the toasted bread.  Very generous portion of tartare--approximately 3" in diameter and 1" thick.Second Course:Bacon Wrapped Rabbit - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Bacon wrapped rabbit with heirloom carrots and roasted garlic ravioli with salsify cream and black truffle.  You get 3 pieces of bacon wrapped rabbit (3" x 1") and 2 ravioli (2" in diameter).  The prominent flavor was the deep smoky bacon.  The rabbit tasted like regular white meat because the bacon was so overwhelming.  The roasted garlic ravioli tasted good as well, however it was bland because the smoky bacon would not leave your mouth.Third Course:48 Hour Beef Belly - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 Stars) - Beef belly that have been cooked for 48 hours with roasted chestnut puree, Brussel sprouts, and pickled sweet onions.  This beef was totally like butter--soft like it, you slice through it like it, and melted like it in your mouth.  The flavor is to remember because to this day I think about how wonderful it tasted.  Other beef will not be the same after you had this beef belly.  This is the beef you marry--we are soul mates.Fourth Course:Warm Apple-Fennel Strudel - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - This is a deconstruction of apple-fennel strudel with hazelnut crumble and brown butter ice cream.  The apple was nicely sweet and warm and worked well with the smooth and creamy brown butter ice cream.  The paper-thin sheet of dough was crispy and flakey and gave the dessert a little added crunch and texture.Complimentary:White chocolate dessert shot - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Our waiter for the evening came by and brought this out stating it was the compliments of the chef.  It was served in a white ceramic shot glass.  It was served warm and was very rich and sweet.  It reminds me of the warm soy bean that is served for Taiwanese breakfasts.  The only main difference there is a spicy kick at the end.  The service and food is wonderful here.  I definitely recommend Sage as a must try whenever you are in Vegas.  You'll like the ambiance as well--very dim and warm lighting.  Plus, the area is very spacious and you will not be in the space of other diners.  Sage is a Woohoo! As good as it gets!The service was spectacular, the orders came out promptly, the environment was lovely (what a relief it was to be on the strip but not have music blaring), the cocktails were top notch, and the menu was creative.  Sage lacked "5 star" complete excellence due to some dishes lacking a bit of flavor.   Some were amazing, some were good but not great.  My two "must try" dishes were the scallops (oh, drool, I can only dream of replicating that at home), and the heirloom carrot and roasted garlic ravioli (with a generous serving of shaved truffles and chantrelles).  Oh my, that ravioli was decadent and so worth the price!The oysters, beet salad, and tuna sashimi all could have used a little more oomph.  The flavors on the menu looked amazing, but they were all a bit muted.  Especially with small servings fancy-restaurant style, I want every bite to smack me upside the head.  Those at our table also thought the beef tartare and beef belly were just okay.  While they were cooked to perfection, the accompanying flavors should have been a little more intense.Deserts were nice, rich, and complex, with our favorite parts being the salted caramel ice cream that came with the pine nut torte with fresh berries.  I am enamored with the candied pine nuts, need to try that at home, and had to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.  Overall, the experience was very nice, and worth doing once every couple of years.  But, for a meal that approaches $100/person, I want everything to be AMAZING with no dishes that are just "pretty good".During the Restaurant Week 2012(Feb 27-Mar 4), my friend took me to this beautiful place.  We decided to have a dinner together since it was my birthday week.If someone asks what will be the best dining experience ever and why it's so special...?  I can say without hesitation that it is not the best seat in a fancy 5 star restaurant, it's the joy of company having a nice conversation and a meal.  I will not trade that for the world :) I sometimes hear people describing the art work, a music concert, opera, or even poetry reading along similar lines are beautiful but I wish more people would realize that sharing food can be the same way as well.Actually, it wasn't my first time trying out food at Sage.  In Aug 30th 2010, there was a fundraiser for Three Square("Wet your Appetite @Wet Republic - MGM Grand).  I had a chance to sample the foods, cocktails, & desserts from each restaurant's food station including Craft Steak, Jean Georges Steakhouse, Circo, Sensi, Joel Robuchon, Fleur de Lys, Burger Bar, & Sage.  All the dishes were excellent but the Ginger flavor cocktail from Sage was outstanding that I still remember the taste of it! I started my dinner at Sage ordering a glass of cocktail called, " Dark & Stormy" It was basically a rum with a fresh lime & a ginger beer :). It was very refreshing and tasty. *1st course: "Spring Green Garlic Soup" - very mild flavor of Spring garlic, light texture of Greek yogurt,  & crispy duct confit.  It was a very unique dish that I never had it before. "Seared Bison Tenderloin Carpaccio - Amazing!  At first, It looked as a raw tuna by the color but the taste was very solid.  The roasted pistachio & beets were sprinkled over the bison carpaccio & it blended well with the dish I thought. *2nd course: "Roasted Jumbo Fluke" - This dish was well presented with spinach, brown butter apples, & crispy leeks.  It was so tender and juicy inside and the crispy golden brown texture outside. I learned one thing from this dish that the sweetness of the apple can go well with the fish."American Wagyu Flat Iron Steak" - Oh, it was melting in my mouth!  We ordered a medium cooked for our steak and it was perfect.  It was fairly pinkish red in the center, beautifully juicy, with crisped and crunchy edges, and so much flavor! It wasn't necessary to cut the steak with a knife because it was so tender.  I was enjoying the dish along with the salsa verde and the potato puree. *3rd course: "Gianduja Pave" - it was a small dessert/ice cream with a flavor of caramel, hazelnut, & tangerine.  The taste was so rich that the small portion was more than enough to spoil my appetite for a dessert!*a complimentary drink for surprise: At the end of our dinner, the server brought a tiny porcelain cup of warm chocolate milk infused with fresh rosemary :) The aroma of rosemary was pleasant and I learned that it is a valuable in digesting foods that can be used in many dishes. I thought the pine-like fragrance & pungent flavor of rosemary went well with warm chocolate milk.  I would like to say our server, Johnathan, he was the picture of perfection in service.  He was taking time to explain all the dishes we had and waited on us at exactly the right moment each time checking on us.  And he remembered to put a little candle on my dessert and that was very nice :PI extremely loved the interior decor such as high columns, huge mirror walls, elegant lamps on random tables, and chocolate brown colored theme all the way through out entire restaurant. I really think the chef & food make a great restaurant, but also the staff & environment ambiance also contribute. I am definitely coming back for the chef McClain's Tasting Menu to try more dishes and can't wait to taste their famous "Foie Gras Brulee" :PPS $50.12 - per person for Restaurant Week Menu       $14 - classic cocktail priceI don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there. My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!! This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me. The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great. The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT      English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY  Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming! We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.**COURSE #1**Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.**COURSE #2**Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.**COURSE #3**48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.**COURSE #4**Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. **AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.If you subscribe to the "you only live once" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.Finally we tried out Sage tonight for my bf's birthday.  The signature tasting menu has upped from $79 to $89 and wine/beer pairing has upped from $39 to $44.  Here are the items we got:Amuse Buche: Smoked salmon profiterole.  One bite that excited our palate.  Then we got to choose the bacon bread or the sourdough bread to spread some chive butter and sprinkle some Himalayan sea salt on it if we like.  I prefer the sourdough. 1st Course:-Wagyu Beef Tartare -Delicious.  The beef was tender and yummy with the nice crushed caper aioli to give it that oomph and the slow poached egg to bring everything together.  We were given crostini to top the tartare on.  This was paired with a Chimay white.-Foie Gras Brulee (extra $10)-like a savory dessert.  Too rich for my taste.  I only ate a quarter and was done with this.Winner: Wagyu Beef Tartar2nd Course:-Grilled Spanish Octopus: The octopus pieces were so tender...never had it this tender ever!  These octopus slices were served with smoked Potato Puree, fried potatoes, and other veggies.  This was paired with a Unibroe.-Maine Dayboat Scallops:  2 jumbo scallops and they were cooked to perfection.  American Fish can learn from Sage how to cook seafood.  They were served with braised oxtail and wild mushrooms.  The scallops were the star and I could care less about the oxtail and mushrooms.Winner:  Both were delicious, but scallops win by a few points.3rd Course:-Iberco Pork Loin: the pork loin was a bit salty, the ham was not memorable, the crispy pork shoulder was delicious.  This was paired with a dark beer that my bf cannot remember the name of but he loved this beer.  -48 hour beef belly:  Very tender.  It was served with grilled peach.  This was paired with a Chimay Red.Winner: 48 hour beef belly, although the crispy pork shoulder in the Iberco Pork Loin was pretty darn good!4th Course:-Gianduja Pave: This is an olive oil ice cream with pieces of hazelnut crunch and basil jam.  It was quite beautiful  but a  bit hard to eat since we have to spoon a bit of the ice cream, the blue berries, the hazelnut crunch, the chocolate, to get them all in one bite.  My bf didn't like this dessert as much as I did.-Pistachio Tart:  The tart was in little pieces, strategically laid out on top of some stringy cake, served with sauteed strawberries and a strawberry-black pepper gelato.  Interesting flavor combination.  It also came with a lit candle for my bf.  My bf loved this dessert.  This was paired with a fruity lindemann beer.Winner:  Tied.We ended the night with this white chocolate drink, compliments of the chef.  Was yummy in my tummy.  The total bill, including tip, was $300.Worth it?  Yes.  Service was impeccable.Once a month, a few friends and I get together to dine at a nice restaurant. Sage has been on our list for a long time. Three of us got there early and spent some time at the bar. The signature cocktails are innovative and fresh. Most of the ingredients are not your conventional elements and mixed well. Personally, I like the Moscow Mule. Served in the traditional copper mug, the blend of lime, ginger beer, and vodka hit the spot. James, our server, was beyond amazing. We started off with a glass of champagne. We found out that any full bottle of champagne or wine under $500 is half off. That is dangerous, because it lead to five bottles being consumed throughout dinner. It is a great deal for locals and a great way to get people to come back. The best appetizers are the oysters with aged tequila mignonette and a Tabasco sorbet, roasted sweetbreads, and frois gras creme brulee. The wagyu beef tartare was decent. Nothing amazing or unique. The ones we could have done without were the octopus, yellowtail, and the brussel sprouts salad. The greens had too much of a bacon flavor. I never would have thought I'd be the one to say that. Normally bacon is the solution to all of life's problems. In this case, the smokiness was overbearing. Two different places have taught me that yellowtail is not to be ordered outside of sushi restaurants. As for entrees, the veal cheeks and NY strip were melt in your mouth buttery goodness. The side of creamed potatoes were irresistible. The tile fish was not worth getting. I would suggest getting something else. Both of the pastas are impressive. The raviolis had large pieces of king crab meat on each stuffed pocket. The cavatelli had a generous amount of shaved truffles on it. The toasted pine nuts add a textural component to the dish that was complimentary. We were told that every dish was rich and heavy. By the end, I was done for. If death was at my door, I would gladly go. Desserts are Sage's weak point. The sweet potato sundae was the best offering. Otherwise the other three desserts we ordered were forgettable. Skip dessert and just order another entree. Otherwise go to Jean Philippe Patisserie.Of all the five star high end restaurants in town, most disappoint me in one way or another. However, every once and awhile, you stumble across one that not only meets but exceeds your expectations in every way imaginable. From the service to the ambiance to the food, everything thoroughly surprised me. Mind you though, that all that fanciness doesn't come cheap but I am a huge believer in getting what you pay for. The last couple of times we have eaten here, service has been superb and the details never a miss. While the portions are generally on the smaller side and served a la carte, it does allow one to sample many things off the menu which is always a treat. However, the best way to get a little of everything without getting to full or breaking the proverbial bank is the tasting menu. I generally try and always take advantage of tasting menus when available because they truly allow you to sample a little bit of everything on the menu.DATE/TIME: August 20, 2012 // 10:00 PMPRICE: $70/person for Chef McCain's Signature Menu - 4 Courses (+$10 supplement for foie gras brulee) - Increased to $89 as of 3/15/13VALUE: A great deal. After a series of disappointing dining experiences at a few Michelin-starred restaurants, Sage was a pleasant surprise. AMBIANCE: Dimly lit. Romantic. Modern.CHANCE OF RETURNING: 80%___________________________________We were here for our 3 year anniversary, which we forgot to mention when we made reservations. To be able to taste a wider variety of dishes, my husband and I usually have a habit of ordering different dishes for each course and swapping plates. A few dishes that we both had trouble swapping include: foie gras brulee, dayboat scallops, beef belly.___________________________________:::: [ THE FOOD ] ::::* FOIE GRAS BRULEE (+$10) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sage-las-vegas-2?select=vhHgJh_3RxC2PVTNyCTneQ#vhHgJh_3RxC2PVTNyCTneQ)              - [5/5 - This dish fully converted my husband into a foie gras lover.

Aria's upscale restaurants are much more contemporary than the traditional fine dining spots you will find in older casinos like Caesars Palace and Bellagio.  Sage follows that trend.Sage is in a very modern space that has kind of an upscale lounge feel.  There is  no white tablecloth though the restaurant does feel like a fine dining restaurant when it comes to their menu--a la carte items with premium ingredients, a pre fixe menu and a tasting menu are available.I had the pre fixe menu, which offers the choice of several of Sage's signature dishes across four courses.  The meal started with complimentary bread--two crusty options including a bacon roll and salt dusted sourdough.  Both breads were fine but nothing special.  The amuse bouche was raw tuna with cucumber and wasabi.  It lacked the brightness and vibrant flavor of a good amuse.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xx2ixDh92XbugQPNsARWxA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQI started with the foie gras creme brulee, which was a foie gras custard base with a traditional creme brulee caramelized sugar crust.  Garnishes included good and sweet Bing cherries as well as warm, buttery and sweet brioche (topped with a little bit of salt).  The starter was very dessert-like, but it did have a strong foie gras flavor as well as foie gras' creaminess.  The brioche was a little oily.  I liked the dish, but I think it would work better as a dessert given its very sweet flavor.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tuTEWuF9RJLCM0gO39PSEA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQNext came day boat scallops with good mushrooms, greens and braised oxtail.  I did like the garnishes.  The oxtail was very good--tender, juicy and meaty--though there was too little of it.  The scallops were just okay. They just were not as soft, fresh or moist as I have had at other restaurants including Vegas spots like Picasso, Table 10 and Olives.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-AmrCdNy2bPb4g30EVVeSQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQI had the braised beef belly for my entree.  It was an okay tasting dish.  The garnishes were decent but not as good as what came with the scallops.  The best garnish with this beef dish was the tart pickled ramps, which was the only real flavor that stood out.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7u38OgDbTux-a4MU7_N2dQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQThe beef belly was like ribs.  The beef belly had a good flavor and it was tender and juicy.  I did not like the unevenness of it with some meaty parts but also fatty parts that were not rendered down.  It could have just been the nature of this cut.Dessert was an almond tart, which was really dense and thick with the texture of a butterscotch square.  It was dry and had no cake-like or cream-like consistency.  I did not like the core of this dessert though the garnishes of macerated berries and creamy, refreshing and fragrant lavender gelato were both good.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W9-266MC8A3Rbr7hAIaKYQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQA la carte prices were very high like other high-end Vegas restaurants with entrees in the $40s and $50s.  The pre fixe menu was not too bad of a deal given the variety of ingredients and generous portions.Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a quick pace.  Our server had a matter of fact manner (which I liked).  It was a little different from the service I have had at similar restaurants where servers tend to be very gracious and eager to please.  Even though she did not have that incredibly pleasant approach of those other places, she was still polite, professional and engaging.Overall, the food at Sage was decent and properly cooked though not much about the meal stood out.  Though Vegas has a lot of fine dining and upscale restaurants, I actually find it quite hard to have a really great high-end meal in Vegas.  If you are looking for really good contemporary upscale cuisine, I recommend the more expensive L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in MGM Grand.  If quality of ingredients and good flavors are what you are seeking, I recommend the similarly priced though more formal and traditional Picasso (in the Bellagio) over Sage.Aria, like most casinos on The Strip, offers both complimentary self and valet parking.A top notch restaurant that was delicious from start to finish.  The people working there will literally give you the shirt off their back!  My wife was freezing and our excellent server offered the manager's cardigan to wear during dinner.  Who does that??We went with Chef McClain's Signature Menu for $89.  No wine pairings because I am usually too buzzed at the end to appreciate the flavors.  I started with the "Wagyu Beef Tartare" with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg and dark chocolate.  Chocolate and beef isn't a combo I am usually down with but it was a fun twist that totally worked.  I literally could've had this as my whole meal.  The buttered and grilled sourdough bread complimented it perfectly.My wife got the "Foie Gras Brulee" which was wow, wow, wow.  It was such a creative dish and a wild mix of flavors upon first taste but it just got better and better after each bite.  It's ok to lick the dish, right?  This could have been a dessert and I wondered if the chef ever considered that.  I got the "Australian Wagyu Sirloin" for my main entree.  It was as tender as expected but I was ready to swap after having a bit of the 48 hour beef belly.  That was treeeeemendous and what I would go with had I done it all over again.  "Gianuja Pave" was my choice for dessert.  It's not often I get to try olive oil ice cream with basil jam.  That was a really excellent ending to the meal and kept up with the creativity of the experience.Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brûlée.The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.Happy Eats!New American at it's finest.  Combining globally sourced ingredients and flavors with classic American cuisine then trying to achieve the broadest range of taste results in incredible good eats.  It's all done without molecular gastronomy. For starters, the wagyu beef tartare; great beef flavor and just the right accompaniments to balance the usual cloying fatty finish (pickled mustard seeds, capers, the usual coddled egg yolk, and CHOCOLATE).  The bitterness balanced the entire dish.  Not to be missed, the foie gras custard brulee; excellent.  Cherries for the requisite acidic sweetness, toasted cocoa nibs for bitterness and a twist, salted brioche.  Imaginative.Finally, the roasted sweetbreads; stunning.  Bacon fat (from a thick cut piece of bacon) provides the seasoning to the airy sweetbreads they blend well with polenta and wafting umame of trumpet mushrooms.  Slightly one dimensional texturally but good eats for sure.Salads are anything but common.  How about a heirloom tomato salad with smoked peaches and baby fennel accented by lemon pickled cucumber.  Vibrant acidity, complexity from the licorice fennel, sweet bitterness of the peaches.  Perfect.For mains, the Iberico pork loin, cooked medium, tender with a pronounced heritage pork flavor.  It contrast well with a piece of crispy pork shoulder.  Served with a sweet, smoked date pure that makes the perfect accompaniment heightening the natural sweetness of the pork.The 36 hour braised wagyu short rib, equally good.  One of the best braised short ribs I've had (the best being Craftsteak).  Served with an earthy horseradish potato pave and caramelized onions, glazed in its own braising liquid.  The braised beef, rich and melting the sides providing a sweet, earthy balance.Excellent and efficient service.The wine list remains excellent.  Vegas resort pricing.Truly a foodies playground!I think my expectations were too high. This was not a bad experience by any means, but I have had better meals at some of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. I treated a friend for their birthday and we opted for the early evening dinner three course menu ($59 pp) with wine pairing ($29 pp). The restaurant is classy and beautiful with plenty of quite and intimate space. Our server was attentive, but overbearing at certain points. Overall, I think he did a great job, so I won't really nitpick there.We started off with an amuse-bouche consisting of kampachi and mango. The texture and flavor was incredible. I started off with a chilled sweet corn soup while the other party opted for a fresh vegetable medley. I absolutely devoured my soup, it was perfect. Her veggies were completely unoriginal, they tasted fresh, but that is about it. There was no interesting spin or vinaigrette to accompany the meal. As my entree I opted for the Pacific Yellowtail Kampachi with chanterelle mushrooms, bacon, manila clams and black grapes. The fish was not cooked evenly, but the overall flavors worked superbly together. The other party opted for the flat iron steak which ended up being $10 extra on top of the tasting menu price. It was a generous serving of protein that was cooked perfectly.The final course was the dessert, and that was heavenly. It was a caramelized pineapple mousse with all sorts of other goodies added to it. To acknowledge her birthday, it came with a single candle that I though was a nice touch. Overall it was an enjoyable, yet not a mind blowing meal. Especially for $250 with tip.Totally hip, totally fun, totally delicious. Servers were attentive, playful and far from uptight.  Great all around dining experience -- Vegas style!Starters:Grilled robada apricots with toasted pecan purée, shaved pork belly, watercress and crispy guanciale -- Different and tasty!Wagyu beef tartar with crushed caper aoili, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds & crispy chocolate!  Heaven on earth!  Foie gras custard brûlée with bing cherries, toasted cocoa nibs & salted brioche -- My favorite way to have foie gras.  DAYAM it was GOOOOOD.Main Courses:Maine scallops with braised oxtail, wild mushrooms and salted caramel reduction - Fabulous-O!  Salted reduction was genius.  The short ribs were dynamite.  They were so tender and quite the party in my mouth!  I've been dying for something like this after watching an episode of Master Chef season finale.Dessert: Efferescent grape mousse with greek yogurt posset, carbonated grapes and lychee sorbet. Unique! Never seen anything like it on any menu & pretty darn amazing.  Didn't think I would like it but wanted to try it because it's so different.  What a perfect combo of balance... especially with the lychee sorbet.Apple fritters with root beer panna cotta, apple cider sorbet with sassafras ice cream. This is supposed to replicate what you would get at the fair, but with a sophisticated twist.  The edible paper was so cool.  Definitely a lot of intricate details involved in crafting this piece of art.UNIQUE & EXCELLENT in every way!  Talk about creative.  Must try the grape mousse.  I was a bit nervous but the pastry chef knows what she is doing.  Complex, creative & delicious. Better move quick though because the options change with the season.At the end of our meal we were given warm sage milk.  How fitting and perfect to help cleanse the pallet.Sage is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!  They have had two of my favorite appetizers...maybe 2 of the top 5 or 10 appetizers.  One being their Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg--Smoked Potato/Shaved Black Truffles/Toasted Country Bread.  The other being their famous Foie Gras Custard Brulee--Apricot Chutney/Toasted Cocoa Nibs/Salted Brioche.  If these two weren't enough, Sage continues to shine with other great starters.  The Aged Tequila Mignonette that accompanies the already creamy and succulent Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters is fantastic!  Moreover, the Wagyu Beef Tartare is a solid choice and the Chilled Sweet Corn Soup is outstanding! Additionally though, this cocktail snob can't stop thinking about their "Seville Constelation." This is my current favorite drink.  There is nothing I'd rather start an evening of whiskey/bourbon/scotch/rye drinking more than this drink.  It is refined and delicate for a whiskey-based cocktail, but still has enough of a backbone to entice whiskey purists.  It is the epitome of a balanced drink!The menu is not perfect in my opinion, I have had a few dishes on occasion that have fallen flat, but in general Sage's dishes are inventive, and bring together a wonderful combination of technique and flavor.  I am certainly more of a fan of the Starters then I am of the Entrées, but that doesn't mean that the Entrées are bad, just not as euphoric as the Starters.  I generally prefer lighter meats and seafood dishes.  I think Sage does a good job with these items, but I would recommend the Steaks and Braises to those looking for more cohesive plates.Always check to see if they are participating in Restaurant Week when it rolls around. This year's Restaurant Week menu at Sage was the best value on all of Restaurant Week....it was a delightful excuse to come in again.Furthermore, Lauren is one of the best servers you will ever have the pleasure of experiencing.  Don't request her though as we are trying to keep that on the DL so she is available for us when we come in.We were staying at the Mandarin Oriental and had a positive experience when we came to Sage for dinner on a Friday night. We made the mistake of coming back on Sunday night to have a cocktail at the bar. Aaron B. was our bartender and I can say that, without a doubt, he was one of the most unpleasant people I've encountered in the service industry. If this was a low-rent bar with cheap drinks, I'd forgive him. But...we paid top dollar for an enjoyable high-end experience and, after attempting to make polite chit-chat with him about how he was making our cocktails, he became oddly aggressive and insulting -- as if we were idiots questioning the work of a master. Absolutely ridiculous.A few moments later, we also overheard him complaining loudly about a female customer who was "so f--ing stupid that he had to explain every item on the menu three times." Very classy indeed. For our last night in Vegas, it left a bad taste in our mouths. We visit Vegas often, but we won't be going back to Sage. There are too many other places to spend our money -- and we've encountered many other bartenders who make comparable drinks and understand how to engage with their customers.Wow!  All I can say is, wow!  I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened, so when the opportunity came up I  jumped on it.  I had family in town and thought it would be perfect to try a good selection of dishes.There were four of us and we were seated promptly in the main dining area.  I really liked the decor.  It was hip, modern, and had a nice quaint atmosphere that wasn't too loud, but not too quiet either.  We were approached by our server, who wasn't very inviting and were presented with menus.  She didn't bother going through the menu, nor did she offer us any specials or the tasting menu.  I would've liked the option of a tasting menu.  The waitress seemed rather rushed to get our orders in, I guess we came in towards their closing time, but she didn't offer any suggestions or help with the menu to expedite our ordering.  I asked her what she recommended and she pointed out the octopus and foie gars for appetizers.  I asked her if she could come back in a minute and she left annoyed.  Anyway, we ordered the Ricotta Cavatelli, Braised Waygu, Foie Gras Custard, Spanish Octopus starter, Poached Egg starter and Organic chicken.  She then told us that the chicken would take about 30-45 minutes to prepare.  It was kind of upsetting because my cousin had her heart set on that chicken, and for a dish that requires extra prep time, it should be mandatory they tell us in the beginning.  She could've put her order in the first time she came around.  She ended up going for the lobster ravioli instead.The food was horrible, to say the least.  Six dishes came out and all was difficult to eat, some more than others.  We left the Waygu, Cavatelli, Foie Grad brûlée and octopus uneaten.  The waitress saw this and cleared the plates without asking us how our food was.  She just wanted to get out of there and I could tell while she stared at us from across the room that she was hoping we'd finish fast.  Seriously, service was such a joke.  She was useless, rude, and unhelpful.  I asked her about the portions and she said they were individually portioned out, which was fine.  I just wanted an idea of how much we would order to get a good selection.  To my surprise, the dishes were actually pretty big.  My pasta could've fed two. THE FOOD:-The Grilled Spanish Octopus (starter) was extremely acidic.  The texture was tough and kinda rubbery.  You couldn't really taste any other ingredient, and the plating was messy.-Foie Gras Custard Brûlée (starter) was ok, it was the best dish out of the six.  I liked the salted brioche it came with.  The texture wasn't like a creme brûlée though, it was more like a mousse.  They added some fig and brown butter chestnut, which over powered any taste of the Foie Gras.  It was a really sweet dish, so I felt like we had a dessert for a starter.-Slow Poached Organic Egg (starter): I didn't try this dish, but my cousin said it was good.  How can you mess up a poached egg though?-36 Hr. Brasied Waygu was extremely sweet and acidic, as if they braised it in vinegar.  One bite was more than enough, so this dish went to waste.-Ricotta Cavatelli: They tried to make Spaetzle for this dish, which is a thin pasta, but ended up making it so thick it had the texture of gnocchi.  This extremely thick doughy pasta was the only thing you tasted.  Moreover, it looked like they just took a bunch of ingredients from a fridge and threw it on the plate.  Less is more with this dish, and they over did it.  No one at the table wanted to eat it, so it sat untouched for the duration of our dinner.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS DISH.-Fennel Ravioli w/ Lobster was a joke.  It was pasta, topped with lobster and whatever else it came with.  All of the ingredients were sort of layered and just laid on top of empty ravioli pasta.  My cousin decided to finish the dish, even though she did not like it, because we left so many dishes uneaten already.Didn't bother with dessert.  At that point we were already pissed at how much money we threw away to this restaurant, and our server just sucked.I believed all the hype that came with this restaurant and was extremely disappointed.  I will not go back, and will not recommend it to anyone.  I want to think I came on a bad night, too close to closing time, but the quality of the food and service is not worth the $30-50pp price mark.  Also, they shouldn't be taking tables an hour and a half prior to them closing if they are going to end up rushing you out.I really want to come back and give this place another try, but my experience was just flat out horrible.  I did like the bread they offered, lol.We were SO NOT impressed with this restaurant, NOT at all. I was debating two stars or three stars, considering we were tired, maybe our taste buds were a little numbed from too much drinking, or our judgment was a little impaired from vodka, so I think three stars is fair. Beautiful restaurant for sure, it was nearly empty on a Saturday night, not a good sign. Got seated at a comfy and intimate booth, very romantic indeed. Brought our own Perrier Nuit Blanche, corkage was $35 too. Took a short while to look through the menu, our server introduced the chef's tasting menu, but I don't eat meat so we can't order that. They have vegetarian and vegan tasting menus too. Starters:Garlic soup with prawn, the best dish of the entire meal, very nice garlic flavor, not too light or too strong, tender and fresh prawn, so good! Dozen of Vancouver island Kushi oysters: fairly fresh, the housemade sauce was a little bland, had to ask for tabasco, tasted better with hot sauce though. Romaine greens with parmesan cheese, my salad never came, so I asked to pack it to go, but didn't eat it when we got back, so it was a waste because they forgot about my salad. Entrees:American kobe skirt steak in rare plus: it was not rare enough for hubby, he liked the flavors alright, was not mind blowing at all. Pacific red snapper with veggie stock: server said this was a popular dish, OK... The fish was completely flavorless, the veggies in it were a little too raw for my taste, it tasted like grass to me, or was it the veggie broth? But the fish was very fresh and tender, just extremely bland! This dish FAILED! We weren't interested in our entrees, didn't want desserts either, just asked them to pack everything, including our unfinished Champagne, I have to say that I had high expectations for this restaurant because of the high ratings on yelp, and the major advertisement of fine dining at Aria hotel. It was a HUGE disappointment! The service didn't meet my expectation either, our server wasn't attentive or friendly enough, there were a few staffs served us, they all looked dull to me for some reason, or probably we finished our meal too fast that they didn't have time to check on us.  I don't think we will ever be back for Sage, this restaurant didn't work for us, just one of those high rating restaurants fell short I guess, it happens sometime.Close your eyes children, it's about to go downIf this was my last meal on the face of this Earth, I would have died the only way I would like to and then gone straight to heaven to take a nap. Luckily, this was my last meal of the trip, and then I went to see Calvin Harris after at Hakkasan. So it's pretty much equivalent to going to heaven and taking a nap because I don't remember anything after.Definitely sexyIt's the kind of restaurant you want to spend your dinners at in Vegas. Very fitting for a sexy night out, dark and welcoming space with warm colors and vibrant high-end materials. Not to mention the at tentative servers who make you feel like a boss. I literally left there telling people to give me their TPS reports. "Apparently you didn't put one of those new cover letters on the new TPS reports......" Who doesn't like feeling like a boss? I wish I had an endless stomach.For occasions like this, I want to eat their food forever. Try their tasting menu or off a la carte in this exact order: 1) Vancouver Island Oysters 2) Wagyu Beef Tartare 3) Grilled Spanish Octopus 4) Main Day Boat Scallops 5) 48 Hour Beef Belly 6) Meyer Lemon Cheesecake.............then tell the kids to close their eyes.
Vu Bistro=WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A RESTAURANT!This is so disappointing to have to write about. This last summer our family and my husbands family bought vacation homes in Fountain Hills. My husbands family was visiting from England and I told them we should definitely stop by the Vu. I had been there once and the views and food were delicious. This time we arrived at 8pm and there were just a couple tables there of people. No music this time (last time it was fabulous) but it was a Thursday. We ordered a few drinks and they came pretty quickly. We also ordered food and that was a problem all together. We ordered a caprese salad, 3 calamari's, seared ahi, 3 kobe burgers, 1 pasta dish, and 1 risotto. 45 minutes later we had only received the ahi. We had some starving folks so we asked if any bread would be available. The waiter was not very friendly with a response and finally said but yes I can get you some. Did not provide any update on how much longer our food would take. Then one person asked to see a wine menu and again the waiter in an unfriendly tone said "why don't you just ask me". My sister-in-law was a bit taken back by the response and quickly tried to figure out what she might want. It seemed like it was a burden to him to get a wine list. He took her order and walked off. I walked in and just picked up a menu for her to look at for her next drink choice. Then 15 minutes later, no wine and no additional food (no appetizers or salads even). Now it's been an hour and we've had not updates, no water refills, not any friendly visits from the waiter at all. Everyone was so hungry and the restaurant was pretty empty (only two other tables)! My husband decided to get up and speak to the waiter. As he did the waiter came with a plate of bread and one caprese salad (why did it take an hour for an uncooked caprese salad?). My husband said, "Whew that was close, we were getting ready to walk out!!". The waiter quickly snapped back "but why?" and that set off a lot of angry hungry people. The waiter continued to argue with no apologies at all for the length of time it was taking or reasons. All he seemed he could add was "your kobe burgers aren't even ready". (yes....that is our point). He didn't even realize we hadn't received our calamari either. He was so rude and unapologetic it was truly shocking!! My husband asked to see the manager and the waiter said "I kind of am the manager". So my husband said there's no way we can stay here now, we want to pay our bill and leave.  The waiter gave him a bill for $98 dollars. lol it included a bunch of the food we hadn't even received. He fixed it for him in a major huff and saying "here's something you won't be having" in a way that he was trying to make us feel guilty. So awful! We ended up leaving right after to try to find another restaurant. Which in Fountain Hills is very difficult after 9pm. The best we could find was the The All American Sports Grill. We went in sat down and instantly started to have way better service from the staff there than at the Vu. They were actually friendly, smiling and helpful.  We also received food within 10-20 minutes (varied based on appetizers and burgers) and it was still pretty tasty. If Vu would have been friendly, showed a bit of "care" in their attitude and communicated a bit better I'm sure we would have been patient and waited even though it was taking so long. We just had no idea if it was going to be 5 minutes more or 45 minutes more. Really ridiculous and a huge disappointment as I had high hopes for this being one of our favorites in Fountain Hills.
BBQ King=Don't believe its name in Chinese. "Number One BBQ, jook and noodle" restaurant is sure as hell not number one in anything except grossness.BBQ pork was orange in color and had no taste. Roast duck was fatty and unseasoned. Did they truly expect every person to dip the duck into the plum sauce? What if you don't like plum sauce? The ratio of meat to rice was amazingly vast -- 70% rice to 30% meat. We also ordered the wontons in soup -- wontons were not anything special. The accompanying broth was overwhelmingly fishy. When I asked the waitress (in Cantonese) if they accepted credit card, she barked "for a little over $10???? PAY CASH!!!"YES MAAM! I paid and left hurriedly! Never returning.
Pho Saigon 8=I just got back from a two week trip to Vietnam and was excited to test out Pho Saigon 8 after reading some good reviews from John Curtis.  First, I noticed that some have complained about the service.  It's not prompt, or attentive, but trust me, that's authentic!  In Vietnam servers don't get tipped so they have no reason to be attentive, and there you have to ask for your check... So, if it really is Vietnamese staff working there, expect to have to request your check and realize that it's not rude to approach them.Now for the food!  We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were tasty, although they could have used some more herby additions.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  We split the Pho Tai (thin strips of beef in the beef pho broth).  The pho was good, not the best I've had, but a solid middle of the road.  It was pretty flavorful, add-ins are appropriate (giant basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers).  But, what impressed me was that they had the rice crepes that have become my favorite Vietnamese meal!The crepe is made with rice flour (it's a savory crepe, folks), cooked in a pan until a bit crispy, and filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork.  It comes with a fish sauce based dripping sauce that augments this dish wonderfully.  With this meal (which appears in the appetizer section, but I use as a main course) comes a giant plate of ruffage.  The proper execution is to take a lettuce leaf, cut off a chunk of the crepe + filling, and use the lettuce leaf as a wrap to make your own little spring roll out of it.  Add in the carrot, some kind of other root vegetable, and mint that they provide.  The rolls are cool and crunchy on the outside, warm, crunchy, and flavorful on the inside.  Don't forget the dipping sauce, it's well worth it.Most Vietnamese restaurants in town don't extend past pho and some stir-fried rice dishes, and maybe a "clay pot" type dish if you're lucky.  This rice "crepe" will keep me coming back for more, yum!I came here for lunch with several co-workers. The weather is cold and what better time than that to get some pho. We came around noon since my coworker mentioned they get pretty busy. The decor is nice and they keep the place pretty clean. I wasn't in a soup eating mood, so I decided on a vermicelli bowl. My other coworker ordered some eggrolls to share and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they had a nice crunch. My vermicelli bowl was a little lackluster. I usually enjoy all the nice crunchy vegetables that are included and this one just included a few leaves of lettuce and some sprouts. Definitely not what I had hope for. The pork and shrimp were ok, but definitely not one of best bowls I've encountered. Since they are the closest pho place to work, I'll probably give them another shot, but I'll try their pho next time. The prices are a little on the high side, but I guess that's pretty typical for the Henderson area. For now, I can't give them much beyond three stars.Table for 1...dinner was less than $10 bucks + $2 dollar tip!Ordered & enjoyed one of their Pho Bo (rice noodle w/ beef broth) soups.#18 Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach - noodle w/ rare eye round, flank, brisket, tendon & tripe. It was good. (see photos)I asked for Banh Mi as an appetizer, but the server said they don't offer any sandwiches.Nice artwork on the walls, including several unique roll up window shades that have beautiful waterfalls silk screened on them. (see photos)I'll be back again!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #211
Marinelli's Pasta Bar=This is another 3.5 star restaurant on Yelp that I feel is a little more deserving of 4 - 4.5 stars rather than the 3.5 it actually has. As you can see by my checkins, I've been here a couple times. I started coming here right before they moved. I was actually quite worried because I had fallen in love with one of their dishes and was told by my waiter that the restaurant was closing for remodeling in a week and they weren't sure if they would even have a Marinelli's at the M Resort anymore. Just my luck! And whatever they were putting there was top secret and even staff wasn't privy to what was happening. I was so bummed because I had finally found a place where I could get my pasta with vodka sauce craving in check, as evidenced by the Yelp tip I left here & now, in the blink of an eye, everything was all in limbo. Well... what ended up going down was that they remodeled the old Marinelli's spot and gave that space to the new Jayde Fuzion restaurant and moved Marinelli's to where the old Anthony's Oyster Bar once was & renamed it Marinelli's Pasta Bar. I was pleased to see that I didn't lose my beloved restaurant after all! I have major issues with losing a faved place to order Penne ala Vodka ever since Ago in the Hard Rock closed down. I still have yet to recover from that whole experience and have been searching high and low for a similar place to get my fix ever since. So... I always order the same thing here. I get the Penne ala Vodka off the menu but then I get all high maintenance on them and have them add prosciutto (to make it like the dish I fell in love with at Ago) along with roasted garlic slices & crushed red pepper flakes. I recommend my fave concoction with a glass of the Prisoner wine. I also really enjoy their Caprese Salad.Service is excellent here... Particularly if you sit at the bar. The seating is very comfortable and there's plenty of room, so you aren't giving up anything by sitting at the bar as opposed to a table. Plus, if you need anything, there are at least two chefs right there cooking in front of you that you can ask as well as your waiter.I must say a big thank you to the M Resort for keeping Marinelli's around. I am going to keep patronizing their restaurant for as long as I am eating carbs. :)
Red Apple Grill=SW corner of W Sahara Ave & Torrey Pines inside Sinclair(Formerly it was located on Jones between Spring Mtn & Desert Inn-right out front of the old Boston Bar & Grill.)You can smell the BBQ from a block away, they cook on an open pit bbq so you can see it & smell it before you even get out of the car.I have been trying to try this place ever since I saw it reappeared in this gas station.It's only open Tues-Saturday.Sandwiches are 2 for 1 so I got a HOT link & pulled pork-coleslaw & chili for sides.$10!! What a deal!John the owner/operator is quite a character-very friendly and he takes great pride in his work.The pulled pork was great, nice & smoky with a little crunch from being grilled.The HOT link was one of the best I've had at any BBQ joint. REAL Spicy.The coleslaw was ok & the chili was meat & beans -NOT red chili or verde with any tomato or peppers, but it was  a very nice change-a kind of BBQ chili-smoky with al dente beans. I'll go back & try the ribs & tri-tip next time.
Famous Dave's=I wanted to bring in lunch for clients who requested Famous Dave's. There were a total of 6 of us and this was the first time I had visited this location. For delivery the order needs to be a minimum of $150.00 so I called my order in for the All American Feast the day before and advised the staff I would pick up at 11:30 amI arrived just after they opened at 11:00 am and went into the bar area where the waitress was very helpful. Within ten minutes my order was ready to go and they included paper plates and utensilsThe lunch included a full slab of St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a whole Country-Roasted Chicken, 1/2 lb. of Texas beef brisket, creamy coleslaw, famous Dave fries, Wilbur beans, six pieces of fresh sweet corn and four Corn Bread Muffins. I added on to my order an additional two pints of sides - beans, slaw, 2 corn muffins and 6 cans of sodas. The food was put on a large tray with the exception of the sides which were packed efficiently. The food was a hit and tasty. Ribs were smoked and tender, brisket was yummy and chicken flavorful and moist. The sides were solid and the extra pints weren't even touched BC we had so much food. Actually the platter fed a total of 7 and was a great choice.My clients were happy, since it's difficult for entire staff to get out of the office and I was able to secure some orders! I would definitely use Famous Dave's BBQ in the future for lunch to go.
Crazy Otto's Diner=Country Diner alert!!  All your breakfast  and lunch diner favorites !  We have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like.  Well we wonder no more.  For lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an Oklahoma Diner , I could almost see my  country country cousins stopping by this place.  The menu is full of classic sandwiches like French Dip, Monte Cristo, Hamburgers and other American Sandwich Staples.  The menu is big on Breakfast and has lots of Omelettes to chose from .They even mark all the low carb items so you for those South Beachers it's a little easier. For starters Linda our server was instantly like family, she was sweet and kind . I love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , "So Sammy what are we having today?" Linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations  .She even warned us about the size of portions and boy she wasn't kidding. Linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service. We noticed in this small establishment  there  were four servers , whoa that's rare these days. I had the avocado Omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa  but I never asked for any either. The hash browns were not my favorite style  more mashed than chunky but you decide. You can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast. Plus One( husband) had the  Prime rib and eggs breakfast which he couldn't finish. The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch! The decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only.hobo eggs dish = ridiculous. My waiter warned me that it was "alot of food". I thought, ok, it's gonna be a big plate of food.I was wrong, way wrong. It's not a big plate of food, it is a MOUNTAIN of food! http://twitpic.com/awqxk A tasty mountain of hashbrowns, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers & eggs, with the majority of it being hashbrowns. This behemoth of a serving had me shocked & joyed. Crazy Otto's made my day yesterday. I'll be eating leftovers all week.While I reserve the right to upgrade this my gut is 3.5 stars rounded down Thanks yelp. Service: 5 stars, granted there were only us and 2 others for a short time. The staff was great and friendly. Food: 2.5 Stars, I had a burger and knew that it was not going to be the best burger ever but decided to try it anyway. They Flat Grill (fry) a hand pattied 1/2lb burger and serve it with mayo, mustard, 1000 Island, let and tom. While it was not over cooked it was too thin to cook med rare. The flavor was ok but there was no seasoning at all on it. The fries needed salt desperately also. There was a small and I mean small cup of what appeared to be coleslaw.. wow it was bad. Building: 3 Stars Clean open, plenty of light. Looked nice to me. I WILL be back for some breakfast.
Paradise Bakery and Cafe=12  Steps from the car to the door. 11  Or so people seated having coffee and pastries. 10  Peanut butter cookies readily available. 9    Feet separate the counter from the back wall. 8    Varieties of muffins for sale. 7    Employees doing ? 6    Foot tall customer waiting alone for service. 5    Rumblings from my tummy waiting for a snack. 4    Minutes waiting for one of the 7 employees to take my order. 3    Attempts to use the free wifi. 2    Minutes to polish off the zucchini nut muffin which hit the spot. 1    Hot latte that was supposed to be a mocha but was good anyway. 0    Reviews for this location until just now.
Gyro House=I have never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but I am officially converted!! Let me start by saying the Gyro house has the best chicken gyro I've ever had!I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that aesthetically, this place is not something to look at. It's located in a small strip mall and the restaurant itself is not the fanciest. However, it definitely has character. It looks like your run-of-the-mill small, local business. The owner was in the store when I went in, and he was super friendly and I received great customer service.Now for the good part... the food! I ordered a chicken gyro with french fries. Both were delish! The chicken was very tender and was served on the fluffiest pita bread I've ever tasted. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion (which I picked off), and tzaziki sauce. I paid about $7.50 for my meal, and it was definitely worth every penny. If you're a fan of a great gyro, this is the place for you!
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=Update of the Update. They are still charging me for my food. Which I didn't get. Because this is the SANDWICH SHOP that ran out of BREAD! NOT COOL. Didn't want to have to do the CHARGEBACK but since they want to be dicks about it, time to do that and contact Corporate. Hey Yelp, I wish we could give out NEGATIVE STARS....********************************************Unfreakinbelievable. I go through the hassle of online ordering....it's a hassle since their crappy online page uses Flash it blocks iOS devices from ordering. So I go online with the laptop, place my order, get in the car to head out and get a call: Sorry, we're out of bread and we closed the store an hour ago!ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?I have never, EVER had anyone cancel an online order on me, and when a sandwich shop can't even keep their most basic item, bread, in stock, then they've got a damn problem. Venting my frustration even more.... I finally got a whole group of people to figure out what they wanted to eat and jump through a byzantine crappy website only to get told sorry...we can't get our head out of our rear end enough to order enough damn bread....Oh and they want me to come by the store to process the debit card refund sometime tomorrow...I have a damn job, I don't have time to come back and deal with stupidity. Refund? How about I pick up the phone and yell CHARGEBACK to my credit card company tonight instead! Placement on my Jackassery! list is about as guaranteed as it gets. I don't do stupid and clueless, and especially not when social media lets me light you up over it. And this experience was an example of both.
Higley Hot Dog Hut=I'm just going to say "ditto" to Alan L's review.  It's because of his detailed review that we knew to order outside and to bring cash.  So thank you, Alan!  The Hut is a great little Chicago-style joint that took me right back, not to Chicago, but to Hot Dog Heaven in Orlando, which has been ranked in the top hot dog places in the country.  We got a polish dog, a combo with sausage and beef, chili cheese fries, and a bottle of water for something like $13.90.  GREAT dogs, low prices, friendly staff, and excellent chili cheese fries.  We sat outside so we wouldn't have to look at any Cubs gear.  (GO CARDS!)  I'm sorry it's in Gilbert, but make the drive.  It's worth it.
The Bayou=I just need to start off this review by stating that I worked in a Cajun / Creole restaurant for half my life.When I arrived it was pretty empty so I had time to chat up the bartenders. I started talking to them how I worked in a Cajun/Creole restaurant and they warmed up to me real fast. They started recommending everything that was popular and their own favorites. I started with the Seafood Gumbo. Fresh seafood, nice thick veggies and a great roux base. Served with a piece of french bread. * Now they use Leidenheimer bread which is a New Orleans staple. Not my favorite because it has to be served fresh within a day or two. But this placed seemed like they had that under control*  Next I tried a side of the Red Beans and Rice. You really got the flavor of the   smoked ham hocks and Abita beer. With some local smoked andouille sausage. Chalk this one up to a win! For my main course I had the Catfish Po Boy. Now they do this right. You can get it dressed, (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and red onion) or naked and you can choose you sauce, (mayo, tartar, remoulade or cocktail.) The hand cut fries that came with it? Just stop right now. You won't find any better than this. For dessert, yes I was not full, or just did not care, I had the Creme Brulee. By know means am I a dessert snob but I have tried a lot of different ones and this one was good. It had a good custard / pudding texture and the sugar was browned, not burnt. A nice portion sizing as well. Now the best part of the review? The beer. Sweet baby alcohol gods the beer!! They have Abita, and lot's of it. So many choices you will not know what to do. They even had a nice selection that was no longer in season so they were hard to find. 12 oz. and 22 oz. bombers. If you have never had Abita get your butts down there for the drink alone. They also had a great selection of cocktails. \This place really blew my mind. I cannot stress how great this place is, how friendly the bartenders are, and how tasty the food is... and all of it is well presented to, because we all know you eat with your eyes first.Another Saturday afternoon and here I am at The Bayou again. Happily, the have one of my davorite beers on tap again....Abita's Grapefruit IPA!! This pairs so well with the grilled oysters that I specifically made the trek all the way from 'the land beyond the beltline' for. Unfortunately,  the Grapefruit IPA is a seasonal beer, and it's been on tap for two weeks already, so how much longer they'll have it is anyone's guess. I debated whether to even tell y'all about it, since that means more for me while it's here, but being a good Yelper, there it is. All the food I've had here has been excellent but the oysters are always my go to. Whether you get 'em fresh on the half-shell, grilled, or 'dirty' (in a shot of vodka), you will not be disappointed. Make sure you get here for Fat Tuesday! The most fun celebration in Madison and they serve AMAZING beignets!! (which are served freshly made year round!)Do yourself a favor, take a Saturday afternoon and make the trip to New Mad-orleans!
