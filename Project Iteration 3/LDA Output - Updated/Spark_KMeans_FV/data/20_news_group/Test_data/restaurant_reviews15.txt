Review Text :
First of all, I am a huge fan of Hawaiian Food, and have enjoyed L& L many years. However, after expanding my taste buds to Hawaii, California and some great Hawaiian food here in the Vegas Valley, I have to say, hmmmmm not bad L& La. Location - This one is near the Walmart / Sams Club on Serene just west of Eastern.  Easy location and parking.b.  Service - Is, not great, but not mediocre. It is just okay. They do not attempt to make a difference or to make it a great experience.c.  Food - Great overall selection.  We ordered the Katsu and the Beef plate.  The Katsu was quite good and they give you a ton of food. The Mac Salad was just right.  Where they get seriously dinged on the stars is the beef.  Can you remove the fatty tendons that is all over the beef?  You cannot eat this properly because so much sinewy fat is in this beef. It is tough, rough and downright a pain in the but to cut away with a plastic fork and plastic knife in a styrofoam plate.  This is evident to the quality of beef they are using and I would say that all their salty flavorings are covering up the poor meet taste.  However, the texture totally reeks of poor quality.d.  The bathroom - Why do lock it?  What a pain where your hands are totally greasy from trying to pick apart the fat from the meat. Then we cannot just push our way into the restroom, we have to pick up a key on a long stick, work the lock and get in.  I just want to wash my hands and now I have to wash first to pick up the keys..... Yucky.Overall, the taste of the flavoring is good, the katsu good, but the beef and the inconvenience of this place overall causes me to give this a 3 star at best.GK says, gas is still cheap. Keep driving to somewhere else...I went here today for dinner because I was across the street at Costco. I totally forgot this place opened up (and so very glad it did) because the only other one I know of is near UNLV---across town for me.The bento box was really goood. It came with four different kinds of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. All the meats were delicious, even the fried stuff wasn't very greasy. I did not try the macaroni salad --- I dislike items that taste like mayonnaise (IMHO). Thankfully, they kept the mac salad in a separate container so that it would not touch any of the food that I actually wanted to eat. This will def be my go-to here.The seafood platter, which included scallops, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, rice, and mac salad, was alright. It didn't come with as much food as the bento combo, but it was the same price. You always have to pay more for seafood though. The scallops tasted soft with a nice, crispy breading. I liked the mahi-mahi too--very fresh tasting. I did not taste the shrimp.PROS:-Refillable drinks-Plenty of seats (for a small place), some booths too-Food was served quickly-Good service overall-Food comes in to-go boxes (but not biodegradable ones)The one aspect of the visit that I disliked was that that they did not close the door even though it was windy outside. I was sitting by the door and got chills every so often. I got over it as the wind died down though.I'll be back... I need to try their spam musubi and saimin.Man! I love their food.... let me introduce something good ( personal opinion) :37. Spam for sure!!!!!29. Kalua & Lau Lau combo in one regular size15. Loco Moco in mini size ( for lunch )21. Chicken Katsu in regular size 46. Aloha SaiminMini size means one scope of rice andRegular size means two scopes of rice :)um... it's 2:13 in the morning and I'm hungry now while thinking of their food. SPAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I personally think L & L has better Spam than Island Flavor even tho IF is more popular :)Back to L & L, they also provide catering in Seafood, Beef, Pork, Chicken and side orders, from 10-13 servings as Small Pan, 20-25 servings as Half Pan and 45-50 servings as Full Pan. More info.:$32.99 for small family 4-6 people$49.99 for dinner family 6-8 peopleboth of them have choice of BBQ combination and Seafood combination. Accept Visa and MasterCardOpen Daily 10am - 10pmI've never been a huge fan of L&L, but they get you by in a pinch when you're craving Hawaiian food. On a recent visit for lunch my fella and I found ourselves at L&L and decided to share two plates. We went with the garlic chicken and the kalbi. Service was decent and our meals were brought out to us quickly despite being pretty busy during the lunch rush. The garlic chicken was intensely garlicky. Dare I say too garlicky and the kalbi was overcooked and dry. I didn't love anything I ate here. The shop is pretty small but there are a decent amount of tables inside. I'm not in any hurry to come back, but like I said, it's convenient when the mood strikes.

This is a new spot to hit Centennial so of course I want to try it out.We ordered some take out pizza and it was LEGIT New York Pizza. Super thin and light crispy yet chewy crust with a good bread to cheese to sauce ratio. Definitely was surprising as I've been to a few places that claim they are NY style but wasn't quite there. We just went simple with some pepperoni so I can observe the crust better without overdoing the toppings. I enjoyed our pizza thoroughly and it is what I've had in NY.I wonder if they ship their dough in from NY. Most NY style west coast places that are legit do. Why does the dough have to come from there you ask? Well, the saying goes that the NY pizza made with the NY dough is unique by the NY water they put into it. I dunno the science behind it on what the unique regional water compounds do to the dough, but whatever- it's good so I EAT! We had a special Val Pak coupon for a pizza and wings. Wings were decent but love to get it with some more zing to the sauce.Short and sweet this time. I will be back since its right down the street from the house! YAY! I will be dining in since that is always a different experience than take away food.To be continued....but I think I found a pizza place to have a love affair with.So after a disastrous lunch @ Los Antojos, I had to redeem myself.  I read a few reviews about this place and it's near my end of town, so I decided to check it out on the way home from the office.When I arrived there, I was shocked to see that the entire strip mall that this place is in was empty!  It was kind of Twilight Zonish creepy....I took pics, check it out....just weird.Anyway, I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was spacious....I was expecting a small joint with a couple of tables.  I think the owners are from Boston....lots of Boston sports memorabilia on the walls.....and since it was dead, 3 of the workers were changing the channel to put on the Dodgers vs Red Sox game.  Cool!I ordered the 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza special with a Bottle of Water.  Total damage was $5.15....what a deal!The guy who took my order brought out the Pizza on paper plates.  The Pizza is thin sliced NY style Pizza.  The Pizza was pretty good.  Of course I folded it per standard MO for thin sliced Pizza.Overall, it was a good experience.  I'll have to come back to try their pepperoni and veggie pizzas.Will I return?  Of course!I've been eating here consistently pretty much once a month for the past year and I haven't been disappointed once.  I've tried the chicken tenders, garlic chips, Italian wedding soup and their house salad when I'm trying to "balance" the meal, but mostly, I go there when I'm craving their fantastic thin crust pizza.  I don't get anything fancy.... just a couple slices of cheese pizza.Picture the bite:  Perfectly chewy, crusty with just the right amount of char on the bottom + tangy sweet tomato sauce + ooey gooey cheese + grease.Tip:  I stress again that this is NOT for the greasy food haters.  Just don't step into there.  Just don't.Conclusion:  What are you waiting for?!  Go get some pizza!Wow after reading Daniel S. review of NEP well I just had to have some. So I got a large extra cheese on my half and the husband has some mess on his half like bacon peperoni and something else. Call me selfish & spoiled if you will. But this pizza is so good that I was mad at my husband for wanting his half. YOU READ CORRECT: It was so pretty and cheesy I simply didn't want him touching my pizza or breathing my air for that matter. I don't know maybe I had some girl moment or something but my husband had been at work all day and somehow I wished he could just go back to his office at city hall and leave me alone with the pizza. So I could watch cartoons and eat pizza ALONE with out him at all. He was just all in my space looking hungry and eating his half of the pizza. Pfff he don't even like pizza but yet here he is all in my box getting slice after slice munching talking bout...this is some good pizza. I'm glad your on yelp and you found this pizza. See you guys don't get to feel pity for him either because truth is he don't like yelp he says yelp takes my attention from him and that I check in all the time and give tips. Anyway did I say I wanted to slap him silly for opening my box of pizza? Next time he will get his own pizza. I'm not sharing my North End Pizza its to hot & good. No. He cant ever have any at all. ..........PfffffI have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout. Mon thru Sat: 11 am - 9 pmSun: 12 pm - 9 pmI was finally able to cross North End Pizza off my bookmark list when my husband and I came here for dinner recently. Located off the 215 and Durango, North Pizza is nestled inside a small shopping center that houses Braddah's and a local Gyro shop. 12" VEGGIE CALZONE ($12.99): Large enough to feed two and piping hot. Very bland in flavor though. The calzone crust was the biggest disappointment. It was thin and appeared to not have been dressed with any type of seasonings, to include olive oil. It was just plain ol' dough. I have to say, I expected better from a pizza joint and have had better calzones at standard local's bars. 2/5 CHICKEN WINGS x10 ($7.99): Served with only 1 choice of sauce but very satisfying for a hungry hunter like my husband. Husband said they were good, but still below BWW's. 4/5FRIES ($2.59): We paid and extra $0.50 to have garlic added. A-OK. 3/5VIBE: Is it just me, or do all these hole in the wall pizza places look exactly the same? Newspaper clippings, black and white photos of celebrities, and East Coast regalia line the walls. 3/5SERVICE: Staff are dressed super causal but are friendly enough. 3/5 Food came out within 15 minutes for everything, although it came out in succession. The manager okay'd this with us first. 3/5Worth a Return Visit?We paid $29 and some change for our meal, which I thought was pretty expensive for what we got. There are plenty of pizza spots closer to home, and the food quality really doesn't justify a second trip back. I'll keep looking for that perfect calzone!YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #241

Review Text :
My parents told me about this place and I really wanted to love it because they do, they met the owners and had a fabulous time there.  I wish I could say the same.I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked the bartender not to put Tabasco sauce in it but she didn't really acknowledge me.  So when my drink came and it was too hot to drink, I reminded her that I had asked for it without the Tabasco.  She informed me that its not made with Tabasco, it a special blend of habenaros and other spices.  Okay, it's my fault for not specifying that I don't like my Bloodys spicy.  Whatever.  I ask her to take it back and another woman, presumably the manager, tells her to tone it down with orange juice.  So she gives me the bloody back, with OJ and asks me if I like it, I said yes because I'm a push over and I didn't want to send the drink back again.  Seriously though, it tasted like something my friends and I concocted in 5th grade from everything in my parents liquor cabinet - the worst beverage, something you'd drink as a dare.  The food wasn't much better.  The potatoes were cold, not just room temperature but literally cold.I really want this place to make it, it has a lot of potential and I love supporting local businesses.  I hope they get their act together.I would never, ever write a review about a place I have not been until now.  My parents went to The Groves today and were so upset about their experience (and they do not use yelp) that I had to share the lack of customer service and terrible experience they had.  When my mother got her roast beef sandwich, it had a greenish tint to it.  After research the USDA website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Color_of_Meat_&_Poultry/index.asp#10 I found this can happen with that type of meat.  My mother was not aware of this but was completely disgusted. She told the server took her plate away. When she returned, she said the chef would not and had not touched it because she should be grateful that his knives are so clean and sharp that it actually oxidized the meat.  After reading the USDA website, this does not seem to be the case.  My mother was so grossed out she said she had lost her appetite.  The server did not even apologize and gave her some attitude.  When the bill came, they even charged them for it. My  parents did not raise a stink, they just left their money and will never be back. I worked in the industry for almost 4 years, anyone with half an ounce of customer service skills would have taken the food away, offered something different, and/or taken it off the bill or at least discounted the bill.  Instead of trying to do guest recovery they chose the "I know better than the customer" road and have a bad yelp review, two people  who influence a lot of diners in the area who will speak poorly about the place, and a frequent AZ visitor who will never go to this place.  All for what?  A few $$ and some swallowing of price. Oh well, plenty of other great places to eat in AZ.

Review Text :
well hello addiction. this deliciousness has become a regular in my belly. i have a thing for their yellow curry chicken. it is so flipping good. I used to eat at Chars Thai in Tempe but since they closed I haven't found a place I liked as well. But I can say I like papaya thai a bit more.  the chicken pieces are so moist and everything is cooked in the open kitchen to order so it is insanely fresh. i have tried the regular yellow curry and the mango yellow curry. i like the regular the best, but the mango is good too if you like fruit in your curry. the veggies are colorful and fresh and cooked just the way i like. not soggy but not too crispy. perf. they have a star scale on spicy, i go with a 4. and 4 basically means my nose will run a bit but i won't die. im willing to try the level 5, thats my next visit. keep in mind, i have a high tolerance for spice bc i love spicy food. if you're a wimp go with a 2. The space is clean and very comfortable, but very tacky in the usual asian restaurant way. it never seems to be too busy in there but i really hope business picks up because i want them to stay around. however, my addiction could probably support them. i have to note the sweet sticky rice dessert. i love it. i get the sticky rice with mango- it is bananas good. if you're in this part of town, it's definitely worth visiting. i would actually suggest it before most of the other places near here. munch up my curry friends.

Restaurant name  Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Upon entering Forte on my initial visit, my first thought was that it was very European. This wasn't just because it was dead at lunch, as most restaurants in Europe are, but also because of the eccentric decor, dark lounge-like feel, off-the-beaten-path location, and genuine hospitality. That, and the fully stocked bar featuring very cheap glasses of delicious European wines (this I would find out later).I've over-ordered Forte at twice now, and though I can't say everything on the small plates menu is a winner, I can say I will keep coming back due to the aforementioned charming qualities and a few unique, inexpensive food highlights.The menu is broken down by European country (mostly Eastern) and their corresponding regional specialties. Under Russia, you won't find any caviar or borscht, but you will find adjarkski kachapurri, which goes down the hatch more easily than it rolls off the tongue ($6.99). This consists of a freshly baked bread loaf akin to a short, fat French baquette, that is hollowed in the center and stuffed with cheese, butter, and a raw egg. If I lost you at 'raw egg' then let me elaborate. The egg is mixed in table-side and is cooked by the heat of the bread, turning the dish into a protein-filled vegetarian friendly dish that will change your mind about Russian food. The flavor of the crusty bread combined with the egg and cheese reminded me of a quiche, yet this was unlike anything I've ever had. Extra (yet unnecessary) points for that!The section from Spain features a variety of chorizo sausages, amongst other items. We had the chistora and bilbao (each $2.50) which were fantastically charred and of fantastic value. These rivaled the Polish links at Costco as far as sausage bargains go, and were much better in my opinion.One note selections included the chicken skewers ($3.25 each), sauteed shrimp ($6.50), and the Bulgarian shopski served in an adorable clay pot ($6.99). Though there are a few minor flops, the thing I love most about this place is that you can try a lot of different foods you've probably never heard of, and, if you don't like them, you haven't spent enough to regret having given them a whirl.Coming back to the wine, I ordered a glass of Spanish Cosechero Blanco, which I was told cannot be found anywhere else in Vegas. Guess how much? $4.50!! The owner of the restaurant, who was our waitress on my second visit, and a gem in and of herself, offered to sell me a bottle at wholesale cost when I mentioned I liked it. So, I got a bottle for later that cost me just $8.20. That pretty much sealed the deal for me!This is a place you have to be experimental and open-minded to go to, but if you appreciate other cultures and want to join me on my mission to support the mom and pops in Vegas, then you'll have no trouble mustering the strength to go to Forte.Forte has an incredibly extensive menu that ranges from Spanish tapas to Russian and Bulgarian specialties, but I'll get to the food later because the MOST UNIQUE part of this restaurant are the numerous house Infused Vodkas: The "Garden Vodka" when used as a substitute for every ingredient in your Dirty Martini excluding dry vermouth, creates an Exceptionally tasty yet one of a kind Cocktail. And I'm not afraid to admit that I am definitely a cocktail snob ;DThere is raspberry infused vodka, potato infused vodka, various Grappas... The list goes on- you need to check this place out if only to discover the rest. In addition they have Banana Sambuca, and while it isn't infused in house it's definitely going to be a pleaser for adventurous types. The bar is very well stocked from recongnizable alchohol to imported beers and wine, and especially imported vodkas; So don't be afraid to get obscure, like small village in the Ukraine obscure.Service- One thing I couldn't understand are the bad reviews preceding mine! You cannot come here expecting your service to be like The Olive Garden or some other heinous food chain. Forte is definitely an intimate atmosphere if you go early or on a weeknight. Thursday night is quietest. Because like most Eastern European bars/ casual restaurants they like to get a little rowdy with music! It's apart of the culture. They are having Jazz on Mondays though FYI. Service is personable and casual, and perfect for what it is.The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. The egg boat had a name I won't even try to pronounce (see pictures), and is a dish I've never come across before. So happy I did! My favorites were the almond stuffed dates (Rich and Delightful) and the Feta Burek with its flaky delicate crust and creamy center- Mmmm. For dessert we had the biscuit cake which reminded us of Tiramisu at first glance, but had this incredibly soft texture and taste that did not resemble Tiramisu, and it was a sumptuous finish to a quite filling dinner. They have flavored cappuccinos as well! If I had to sum up this place in a sentence it would be:Don't miss out!!Forte is called "Forte" because that's exactly what their food is filled with - strength. They're a strong restaurant. To hold their fort down, outside of the restaurant are heavy-duty patio furnishings and a green metal gate with two different entrances. Just hop right in whichever side, left or right, and open the darkly tinted door. A server, Robert, greeted us and told us to choose a seat anywhere. There were candles to light the dining room. There was one other group that we saw and they were chatting in Russian. Apparently, the dining room is split in half and there are other dining tables further back and to the left side of the restaurant because the server went back there several times with food and drink.I highly recommend trying the Selyodka, Adjarski Khachapurri, Thracian Cheese Clay Pot, and their Pelmeni Dumplings.Selyodka: definitely fish and potatoes done right with some olive oil, dill and great pairing of flavors that really wow youAdjarski Khachapurri: Refer to Frank W.'s review for a description. It's a great description. This one was delicious and the bread just sensationalThracian Cheese Clay Pot: brimming with seasoning, but not overwhelming. So deliciousPelmeni Dumplings: European jiaozi... mmm...Very European vibe... food was excellent. I will definitely be back again!Incredible meal and experience!   Bookmarked forever, I finally made it happen with a group because I wanted to try several dishes and needed lots of people.  My best friend from middle and high school came in from Boston for a short weekend visit.  Last year when she visited we went to Komol with Carmin H. and Cole R., and they wanted to join in on our Forte dinner with me and Eric R.  I made reservations for 7:00 and we were seated in the back corner of this artistic and funky restaurant and bar.I ordered prosecco, Carmin H. and Nithya V. ordered angry ginger lemonade cocktails, Cole R. had a giant dark beer of some sort, and Eric R. got sangria.  We then ordered in waves and the food came out quickly and staggered perfectly.  Our server (Christina or Kristina) was fantastic.  She offered us a bread basket that was replenished upon request, served with olive oil and Bulgarian spices.The plates were so intricate and pretty, all the way from Bulgaria.  Our first bite was the Shopska salad, with cucumber, tomato, and lots of Bulgarian feta.  Next was the squid stuffed with baby squids cooked in its own ink served on hot rice.  I loved the rice that came with it, a squeeze of lemon...delicious.  The squid itself was more room temperature but definitely tasty and unique.  On our server's recommendation, we ordered potato dumplings with fried onions.  I was shocked to discover that NIthya V. like my husband did not like potatoes!  Two crazy people exist!  Nevertheless, I went with the rec and all 5 of us ate one.  Both potato haters enjoyed these dumplings!!!!  They were scrumptious.Eric R. ordered one of his fave things, hot meat stuffed grape leaves, also recommended by our grape leaves expert friend Mamie P.  They were very good.  Finally the dreamy bread (kachapuri) came, shaped like a boat filled with cheese, topped with egg, swirled at the table.  I cut this haphazardly into 5 pieces for the table and it was so hot, no wonder the egg cooked on it!  Sooooo good.After watching Triple D, Nithya V. wanted to try the Thoracian clay pot.  We ordered 2 for the table, one with meat and one without.  I ate the no meat one and it was amazing.  The serrano pepper was legit with it, and I liked the combo of the cooked egg, tomato, peppers, and feta.  This is a must order.  Lastly, one of Eric R.'s favorite dishes came out, beef stroganoff.  We have only had this on egg noodles, so the dumpling/ravioli style made this dish unique.  I could taste liquor in the sauce, which can only be a good thing.Overall, every bite of food I put in my mouth was tasty, fresh, and unique.  I would absolutely return with a group of friends to try more.  The vibe is funky, the service great, and the food special - you won't find this anywhere else in Vegas.The gf and I finally hit Forte - it's relatively close to our house ( about 2 miles ) but just now made it to the top of the "new try" list.Went on a Tuesday night and the place had a decent crowd.  Quirky looking place and kinda strange lay-out of the tables but ok by us.  Servers were pleasant and attentive.  The gf was really focused on one of the servers hair style, " Should I get my hair like that?"  - must have asked me 4 times, hey !  I'm here to eat, not look at hair !We avoided liquor since it was a weekday.  They provided a mini-loave of bread with olive oil and they recommended you add a special Bulgarian seasoning mix to the oil - the gf loved it - I also liked it though I felt she added to much of the herb mixture to the oil.We ordered:Beef Stroganoff Ragu ( $8 ) - Holy cow, the ragu was perfect !  the pasta shells were like little cups to hold the ragu - also very good but we wish they gave us more !Chebureki ( $3.50 ) -two beef filled fried dumplings - basically a turnover.  perfectly fried, nice flaky crust, a little light on filling but what do you want for $3.50 ??Bulgarian Mixed grill ( $10 ) - pork grilled three ways - two are sausage, one a patty.  Different seasoning and texture on all three .  came with a side of white beans and a salad similar to cole slaw but better - overall, an excellent plate of food !Stuffed grape leaves( $5) - each one had a sausage in it.  I enjoyed but the gf prefers the middle eastern version that includes rice.I wanted to avoid the sweets but I was being hounded so we ordered the rice pudding( I believe $4 ) and the biscuit cake ( $5).  The biscuit cake was very good - reminded us of tiramisu but the liquor flavor is lighter.  I'm not a rice pudding fan but I liked the generous amount of cinnamon on top of the pudding that gave it a nice kick.a few pics attachedwe'll definitely returnWhy the heck did it take me so long to come here?  Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the "Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.Our favorite dish was the "Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :PThe "Thracian Clay Pot" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in "Game of Thrones" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the "Bulgarian Mixed Grill" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!The best little hole in the wall in Vegas!Came here with a group of girlfriends from work, one being from Russia. We had made a reservation ahead of time, for which I was glad. At 7 pm, the place was pretty packed, but began clearing out a bit around 8 pm. Here's what was on our table:Adjarski Khachapurri - giant boat bread with soft cheese and a cracked egg. This was amazing. The flavor wasn't overdone and it was fresh out of the oven!Beef Strogannoff Ragu - we all know what this is and it was awesomeVereniki and Pelmeni - two different types of dumplings with sour cream. They were not overly greasy and paired with the sour cream...amazing!.We ordered some of their signature house drinks and a bottle of wine. I have to give the food 5 stars. It was so nice to go to a place where the tapas wasn't pre-made and sitting under heat lamps getting greasy and dried out (*cough* Firefly *cough*). The food was not overly seasoned to cover up the lack of quality...like a lot of places do. The vegetables and fresh seasonings (scallions, parsley, etc.) served with each dish really complimented the home cooking and quality ingredients. The service was slow, but due to everything being fresh out of the oven, it was more than acceptable. Plus, in Euro culture, you take your time to eat and talk. Why is everyone in such a hurry?! We stayed here for over 4 hours listening to the live music and chatting away. It was a really nice atmosphere, and we all left happy.After many visits here I am thrilled to discover many delicious dishes from several regions around the world, along with a darn tasty spice blend, great atmosphere, and excellent service.Everyone starts with house-made bread, the Bulgarian spice mix and olive oil.  The spice blend (15 herbs and spices) is for sale in cute jars for $6 each.  This is a great gift for friends or for yourself!  I have even used these spices to coat raw cashews (using coconut oil) which make for a great snack!I have successfully shared the joy of Forte with friends, family, and other visitors alike, from vegetarian to carnivore.  Last night I learned that Forte could make Eric R. a fan of octopus, which he never enjoyed before.  My friends have really enjoyed the sausages made in house, but since I don't eat pork I am not able to tell you how they taste.Dishes I have tried:Shopska Salad: basic salad covered in shredded Bulgarian feta.  Tasty but simple.Fetamelon Salad: special in spring 2014. Huge portion of watermelon squares, Bulgarian feta, mint, and chopped red onion.  Very refreshing but needs people for sharing!Calamares Rellenos en su Tinto: Stuffed squid marinated in its own ink on Spanish herb rice. Room temperate squid, tasty and different.Octopus in Olive Oil: super tender octopous on top of warm rice with green onions, served with lemon.  Truly outstanding though simple, converted a non-octopus eater.Beef and Lamb Confit: beef and lamb that melts in the mouth cooked in its own juices and fat on top of the Uzbeki Plov rice - I ordered the rice dish separately once with a veg friend but just get it here.  The meat juices coat the rice, which has dried cranberry and cornichons.  Love this dish!Adjarski Khachapurri: bread boat with cheese topped with raw egg at table that cooks on the bread because it is so hot.  This is very delicious but hard to split, so at most 2 people should share one or it loses the fun.  Sooooo delicious.Thracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!Stuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.  Dip the homemade bread in the sauce after the dolmas are gone!Beef stroganoff ragu: wild mushroom dumplings topped with a beef strogranoff ragu is one of Eric R.'s faves (he loves stroganoff in general).  Very rich sauce.Vareniki: my favorite simple housemade dumplings stuffed with potato, topped with fried diced onions.  So good it converted 2 non-potato eaters!Biscuit cake: dessert for David S.'s birthday.  Honey biscuits, mascarpone, walnuts, chocolate - tasty!  I would rather eat more savory food than sweets though if I had the option! :)There is more for me to try but I never leave without flavors dancing in my palate.5 of us met again to try a new restaurant and try different food.  I have had Forte bookmarked for about 2 years but I never seemed to think of this place.  We were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.We were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.Our things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish "nacho" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.We were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.  We also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.We had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.Next came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.We closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a "traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.Then dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as "decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.I thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.  I might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.As always, good company made lunch a much better time!I arrived at Forte with high expectations after reading all the rave reviews from Yelpers I admire. The seating we chose wasn't the best, since the chairs weren't comfortable and the table too high. What we won't sacrifice for good lighting for our food pictures. With a semi-large group of diners, we were able to sample a good number of menu items. We started with the house pita bread, which I didn't love. A little on the doughy side for my taste. We decided on a good sampling from the options on the menu and waited with anticipation. As others have noted, the timing of our food didn't come out as spaced out as we would have liked and refills came only after a few reminders, I still enjoyed quite a bit about our meal here. My favorites from lunch were the Calamares rellenos en su tinta, Thracian clay pot, sofiiska baniza, Chebureki and Adjarski khachapurri. I would return for any of these menu items in a heartbeat. My least favorite parts of the meal were the sugary sweet and drippy baklava, the overcooked and overly sweet almond stuffed dates and uninventive and incrediby generic-tasting Spanish chorizo chips. The Bulgarian lamb was just ok, I can't see myself ordering this again and the biscuit cake, although a favorite at our table was a little too dense and sweet-tasting for my particular palate. I was on the fence on how many stars to give Forte, debating between 3 and 4 stars. Based on the number of items we ordered, I notice that the ones I didn't like outnumbered those that I did enjoy, but I would return to enjoy those few items I loved alone.This place is excellent. We're always looking for something next to try, and I'm glad we tried this place out. It's so different and unique in comparison to other restaurants in town. As soon as we walked in, most of the crowd was speaking several different languages. Perfect sign for me - I knew it was going to be good. We had some of the Russian beer - served with beautiful clay mugs. Dat bread - the bread is delicious. It's so fluffy, yet filling. We were starving when we walked in, so I was very grateful for this. The clay pot -  very different. It wasn't my favorite, but the sausage in it was very tasty. The shrimp saute -  very very good. It had a very good white wine sauce and fresh lemon. Dip your bread in it. And my favorite - the beef stroganoff. So so so so good!!! Probably the best I've ever had in my life. Served with delicious mushroom filled dumplings. It was very busy, so expect a wait. The service was good, they just seemed under staffed. Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go back!!It been while since wrote a five star review. Forte is a place that exceeded my expectations not only the food but overall experience was very unique. Lot of things that stood out for me. The fact that small family run business, off the strip not in mega hotel, very reasonable price, interior design screaming personality, and am NOT fan of Tapas style of eating but Forte made me FAN. I came to Forte with my cousins from the 808 visiting also avid yelpers and enjoy food like myself. The few times get together over the years here or back home about trying something new. I was excited too get bookmark off my list and just enjoy time around Ohana.I knew the interior design has personality from watching the episode on DDD. What you see on television can never prepare you for the real thing. I loved every bit of it! Really small restaurant maybe holds 50 people, the bar area is also small just one row of bar stools, and the dining room is divided into two sections. Each one having its own personality. Lot of bright colors, all kinds of different tables, booths, and even the chairs few different ones so really nothing uniform or the same look around from any angle. The artwork (assume someone did) lot of Day of the Dead influence not that came as surprising since european melting pot of food. One artwork that thankfully my cousins pointed out they did Guy Fieri head with the show logo and his signature on the wall. Hell of cool! It literally feels like walking into another world once open the front door.The food thankfully hanging out with the right peeps or Ohana this night. I got too try lot of the menu. We ordered decent amount of food for three of us. Six items in all. To go back to my earlier point reasonable price our bill was $60 before tip and we were stuffed. Two of us had drink so the bill would have been cheaper if not in the drinking mood. The HH price for drinks on all of them. Steal of deal. I stuck with beer but my cousin had one of the vodka drinks. I pass on trying but she told me was very tasty. Home-made chicken soup was pleasantly surprised! We all thought ok on cold night get some soup. It might be bland your basic soup. Instead this little bowl packed bowl full of goodness. The broth was really tasty had depth, ample amount of shredded chicken in it, nice portion of vegetables, and really tasted like fresh Home-made soup. On chilly day could get super size bowl be soup Happy!Stuffed Grape Leaves was really good. I really enjoyed the filling. The ground pork or assume pork had great seasoning and flavor. The sauce brought everything together along with the grape leaves. Beef Stroganoff Ragu was another winnah. Again one of those dishes just give me super size plate be happy with one dish. The pasta dumplings was on point between the filling and the rich, thick, creamy, hearty stroganoff meat sauce. It heavy pasta dish but so good.Spanish Rice (not sure forgot called) but talk about bowl of rice. It look more like paella without all the seafood or the saffron. It was popping with flavor. Not protein in it. Talk about flavors. It was really good rice.The star of the show the one dish excited about Bulgarian Mixed Grill. Two dishes that was featured on the show. This was the one most looking forward too and past on the clay pot dish. Awesome. Not only the three different meats. I enjoy the three different sides. The beans and the red pepper something perfect compliment. If one dish NEED too order if first time, many times, or only time this is the one. The only dish that not fan of was the Octopus in Olive Oil. Yay it has really nice depth of Olive Oil had the Octopus. Saying sometimes can have too much of good thing. Olive Oil was the killer for me. The rice that served with was bland not very good dish overall.Outside of the one dish everything was awesome. All the food felt like had great depth of flavor. LOVE LOVE the atmosphere very much different then most restaurants in Vegas. Great spot to hang out with family or friends over drinks, some food, and weekend they even have live music. The service was fabulous. Looking forward too my next visit!!!I enjoyed quite the delicious dinner at this quaint little place. Offering a variety of cuisine from the European continent, but I settled for the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, not served over noodles, but pelmeni stuffed with mushrooms for $9.Before the stroganoff arrived, the meal started with some moist house Russian bread with a side of extra virgin olive oil and some red spices, mostly made of paprika. The Russina wheat bread was great and eaten with the dressed up olive oil was bliss. The Stroganoff was quite the treat. First of all, the ragu was very well made. It was thick and rich with a great flavor: a deep rich flavor that took time to develop, and some skill to make. Somebody had a great recipe hidden back there.  The pelmeni's mushrooms inside were tender, very well seasoned, and had a great natural flavor. Also, the pelmeni's itself, the shell, had a great chewiness in a very good way. No doubt they were cooked well. I'm telling you, I could of eaten a mountain of these. I also tried tasters from a Bulgarian Mixed Grill which was quite good. Nataliya, the server was absolutely amazing. She not only was very well verse in Forte's cuisine and its individual preparations, but she reserved extreme patience. She was very prompt and always had a great smile on her face.If you are looking for something different and great, check this place out.I was so disappointed in this place! Went to Vegas with Bear and we went to this location because we wanted Tapas and it was fairly close to the strip. The place is dark and cozy and the service is pretty nice. But the food was terrible. Absolutely godawful. We ordered the stroganoff on fries. The fries were great but the stroganoff was with ground beef and had a really thin broth like sauce which they had been very stingy with. Stroganoff usually comes with a creamy sauce and I thought they fries were gonna be covered with them but nah. Still this was the least terrible, can I say that? I don't want to say the best. We ordered some sort of dumpling that came looking like a Pirozhki. The crust was nearly burnt, super crunchy and inside was just a very firm and rubbery meetball, no sauce, no seasoning, nothing. We ordered the Lamb chop lollipop and we got two really big lamb chops, barely seasoned, the texture was all wrong. We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce. We got 5 pieces of hard rubbery shrimp, swimming in a sour lemon sauce. Even though the dishes were very very small, we didn't finish a single one. We didn't finish the shrimp, the second dumpling was left untouched, the lamb chops we're left, the only thing we ate we're the fries. Never again!!I was down here in Vegas for business just for a day and needed a good place to take my clients out. I'm always on the look out for European restaurants. You can always find your Italian and many French and you might find a German place, but that's about it in the USA. So, I was so surprised to find this Forte' restaurant specializing in Eastern European cuisine with some Spanish thrown in. Quite an odd combination but if it works, why not? As it turns out, this was one of my  fave restaurant of all the places I've tried in Las Vegas. I was trying to stay away from the Strip area. Forte' is located in a pretty nondescript strip mall near the intersection of Rainbow and Flamingo. Apparently, Forte' was featured on the TV show Diners and Dives and gained some publicity from that.Upon entering, we are greeted by a nice server. Inside, you sure can't tell you're in Vegas, that's for sure. The interior reminds me more of a place in Berkeley CA, with an odd mish mash of art work hung on walls painted with Picasso like murals. The whole interior is exactly opposite of what you might see in a color coordinated and professionally designed chain restaurant. Slick and chic, this is not .... Which makes it all the more interesting. We are seated at a smallish round table, more like a cocktail table than a dinner table. I guess the menu does say tapas! That being the Spanish part.Looking over the menu I see Russian soups, fresh baked flatbreads, one served with foie gras even! Then there is a selection of Spanish Tapas, including Spanish cheeses and sausages like chorizo. The rest of the menu offers food from Bulgaria, Russia, Hungary, Serbia and Georgia. I was more interested in the Eastern European selections.Fresh baked bread was brought to our table right away and drink orders taken. I was so interested in looking over the unusual menu, I just had water to start. The chilled water was served in Vodka bottles! It made me think I was in Russia downing a whole bottle of Vodka with my meal! That was amusing! Along with the bread you get a plate with olive oil and instead of the usual Italian style with Balsamic Vinegar in the oil, we were treated to a heavenly mixture of house mixed spices from a cute little carved wooden container on the table spooned into the oil. Holy Moly! Was that good! I had to stop myself from eating too much bread or I'd be too full to eat the rest of the food!So, for appetizers we started with the Georgian boat shaped bread filled with cheeses and an egg. This was one dish featured on TV. ($10.00). It was good , but a little on the doughy side and very chewy. We also had the Borsht, Russian beet soup. ($6.50) That was wonderful and filled with lots of beets and goodies, plus a broth where you could tell the person making this really knew what they were doing. Get this one! I had the Beef Stroganoff ($9.50) and my second client had the Hungarian Goulash ($9.00). Both were so well executed and in perfect balance with spices. My other client had the Serbian Mixed Grill ($16.00), which was a mix of 5 different house ground and stuffed sausages. All were quite tasty! My third client at the table, he had the Bulgarian Easter Lamb, ($14.00) and that was so tender, no knife needed and the lamb au jus reduction was heavenly! I could just drink a cup of that! For drinks we tried some of the house flavor infused vodkas. Great interesting flavors of fruits and at 80 proof!The service was very attentive and couldn't ask for more. The servers will explain all the dishes and drinks, cause unless you're Bulgarian, you might not have had these menu items before. The prices here are reasonable .... Unless you get carried away with drinks like we did .... Sort of.I'll will return here every time I'm down here in Vegas, this was quite the interesting find! I see they even serve European breakfasts here, that might be interesting! Next time for sure, I'll be back.

08/11/13Sisters, BIL, and I arrived an hour before the concert next door at Uptown Amphitheatre, so we stopped at Wet Willie's for drinks and a bite to eat.  After IDs were checked, we sat ourselves.  (No one greeted us save security, and everyone else were seating themselves...)  The colorful murals that adorned the bar wall with all the daiquiri flavor machines made up for the initial disappointment caused by the wafts of stale beer that greeted me at the door.  With so many machines already churning out varieties of daiquiris, I knew that I wouldn't be able to try them due to corn allergy (corn syrup), so I asked our server MJ if they had mojitos (no- discontinued daiquiri flavor; I was looking for the actual drink, anyway), or wine (no).  Just bottled beer (standard domestics- Coors, Michelob, Bud, and YuengLing lager).  "Mixed drinks" consisted of vodka or Jack Daniels.  Sisters ordered Bahama Mama and Pina Colada, BIL had a Yuengling, and I ended up with a Michelob Ultra- not bad, a little too bland, but no bitterness or aftertaste, and it went well with the pepperjack cheeseburger, with bacon I ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wet-willies-charlotte?select=cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA#cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA  The bun top had a dusting of cornmeal, so I set it aside, but the rest of the burger was delicious!  Cooked medium, had a nice kick from the pepperjack cheese (older sis found it too spicy), and had nice flavors and textures (good bread!)  Bacon was a bit too greasy, but I didn't pat them down with a napkin to absorb some of the oil like I normally do, so it was partly my fault.  Baby sis claimed them eventually, after everyone else devoured the chips and salsa app they had ordered.  BIL had asked for a Philly cheesesteak (made with grilled onions and mushrooms and topped with a homemade cheese sauce), but MJ must've forgotten it when I asked him about the beverage selections.  No worries, since the rush order didn't take long (two to three minutes?), was hot (not cold at all, considering it arrived so soon after the discrepancy was mentioned, and it was complimentary (due to the order being forgotten).  The fries here were TERRIFIC!  We all raved about them, and for a non-gourmet restaurant, the fries here were some of the best I've ever bitten into (delicious flavor and perfectly-crisped)!  The plastic daiquiri beverage glasses had Wet Willie cartoon-comic graphics on them, so I asked MJ if we could take them home with us, and he said yes.  My sisters didn't want to keep them, so I now have souvenirs for this Charlotte trip!  :)Could've been 3.5 stars if the beverage selections were larger, and please work on eradicating the stale beer smell!  Women's restroom was clean and stylish though, considering WW could be considered a dive bar...  Perhaps the restroom is part of The Comedy Zone, which WW shares the floor with?  p.s.  There is an overlook/patio where people can dine and listen in to the concerts next door.  You won't be able to see the stage, but you'll get to people-watch!  (I wonder how we all looked awashed with the lights from the stage?)  People smoke around the concession stands and restrooms below, though, just so you know...

Review Text :
I haven't been to Bar + Bistro since I accidently sat down thinking the restaurant was still Paymon's and was too embarrassed to leave.  It was all Italian food back then, and not particularly good.  But I heard the menu changed for the better so I decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did.I tried the grilled cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries and tomato soup ($7) and the B+B slider ($5).  The grilled cheese portion was good for the price.  Five bucks is a little steep for one slider, but you can tell they are high quality.  The food was delectable.  I really liked that the ketchup for the fries was mixed with a little bit of sriracha, making it spicy.  The sliders were super cute and the B+B slider was good with Wagyu beef, Manchego cheese, and pickled shallots.  Service was excellent.  They kept the same décor as Tinoco's, which Paymon's kept as well.  Basically, tables shaped like painting palettes with splashes of paint and holes in them that used to store the ketchup, salt, etc.  I guess it makes sense, being that this is the Arts District and all.  But they should use the holes in the tables to store something.  It's just weird seeing them empty.They seem to have a decent happy hour M-F from 5-7pm.  $1 PBR is the focus but they seem to have specials on their inventive drinks.  I rarely come downtown for drinks but I may have to check it out.You know how it is when you live in Vegas -- everyone comes to visit, and expects you to take them someplace "cool." Pressure!Yesterday I had two different friends in town, who both wanted a piece of me. One is a 7-months-pregnant Conservative Christian from Arkansas, and the other is a traveling art-nude model with a wild '70s bush and a predilection for men 40+ years her senior. Where to take them that would appeal to both??I wanted someplace fun, unpretentious and off-Strip (both of my friends have the good sense to despise the overpriced pretentiousness of places with all-caps names like MIX, STACK, FIX, DOUCHE...oh wait, the Health Dept. shut that one down). Anyhoo, I asked around and finally lit on Bar + Bistro...which turned out to be AWESOME! This was in the middle of the humid monsoon season (8.1.11), but we sat on their fabulous patio anyway -- and it was GREAT! They have a huge patio all strung up with Christmas lights, facing out onto Charleston Blvd...but it's not loud at all, and very pleasant. I always go for atmo over food quality...but it wasn't just the atmo that was kickass here -- every single thing we ordered was FANTASTIC! I had the chopped Latin salad (delish and filling), my girlfriends had paella (bomb) and pizza mergherita (ditto), plus we split an order of mahi mahi tacos (fabulous) and the lavash/hummus they brought us was also incredible. I really can't speak highly enough of the food here...and the prices were totally reasonable.The waitstaff was super badass, too. One of the waiters, a super cool guy named Arash, even came and had a beer with us. We had a total blast, and this was on a Monday night when the place was totally dead! I can only imagine how much fun it is during First Friday or their Saturday night poetry jam. I will DEFINITELY be coming back here!P.S. They also have a fairly extensive tapas menu...and I recommend this place a thousand times over Firefly. MUCH better atmo.I've had Bar + Bistro bookmarked for about a year. Finally went two weeks ago and have been there three times since.I highly suggest ordering a latte with breakfast. A fabulous surprise was the crispy pancakes. There are about five items on the breakfast menu. The omelet was okay. I probably wouldn't revisit it.The steak salad at lunch is wonderful. For $12 you get a filling assortment of pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, eggs, avocado, tomatoes, and grilled steak. For dinner I tried their version of sorullitos. Holy cow. This is the reason I returned twice. These things are the distant, beautiful cousins to the ones you get in Puerto Rico. The cousin everyone wants, but no one can have, because, well, it's family and that'd be wrong. But here, it's okay. Eat the corny fried thing with the secret spicy sauce. Guess the thing that puts Bar + Bistro above the rest is the atmosphere. It's real. Authentic. It has hurricane furniture, the kind that doesn't move when a storm hits because it's the real deal, welded together by an artist. My dad welds. Service can be spotty but I don't mind because I've got stars in my eyes.Bar + Bistro is what community tastes like, looks like.Add B+B to the current vegan explosion going on in Vegas! Their chef recently revealed a new and extensive vegan menu.  I was super excited to check it out, and I was not disappointed.First, there are at least 3 or 4 FULL PAGES of vegan menu, including tapas, salads, sandwiches, entrees and yes, even desserts.  No afterthought of inclusion here -- this was a carefully thought-out and well-designed nod to vegan and v-friendly diners.  I went with my foodie vegan pal, and we tried lots of tapas: Daiya cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers (yum!), pomegranate-sauced plantains (yum!), fried artichokes (yum!), paella (yum!), and grilled veggie tacos (OMFG double yum!).  The paella was more of a risotto, but still tasty, and a HUGE serving considering it was a "tapa."  The star of the evening was the plate grilled tacos, which came with jicama slaw, pico de gallo and some mango salsa, too, I believe.  Each component was delish and combined, the flavors all really worked together.  Sadly there were only 3 little tortillas (so there was lots of leftover filling, which we ate anyway).  I cold have eaten 10 of these! Another nice surprise was the VERY reasonably-priced wine list! We had a nice bottle of garnacha to accompany our dinner, and it was only $28.  Several other choices under $30 as well! We decided on the chocolate cake (served with a glass of rice milk) for dessert.  Way too full to each get our own!  It took quite awhile to arrive (I actually think our waiter forgot to put in the order), but we were enjoying our wine and a lovely evening on the patio, so no big.  The cake was also delish.  Molten on the inside, and the cool rice milk was a nice foil to the warm chocolate.  The texture of the cake was a little spongy and dry, but I would definitely order it again.I can't wait to go back and try more stuff! I put up my pictures from the night, but they are pretty poor quality due to the low lighting.  Better pix next time!Our server was very nice, but a bit slow and absent minded. That was the only real negative.  Otherwise, everything was excellent; and our dinner with 5 tapas, dessert, a bottle of wine, sparkling water, and tip was just over $100.  Good deal!You would think that finding a place to eat dinner on Christmas Even in Las Vegas is not difficult, right? Well, if you're not looking for a buffet or some overpriced casino restaurant, it's actually a lot harder than you think. Sure, Vegas is a 24-hour city for tourists, but apparently locals prefer to eat important holiday meals at home. Who knew?Luckily, Bar + Bistro's kitchen was open December 24 and we were able to dine in on some small plates while catching up with friends over drinks. I've been here before for a cocktail and this is a cool local bar. It's never too terribly crowded inside and there's a very inviting patio out front. Although they had a fire going, it was a little too chilly to sit out there. Inside was toasty warm and a glass of wine was calling my name. For dinner we ordered plantains, carnitas tacos and potatoes bravas. In retrospect, I should have gotten the sangria to go with this Spanish cuisine, but as I mentioned before, it was cold outside and I wanted a non-icy drink to warm up. The sangria here is especially good, so definitely order it if you're at the bar. Portions were just right - we had a heavy lunch just a few hours earlier and just wanted something small. Carnitas tacos were so good! Would eat three more plates of them! Plantains and potatoes were good, very standard tapas fare. Thank you, Bar + Bistro for being open Christmas Eve and serving food, too! Hit the spot!I was hoping to have a knock-your-socks-off experience here.  I did not. I love downtown Vegas, and I am a fan of any business that is going to help the area grow.  So kudos for that. However, when you have alcapurrias, bacalaitos, mofongo, and paella on the menu, I'm going to judge you harshly if you can't deliver.  Let me preface by saying that I knew going into this place that everything on the menu was going to be the 'fancy-pants' version of traditional Spanish and Caribbean foods, so there's some leeway for artistic interpretation.  I said leeway, not 'screw tradition, I do what I want'.  I've had alcapurrias, bacalaitos, and mofongo on the beaches of Puerto Rico, so ordering this was a way to have a culinary nostalgia trip for me.  Nope, no such luck.  The alcapurrias were bland, the bacalaitos were soggy, and the mofongo was oily.  For those of you not familiar with these foods, they are *not* supposed to be that way.  Now, the paella, I'm thinking will redeem the menu.  It's a seafood paella, with mussels, shrimp, clams, bits of whitefish (I believe cod but don't quote me), and veggies and rice.  Traditional paella takes at least a good half hour to bake, and it should only be made when it's ordered.  Otherwise, if it sits too long it can get gummy and chewy.  So I'm thinking ok, let the tapas settle and have some chit-chat with my friend while the paella is ready.  Sidebar:  The chef was out in the dining room nearly the entire time I was there and he was having a loud conversation with a patron about sources, marketing, mixology, and all sorts of other stuff which I'm sure would be interesting if you were part of the conversation, but honestly, I don't want to listen to all that while I'm trying to have a pleasant dinner with a friend.  Get back into your kitchen and make sure your chefs are on point with their food and your servers are on point with their service.Surprisingly, the paella comes out in about ten minutes from the time of ordering.  Uhm, what, ok.  So it looks to have a fair amount of seafood in the rice and veggies and I'm thinking it looks promising.  I taste it.  It's salty.  And not just salty because it's seafood and there's salt in seafood anyway.  No, I mean, salty to the point that I'm drinking water to wash out the salt.  The actual consistency of the paella was ok (no mushiness so good job there) but I couldn't get past the salt to appreciate the seasoning.  I want to be a fan.  I really do.  But I'm not.I'd like to preface by saying that I plan on placing a call to the manager to report the experience I had here. While some people take joy in obliterating the reputations of businesses with one-star ratings on Yelp, I don't like giving only one star, especially for a locally-owned, non-franchisee establishment with good food. We just don't have enough of those here and they should be cherished. However, the experience I had at Bar+Bistro, combined with lackluster visits since writing my last review really leaves me no choice but a one-star review. The food is as great as everyone says. It's creative and delicious and consistently so-I've only had one dish here that I didn't care for. The drinks are great and they have decent happy hour specials. As far as food and drink goes, they have it right.The service ranges on a scale from apathetic to unwarranted hostility, the latter of which was received on my latest visit. I've sat at the bar most times when I've come here and have found the bartenders to be more interested in talking to friends and more regular customers than taking a simple drink order from me. Most times I felt like a burden sitting at the bar, taking up valuable time from the bartender that they could be using to discuss who Biffy is boffing with their friends at the other end of the bar. I'm so sorry it's asking so much for you to place a cup under the faucet of the sangria jug and take the three seconds to pour me a beverage. Perhaps I should've hopped over the bar and done it myself as it would've been less of an inconvenience.My latest and very last visit (4/22/12) involved Sunday brunch with three other friends. Our waiter was nice enough-friendly and personable, a little forgetful, but seeing as he was the only one in the dining area for a bit I was ready to let that slide. Thus began theme one of the day: retardedly long lapses of time. Two parties were seated next to us maybe 15 minutes after we sat down and before we even received refills on our coffee, their food came out. So we waited. And waited. No food. No sign of our waiter. Just four very hangry girls in various stages of hangover waiting on food that was possibly being sourced in another state. We stopped the waitress serving the table next to us, to ask for refills and find out about our food since our waiter was nowhere to be found and with great insincerity she put her hands together, smiled and said "Let me get your waiter!" Thus began the coexisting theme: unnecessarily hostile service. Why did she have to say it like that? Even though it wasn't her fault she should have apologized and non-passive aggressively offered to get our waiter for us. Our waiter arrives back after another long lapse of time to tell us that our ticket was lost and our food was being made right now. The food starts to arrive about 20 minutes later in ridiculous intervals of 5-10 minutes between dishes and there we are, nearly an hour in and only 3/4 of our party has food, which is now getting cold as we wait for the last dish. What happened to the party of 8 that had arrived after us you ask? Oh, they had FINISHED THEIR MEAL AND LEFT. I finally asked for the manager and after a small, fragile woman who could not process my complaint was sent over to our table, the waitress who had made it clear that we were an annoyance to her, was sent over to share in the snarkiest of tones what a busy day it was for them, how they were so disabled with only one chef on staff and how poppin' the patio was.  Yes, the busyness of the patio was preventing the food I ordered over an hour ago from getting to the table. Her attitude was completely hostile and she treated us like we were making a big deal out of nothing. The apology she gave after the list of excuses was insincere and anything but apologetic.  Then she continued to insult me by offering to take my  $2 coffee off the tab. How kind of her to offer such a generous discount! After my strong suggestion that she remove my entree from the tab, she did. The delay in food to table I could let go. The inattentiveness of our friendly waiter, I could also let go. The lack of consistent refills, forgiven. The utter lack of concern and boorish behavior of the waitress/manager/restaurant muscle was unacceptable. She treated us like we were being unreasonable and like it was US who had made the mistake when in fact the only mistake we'd made was ordering food and expecting it to arrive before Memorial Day. Her disgusting approach to the situation was unprofessional and an embarrassment to the restaurant industry. I am really sad to have had such a terrible experience at a restaurant that really sets a local standard as far as food goes.  I will not be back. I will not make any more referrals. This place is dead to me and I can only hope to erase the horrible experience I had here with a substantially better experience at another restaurant more deserving of my business.Reflective of visit May 2012.Do not go, do not go, do not go, do not go. I can't say that enough. If I could give a negative rating I would.Decor: I've got too much to talk about to waste characters here.  But to note:  I am handicapped, and there is no elevator. I understand it is an old building, so actually not their fault, but it was the first omen of a bad night and should be noted for any handicapped patrons who may be reading this review. Even to get to the inside dining room, there is no ramp, only stairs, albeit 2 steps, but still.Service: Ha! Negative 5 stars. We were there as guests of a sizable private party, and seated outside and served buffet style. Many of us, including my husband, approached the outdoor bar instead of going back inside to the main. There were two bartenders, a female and male. He tried to order from the male. "Do you have Malibu rum?" Reply: "No." "Okay, what about a 7&7?" Reply: "Nope." "Fine then, just a plain Coke." Reply: "We don't have Coke." "Okay... what do you have?" The bartender starts to lift up bottles to show my husband. One of which is rum, not Malibu, fine, but then the correct response at the beginning should have been, "Sorry sir, I don't have Malibu, but I do have 'insert brand here.' Would you like that?" Anyway, as he sees the bottle of rum in front of his eyes, he also sees a cocktail waitress next to him ordering from the female bartender-- 2 rum and cokes, so my husband asks for that, as he sees her pouring said rum and popping open cans of coke for the waitress' drinks. He tells male bartender "I'll take one of those--a rum and coke." Reply is an exacerbated "We don't have Coke!" My husband is in disbelief. Finally the female says, "Yes, we do," and hands the man a can. The male says to my husband, "Oh, I guess we do," mixes the cocktail, and there is no apology or even sheepish or embarrassed expression.Next, the buffet line of tapas chosen by the host: at sundown on the patio with little light (as well as the fact most items were fried past recognition) many of us couldn't see or figure out what was being served. My husband, ever the optimist, even after his bar escapade, asked the staff member working the buffet line if he could tell us (aka me, him, and his elderly uncle) what that the items were. Staff member's response: He scoffed, and said "EVERYTHING?!?!?!" (Oh, I'm sorry for putting you out by asking you to assist me, which is your job!) My husband quietly, being made to feel like the rude one in the situation, if not an idiot, both of which were untrue and uncalled for, said, "Well, yes." So the horrendously rude server quickly pointed and offered no explanation other than, "Pork sandwiches, lamb, chicken, and all the same repeated at the other end." First of all, even I could tell via sight that every serving tray held something different, there was no "repeating at the other end," but whatever...Anyway, based on that amazingly helpful [please read sarcasm] explanation, we chose a few items and went to our seats. Mr. Helpful server wasn't even right. His closest "guess" was the "pork sandwiches which turned out to be mini Cubans. Other than that there were fried artichokes and calamari. (Glad I guessed that from its look on the serving table myself, as I hate the stuff and would have "urped" if I mistakenly took a bite.)Lastly on the service end, I asked a passing waiter if there was a manager I could speak with in order to report the previous server's disrespectful attitude. This waiter refused to get a manager, saying, "Whatever it is, I can help." Fine, I was in no mood to argue. But when I told him, he simply laughed and said, "I'll get you a menu." I was taken aback and replied, "I don't need a menu, it's done. It's just his attitude I have a problem with." He laughed again and offered to bring a menu.  When I insisted again that a menu had nothing to do with it, he laughed more and walked away.  I would bet the bank these employees have either been trained to not get a manager because the manager doesn't want to hear about it, or that they don't want to get a manager because they don't want to show any sign to their superiors that there is, yet another, complaint.Food: Zero stars.  Most tasteless beyond fried grease, the rest bland.Trust the undercover Food Network specials--this place is deplorable. I can't believe in an economy where establishments are boarded up daily it seems, that this one has enough customers to stay open, and that it doesn't seem to care if or how it will retain them.I went to this place and they told us that the kitchen was backed up and I couldn't place my order for at least 30 min! Terrible experienceI very rarely find myself downtown but I was seeing a matinee at the Smith's Center, and me and my people needed to eat so Bar + Bistro was what we chose. There were 3 ways to walk into the restaurant, there were no obvious signs to entrance and I picked all the wrong doors. Finally we found our way to the host desk and he sat us at our table ... with no menus. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to ask for a menu. He said that they didn't have enough to go around, so he grabbed us small paper to-go menus. Good enough, I suppose. Our server greeted us, she was friendly and attentive, and helped me make my decision. My eyes are perpetually larger than my stomach so I usually need some assistance. The food took forever, but was delicious when it finally arrived. I had the Cangrejo Benedict Mofongo - tasty, my mom had the Paella Mixto Crepe - delicious, and the highlight - my G-ma's flan french toast. It was an okay visit, so ... why the two stars? After the show I returned with a friend for a glass of wine and maybe tapas. We sat at the bar ... the bartender that was there when we arrived was an asshole with no concept of good customer service, and was joined shortly after we sat down by a pompous asshole who also had no concept of good customer service. We sat down in a mostly empty place, again I had to ask for a menu, again they were out. The conversation I had with the dude went something like this ... "May I have a menu?" "Uh ... we're out, let me see what I can find" several moments later he returns with a food/wine menu and i ask "do you have a cocktail menu?" "no" "are there any specialty cocktails?" "no ... we just took pictures last week" "oh, are you redoing it?" "no" "how long have you been open?" "about a year, we took pictures last week" "are there any cocktails that you personally can make?" "no ... maybe in a couple weeks" . My bad for assuming that there should be a cocktail menu, but the hundreds of specialty liquor and liqueur bottles, fresh herbs in the well, and all the jiggers, muddlers and other such accoutrements that all mixologists carry around would lead me to believe that they had a specialty cocktail menu. Apparently not, they just took pictures last week. Full disclosure ... I got a little snappy with the guy, because he was the opposite of helpful. Enter the next bartender ... no hello, no eye contact just a louder than a whisper conversation with the other bartender about if the people at the bar are cool.  I have high expectations for the level of service in Vegas. Any dickhead can put on a smedium sized vest and bow tie and make a cocktail. A++ customer service is a skill and these dudes these ... definitely not up to par.A couple ladies sit down next to us, they ask for menus, ask the same cocktail related questions. Same responses. They asked to place a food order and were then informed that there was a 20 minute hold on ordering any food. So the food would be 20 minutes + the amount of time it actually took to prepare the food after it was ordered. Not okay, and not okay with them, so they left. Anytime I'm downtown, I get excited about it's future. The Smith Center, all the cleanup, locally owned restaurants popping up everywhere, cool bars, culture! How would this place handle an actual crowd? On both occasions the restaurant/bar was only 25% full. Why aren't there enough menus? Why the belated specialty cocktail menu? Why the egotistical bartenders? I don't see this place going the distance unless some serious kinks are worked out and I hope that they do because that flan french toast was something else.The two stars are for the sweet potato fries, which are delicious.Everything else is horrendous here. The food isn't bad, per se, but it is nothing special and is ridiculously overpriced. The service...WOW. This place may have the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waiters are slow and don't check up on you. When they do check up on you, beware! I had a waiter take my plate (with half my food still on it!) while I had turned to talk to my friend. I turned back to an empty table and a still-empty stomach because quite literally half of my sandwich was taken away without anyone asking me if I was done. This would be bad enough on its own, but I've had several friends tell me they have had the same exact thing happen to them here!Add to that their complete lack of willingness to work with you or make you happy. The pastrami here is traditionally served on rye bread. I dislike rye bread, so I asked my server if I could get it on white bread. The answer? "No, it comes on rye." WHAT??? The kitchen is incapable of slapping pastrami and mustard on a different kind of bread? I ended up ordering the club sandwich, which came on white bread.Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. It will probably be cheaper and have better customer service.No doubt the hottest mess in downtown. One of the first times I visited, the bar was airing a live episode of the Food Network show Restaurant Stakeout (all about deeply troubled restaurants), and I got to watch the service staff laughing at their horrible depictions on TV. That was about two years ago. Cut to this weekend, a beautiful Sunday morning. What sounds better than brunch while sitting outside? The lady suggests B&B. Although I've been a number of times for dinner, still haven't tried brunch, plus its super close, plus the weather--yes, let's do B&B! We arrive about 11:15, order by 11:45. I need to to leave by 1pm to meet some folks, but we figure there's plenty of time. You know where this is going. We order a Spanish omelet and the B&B Bake and are told something about how the bake takes an extra 5-10 minutes. Fine, no immediate rush. Around minute thirty is when things start to get a little weird, so I mention how "excited" we are for our dishes. Profuse apologies; kitchen's backed up, the usual. Another fifteen minutes later, as the five or six tables that sat down after us are well into their meals, I tell the server we need to get going so either the food has to arrive immediately or we'll have to split. Quick run to the kitchen; profuse apologies; our orders are "the very next ones" at the window. Watch three more orders land at tables around us, and finally around minute sixty we stand up and begin to take our leave. It is almost ten to 1. Naturally, the server is carrying our plates right as we're passing her. She implores us to sit and eat, says the meal will be taken care of. We're starving, so we sit down and eat. Not much point going into great detail about the food. It was bad. The Spanish omelet was overcooked eggs with a few red peppers and a slice of supposedly manchego cheese on top. Slapped on a plate, no accompaniment, no flavor or texture, just a quickly thrown together mess that I am certain took no more than four minutes to execute. The "bake" had more flavor (chorizo, obvi) but was also dry and accompanied by some curiously soggy "salad" involving finely diced tomatoes, lettuce, avocados, beans, and olives. It was weird, disproportionate, heavy, mushy, and made no sense. In other words, it was a lousy experience. The weather was lovely, the bluegrass band, although too loud for talking, was a fun touch, and the packed seating area bustled with merriment. I guess you can get away with a lot on a Sunday morning when the weather's nice and the mimosa and bloody mary taps are wide open. Folks seemed happy. I'd have been one of the happy ones too if I were getting rocked on bottomless booze and time was no issue. Sadly, we were there for the meal in addition to the sun, and the meal was a dumpster fire. I have it on good authority that the reason B&B offers such chronically horrible service is because the kitchen is simply too small to accommodate the amount of diners that the house can accommodate. If that's the case, it's an unfortunate error in the original design, but it can't continue to hobble the entire operation. A restaurant can't thrive if it's constantly apologizing for pissing off its customers. That's a model for failure. They need to radically simplify the menu, or streamline the preparation, or get rid of tables, or hire faster cooks, or knock out some walls and expand the kitchen, or.... I won't come back, at least not for the food. I've eaten here several times and recall a few quite memorable bites. The mac n cheese blew me away the first time I tried it. A few other things have been surprisingly good. But the menu is much like the service--all over the place and wildly inconsistent. B&B is more than the food, though, which is probably why it continues to survive. The location is premiere, right in the heart of the Arts District. The bar offers a brilliant selection of brown spirits and usually friendly service. It's more than a restaurant, it's a hub, and good thing because it wouldn't survive on the food alone.For those of us who live near and/or support the Arts District, B&B is a place to embrace and rally around. It's exactly the kind of thing to want to thrive. But it shouldn't get a free pass on being a restaurant just for being a cool spot in a cool location. Two years ago B&B was laughing at its own bumbling self on TV, and it doesn't seem like much has improved since. Pity.Great and unique place for brunch on a late-Sunday morning! Came here as a suggestion from my friend who wanted the brunch atmosphere with the bluegrass music spin. Parking was a bit rough in the area and we ended up parking in a loading zone, but other people were parked there and it was a Sunday. Luckily our car was still there later :DI had the french toast - it was served with the syrup already poured on and not too sweet. I liked how the bread pieces weren't too thick and it was the perfect balance of fluffy and crispy. We also ordered the house fries that come with tasty takes on mayo and ketchup (slightly spicy). The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the quiche which he claims to be the best quiche he's ever had (topping Bouchon's even - but not sure if I'd personally go that far). The rest of our party really enjoyed their entree choices and a few of us got the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12. They even let one of our friends change between both drinks. They are very generous with their mimosa pours and even when I told them I was good after 2 cups, one of our servers encouraged me to just have a little more! They did run out of champagne and switched to bottomless white wine sangria, which I unfortunately didn't have room for. One of the proprietors came to talk to us and was super sweet and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. I'll definitely be back for the sangria and all the entrees that got me hooked!Great spot downtown for outdoor dining and cocktails. Met two of my girlfriends from my 'Showbiz' days on a beautiful Saturday night. I did think it would be crowded, but it was perfect, plenty of outdoor seating and no waiting at all. The waitress was super nice and very attentive. Prices not too expensive, I ordered the Pomegranate Champagne Sangria, and OH MY GOODNESS, how delicious and fresh it was!Yes, I will be back. Its 2 blocks from my building!

Mom and I stopped by for lunch the other day.  She ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack Appetizer ($11.65), I had the Chicken Nachos ($10.35).....the waitress convinced me to have a Stone Ruination IPA ($6.25)....kidding, I didn't need any convincing.The food came out fast.  Mom enjoyed the Poke Stack, it's one of her favorite dishes here.  The Chicken Nachos had a lot of potential....half of the Chips tasted stale...you know, when it has the texture of Licorice....anyway, the part of my Nachos with the stale Chips were awful, the part of my Nachos with fresh Chips was awesome.  Seriously, it was night and day.  Dammit Yard House.The Stone Ruination IPA made it all better though....yummy!Overall, it was an OK lunch.  Could have been better.Will I return?  I'm sure I will.I never have any issue with service or food at this location. My latest visit, our waiter Benjamin S. was one of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. He had the most personality and checked up on us while making jokes each time. I could not stop laughing.My favorites at yard house are:Lobster crab artichoke dip, chicken tortilla soup, chicken enchilada stack, & they have really good fish too. Benjamin brought out a dipping sauce for our sweet potato fries which were to die for. It was a bacon maple cream sauce. Omg I want some right now thinking about it. Beers are great. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do appreciate their fruity beer selection. The prices are pretty reasonable as well.

Review Text :
Awww Checkers, I'm so glad I found you again after so many years!  I grew up with you but then moved to Vegas and thought we would never see each other again.  Oh happy day because you have now opened a place in town, so our romance can continue!So, it has been about 20 years since I had Checkers/Rally's.  I remember them being the best burgers and fries in the world.  I was so excited to grab some food here and relive my childhood with my family.  The Baconzilla Burger was tasty, the fried  chicken sandwich was like every other fried chicken sandwich at fast food places, and the fish sandwich was in the same boat as the chicken.  The fries are still pretty tasty being covered in all sorts of seasoning and fried to be on the crispy side.  The food wasn't as fantastic as I remember it, but it was still pretty tasty.  The milk shakes are quite yummy here too.  They even have banana milk shakes, which you don't see often.  The only negative here are the serving sizes on the fries.  The small order of fries looked like it should belong in the kid's meal not the adult meal.  So if you are hungry, go for a bigger size otherwise you will still be hungry afterwards.   The drinks and the sandwiches all seem on par with other comparable places.The prices all seem a tad on the high side for what you get.  They aren't outrageous, but more than what you will spend at McDs or BK or the like, on a similar meal deal.This particular location is on a really busy corner, so you have to be careful getting in and out of the place, since everyone drives like maniacs in this area.  It can also take a bit to get out of the parking lot onto the main street again due to the high volume of traffic.  This is not a good place if you are crunched for time.  As for the seating, it is outdoor only, so keep that in mind if you plan on going in the middle of July.  Also with it being on a busy street corner, it is loud sitting outside due to the traffic sounds.So yes, Checkers is a yummy fast food joint for good burgers.  The fries are tasty, but order a bigger size than normal for yourself.  And lastly, give yourself some extra time since everything is on the slow side.I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.Rally's... Checker's... It's all the same. And it's good. I had a all beef chili cheese dog with onions and it was good. I ate a Cheese Champ that was a single burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and ketchup and it was damn good especially for the price. I have been before this last time and had mozzarella sticks that are good as hell for a fast food place. I have also had a burger that had jalapenos and they weren't shy with them so I liked it a lot. They have a walk up window and a double drive thru. The drive thru speaker on the left has window service on the passenger side and the speaker on the right has window service at the drivers window.This Checkers is located on the corner of Deseret inn and Boulder Highway.  It has that old school feel of an old diner except you cannot go inside to eat. I've been here several times of the years and it's just ok to me.  It's not the first place I'll go to when I want to grab a burger and fries.  One thing I don't like about the location is the drive thru.  It's not suitable for longer vehicles and I always rub my tires against the curb when I'm trying to exit the joint.  Besides that I always get coupons in the mail for checkers but I still prefer the more established  burger places because I know what Im getting.  Checkers just doesn't leave too much of an impression with me.

Review Text :
Monday night was a big one for me.  First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one. So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry. Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime. We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite. Really though, the food was phenomenal.We had some time to kill after a schedule change left us stranded at the Greyhound Station in Phoenix. We ditched the bus station and asked a cab driver to take us somewhere - anywhere - interesting. We ended up at Biltmore Fashion Center and were dropped off near Zinburger. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=bHZobMw7BzUv5Thd211_QQWe saw many diners enjoying burgers, shakes, and fries, and asked Ichabod if he'd like something to eat. He seemed excited about the restaurant and chose barstools for us near the pleasant outdoor patio dining area. We ordered:* Roasted chicken salad with organic greens, pomegranate, marcona almonds, and goat cheese dressing  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=5lTby7rzAD3Japndi95ykg* Burger of the day - angus and brie with truffled aioli. The flavor of the cheese overpowered the meat, but it was still tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=d0aoEc0hSLAppfbY3MNhtg* Fries - limp, greasy, disappointing. How does a burger place mess up fries? They looked better than they tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=mGD30C-GrVFNzmaCRU-9jA* Black cow float - root beer float with a tall glass packed with vanilla ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could justify charging $6 for it, but the price made more sense when I saw the amount of high quality ice cream and the premium root beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=kSz0KDrt4SPLOaPr26CFSwMr. L and I shared the salad and burger, which they split for us, and brought in succession. That made dining easy and enjoyable. Our server was borderline unpleasant and impatient, and gave me the impression she wanted us to order quickly and be done with us. When she gave us our check, she made one attempt at friendliness, the last-ditch "don't stiff me my tip endzone play," which we witnessed her do with another customer at the bar. Strange. In contrast, the other Zinburger servers were consistently pleasant and very helpful. The bovine theme here is pervasive, from the cow decorations on the walls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=ljBTfOt7fXWa15uq55A_lQ to the trough sink in the ladies room. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=_-qDTkIuzpxOMk1RgJ5z4wFrom the burgerlicious food to the fun atmosphere, I can see why Zinburger is a popular eatery.Regrettably I was here a few months back for a friend's birthday, and while the vehemence of my disdain has been allowed to cool with the ensuing time since my visit, I now know with a particular level of certainty why you shouldn't waste any of your hard earned benjamin's here.-crowds: granted it is in the Biltmore, so your bound to be surrounded with yuppies, however if you truly analyze the setting of this restaurant it's essentially an option in a food court of a pretentious mall masquerading as something else. lets be fair though, most places in Az are in some form of strip mall setting, but in all honesty isnt the Biltmore just another shopping mall?-rude servers: now there is any number of reasons why a server has the right to be a little curt, I'm not saying that a server needs to be a ball of sunshine to satisfy me, but open hostility, resentment, and referring to one of my friends with a pretty strong homophobic slur is in my eyes unacceptable.-inflated prices: $10 for a burger? to quote Wayne's World "SHUHHH" NO WAY!? WAAAY." There'd be no complaints to that price tag if the burger was actually worth it, what your paying for is what my Peruvian friend's realtor mom likes to call "Locacion, Locacion, Locacion"-mediocre burgers: along the lines with the last comment, the burgers here are surely "meh, i've had better" 2 stars at best. For a pricier burger that you'll be glad to shell out a hamilton and a few washingtons for go to Phoenix City Grille, now they know how to make a burger and treat customersSimply put Zinburger has no Zen, and it leaves you with the same taste in your mouth that a haiku written by George Carlin might.Big, juicy, burgers...Sam Fox Style. The burgers here are juicy and delicious. The fries are just as good and very salty (in a good way). I especially enjoy the multiple dipping sauces they offer to accompany the fries and I always try to save room for a milkshake to wash it down! This is a good spot for lunch because the service is relatively quick!***Zinburger is a small Phoenix burger chain from a restaurant group (Fox Restaurant Concepts) that has several restaurants--mostly in Phoenix though I think some of their restaurants are coming to Los Angeles; the food here is okay but definitely not as good as some of Los Angeles' great burger spots like Father's Office and Short Order***Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which is an upscale outdoor mall just outside of Downtown Phoenix.  Biltmore Fashion Park has a few upscale shops like J. Crew, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn, but it seems to have even more dining options--a lot of chains from upscale ones like The Capital Grille to moderately priced ones like California Pizza Kitchen.  Zinburger seems to be one of the more local or at least regional places here.Zinburger has a clean and simple indoor dining room.  The dining room is very minimalist and no frills, but it is modern and comfortable.  An outdoor dining patio is also available, but it would probably be quite uncomfortable dining outside during Phoenix's hot summers.Because Zinburger is a burger spot, prices are not too high for dinner.  Zinburger is a gourmet burger spot though so burgers run $10 here.  You can upgrade to an American Kobe beef patty for an extra $5.  All sides are a la carte and are large sides that are suited for two or three people.Salads are also available as well as an assortment of shakes and not just traditional flavors.  Shakes are very dessert-focused here--shakes based on popular and longstanding desserts like crème brulee, strawberry cheesecake and bananas foster.Zinburger's menu setup is also a tad similar to The Counter.  Like The Counter, Zinburger has a build-your-own-burger option where you can choose between quite a few toppings, cheeses and sauces.  The Counter showcases special burgers (and I believe shakes) for the month and so does Zinburger.I had Zinburger's El Diablo burger.  The burger came with fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo.  I also upgraded the patty to American Kobe beef.  The burger itself was pretty good.  It had a good flavor and was juicy enough.  It did not have the juiciness of a very great burger, but it was definitely not dry.  I am not sure how much the American Kobe added.  I have never been a big fan of American Kobe beef; it lacks the richness of Japanese Kobe.  The burger patty was good though their regular patty might be good as well.The toppings were okay.  The burger was not too spicy.  It could have used a little more heat though occasionally the burger had nice heat.  I wish the burger had greens though to add freshness and balance.  It seems like a lot of their signature burgers lack greens and lettuce, which I think is a big miss.Their hand cut fries were just okay.  They were thin fries and they could have been crispier.  The zucchini fries could have been crispier too.  The flavor of the zucchini fries were good though and they came with a decent Parmesan ranch dipping sauce.I had their Bars of Zin shake, which was chocolate ice cream, melted chocolate and praline flakes.  The shake had a good consistency.  It was smooth and thick but still very drinkable.  The flavor was good.  It had a good chocolate flavor without being too rich.  The praline flakes were just okay.  It did not add the crispiness I would have preferred.Service was good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.As already mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Overall, you can get out of here with a filling dinner for not that much money.  That being said, the burgers and shakes here are expensive for casual food given their gourmet label and significant portion sizes.Zinburger is an okay burger spot.  In terms of flavor, I would definitely put it above a spot like The Counter.  I would say though that Father's Office and Short Order are significantly better than Zinburger and I would even prefer spots like 25 Degrees over Zinburger too.As mentioned earlier, Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which offers both pay self and valet parking.  Zinburger does validate parking (I believe they validate up to 2 hours).There's nothing like a good burger! I've heard so many good things about this place and FINALLY got to check it out this weekend, boy was everyone right about it! It was amazing! I saw the Breakfast burger and just had to get it. It comes with all of my favorites.. avocado, bacon, mayo and topped with a fried egg! Anything with a fried egg on it is good to me. lol. The burger was amazing and beyond delicious. I also ordered the Creme Brulee Milkshake which was soooooo good! You have to try it! We also ordered the Double Truffle Fries. It was good but it came with this weird Mayo dip which I was not too fond of. Everything was really amazing, HOWEVER the service... my oh my... Let's just say it was very disappointing... We ordered ranch and ketchup for our fries which never came. We had to flag down another waitress to get it for us. Also, our water cups were pretty much always empty. I almost felt the need to go to the bar just to get more water. =/ The waitress probably checked on us maybe once the entire time we were there. This place really does have amazingggg burgers! I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service. I also wish there was one on my side of town as well but you can't win em all! =0Last year, when faced with a week of no solid foods before AND after renal surgery, Dude asked me what/where I wanted to eat the Saturday before.  One place came to mind. Zinburger! When you've got a week of chicken broth, water, Jell-O and Morphine to look forward to: Who in their right mind would turn up their nose to gourmet burgers, decadent and creative milkshakes and craveable sides?!Over the last year and a half, we've gone 4-5 times. Friendly customer service every visit, and worth the wait time.We've tried the Double Truffle Fries with Garlic Aioli, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato and Zucchini fries ... All delicious; however, the Double Truffle Fries are the winner here.You can replace any patty with Kobe Beef or Turkey; they will also lettuce wrap them for all you Paleonerds and Low Carb Kids. My favorites have been: 1) Turkey Burger: These guys do it right. Not your typical Jenni-O boring patties. 2) The Samburger: Cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Thousand Island with the obligatory lettuce, tomato and onion. I'd drive 30 minutes out here JUST for that Creme Brulee Shake. Wish the Butterfinger one was a permanent menu option, not just another "Shake of the Month"! Highly recommend sharing them. They are huge. Hit up Zinburger to indulge any burger / "sin food" craving. And wear your fat pants. I know I'll be back ... Again and again!A bit closer to 2.5 stars but my server was super friendly so that is why it's a 3.I was craving a burger and had seen this place mentioned a few times being named as one of the "Best Burgers in Phoenix".   I decided to come down and check it out.  Pay parking which you can get validated.  They use plastic tokens...reminded me of a small poker chip.  Anyways..........walked inside and was seated against the wall.  My server came over and asked me if it was my first time here etc.  She went over the whole drill.  I decided to order the Zinburger (minus mayo), an order of fresh cut fries and a Diet Pepsi to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.................Zinburger-  ($10.50)  This is a ground beef patty (I'm assuming 1/3 lb...it was a good sized patty) topped with manchengo cheese, zinfandel braised onions, and lettuce.  I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect.  It was presented nicely but it was lacking greatness.  I took a bite of the meat itself and it tasted really great...like steak!  The cheese was melted on top of the burger and the onions were layered nicely on top of the cheese.  It came on a soft "fancy" bun.  Each item itself was great...when combined though, it left something to be desired.  All I could really taste was bread and onions.  The meat/burger was not the star of the show.  The lettuce addition was a little weird too.  It probably would have been better without.  It was a decent enough burger but for a "fancy" higher end burger joint, I expected more.  It ain't cheap either!  Hand Cut Fries-  ($5.00)  These things were actually really good.  They give you a nice sized mound of them.  They were hot and crispy and delicious.  They needed just a bit more salt, but other than that, they were really good.  Better/more memorable than the burger.Diet Pepsi- Is what it is.Why only 2.5/3 stars?  For a burger, fries and drink, it was $19.98...that is before tip!  I will never ever ever ever ever ever pay $25.00 to come back here for simple comfort food.  It's just way too expensive for what you get!   The staff was all pretty friendly, the layout is cool (kind of a hipster vibe), and they validate parking for up to 2 hours.  I am glad I came to check it out, but sadly I will not be returning...the value is just not there.  Once I hit that lotto and move to Scottsdale, then we can come here often lol.Came here last night for the very first time with a couple of our good friends. We had the kale Caesar, the Kobe Burger, hand Fries and the IPA Beer and Berry Mojito. Everything was delicious! The fools was phenomenal, the drinks were tasty and the service was over all great!we had an outdoor table and the atmosphere was very hip and easy going. Great Job Sam Fox! I look fwd to visiting all your restaurants now!

Restaurant name  Cannon Coffee

Review Text :
Why five stars? Anyone who can start a coffeehouse with a world full of Starbucks and Caribou's gets a pat on the back from me. The only strike against Cannon is that they close early but it's not that big a deal with me to take a star away. I ordered an iced coffee for 2 bucks, it was every bit as good as Starbucks' iced brew and the best part, the "plastic" cup my beverage came in was made from plant products. So it will  rot in the ground. I love supporting locally own businesses, it's good for the community and the economy. It's got a Beehive feel without the freaks. You can borrow a book from the bookshelf, listen to good music when they have open mic night or just go in with an iPhone like I did and chill. I got to talking to the owner and his partner, he has some great ideas, I wish him luck and hope it comes to fruition. Locals go behind the counter and help themselves and leave the money on the counter. There is a deck behind the counter for smokers or if you just want to sit outside. I like this place and can see myself becoming a regular. Hey Nate good luck and save me a comfy chair!People looking to open up a coffee shop in Pittsburgh have it made!  Want a homey feel?  Buy a house and convert it into a business!  Want a beautiful molded ceiling?  Already there!  Want character? It's built in.Get the point?  This place has history and I love it!  Lots of books line the walls, but little trinkets decorate the walls and ample seating, including comfy chairs, make it a prime spot for work or a casual meet up.  They also have a killer outdoor patio that actually offers power for your laptop too, which is a total plus if you want to hang in the pretty space.They have all the normal coffee, tea and soda offerings (yay for Italian soda!). I went with an iced vanilla latte and it was perfect.  The dude who seemed to be the owner was incredible friendly and even had his fluffy friendly dog with him.  If you're looking for a furry friend to break up the work day, this doggie is looking for attention!  The food they were making for breakfast and lunch smelled awesome, so I'm looking forward to stopping back for some bites.

Restaurant name  La Katra Hot Dog Cart
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
So there I was... on week three of my semi-vegan, all whole foods, mostly organic, low-sodium and low-sugar diet and I was pissed. Angry and frustrated with the way things have been happening lately. Two major fights in two days... doesn't make for a good pageant week, but whatev' it happened. Not wanting to relive everything, but KNOWING I was about to... only one thing came to mind... I want an effing HOT DOG!Now, I live within walking distance of Ted's Hot Dogs, but it was closed, I tried to think of somewhere that was open... a spot came to mind: perched on the south west corner of Priest and Baseline, across the street from AZ Mills Mall and a lil down from Carls Jr. sat the gleaming cart of happiness... La Katra Hot Dogs. With its Sonoran Dogs, bottled mexican sodas, plastic tables n chairs, and small tv showing nothing but Telenovelas, La Katra was the perfect setting for my culinary Wooo Saaaw. The first time I heard of Sonoran Hot Dogs, the sound of it made me sick. Nothing but unkosher, heavily processed food?! Uhh... no thanks! But I'm so happy I gave it a go because I have been missing OUT! We quickly got our boiled bacon wrapped dog topped with refried beans, MAYO and tomatoes on a steamed sesame seed bun. There is an ice chest filled with other toppings. Things such as: sliced mushrooms, shredded cheese, sweet relish, whole green chilies, creamy guac sauce, salsa verde and parmesan cheese (u know... the stuff in the green can).I was elated and a little overwhelmed. I asked my friend Beckita which I should use, she suggested the guac and salsa. I obeyed and added relish, parmesan and hot green chili sauce for good measure! I took my first bite and it was... DUH-VINE!Creamy, spicy and kind of salty. It was soft, yummy and could use some crunch, maybe some crushed tortilla chips on top? Extremely savory and filling. You only need ONE $3 Sonoran Dog. Their Bottles are $1.50 and cans of soda are a $1. They are open daily starting at 6pm and close 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. If you have $5 and need some late night food, then this is the place for you! Be sure to top yours with the salsa verde! It's the best!!

Restaurant name  Rambo's Kitchen

Review Text :
Was it my love of dogs that brought me to Rambo's Kitchen?  (There is a picture of the owner's dog "Rambo" on the sign)  I stopped in last night for dinner, and knew the moment I walked in that this place had a shot at being great.  The restaurant is decked out with tie-dye, vintage concert posters, and other 60's and 70's era memorabilia.  A few menu items and specials are written on the wall, and the music plays at an appropriate level.  Last night "Bernadette" by the Temptations was on as we entered, a personal favorite.  The menu has a lot of variety; its a good idea to ask your server what's delicious?  Most items come with a side, and even though there were a lot of choices, we both ordered the hand-cut fries.Our Dinner:Sm. Onion rings - They were standard onion rings, not too greasy, crisp coating.  The side of ranch they are served with is key.Turkey Avocado Croissant w/ hand cut fries - A flaky, buttery croissant hugged some fresh slices of avocado, lettuce, tasty turkey, and a little aioli.  It was very good.  The FRIES are excellent.  The hand-cut bad boys were in-and-out strives to be, but falls short of accomplishing.  They aren't fast food fries, but they are similar to in-and-out in cut.  The RAMBO BURGER - Oh Yeeeaaahhhh!  (Hulk Hogan voice)As soon as I saw this I figured, "I worked hard this week, I earned this."  This juicy, 1/2 pound burger is stuffed with various cheeses, (mild with a hint of sharp cheddar) topped with home made BBQ Pulled Pork and an onion ring.  The lightly toasted bun was incredible.  If this burger won an award, it would first thank the bun for its great support.  There is a roll of paper towels on the table so fear not, a little contained chaos is what all of us need once in a while.  I liked the flavors a lot.  I asked for a side of BBQ sauce and dipped a bit because it was so good.Bottom Line:  My parents and yours would love this place.  I love Rambo's Kitchen because it is family run, practically everything is made from scratch, it is reasonably priced, and fun.  This is a Diner's Drive ins, and Dives spot waiting to be discovered.Horrible, Horrible service is what is was all about my last time there. I went there last week during my lunch break with a couple of people from my work. When we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order. We all ordered water and then ordered our meals.We were then IGNORED for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food. No check ups by the waitress, no I am sorry your food is taking so long. hey do you need a refill, no nothing. At that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave. That is when we were finally noticed. The waitress came running over almost freaking out  saying our food is just about ready. Where were you 20 minutes ago?Anyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go. I disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice.I understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh, but not 40 minutes. but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time.P.S. In response to the owner's comments, I stand by what I said in my review as accurate. So based on what the owner says, good customer service is to call me a liar, write a snarky insincere response, and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are?  I have read all the owner's comments left towards other Yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them. If something goes wrong during your visit, don't blame the restaurant. Not a very productive response in my opinion. I think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money. It is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business.Okay, let's try this again.....First let me apologize to yelp and the owner of Rambo's kitchen for writing a review that fell "outside" yelps TOS. I am usually a fairly soft spoken and respectful person and I am sincerely sorry for anything said in my previous review that was found to be disrespectful or a "personal attack".Now to my review of the restaurant.....I have been to Rambo's at least a half dozen times and despite what Yelp or the owner might think, I have never had a bad experience or a bad meal. All the food and service I have ever received there has been decent. As stated in my "too personal" review, I would give Rambo's a solid 3 stars to a soft 4 stars, which actually falls right into line with Rambo's average review, if it was just about food and service. More on that later.The Rambo Burger was excellent. I do think that the thimble sized portion of cole slaw is a bit silly.The first time my wife and I went there we order the fried zucchini app and it was one of the best we had ever had. Nice long lightly battered spears of zucchini that were just wonderful. The next couple of time we got the FZ the quality went down each time. We have never ordered it again.My wife loves their salads. My 16 y/o sons loves everything, but come on, he's a 16 y/o boy.Service? Hit and miss. Sometimes you get your order right in and it comes to your table in a timely manner, other times, not so much. Some times your water glass is always full, others not.As for the one star rating, it needs to be understood that my wife and I try to avoid the big chain restaurants. In these difficult time we choose to go with the locally owned mom and pop places. It take guts and determination to run your own restaurant.That said, I do not understand the attitude that the owner takes when someone gives him a negative review. Just be gracious. Accept the fact that sometimes your restaurant will hit a home run and other times it will strike out. Rather than going to the surveillance tapes to attack dissatisfied customers about their timing issues, why not just say "Sorry for you bad experience" and determine to improve in the future. People do not right reviews, good or bad, because they like you or dislike you. They write review because they had an emotional reaction to their experience, good or bad.With all due respect to the owner of Rambo's, I cannot separate the food and service at Rambo's from what I feel to be a severe disconnect from the owner when faced with a legitimate, honest reviews that he doesn't like.All parts equal the sum of this review and that's why it is a one star review.A co-worker recommended this place, so my sister and I went for dinner.  All in all I just wasn't impressed with this restaurant, so much so that I won't be back.The decor is psychadelic 60's.  Well, actually, it seemed to flux from random things of the 60's, such as bands or movies, to just psychadelic looking stickers.  It seemed like they were just desperate to fill in every empty space on their walls.  It's a bit over the top when you walk in, but I can understand the fun for people that particularly enjoy that decade.  I don't happen to and even if I did like the 60's, their decor could have been way less cheesy and still been faithful to the theme.Each table has books, toys or memorablia from that same decade, which I thought was interesting, especially since our table featured a Greatest Edition of Archie Comics, which I loved when I was a little girl.  Obviously the music they play is from the 60's and they even show muted Ed Sullivan Show clips on a large television.When we placed our orders, I told the waitress that I had wanted a hamburger, so she recomended the special which was a Rambo Burger.  The menu didn't really give a description on the specials part, so I ordered it.  It came out with shredded barbecue beef on top and an onion ring.  I really just wanted a simple burger and had there been a description when I ordered, I would have picked something else.  Still, when I scraped off the extra meat and put the onion ring to the side, it was a decent burger.  Actually, the quality of the burger is why this review is two stars instead of just one, espcially when my sister didn't like her chicken Alfredo.All in all, I wasn't impressed with the service and when we got our bill I was shocked when our total came out to close to $40.00.  Like I said, the food was good, but I can't spend that much in what I assumed would be a mom and pop style establishment.1/9/2013 (Response to Owner's Comments)If there's one thing that kinda irks me, it's the inability to quietly take a less than positive review and use it constructively instead of trying to defend youself against one person's bad experience.  I'm ALWAYS more than willing to give a second chance, and if you check my past reviews, most locations get a better review from the first time when I wasn't impressed.  This owner response was that second chance.  However, since the owner(?) was able to go into better detail of my review, I figured I would and could afford him the same courtesy.1. Cost: I hold in my hand my receipt from Rambo's Kitchen dated 12/26/12 for the total amount of $36.36 ("close to $40.00").  Now, even though I wasn't that impressed with the service, it wasn't horrible, so I decided to round up my bill with a tip of $3.64, more for my convenience than for the server's reward.  Hence, my bill came to $40.00.  Now, the reason for the increase in my bill is because I failed to mention the "$5.00" milkshake that we also ordered.  My apologies and the subject of my next issue.2. "$5.00 Milkshake": I love the name of that item, all I can think of is Vincent Vega and his outrage that something made of milk and ice cream can cost $5.00.  Of course, when he tasted Mia Wallace's shake, he had to agree that it was an amazing shake.  I couldn't.  The ice cream they used must have been thawed and then refrozen, because there were crystalized parts of it that just tasted like straight ice.  It wasn't quite blended well and I'm pretty sure if I was a waitress (as I have been, so I'm speaking from experience) I would have noticed if an item had barely been touched and asked if something was wrong.  I assume this is not a policy at Rambo's, but everyone has their off day and it's not like this is fine dining.  In fact, the person that ordered this shake, took one taste and didn't touch it again, I ate more than her since I didn't want to waste an entire $5.00.3. Quality of food: I apologize, sincerely, for stating that my sandwich contained beef, it was pulled pork now that I remember it.  I assume that I just glossed over that information and picture on the menu, so I apologize for that as well.  Now, as for the fettucine alfredo.  I had decided that I wouldn't go into detail in my original review, but fair's fair.  My sister loved it.  She brought the rest home to eat the next day.  Of course, when she woke up at two in the morning with stomach pains and spent the rest of the next day glued to the toilet, she instructed me to throw away her takeout food.  I'm not sure if it was undercooked chicken or something else, but the food made her sick.  However, I'll state it once again, my hamburger (once I had scraped off the pulled PORK) was delicious and I didn't get sick.In summation, I appreciate the archived positive reviews that were included and wish congratulations on the patrons that enjoyed this restaurant.  I was not one of them and definintely won't be.  Accordingly, I'll remove one star due to owner understanding.For the record, I hate giving this place two stars.The place is adorable.  Every square inch is packed with some kind of memorabilia or decoration from the 60's/70's.  There was obviously a lot of care and thought taken when decorating and it pays off big.  They also play a lot of Rolling Stones, Doors, etc, to add to the hippie experience.  The servers are also really great, especially Misty.  She's very sweet and willing to make recommendations on the menu.Unfortunately, each time I've been here, at least one person at my table absolutely hated their meal.  I'm not talking about "eh, not my fave" kind of reactions, but "I can't eat anymore of this, no, no, no."   One of those meals was a pulled pork sandwich (apparently the meat texture left much to be desired).  The other hated meal was my egg salad sandwich.  Now, I am a big egg salad enthusiast and will eat pretty much anything.  But, I really disliked this sandwich due to the overwhelming amount of celery in the filling.  I could only taste celery in each bite, which was gross. Also, the egg chunks were pretty large and not mashed like I prefer.  So, after a few bites, I was done and I sent it back.  I NEVER send things back, but it had to be done.  Luckily, they were very nice about it and brought me a chicken salad sandwich instead.  The chicken salad was much better, but not the greatest.Because I love everything else about this place, I'm going to give it a few more shots.  They serve breakfast all day, so, that might be the best bet.Went here today for the first time.  We were greeted when we arrived and chose a table in front.  Waitress came to take drink order and I put in order for my child's meal and a appetizer.  She brought the drinks but then didn't return to take the order until the app and kids meal was delivered.  We ordered our food, I fed my daughter, we ate our huge order of zucchini.  The zucchini came with a small dipping cup of ranch, we were charged for the extra ranch we needed due to the size of app.  After a while I went to go refill my drink myself and ask about our food.  2 orders of fish and chips.  It had been over 1/2 hr at this point and I knew there was a issue because I could see all the staff in the corner.  I could also HEAR them talking about a lost ticket.  We were about to leave and I even told the waitress "I just saw the cook drop in fish, is that ours?"  Wondering why it had been so long.  The waitress was sweet but clearly not trained to know how to handle a screw up.  She proceeded to lie to me and say "it takes a while because we need to make sure the fish is cooked, and what I saw was a to go order."  She clearly was oblivious that being the ONLY customers in the restaurant, no one came in for take out and I had a clear view of the cook.  Also its pretty common knowledge when you are ordering fried fish it only takes a couple minutes, not 30!  We proceeded to eat and before leaving a lady came over full of bad excuses... We switched staff, etc.  Well as I said had a clear view of the 1 cook who was there from when we walked in to when we left, and we had the same waitress so who knows what staff she was talking about.  She gave us a couple donuts which from what I have read is their "apology."   We also used a groupon, which by the way means you cannot order 1/2 the menu, no specials, etc.  Bad experience, mediocre food for the price, poor service, and penalized for using a group on.PS.. in response to Robert.  My daughter never sat on the floor, never colored on your very doubtfully "new" tile.  Shame on you. She was bored to tears at the amount of time we were there, as were we.  My experience was accurate.  I watched the SAME cook in the kitchen, and our meal there took over 1 hour.  Bought the groupon on the way in and have a time on the bill.  People came in after us and left before us.  As I stated we were the ONLY table.  There was not a 7-9 nominate delay, It took 15 minutes for app, than another 30 for meal.  The waitress LIED, a weak apology was given at end with a couple donuts.  If going back there was ever going to happen, your response has changed that.  Good luck in business.I had an extended bike ride this Sunday morning, so I decided to add breakfast into my morning ride.  I've been in the plaza several times when I was picking up Thai food nearby, but I never never stopped here.  Sunday, they open a 8 and I was there at 8:10.  A little warmer and I could have eaten outside, but it is December!Misty was my server and she was a gem!  Very pleasant smile, lots of helpful information, lots of coffee refills.  I ordered the Red Rock Bene which the menu describes as layers of Focaccia bread, bacon, fresh spinach, poached eggs, and homemade Hollandaise.  It's not "layers" of Focaccia.  Rather, there are two very large cuts of Focaccia each about two and a half to three inches tall.  I'm guessing those are the cliffs at Red Rock.  The rest was the standard Benedict except for the bacon.  The breakfast comes with choice of home fries or breakfast potatoes and if you get breakfast potatoes, you can get them plain or with fried onion and peppers.  There's a small charge for the onions and peppers, something I didn't see on the menu.The Bene was OK.  There's simply too much bread. I ate one slab and halfway through that, I moved the other poached egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff.  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and the onion and peppers were very good.  Worth the up charge.  Other than too much bread, my one complaint would be that the eggs were poached too long.  They were not runny when pierced but were semi hard yolks.  Note:  Saturday and Sunday are the only days they sell the two kinds of Benedicts.I really liked the inside.  The 60s, tie dyed things, peace symbols, and the music being played that I grew up with made for humming along with the sound track.  It was OK.  There was only one couple besides me in the place and they were at the other end so no one needed to go running out!The sign of Lucille Ball and Vitametavegamin sealed the deal for me.  A place that would have this sign is A-OK in my book!  Check out Elvis.  He's in the bathroom.So maybe Rambo's Kitchen didn't open to nationally televised fanfare, but someone is obviously reading my reviews because that's all about to change.Coming up this June they will be airing an episode of Jon Taffer's new show "Hungry Investors" featuring my favorite neighborhood diner - Rambo's Kitchen (its actually in my neighborhood).If I really think about it, I should be disappointed. I get the feeling that once the show airs, my quaint little neighborhood diner is going to become a little harder to get in to.Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Misty and the crew, and I hope the national spotlight proves to be a windfall for them all - but I will miss all the special attention they give this humble patron. I hope they remember this little guy when they hit it big. :)By the way, for those of you who thought this place couldn't get much better, they just changed their awesome homemade potato chips and now they are 'even more awesome' - thinner and crispier than before, but still as delicious as ever.And the chips aren't the only things getting better, time has certainly helped improve their skills in the kitchen, as just about everything is tasting better every time I order it.For those East-Siders who don't get around to our side of town very often, this is one place I promise is worth the drive. Pretty soon, there will be all kinds of people driving a whole long way to dine at Rambo's Kitchen.My suggestion, get here before the rush.On my last visit here, they took bad service to a whole new level. We were there a half hour before being acknowledged at our table. After ordering, we didnt get drinks for 15 mins and our food took 45 minutes!There was a server running around like a chicken without a head, nervously mentioning how she was new there. Each time we had to encounter her we wanted to ask her where the fire was. When we inquired about our food she went to check and reported back to us in such a somber, nervous way that we thought she was going to break the news that our dog died or something. Dramatic, much? Hold it together, this isn't life or death.The check was wrong on so many levels. They charged me for meat with my eggs, which I didn't get, and for a side of fruit (which could have replaced the meat), and extra for egg whites. My friend was charged for fruit, even though she plainly asked if she could sub potatoes for fruit. They accidentally brought her both, and charged her for both...It took so long to get our credit cards back that we thought we could sooner leave, cancel the damn cards, and get replacements in the mail before they'd return. After all of this, the food was just not good enough to get me back there. Ever. This place is a circus, and a poorly staged one at that.I found this place on Yelp when my husband and I were in the area for his job. I'm a total sucker for anything vintage so this place seemed right up my alley.As for the staff and the service I would give a total 5 stars for that. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She showed us the specials and never let our drinks get empty. I also would give the decor a 5 star. It's filled with old record albums from the 60's and posters from that era as well. If you visit the restroom don't let Elvis scare you! They also have a ton of board and card games you can play while you wait. How could you not like that?Now the food. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich that came on a buttery croissant. On the side I had their fresh made potato chips and coleslaw. I really liked the coleslaw! I'm very picky when it comes to this dish, but their version was yummy! (And was made with mayo! Yay!) I just wish I got a slightly bigger serving then a little tiny to go cup. The chips were huge, crisp and very tasty. The sandwich was good to, but just average. My husband ordered the "Rambo" Burger. It had a combo of chesses, bbq pulled pork and an onion ring. Which sounded delicious, but lacked flavor. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I'm going to have to go with a 4. The staff, service and decor are amazing, but I just was not that impressed with the food. I'm totally willing to go back and try it again. Hopefully I can update this review and give them the 5 stars I really hoped I could give them. Keep on going Rambo's Kitchen!I like the concept of Rambo's kitchen. Old school '60s diner with retro ambiance and bright colors. I love things that are loud and that stand out. Now the lack of execution with the food is why I give this a 2 star rating. The food doesn't stand out as much as the decor does. I've ordered many items from their menu and all have not left me wanting more. I've come to know of this place through my co-worker. Our doctor likes to order the fish and chips from here so we  do  order lunch here once in a while. Last time I ate here I had ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but unfortunately they decided to stop serving philly steak. They let me know I can have a chicken cheese steak instead. Ehhh.. I opt for it. Chicken was dry, bread was on the hard side, and fries wasn't crispy enough. I do love their ranch though. I can drink it like water. LOL.Their menu is kind of cluttered. There is too much going on. I don't know where to look first. I honestly would not eat here on my own pocket, but if the doctor wants Rambo's for lunch well I guess I have no choice. Any other day you probably won't see me here.Let's try to write another review since my last one was taken off for "personal attacks."I will keep this one short and sweet. The food at this place is very average. Without a groupon that gives you 50% off, this place would be very over priced for the quality of food one is served. The food averages around $10-$13 and although that may not be too pricey, I feel as if any random guy could cook the same quality of food. As the service goes, from reading other reviews it has come apparent to me that neither the owner nor servers are very nice. I don't like an owner who trolls on yelp to only dismiss and refuse to accept any bad reviews (the reason why my last review was deleted). I will not come back to this place to stand up for those who the owner has verbally attacked. In addition, the food isn't great and won't be missed.A wonderful "best of the neighborhood" restaurant that is probably the best kept secret in Spring Valley/Westside/Southwest . This is a self-described 60's diner. The ownership is local, the prices are friendly, the staff is motivated, and the food selection is immense. "Why is this place not on blast? "   Every helicopter parent and their Charge D'or should be here both days! "Mini Doughnuts" $2 for 6, $4 for 12. This is the utmost of comfort food: Caesar Salad $8 (add Chicken Breast grilled or breaded for 4 more)Brilliant people, brilliant concept, brilliant motivation, great prices. Why aren't you here? :)Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entrée was unacceptable in quality. FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that "the system" did not "allow" her to give any "discounts" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. His response? A defensive, "Well that's just like, your opinion." Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's "not afraid of bad Yelps" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he "doesn't give discounts."In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he "could comp the whole thing, whatever."  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.EDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 "filtered" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and/or food as well.

If you are not staying at The Quad, odds are you will never find this place. Access is via a narrow escalator and you may chance on it if you are watching a show donwstairs. The place is awash in a red glow (lighting) with surfboards hanging from the ceiling and a spacious drinking area out front. The menu is typical - tacos, quesadillas, burritos, ensaladas. It was not busy on a Friday night, and mostly families and older couples were in the restaurant.But we stayed because one thing caught our eye: $1 margaritas ($2 if you get the strawberry one). All night. No limits. Even on weekends.No lines and easy drinks? I am set. The long drive to Las Vegas began to fade away after the 1st couple of sips. I'll make do with the acceptable food.

Stopped by for Lunch and had a Johnny Sack (Hot Capacola, Sharp Provolone, Prosciutto, Lettuce, and Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil) $8.49.  One thing you should know is that most of their Sandwiches are made with their signature "Hard Roll", which is hard Italian Bread.  If you don't like Hard Bread, you may not enjoy this place.  I think they offer other Bread, but I'd call before you come down here.This was my 2nd time trying the Johnny Sack.....damn, it was good!  So good, I'm upping my rating for this joint to 5 Stars.  The kicker for me was the Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil....wow, that Sweet/Sour flavor brought out the flavors of the Meat & Sharp Provolone....what a great combination of ingredients!  The Johnny Sack didn't have that the last time I was here.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Will I return?  Don't be silly....of course!

Restaurant name  Robbie Fox's Public House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My experience at Robbie Fox's Public House varied greatly from my experience at the lesser known Robbie Fox's Private House (invitation only).At the public house we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  We enjoyed the pub atmosphere.  I had the fish & chips (as I often do).  I was pleasantly surprised by the fish. It was nicely battered, thick but not too heavy.  The fish itself was done just right, flaky but tender.  There's nothing worse than chewy, overdone fish.  The "chips" were actually skinny or pencil fries, not what I expected or prefer with fish.  I prefer the thicker cut, more traditional chips.  I also enjoyed a 90 schilling.  Service was good throughout the meal.At Robbie Fox's Private House (you have to ask a server for the password to gain access to the secret entrance) I had quite a carousing time and the Irish Whiskey flowed like water. As a matter of fact, when I requested water in a futile attempt to stay hydrated and avoid a hangover, several drunken blokes at the bar turned and shouted that I had a face that would "drive rats from a barn."This of course led to a lively but short lived brawl that degenerated into Irish drinking songs.  All was tilting along fairly well then until a gnarly old hag slipped on bangers & mash that had been slung over the bar during the earlier melee.  When not a soul sprang to her aid immediately, she launched into such a profanity laden tirade that even the most jaded of drunkards about lost their ruddy color momentarily.I pulled Macklin O'Shea away just afore he mistook her for  the head in his drunken stupor and the last thing I heard her shout was  "May the cat eat you and the devil eat the cat!"I'm not sure if Robbie Fox's Private House is even open anymore but the Public House certainly is and I would recommend it for fish & chips and a bout of drinking.I like!!Great night life to it!! Really nicely designed inside and super nice bartenders as well !!! :) New top favorite on Mill Ave for now!!!

Review Text :
The reason why I am giving this place a 1 is over exceeding it. It should be a negative 5 star. My friends and I usually come here all the time since they live across the street. And my friend walks up to the bar and asks a simple question regarding a beer to see if there was a difference and the bartender replies "well obviously it's fucking different" with an attitude and the server stated that we should not go to the bar since she is our servicer. So does that mean you're not allowed to go to the bar to order drinks if your sitting down? The customer service from the bartender is terrible. His name is Mikey. That's just so rude for him to be a smart ass. We will never come here again!This PT's location is quite popular with my previous co-workers, and I've been here a few times to attend late-night going away parties. Located off Centennial and Losee, PT's Gold is a solid local's bar. The bar is updated and always has plenty of seating. It's never smoky in here and the people that come here are the relaxed, quiet variety. My get-togethers here usually are timed perfectly to coincide with PT's Late Night Happy Hour, which runs everyday 12AM - 2AM with half-off drinks and select $5 appetizers. I've never had the food here, just beer! On my recent visit I enjoyed a humongous draft of Heineken for only $4 (HH)! Service is great here, even with a large group of people. I'm sure I'll be back for another bon voyage party.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #189

Restaurant name  Raising Cane's

Review Text :
I've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.Since I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.After a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!I munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.Will I return?  Probably not....it just didn't "Wow" me.Raising Cane's never ceases to satisfy my hunger!! I usually get the box combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips & fries, a piece of toast, secret sauce and cole slaw (you can substitute the slaw for another piece of toast =D, which I always do!)The toast is the best part to this boxed combo!! It is perfectly buttery with a crunch on the outside, and soft and delectable inside! Best bread you will have in a lifetime!The sweet tea & ice is also pretty great!! Eat there so you can enjoy unlimited refills! HAHA =)Raising Cane's just raised the bar for chicken strips to heights I never fathomed reachable for this familiar finger food.Chicken strips, chicken tenders- call them what you will. The name won't add any juice or flavor to these boneless pieces of white meat, coated in bread crumbs then deep-fried to mask their dry texture and dull nature.Ironically, in the middle of the parched Nevada desert, I found the moistest chicken strips I've ever had. The chicken was coated in a crunchy cover of breading and broke apart lightly. It came with an orange-colored, slightly tangy secret sauce that might have been some house version of thousand island. The crinkle-cut fries were cooked medium to medium-well, slightly crispy on the outside; ordinary, but they fulfill their purpose as a filler. The Texas toast was a unique surprise, a thick slice of buttery brioche slightly toasted outside while fluffy as feathers on the inside. The menu at this small fast-food chain from Louisiana is simple: 3 pieces (The 3 Finger), 4 pieces (The Box), 6 pieces (The Caniac), or 3 pieces inside a Kaiser roll (The Sandwich). All come with the toast, fries, and a drink; the 4 and 6-piece combos also have the addition of coleslaw. I got the 3 Finger Combo which was a good-sized lunch. For 6 bucks and some change, I learned that chicken tenders can be tender, and that food can be fast and affordable and still fit the bill for great grub.

Review Text :
Yelp has a dearth of Scottsdale reviews on fine dining. So it stands to reason that places with only a small handful of 4 or 5 star reviews are met with a bit of skepticism. I wasn't too sure what to expect as we headed into Talavera. All I knew was that it was at the Four Seasons, so we could expect it to be pretentious and expensive. But would it be good??A resounding YES. This place was hands down the best dinner we had our entire 4 days there. My monstrous rib-eye was cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. It did not even need the smattering of gorgonzola butter that came with, I would have easily devoured this beauty all on its natural own. My husband's duo-lamb specialty was eaten with great reverence, and that plate was almost licked clean.A sweet, electric pink prickly pear blended margarita was a nice surprise in a fancy atmosphere that looked like it was made only for expensive wines. Try the Olive bread with the gorgonzola and red pepper spread. Skip the sides if you don't have the room. The ham mac n' cheese was good but I've had better. The charred corn was good, but again, I've made better. Save your appetite for the main event.The view here is simply astounding, there is no other way to say it. See my photo. If you are evening dining, you absolutely must sit outside, hopefully along the glass wall to get the best view of the grounds and valley.My steak was so good that I didn't even save room for dessert, which is virtually unheard of if you know me. Nevertheless, our tireless and friendly waiter presented the check with two little cheesecake bites on a stick covered in a shell of white chocolate. A perfectly sweet end to a fabulous pre-Anniversary dinner.Oh....and the only thing pretentious was the people sitting next to us demanding their wine, proclaiming their unhappiness, and denouncing our extremely harried (yet competent) server. Seriously, again...what is up with all the bitter people vacationing in AZ??Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third. Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? Misc:Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

Nachos as big as 5 Yelpers faces!On a Yelper Nacho-crawl, we ended up here. My first question was 'why had I not been here sooner?' Y'see, I was a total wee mini mosher in my day. I only didn't go to SOAD concerts for fear of being literally crushed in the mosh pits. I rarely indulge that side of my any more, but when I step into a bar and hear some good rockin' tunes on and some really ace staff who are friendly but chilled out, I feel at home.A group of 10 of us descended to feast upon their epic sized nachos. I thought I had seen big food before. But nothing compared to the big nachos. For £10.95 they say they'll feed 3 - 4. Ha. I'd reckon 5 - 6. The photos don't do them justice. Literally the biggest mound of nachos I have ever seen, heaped HIGH with chilli, and sour cream and guac. Cheese (really really GOOD cheese) melted across almost every layer. We ate for 20 minutes and it looked like we hadn't made a dent.As David S said, Man V Food proportions. I can normally eat a hefty amount and feel fine, but I actually had flashbacks to being 5 years old and giving myself tummy ache from eating just a little too much.Great value, and not scrimping on quality. Good beers and cider, friendly staff, and a kind of chilled out rock bar (rock music and rock staff, but not super loud music or super exclusive).I'll definitely be back.

Seriously folks, I'm not messin' around when I say this is one of thee best meals I've had in the Burgh!  Forget that they're all vegetarian, forget that it could potentially be "off the beaten path" in Homestead, just remember to get your booty there fast!Everything from the cute little ambiance (hello back courtyard in the spring!), the adorable owner and the scrumptious food... I just couldn't get enough!  To start I ordered the Pumpkin Martini.  When I think Pumpkin drink, I'm thinking creamy, but this was light but spicy and all around delicious with a cinnamon rim.  For an app we ordered the brie plate with fresh fruit on top and an ah-mazing loaf of bread that just HAD to be house made.  I really wanted to gobble the entire loaf down, the ENTIRE!For dinner I ordered the risotto in a portabella cap on a bead of greens. This sounds like a simple dish, but it was anything but!  The risotto was creamy with a light texture of what I believe was cheddar and possibly parm cheese.  The cap was grilled to perfection.  But the greens...something you'd almost toss on as a garnish, were cooked to perfection with a delicious lemon garlic sauce.  WOW!  I almost wanted to as how they cooked it because I wanted to recreate it at home (even though I knew I probably couldn't, let's be honest!).  Everything.  Just... WOW!  Toss in the half off shots when the fire bells alarm and we had a magical evening at Tin Front.  Oh wait, add one extremely friendly owner and you've got an amazing restaurant.  I will most certainly be back...maybe like tomorrow!I am so very disappointed with my visit to Tin Front Cafe today. So much so, in fact, that I am writing my first review.My friend and I stopped in for a late lunch. After an incredibly awkward exchange with a woman who we weren't even sure worked there, we were sat. The same woman, who we now know to be our waitress, brought us water and a menu. We sat for fifteen minutes, watching her sit at the bar and chat with another gentleman. After getting her attention, we gave her our order, which amounted to two cups of butternut bisque and two grilled sandwiches. Twenty minutes later, our soup is up. The chef rings a bell and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. After some time, the man sitting at the bar gets up to bring us our soup. We ask for silverware, we ask for napkins-- he brings them to the table after searching behind the bar reluctantly. We still aren't sure if he worked there.There is a hair in my friends soup. We wait, still no waitress.She comes back into the room and looks at our full bowls. This is after another ten minutes. She approaches our table and says, "You can't finish your soup?" to which I reply, "There is a hair in her soup." She asks "Where?" and we point, still floating in the bowl. She then says, "I don't see it. You must have better eyes than me," as she proceeds to take the bowl to the bar and find her glasses to search for the hair. Working in the service industry our whole lives, we are both mortified. She comes back to the table with the bowl and tells us she found it. No apology, no other acknowledgement, just "Well, what's wrong with your soup then?" I explained I wasn't interested in my soup after finding the hair. I explained I would gladly pay for it, it just wasn't appetizing to me anymore. She disappears again.At this point, we have waited an hour for two grilled cheese sandwiches and have been treated like we weren't supposed to be there. When she reappeared, she called to us from the kitchen window, "Don't you want your sandwiches?" as the bell rang. She brought us our lunch, and said "Remember when I told you it was shift change?" We were so confused what that had to do with us, or the hair in our soup, or her general rudeness. At this point, we were both very uncomfortable, so I went to the bar to request our check and a couple of boxes. She proceeded to tell me that they make everything fresh and that's why it takes time, and asked "Have you ever been here?" I told her that I had been here quite a few times and couldn't wait to bring my friend in, but that this was unlike any other experience I have ever had. It was the single most awkward encounter in a restaurant I've had. We don't particularly care about the wait for the food, it was the fact that we were treated so poorly, as if we were inconveniencing the employees by supporting their business. Needless to say, I will not be visiting or recommending the Tin Front Cafe in the future.

Caminero is like my mistress. I wake up thinking about you. You make me happy and never judge me. You don't get mad when I cheat on you and when I come back into your arms feeling guilty you give me a big hug. I can even bring my wife around you, although I here she is now making solo visits and not letting me watch.My latest hug was the Chorizo Breakfast burrito. Its the best I've had. Perfect blend of cheese, chorizo and eggs. The hug before that was the chicken taquitos, which might I say are hand rolled and very meaty, not from a box like that ugly whore "Berto" down the street.See you soon my love.

I usually like Rivas and have ate there frequently but today KILLED it for me!!! I buy 4 entertainment books a year because my family and I LOVE to eat out, so being extremely hungry my sister and I went there today to order some food and went to use our Internet coupon from Rivas that we had JUST PRINTED!!! Some rude ignorant lady tells me that it's a fake coupon and she won't take it. I tell her we have used them before and there is a validation code on it and if she thought it was a fake call the number and validate it. She basically called me a liar and refused to do it.... THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS FOR GOOD!!! Juanita you need a better attitude and you could use a lesson in English as well!... My husband is hispanic and I am no where near a racist but if your going to conduct business you need to be able to properly understand and listen to your customers!

Yanni's Gyros impressed me. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and let me just say, holy sh!t that thing was f'ing huge! It was packin! I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it. Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)I don't get the hype.. When compared to some of my favorite Greek/Mediterranean places such as the The Greak Greek, this place falls short...way short. This is the first Greek restaurant in which I saw Tapatio sauce on every table. Maybe I am behind on a new food trend, but Tapatio sauce does not scream Greek to me, it screams "run!". I ordered their every day special combo consisting of the traditional gyro wrap with a side of garlic feta fries and a sparkling water for which I was charged additional $.50. After tip this came out to be around ~$15. I don't mind splurging if I feel the food and quality are worth it.The wrap was BLAND...now I get why there was Tapatio sauce! They were so stingy with the Tzatziki Sauce and the meat had no flavor. The fries were nothing like the feta fries at The Great Greek.. they were some  weird fusion with a buffalo style sauce on them. I was starving and pregnant so I finished most of my meal..not like it tasted bad..it just didn't taste like much of anything. The quality of the food does not warrant the prices charged. There may have been a change in ownership, because I refuse to believe that this place is an overall 4 star rated places.

A New Mexican restaurant in AZ? This made me think of my best friend who lives in NM. =)I came here with a friend last night for dinner since she's been dying to come here. I think everything deserves a four star. I ordered the Pasta Hedi which was amazingly delicious! It's a pasta that comes with chicken on top of a tortilla. The sauce was sooooo yummy. I'm really into pasta so I really loved it. It also comes with a house salad which I thought was really good and very good size portion. I had to split it with my friend. We washed everything down with margaritas. I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita which definitely satisfied me after a long day..You have to try it! The service was also very good. Our server always came back to make sure everything was to our liking. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It's a great date spot.  The only reason it doesn't get a four star from me is because it's a bit pricey. Between the both of us with our entrees and drinks the bill came out to about $60. That and it's pretty far from me. I wish there was one on my side of town. But you get what you pay for! I'll definitely be coming back for that pasta and margarita again! Plus their brunch menu also looks beyond yummy and something that I'd like to try out. =)The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.I agree with everyone on here who said the food is great but management sucks.  We went in with a gift card we got for our wedding with the person who gave it to us and other friends.  It had never been used and should have had $60 on it--the server came back and said it only had $18 when we were paying the bill.  My husband wanted to handle it discretely because we were with a group, so he paid the server and spoke with the "manager" (stupid--he should never have paid until this was resolved).  The guy who bought it pulled up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid $60 and we had never been in there--so there was definitely a "mistake" made by the employee who sold it.  The manager did not know what to do and said he would talk to their computer guy when he came in later--it's been 5 DAYS now and no resolution, not even a phone call from the manager to let us know he's on it.  We have had  to call several different managers who all play dumb. I'm sorry, but this is theft--selling an $18 gift card for $60--and poor management for not handling it seriously. Too bad because we had a great brunch but I don't trust the honesty or the competency of people there. DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.Update: Filed a complaint against this company with BBB and Attorney General's office.Place is bomb dot comMust visit when in PhoenixIn my top five joints Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!Wow. Do not dine here. Please let me list the reasons why... Made a reservation three weeks in advance for a seven top reso for a bunch of Chicago 20 something's in town to go out and have a great night in Phoenix. Our server was non existent throughout our entire dinner... Our plan was to dine... Translation, spend money! No one was served more than one cocktail. When asked what to order, we were answered with; everything is good. We relied on one girl who has been here before to walk us through the menu. Food came out staggered, and when the food arrived, we asked the food runner (who was clearly the rude host with short spiked boy hair) which entree had meat and which had cheese... (We had a vegetarian in the group) she responded with, "I don't know, this is not my job" Okay, really?! As we are all completely done with this place, and parched because our waters hadn't been refilled on the 90 degree patio. I thought that I should just let the manager know about how much money they lost out on, and more importantly how neglectful his sever was. His response; I wish you would have told me earlier so that I could have fixed it. (Mind you, our entrees were still on the table) No, I'm sorry, no, let me send you dessert. No, apology or care for my complaint in anyway.... Talk about one, the server. Two, the host/food runner. Three, the MANAGER... Dropping the ball! Needless to say, we will never be back. We have now wrote this review, so hopefully other people don't go here. And lastly, to whom ever reads this internally. Find a manager who values the customer... And get a training program in place for all your other staff members who interact with the people who pay your bills.SHORT VERSION:MAJOR disappointment tonight.  Just paid $52 for 2 Pasta Heidi's (online menu says $22 each but they are now $24 each) from "Richardson's" when the EXACT SAME ITEM at "Rokerij" is $18.  Received horrendous service from Richardson's tonight.FULL VERSION:First off, it really kills me to write this.  My husband and I loved this place and met here often for dinner after work.  It's been a gem for us but I'm not sure we will go back after tonight.My husband ordered 2 Pasta Heidi's to go tonight for our dinner tonight.  Nothing else.  No sides, no drinks, nada.   It's pretty far out of our way for a to-go order (from our house) but we were craving this delicious dish from Richardson's/Rokerij big time so we were more than willing to make the trek.However, when my husband was about to sign for the bill, he noticed something felt off.  It was much more expensive than we normally pay.  He asked if the prices went up and the gal mentioned she wasn't sure, but that maybe it was because we had called the Richardson's phone number and not the Rokerij number. He then went to the Rokerij side and checked out their menu. Mind you, as many people who eat here know, there is a lot of carry over between the two.  In essence you can order many of the same items from one vs the other.  Heck, they even use the same font and menu layout!Sure enough, he was right.  There was a $6 price difference for the exact same item.  He asked about it and a male server said they had just had this conversation with management last week because it doesn't make any sense and people have mentioned it. My husband then walked back over to the Richardson's side and asked to speak to someone about it since it must just be a mistake.  Our meal was literally $12 more at Richardson's for no real reason.  After explaining the issue with the lady he was directed to (wish we had gotten her name) all she said "I don't know anything about that" and that "it is what it is" with a very condescending tone.  She neglected to offer any assistance to explore or amend the issue and smugly shrugged at him like he was crazy.For the record, if this were a mere couple dollar difference we wouldn't have bothered, but $12 is a pretty big difference.At the end of the day our experience was a seasoned patron's nightmare and it breaks my heart to share this story.If you absolutely must have the Pasta Heidi, save yourself some frustration and money by ordering it at Rokerij.Please see my photos for proof.  Both are menu screen caps from their website.   Both documents are dated 6.30.14, which indicates this is an issue they've probably known about for a while and haven't bothered to correct.This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm craving some good and fresh tasting New Mexican specialties. The flavors are out of this world and it will make your mouth dance with joy.Been to their other restaurants many times and always enjoy coming back. First got to experience this kind of treat at their older restaurant that mysteriously caught on fire. This place is a favorite of my boss and he usually pays. Nice!Love the Chimayo Chicken and on other visits order one of the Fish Specials written on the board. The appetizers are delicious and you can easily get filled up on them quickly. Really enjoyed the Green Chili French Onion Soup on my last visit. It had the perfect amount of heat for me and made me break a sweat.Service can be somewhat mediocre at times. Make sure to also bring a flashlight or have your smart phone app ready to go. It is ridiculously dark in there and can create a bit of a problem. You can always choose to eat outside at the bar or at one of the smaller tables.This is not a cheap and inexpensive dining experience. Then again it is not super duper crazy expensive. They do have valet parking at certain times so don't be surprised.Give them a shout out and get ready for some yummy flavors. You won't be disappointed. TOUCHDOWN IN MY MOUTH!4.5 STARS

They just opened so I will be gentle...My brother convinced our party of six to meet at newly opened Beauregard Food Co. for dinner this evening.  I actually wanted to try Calistro, but my brother insisted that this place was good!  He said he couldn't remember the name of it but that it's where the old Autostrada was.  Being the nice sister that I am, and always up for trying new places, I gave in.I arrived first, then Jared, and Joan... and twenty minutes later, in waltzed my brother with my aunt and uncle.  Typical.  Note to self: never trust that my brother will be on time - it still frustrates me every time!Luckily, we didn't wait on Zack to arrive before we ordered hummus with pita and a plain pita pizza as appetizers.  Joey, our server, was really sweet but I felt like the place was quite understaffed.  He was the only one really working aside from the kitchen crew. Once the rest of the crew arrived, we ordered more food and drink, but it took a really long time for the drinks to arrive and our orders came at different times.  We split three salads amongst the six of us and had a few orders of fries (sweet potato and regular) and two wraps.  The food was not amazing, but it was decent and moderately priced.  The sweet potato fries blew the regular crinkle cut fries away.Despite being full, Joey noticed that we were celebrating a birthday (Jared's), and generously brought out a box of Krispy Kreme donuts.  I later learned that the owner of BFC also owns the Krispy Kreme donut franchise next door... bonus for donut lovers!Overall, this place was A-OK - especially considering they just opened earlier this month.  I'd return eventually but I won't be rushing back immediately.  **If my brother convinces you to meet him there, take my advice and arrive fifteen minutes after the time you set to meet.

On the advice on Angela H. , we came in search of pie. The BF has been on a quest to try all the pie and this was stop number two. This was indeed some really solid pie. I like that their daily selection is quite big, have a special seasonal pie of the month and they have a larger rotating selection that can be special ordered if it is not currently in rotation. We came to take home a pecan and a boysenberry pie. Both were good. The boysenberry was perfect, pecan a little bit too done, but still pretty tasty. I'm not a pie person but those are my two choice pies and I think they did them justice if I enjoyed it enough to eat a few slices over a course of a few days and not get sick of it. Only caveat was that it was busy, hassle to go park and walk so we wondered if it was good enough to be going there. Apparently, it was enough to try again. This time though, we found a much easier area to park and came at a less busy time. BF never had rhubarb so we got one. Good as far as rhubarb, but in the end he didn't like rhubarb. It's always busy in here so I assume this is some great diner food and wonder how I've not ended up here yet  for a after drinks meal. I can only comment on pie for now and  this is some good pie!One day while my sweetheart and I were sitting and waiting for an oil change on our car I pulled up Yelp on my phone. I was just browsing my bookmarks for a reminder of places that I still want to check out. I pulled up Du-Par's and started reading a few reviews and I showed my boyfriend some of the yummy photos and said we have got to try their pancakes sometime!Ok we are hungry as we did not have breakfast or lunch yet so the car is done and my boyfriend is headed downtown and is taking me to Du-Par's! Yay! Mmmmm I love my spontaneous boyfriend he is so loving!My first impression upon walking into this restaurant was the pie case and what did I spot? A banana cream pie to purchase and take home oh yes! I asked the kind lady behind the counter to please set the pie aside for me as we were going to dine in. I have been looking for banana cream pie made from scratch for awhile I was a bit excited when I saw this beauty looking at me through the glass! It was delicious with real whip cream and a nice cream filling with real banana slices, mmmm!We start off with two of their famous shrimp cocktails! Those were very tasty and a nice treat to start our meal off with!We knew ordering pancakes were a must so we decided to do breakfast this day! We ended up ordering a short stack (2) pancakes to share and we ordered an avocado, bacon and jack cheese omelet, comes with hashed brown potatoes and your choice of toast to split between us as well. It would have been too much food if we both had ordered a main course and pancakes plus we both started off with our own shrimp cocktail.  The food is great! I loved the homemade strawberry jelly for my sourdough toast, I have never had anything that good! The pancakes were delicious, golden butter sweet magic in my mouth! Mmmm yum those were some pancakes to savor for sure!We really enjoyed every single item we ordered including my iced tea something so simple even tasted better here! lolWe will be back for sure! The prices are higher however the quality is worth it and this is not a place you go to everyday in my opinion. It will be a spot we go to from time to time when we want something special and have a bit more money to throw around.i love the old school ways of this wonderful restaurant. All around is great, the service, the atmosphere and the food is Amazing!My phone died so I was only able to snap a picture of our shrimp cocktail and my whole banana cream pie I snapped pictures of later from home. Mmmmm yummy!Thank you Du-Par's!Breakfast, old-school Vegas style at the Golden Gate Casino.  I've lived here for 20 years and never been to the Golden Gate until Yelp told me that I should go and check out the pancakes.  Esquire Magazine said they're the best in the nation--really?  As a fan of Babystacks Cafe, I felt like a traitor the first time I ate here, but they are really two different experiences.  There's nothing like parking at Binion's and walking through the Fremont Experience with the all the lights, the sounds, the drunks, and the smoke to get to the restaurant.  The Golden Gate this morning didn't seem as smoky, though, which was nice.  I brought my gal pal who'd never been there and although she doesn't like pancakes, she loved the bacon--weird.  I had the Hotcake Sandwiches special, which was two pancakes, 1 egg, and 1 slice of bacon. The egg and bacon were standard issue, nothing special.  The pancakes, though, were scrumptious.  Fluffy and full of buttter--very rich tasting.  I couldn't even finish one of them and I don't know why!  I still love the Cinnabun pancakes at Babystacks the best, but if you're a fan of buttermilk pancakes, get downtown and experience these for yourself.I've had this place bookmarked for sometime now after reading all the rave reviews from other Yelpers.  I'm in DTLV a lot and have no clue why I've missed this place, especially with all the great reviews.  Located inside the Golden Gate Casino in Fremont.  DuPars is tucked in the corner and is a rather small restaurant.  Since Golden Gate is small itself, DuPars is easy to locate.  As soon as I opened the menu, I realized something.  I've been here before and to be honest, I wasn't impressed with my first visit.  I remember ordering what I thought was a Ham, Steak, and Eggs.  For about $15, I thought that this is a fabulous price.  When my meal arrived, I asked the waitress "where the heck is my steak"?  Turns out that I missed read the menu.  For about $15 it was a HAM STEAK and eggs.  My mistake and since I was craving steak, my first turn out wasn't good at all.  This had to be over 3 years ago and I have since learned my lesson. This time I made sure I got steak and eggs the right way.  I got their NY Steak w/eggs.  These steaks are grain fed, but I really didn't notice the difference.  The steak was a little dry and the eggs were small in portion.  I swear I probably had one scrambled egg, it's that skimpy.  My meal was just okay and since I've had better for about the same price, I have to say I was disappointed.  There's plenty on the menu, but nothing that really jumped out to me. I thought the portions were small for the price.  The service was actually better than the food.  Attentive, drinks kept full, lines but quick seating, and easy check out.  Would I come back?  I probably would only if I'm in downtown already.  I may even bring up my rating after trying their pancakes, which is what they are known for.The menu said they were voted Best Pancakes in America, so I had to order them.  Then I realized the award was given by Esquire magazine.  Hmm... what do dudes who read Esquire know about pancakes?  I want a review from Fatties Who Don't Care magazine.  Or the Aunt Jemima Fan Club.  But from fitness-conscious, fashion-aware guys with jobs... I began to doubt my order.But dangit if the folks at Metro Mag don't fully grasp the meaning of pancake perfection.Du-Par's serves the best "hotcakes" (I miss you, grandma!) I've ever eaten in a restaurant, hands down.  Fluffy, rich, sweet-n-savory yumminess.  And because we sat at the counter (do NOT make me wait for breakfast if you want to keep all your digits), I saw one of the reasons why: a ladle of melted butter goes over the top of every order.  Now, that's using your pancake.The portions are large.  Order the short stack, and don't add on too many sides, or you will end up like the Mr. -- a sighing, struggling pawn in the war between his tastebuds ("eat it all!") and his stomach ("she's gonna blow, cap'n!").Breakfast was such a delight that we made friends with the fundamentalists sitting next to us -- even after I accidentally mentioned creationism isn't a real thing.  But as we were under the influence, we all just smiled right through it.  All hail the diplomatic powers of the pancake.Perhaps my problem is that no one at our table ordered the pancakes. Those seem to  be the big thing that most people are 5-starring.I gotta tell you, though, the omelete fillings are a awfully skimpy. They say there is pepperjack cheese in the Denver omelete. I didn't see a shred of cheese in mine. Perhaps I should've sent it out for forensic analysis. And if these were three-egg omeletes, they must've been pigeon eggs.I've enjoyed much, much bigger omeletes with way more generous ingredients, for significantly less than Du-Par's $12.50.  All four of our hash brown orders were burnt.There's nothing "wrong" with Du-Par's. But there's just not a whole lot *right* with it, either.My 100th review deserves to be a 5 star one! Congrats DuPars! I've been hearing about this place for a while now. Old cafe style in a run down casino?! I'm there! Not to mention the claim of the "worlds best pancakes" was a bit intriguing. My daughter, boyfriend and myself were heading downtown not sure exactly of our destination and I remembered this place. If you valet park at the golden gate, it's a simple walk thru the small casino. Otherwise park anywhere allowed downtown and find your way. The waitresses and decor somewhat reminded me of a Waffle House. So right of the bat I was happy. The breakfast and lunch menu had TONS of comfort food classics. Never in my life did I think I'd order a meatloaf sandwich, but I did and was so happy about it. The kid had French toast with blueberries and the boyfriend went with a chicken pot pie. And then of course as a table we ordered a nice stack of pancakes. The super sweet waitress actually stopped and asked if we were serious when ordering all this food. (Did I mention I also had a $3 shrimp cocktail?) Well be proud miss waitress cuz we killed it ALL. The pot pie needed a little salt n pepper, but THAT'S IT! That's my only complaint. Great food. Genuine service. Exactly how I would expect an old school, cafe, Waffle House, waitress in cute outfits- type of dive should be! Well done.Part I:  L.A.

Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the "bear claw" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.After our UYE hike at Red Rock Canyon, we came here to have some lunch.  I opted to skip breakfast foods and go with a Reuben sandwich with french fries.  The sandwich was good but it needed some more Thousand Island dressing a good Reuben has.I am upping my rating to  four stars because of the excellent service we got when our previous server went on break, quit, or whatever, and we got Elias.  He got me a cinnamon roll to go and made sure it was packed well in a styrofoam container and then put in a paper bag.  He was also OK with our group of ten getting singleton and doubleton checks.  It just didn't bother him and was part of his job.Now, the Golden Gate needs to validate parking tickets whether you have a slot card or not!  You earn enough from Du-Par's.  That's a deal breaker for me with much of downtown.We visited Du-par's on this occasion for Sunday brunch.  This restaurant does a wait line like a buffet, not a list, so we like to sit at the counter if it's available. It is easier than standing in line with no estimated wait time.  Plus the counter seats are very comfortable and you get a real diner feel.  On this visit, we only waited about 5 minutes before counter seating opened.  The poor hostess was seating people, bussing tables, cashing customers out, and dealing with pies, so we were glad to be one less group she had to deal with.Today we ordered several items to share.1. Blueberry muffin 4/5.  It was soft and flavorful, but the waitress nuked it a little too long.2. The short stack of pancakes 5/5 (I'd give them 10 out of 5 if I could).  These are the best pancakes I've had in Vegas.  They do something sinfully good that you only see if you're sitting by the counter.  They have a hot butter dispenser and the pour hot butter all over the cakes!  Holy cow is this amazing.  Don't tell my arteries!  They were served with warm syrup in a cute little pitcher.3. Denver omelet 4/5.  The omelet was light and fluffy and not gunked down with cheese like so many places do to ruin a good omelet.4. Traditional Eggs Benedict 4/5.  No complaints, just how eggs Benedict should taste.It's rare for me to place experience above food. When it comes to dining, the most important thing to me is what I put in my body. And the food here? It's a'ight. Solidly decent diner food. Omelets, pancakes (which are allegedly delicious), sandwiches, pies, eggs n' meat, etc. My Denver omelet was decent enough, with the size being the major plus. My turkey sausage links? Not so much. But what really seems to fit the bill here is simply the authentic classic diner experience. This is an old school coffee shop/diner in the exact sense. You walk in and are greeted at a cash register, there are vinyl booths and a long counter with fixed swivel-stools (also covered in vinyl), and uniformed servers cutting pies, buttering toast and pouring drip coffee into classic white diner mugs. It's something I haven't seen in quite some time, and I like it. I'm kind of on a weird diet right now so I didn't get a chance to try the much-lauded pancakes, but I saw quite a few come out and they looked great. So did the hashers (man I miss those). And everyone dining there (mostly at least 20+ years older than me) all looked like they were enjoying their ham-steak and eggs, pancakes, etc. Pluses include classic diner service, atmosphere, and portions. Food quality hits about middle here. I've had a lot worse diner food. So if you're in the market for a solid greasy-spoon breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is your diner.One night, I wandered the streets in a state of what can only be described as "hangry." I was in a foul mood since my dinner plans fell through for the night. I stumbled across Du-Par's and they won me over with the promise of pie. My corned beef sandwich wasn't fancy but it was good. I opted for a half sandwich so I could have a slice of pie later. The selection of pie is very good and has something for everyone. I had a slice of egg custard that was rich in flavor and firm in texture. I wasn't disappointed. It's a great place to chill if you're tired of the bustle of Fremont. the old time feel of the place is comforting in so many ways. It's quiet enough to have a conversation but has a steady stream of customers. Things pick up more late night.I knew I was going to like this place (inside the Golden Gate Casino) when I walked through the door and saw Fresh Strawberry Pie in the display case.  I've eaten here 3 times so far!  Thanks to Yelpers Sylvia, Nelson, Norm, Terri, Mel and Ric for their reviews or else I would have never known this restaurant existed! For my first meal I ordered the Famous Shrimp Cocktail,  the Beef Stew, a slice of Fresh Strawberry pie AND the Pie of the Month which was the Fresh Peach Pie. The beef stew was kind of bland, but the meat was very tender.  It came with a plain roll.  I tried it with the gravy, but it didn't help.  I tried the roll with the butter...oh yeah! ! The Strawberry Pie was great... mmm to fresh fruit! The Peach pie was made with wedges of fresh fruit. I think I was supposed to cut it with a knife, but I really enjoyed biting through the wedges of fruit. So happy that the peaches weren't mushy!On my second visit, I ordered the Ultimate Trio which consists of a half sandwich, soup or salad, and a slice of pie. I got the Corned Beef Sandwich which was a disappointment because it was cold and it was between 2 pieces of plain bread.  I needed mustard and mayo. They were out of the Beef Barley Soup (shucks), so I got the tasty (but mushy) macaroni vegetable soup. The Cherry pie was really yummy - but then, I like pie in general because it's too challenging for me to make.  I'd rather have someone else make a pie! Note: The Fresh Fruit Bowl that came with the meal, was super because of the intense flavor.  Fruits shipped to Hawaii just don't taste like this! For my third visit, I got the famous Pancakes and the French toast (which was recommended by the waitress - it was average) and the Corned beef hash with eggs & hash browns (just okay).  GET THE PANCAKES!  I was skeptical because - how good can a pancake be?  The fluffy, buttery goodness is WOW!  I'm sure it's because there's butter in the batter!  It's awesome! The place has a cozy, old fashioned feeling. The service varies, depending upon where you sit.  You won't get much attention if you sit at the counter and have a super busy waiter.  Just stick with the recommended dishes (Shrimp Cocktail and Pancakes) and you'll be fine!  I want to go back for the Lemon Meringue Pie and maybe the Blueberry Pie.  The other pastries look good, too...let's go!I think I made a few mediocre menu selections here. What were they? Glad you asked!The chicken noodle soup: Dare I say I'm a chicken soup connoisseur? You're damn right I'm a chicken soup connoisseur! Does that mean I'm picky? Nope. I give the benefit of the doubt and I know that not all soups can live up to my expectations, but above all else chicken in soup should never be dry. How is it even possible when swimming in broth?The French dip sandwich: A classic hangover meal for me and a pretty damn good gauge when it comes to diner food. Unfortunately this dip fell a bit short on a few levels. First of all, for around $12.00 I expected a little bit lager sandwich and it was easily consumed in 6-8 bites. How about some more dry meat? You got it! To round it all out they are stingy with the beef au jus, which mean you have to be stingy with the au jus. When it comes to French dips, I dip and I dip hard. Dainty dipping just didn't cut it. Expect this star rating to go up because I'm sure to be back with some better menu knowledge.

Stingray's grand opening was definitely a scene... it was packed but isn't that what grand openings are all about?  That night I sampled a few of their specialty cocktails, and I was not disappointed.  And when I was planning a girls night out tonight for my mom-in-law and I to go have dinner and see Sex And The City 2, I thought of Stingray... it was perfect.  We sat outside and while the view could've been better (they are doing renovations to the building nextdoor), the table was comfortable and the service was extremely attentive.  We started out with a seaweed salad and how could we not order drinks before the show?  Joanie had the Geisha A Go Go (watermelon infused vodka cocktail) and I went with a dirty martini... it was perfect!  We shared a few rolls - a futomaki, and eel, and a lollipop roll.  All were delicious.Stingray in Old Town is my go-to sushi spot, but it's so nice to now have an alternative for nights like tonight on the other side of town.  And a note about the parking - the first two hours are free... just validate your little coin and you'll be all set.  Enjoy!Miso happy.Miso love Biltmore Stingray.Miso love our lovely server.Miso LOVE the open decor, the soothing colors and the comfortable furniture. Miso happy.Miso love the Miso, the yellowtail nigiri, the dragon roll, the spicy tuna roll...miso can't even remember all the yummy sushi goodness I engulfed.Miso ready to go back.Miso happy!Stingray has an awesome happy hour and it is not limited to just the bar area. You can enjoy half priced drinks and rolls in the entire restaurant until 7pm. I went there yesterday and tried the lemongrass infused vodka (yum) and had a bunch of different rolls and the calamari tempura. While it may not be the best sushi in town it is more than decent and cheap, cheap, cheap.Great place to meet up with friends after work, but expect it to be crowded as more people learn about the smoking deal on happy hour.Ok......now this has been the best sushi spot so far since I've moved here!! The setup inside is good for a late night hang out in the bar section and the dinning area is open inside and outside. The sushi bar is decent as well. The service is solid. The hostesses at the front are really polite and accommodating. On Friday and Saturday nights it can get a little busy but the wait has never been to long. I've never waited for more than 20mins. The menu is pretty robust. They have a large selection of rolls and seafood dishes that are amazing.... I recommend the shrimp & scallop entree. You won't regret it. I have tried many rolls and non have ever been a disappointment. All in all I would have to say that this is the best sushi in town. If anyone can top this spot please let me know!! GO SUSHI!!!!!!

Ok, so this is right down the road from me, so I thought convenience!  Unfortunately, that did not save this place.1. menu is expensive.2. Food is alright, but not memorable in any way really3. The staff are pretty much worthless.  I went there 3 times... 3 times!  And each time they screwed up the order.  The girlfriend is vegitarian, and of course they still put meat in it, so she couldnt eat her dinner.  Then when we told them about this, they just said sorry and thats it.  The next time we went back we ordered churros, didnt get them, but they didnt forget to bill us!  Of course, when we called they said "ohh well come back and you can have them.  Yes I get that, I paid for them, but lets not go out of our way and go above and beyond... lets just make me waste my time and gas for your screw up... and then there was another time they screwed it up.So we have a rule.. 3 strikes and your out!  Would not recommend this place...

Review Text :
I love mom-n-pop type establishments. I love really good chili dogs, fresh-cut fries, gyros, and other sandwiches. I love it when the staff smiles and greets you when you enter the establishment. I love having a wide array of beverages to choose from, many of which are not available in most  food establishments. And I love it when you get all of these in a place where the prices are extremely affordable. What more can I say -- I love Rocket Burgers and Subs! And I love the fact that it is in my neighborhood.It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- *More Real Than The Original*...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  ...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.I feel like I made a new friend.Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.Their chili burger with cheddar is terrific! Their onion rings have a light cornmeal batter, so they're more onion-y and crispier than onion rings you'd find at most burger places. With one of their many kinds of root beer, this meal combo was fantastic. Love this place!Okay so I've said before that I'm a big fan of owner operated businesses, and small local businesses. This place is one of them. You walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about 250 different specialty sodas. All priced at a $1.89 and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers. One of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like. Very friendly and helpful!!!!! While I was there I asked a couple questions of the owners. One was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich? The guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good. Indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right. Needless to say my sandwich was well portioned. Rand H. and I both got a Large Ruben on Sourdough and split an order of fries. I really like this place for a lot of reasons, some of which I noted in my review. While we were eating I saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish.I must apologize to Norm , Daren and Iain for not listening to my favorite No Pho friends sooner.. Because I made a BIG mistake waiting to go here!! I will promptly make up for it by going as many times as possible this week!! I love this place , yup local owned with a sense of mom and pop goodness. Reminds you of back east...The soda selection is phenomenal and looks great on display as you eat. The Ruben is my new favorite , rye bread , juicy well seasoned pastrami, sauerkraut and light toasty goodness. Plus one had the Cheese steak that was really good except he opted for extra heat and I couldn't handle it .. but still great. Fries are fresh and plentiful ....one basket will serve 2-3 people . Go here Go here now ....and take a friend , let's not waste another moment.'There is no way we are going to finish all of this' This is what we told ourselves we stared at the sizable amount of food placed in front of us.  What possessed us to order two double cheeseburgers, fries AND onion rings?  We wanted them. That is why. I can see how easy it is to over-order at Rocket Burger. Everything looks good. Cheese fries with real cheese? Yes! Rocket (onion) Rings that magically and mysteriously aren't greasy? Yes! Tender, juicy burgers with lots o' cheese? Yes, Yes, Yes! Rocket Burger isn't fancy. It isn't a 'dress to impress' destination. In fact, it appears that maybe once upon a time it was a convenience store. Coolers line one wall containing a fascinating assortment of beverages, including one whole section dedicated to root beer, and one drink the owner admits tastes like 'tree'. Really, tree. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist! The charm in Rocket Burger is that it isn't trying to be something it is not. In fact, you can see the whole open kitchen area behind the counter/cash register. It is simply good food, prepared and served by friendly owners and staff. Oh and yes, we ate it all. :)Just had their latest creation - the chicken tender bites salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-ZBfr1BHvArFp1d6XH8jOQ?select=VQg07pVUi7ZiSTao92KkRg  It was mega-flavorful! I love that this is not a chain eatery; it frees them to be creative, so they keep coming up with delightful new things to offer.Never Ending This describes the choices of food and drink here. On today's menu was a small toasted California Club and a Black Cherry sodee-pop. Don't let the sound of small fool you either, it is huge! Crammed packed with turkey, bacon, tomato and sprouts. This is a sub to try!The staff including the owners are amazing. They have such a great selection of food and drink you can take your picky eating kid or a cranky grandad, both will find something to enjoy.Wowza!  This place is AMAZING!  Thanks to Paul V. I was able to try Rocket Burger many times and every time has been fantastic.  I had the Bacon double cheeseburger  with fries or cheese curds and it's so delicious.  The burger is greasy, cheesy, and has lots of bacon.  Ya can't go wrong!  The french fries are also good, especially the cheese fries.   Paul has ordered take out from here for me quite often as well.  The cheese curds get a bit mushy if not eaten right away so go with french fries if you have take out.  Whether you eat in or get take out the food is awesome!Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!Seeing is the name of this place is "Rocketburger", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........Rocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a "rocket sauce" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird "tang" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.Diet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!The guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back.Rocket Burger & Subs is a very casual and divey. You won't get the most high end burger in the valley but you'll get 100% angus flat patties that are prepared to your likening  and are delicious with several choices of sizes and toppings. Besides burgers they offer sandwiches, subs, beef hot dogs, soft serve, floats and the biggest selection of bottled sodas I've ever seen. Portions are very large and prices aren't much more than fast food. You are getting food that's MUCH Better than fast food.After watching RB&S on Check Please Arizona I went with what everyone else tried the popular NY Double Burger with fries. I liked that they carefully toasted the buns and the burgers were prepared medium just like I asked for and were juicy and tasty. A generous amount of tasty grilled pastrami and house made slaw and rocket sauce topped the burger. It was all good tasty and humungous and a giant amount of fresh cut fried potatoes were yummy too. Check out Rocket Burger!It's a Blast!Came here yesterday because I was craving a burger. This is definitely a no frills type of place.  8 or so tables with order at the counter service (they'll bring your food to the table when it's ready). Settled on the Cali burger and a vanilla milkshake.  While I waited, I browsed what seemed to be an infinite number of bottled soda selections.  They were categorized by what appeared to be flavor so you can hone in on what you're in the mood for.  Both of the girls working the counter were extremely pleasant.  My food (to go) took about 7 minutes from the time I ordered it.  Total for the burger(single patty, no fries) and milkshake was about $9.50.  Got home and tore that burger apart.  Man, that was good.  I liked the Rocket Sauce that came on the burger.  Think a ketchup/mayo blend with a ton of pepper for kick.  I didn't even need to put ketchup on the burger.  The bacon was crisp (score!) and the avocado perfectly ripe. The buns they use are also on point.  Definitely more "sturdy" than a traditional bun (it reminded me of challah bread).  I saw a couple other burgers I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back and bring some friends along.

Review Text :
The only reason I'm giving this an extra star is because I didn't get a chance to try their food. I'm keeping an open mind.This place was listed under "late night food" at the Mandalay Bay's selection of restaurants. We arrived at 12am expecting to satisfy our hunger after coming back to our hotel. Their "late night" menu only runs from 11pm-close, which was at 12am. Not only do you get only 1 hour to eat your food, but doesn't late night usually go until at least 2am??Also, when we arrived at the restaurant, there were no workers on the floor, so we decided to seat ourselves. The TVs were all still on and the small place still had quite some tables eating their food. I figured they were just a little busy, being that they had "late night specials". When a staff member finally spotted us, he didn't say anything. We had to ask if we could get menus, only to find out that the restaurant had already closed.They need to make a "WE ARE CLOSED!" sign.I have found my new spot! I really wanted to give this place 5 stars I really did! Our server was terrible :(OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I'm totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called "The Romance".We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.I had the "Enchiladas Suizas" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.My man had the "Beef Fajitas" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.My mans Dad had the "Chili Relleno"  and this cost $16. He really enjoyed it.I totally recommend this place to anyone who loves margaritas and great Mexican food!!!!!When I heard the name "Hussong's" I thought it was some type of Chinese restaurant. But paired up with the name "Cantina" threw me off as it's actually an Americanized-Mexican resto within the Mandalay Bay Shoppes. PERKS+ great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys)+ gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the "Bull Dog" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria+ FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu)+ CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!DIRTS- prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more)- noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers- not authentic- mediocre drunk grubFYI*located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor*you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all*laundry list of margaritas are available *drinks range from $8-14*many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game *Rick Moonen's "RM" restaurant is just around the corner for sustainable seafoodI came here with my co-workers for a little get together after a meeting. I'm not sure if I'd eat at this establishment again. But for great service, good drinks and mediocre food, it's okay, but probably not my first choice.Maybe I just had an usually smooth experience here, but I loved it! I fully expected it to be douchey as hell, based on the whole marketing B.S...but I was really pleasantly surprised and will be back!My experience was around 8pm on a Wednesday evening, we were seated immediately at a good table, the service was EXCELLENT and very attentive, and what I ordered was fantastic!I had the huarache, which was fanTAStic. The meat was seasoned well and everything just came together perfectly. Even the chips & salsa they put out are amazing...some of the best tortilla chips I've had at a Mex place.My friend had the carnitas platter, which he wasn't thrilled with but said it was OK. And we shared a pitcher of margaritas. I think the total tab was $70...not too bad, seeing as we had 3 small margaritas each, plus food.This is an ok optional for a casual lunch. The service was ok as was the food. The place is deep and narrow with a long bar on one side. The decor is ok.The chips and salsa they bring out is ok. The chips were crispy and the salsa had ok flavor. For my meal I ordered the steak stacked quesadilla. You get a good sized portion. It should fill up most people, especially after snacking on chips and salsa. I would have liked the steak to have better flavor. It certainly could have benefitted from some seasoning. The chipotle aioli inside does make up for the bland flavor of the meat. None the less, the meat should stand on its own if needed.Our server was ok. She came around with good frequency but made a few small mistakes with the orders. Overall it was an ok experience.Yum! Since I'm at MB often I always come here for lunch. I frequently get the mango habanero guacamole XTRA HABANERO! And it never disappoints. Home made chips and a side of habanero sauce how could you go wrong? The veggie tacos and the Mexican street corn are equally enjoyable. I haven't been able to enjoy a margarita yet but I've heard they're amazing. Shout out to the manager Chad! He's awesome.

Review Text :
It always nice to be one of the firsts to see a new restaurant, nightclub, bar, etc.  Especially because the service is typically great, everything is shiny & new.  And the enthusiasm of many familiar faces is felt from the moment you walk in.   RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.  There was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.There are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for "The Place" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)My girlfriends and I ventured into RnR last night for their first night open.  What a gorgeous building and warm atmosphere.  RnR is going to be the perfect spot for day drinking (due to their abundance of outdoor seating).  My favorite structural aspect of the decor was the wine wall - you can't miss it.We didn't sample the menu items, just the cocktails.  The cocktails were great - an unusual selection of specialty cocktails. The menu has a a variety of selections without being overly pretentious. I can't wait to visit again to see how RnR settles in.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great place frequent for lunch and for nights out.OK, this is not a food review. ...let's start with the good. Great space, beautiful, modern industrial space, good outdoor space. Well, that ends the good. So, on a Sunday before a spring training game I showed up hoping for a fun brunch before some work. After checking in and requesting the "rare" and unavailable breakfast menu, we were seated on the upstairs patio...and then the wait began. And...we waited...and waited...and wait, that table over there apparently has a server. Oh apparently he isn't our server. OK, well the table behind us complained. So, that table got a "well I'm not your server but I am helping out."  So...20 minutes in, hmmm, maybe this place can't plan for the reality pre-game Giant's game, or maybe they think this is Suede or some other "club" where people come in despite the horrendous lack of attention to detail and service...but hey, we can wait a few minutes longer...but should we need to wait 20 minutes? OK, let's go to the bar. WHOA! All the waiters are hanging out around the computer entry system..."Umm, dude, what's the code for water?" Ummm, hey, there are 6 of you here, how about serving some tables. I'm no expert, just a suggestion. Let's leave. So...I can't speak to the food, but a good source tells me it matches the service. Disappointing at best! Please don't waste that building!  Either get your act together or hand over the space.  Scottsdale is full of wannabes...it doesn't need another.We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again." He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcoholHonestly my lunch was just okayHonestly they have a drink called the stigmataHonestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hypeBut, I am supposed to be honest.This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. What I paid for this was ridiculous.The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.The food was meh.Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!In my opinion, Sunday Funday should always start off with a bottomless mimosa brunch, and RnR is just the spot to do that. For $10, you can get all the mimosas or Bloody Marys your heart desires and your liver can handle from 10am-2pm. Our party of five must have averaged 7 per person. Key word is "averaged." There were two in our group (who shall remain nameless) who probably pounded at least a dozen.The food was really good! I'm not really sure what the whining is all about from a lot of the other reviewers. I loved my pork hash and maple bacon scone (genius), and my friend's grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, brie and sun dried tomatoes and side of sweet potato tater tots (even more genius) were delish! Obviously, service was amazing, as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long. We had fun being rowdy out on the patio, which is an ideal spot on a nice sunny day. Happy hour specials (daily 3p-7p and reverse happy hour W-Th 10pm-2am) are awesome. Make sure you follow them on FB as well, as they're always announcing other specials.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6 other times because I tried to give your restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and I will not return. Despite one experience with good service, there have been six other times when I have had  incredibly awful service. That's not a good ratio and at this point, I just can't justify coming back nor would I recommend RnR at all.My most recent experience sealed the one star review. First, there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us. We sat ourselves. Then, we sat at a table for about 10 minutes. No waiter to be seen. No one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons. Ah ha! Next, we spot a waiter. After inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter was/if they were closing or something (trying to give them benefit of the doubt) the waiter looked at us begrudgingly, gave us a half eye roll and said, "I guess I can serve you."Well, after that remark I just wanted to get up and walk out. But I stayed (a decision that I now regret) only to experience more poor service. We needed more drinks, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and I know my order wasn't being taken or put into the computer... instead it looked like social hour. Unprofessional. This is not the first time that I have experienced inattentive and no-where-to-be-seen service at RnR, and I guess I should have known better. I don't even think my request to be seated so that I could have a waiter take my order was THAT outlandish.I work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some "RnR" on the weekends. So, with lots of other places (like AZ88, Old Town Tavern, Mabel's on Main, Firehouse, Pattie's, The Lodge, Geshia-A-Go-Go, and the list could go on) where I can count on being served... by an actual live body nonetheless... who doesn't even make me feel like they hate me just because I walked through the door... there's no reason to come here.It was especially awful to be treated so poorly when I'm a Giants fan, and my team's flag is hanging out front of the establishment!! I'm going to pass on anymore of this place's "RnR," as I'm pretty sure it actually stands for "Really Rude" service.Bumpe up to a 4.  this place deserves it!  Tots Fun.  Tots Cool.  Tots The SHIZZLE!"Dirty Bits... Dirty Bits.."  *singing*  whenever I pass this restaurant, I think of that song by the Blackeyed Peas "The TIme -- Dirty Bits" because this restaurant has these awesome Dirty Chips!   Homemade chips with blue cheese, bacon, cheese... Yums... I usually love them.I like RnR for 2 reasons... Dirty Chips and Sunday Brunch/Day Party.  When I have friends in town, this is the place we skip church to go to for food and bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's from 10-3pm.  If you have these type of friends in town, this is a cool place to go for brunch and bypass the snooty brunch locations in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  RnR has the craziest hours of a restaurant like this... 8am - 2am.  Yes folks... I have gone here after a night out for those Dirty Chips.... Dirty Chips. *singing*A DJ starts around 10ish.  If you have a large party, make a reservation.  Get there just before 10 to avoid the crowd.This place calls itself a Gastropub, but I wouldn't.  I think of it as a cool local bar eatery.Return Factor: 100%.RnR is a great place to grab a drink and take in a game. Stopped in here at 10pm on a Saturday and the bar was in full swing. The bartenders are wicked fast, they had to be keeping up with over 100 thirsty patrons and the service was as impeccable as it was speedy. There was also a great mix of people and the male to female ratio was perfect. Something you normally would never see at a bar like this. I really enjoy the floor plan of this establishment as it opens up to the street providing an airy feeling without losing any energy. The drink prices were very reasonable as well, a trend I noticed throughout Scottsdale. Maybe it is that OC/LA is that damn expensive? Your call.I also noticed they offer a full menu and will have to return on my next visit to AZ to sample their offerings. As a bar alone you get no complaints from this Yelper. RnR brings the ruckus!To be honest, I love this place. There's two different types of environments I've encountered here: Sunday morning and every other day/night. SUNDAYS:Now let me tell you, if you like to people watch, Sunday Brunch is the place you need to be. They do bottomless mimosas (or bloody Mary's), which is either 25 dollars without food or (I believe) 15 dollars with the purchase of an entry...which is usually 10-15 dollars. You might as well get the food! Also, they serve mimosas till 2. Be aware if they are having large groups come in, because when we got there right when it started, it was a 2 hour wait....but you can always walk in a sneak a place at the bar! No reservations there. Plus, I like the bar better. You don't have to worry about an extra wait time on your drinks because the bartender stands right in front of you, the second your drink is empty, you blink and BAM! Drinks are ready. They also have a DJ playing, loudly, so if you plan on sitting and having a nice discussion, go somewhere else. Everyone that attends Sunday brunch is very composed...until about noon. Then you have drunk ASU kid + every other type of person in their 20's dancing, then ordering shots and this is where the real drama unfolds. I urge you to check this out, because it is hilarious. The things I witnessed on my trip to the bathroom (which took 20 minutes trying to wiggle my way through the crowd) are permanently burned in my memory. Awesome way to spend the early portion of your Sunday. You know, if you aren't going to church. MON-FRIDAY:They have great drink and food specials. And their food is amazing. 3-7pm they do half of select drinks (with a great beer menu) and 6 dollar select plates... Dirty chips for the win! They also do somewhat of a reverse happy hour from 10-midnight it's half off ALL food and 1/2 off select drinks. If you want to come in and try their food without spending too much money, this is the way to go. And if you didn't get the memo above, their service is great. I always find myself talking to our servers at our table instead of just ordering. I think we've even invited them to sit down with us a couple of times. One time they did! Haha very down to earth staff, very approachable. There was one occurrence when we had ordered food and a pitcher.... After eating and finishing our beer, we didn't see our server for 15-20 minutes, we asked another server to bring us our bill if he got a chance, when he brought it buy us.. Our total was 0.00!! They said "sorry for you wait"... Now that is service!!! I think we tipped him the entire bill cost, but how awesome is that! FOOD SUGGESTIONS:Dirty Chips: (as an appetizer) it's bacon, ranch, bleu cheese, buffalo sauce and their house chips. It's Amazing. Taco Plate: (at brunch) you get 3 tacos: chorizo and egg (the best) potato and egg (tied for first) and bacon and egg. I want to say they all come with cheese too. Plus you get a side of potatoes.Chicken sandwich: now this isn't some plain chicken sandwich it comes with BRIE on focaccia bread with some type of aioli sauce and sundried tomatoes. Is is a heavenly sandwich for lunch or for dinner.Sorry this review is so long. I just love this place. Haha I hope you try it!

*sigh*Initally, I gave this place a 4 star review this morning, but I decided that I needed to be honest, and share an experience here that I had that initally I had wanted to leave out, but now i feel that I can't.  I wanted to ignore what *really* happened, as it's been bothering me more and more and more as the day has gone on.When I came here, the place was empty.  It was just 2 workers, and not a soul in sight.  Despite the food being good, the service here left me feeling angry and upset.  Here's why:The guy that seated me, (and obiously worked here as some form of staff member) made it his point to flirt with me non stop, so much so that it actually RUINED my experience here, and I don't know that I will be back.  He was so aggressive in his tactics, that he actually had the balls to pull up a chair TO MY table while I was trying to eat and enjoy my dinner.  Mind you, I was alone, and trying to enjoy a good book and some quiet time...and this douche ruined it.He sat with me through the majority of my dinner, asking me personal questions about if I was single, what kind of guys Iike, and other personal questions that I found grossly innapropriate.  I was so annoyed, that I actually had my dinner boxed up and left half way through, lying and saying that I had somewhere to be....just to get out of here.I found it rude, annoying, and downright disrespectful that a staff member at this establishment made it his personal playground, and taking it upon himself to not only hit on me, but spend most of the time sitting AT MY TABLE talking to me discussing things that I found grossly inapporpriate.Due to this experience, I will NOT be back to this location.  EVER.

Review Text :
11/09/10Was going to Whole Foods to buy a few staple items when I was hit w/ a craving for falafel.  Remembered there was a pita shop next door, so popped in after dropping some cash at Whole Paycheck.  (I actually am a fan of WF and am willing to part w/ some cash to get bread and organic uncured thick-cut bacon my system can actually stomach!)  Service was friendly, as always, and I even scored a whole piece sample of their delicious homemade walnut-filled baklava!  (It's topped w/ pistachios, so those w/ a mild pistachio allergy could just peel the top layers off, and you're good to go.  Believe you me, the remainder is well worth the $2 (or maybe less... IDK, I didn't pay!) you'll fork over for it.  :)The falafel patties were huge!  However, just like the hummus they're made w/, they weren't very flavorful, but I liked the crunch of the patties, even if they were on the dry side.  The extra sides of hummus and tahini didn't really add any flavor, but they helped to mitigate the low moisture content of the falafel.  I wouldn't buy another falafel pita here (2 stars), but the friendly employees, clean environment, and the complimentary dessert deserved an extra star!It's Tempe AZ... not Irvine or Laguna Niguel, and frankly, I was ready for Mexican. I really wasn't expecting a decent short list of Middle Eastern cuisine cafes. But yet, I found that short list on Yelp. Lucky for me, the yelp reviews for Pita Shack were all good. And even luckier, after driving into Phoenix around 630p, I was tired, but tired with an appetite. I lucked out..... fresh food, fair prices, and because I didn't give in to the burger joints from Indio to Phoenix..... I had an appetite. And... PS is only a couple minutes from the Embassy Suites, Tempe.This is a small shop, with a clean kitchen, and they cook everything to order! Don't expect fast service (although it isn't a long wait either)... because they're cooking from scratch, so to speak. While the falafel mix is ready to go, they form your falafels, and then put them into the fryer. Your kabobs are cooked to order. The only thing that was already prepared was the lentile soup, which was excellent!For a total of $24 with tax, I ordered the Combo Kabob Dinner with steak and chicken, rice, salad and soup, the 6 pc falafel appetizer, an "abundantly filled" gyro sandwich. While I'm not going to say the overall quality was better than our local Panini Grill chain, for a family run restaurant, I feel they're a very solid 4 star. My wife's side is Lebanese Brasilian, and I'm around spectacular Middle Eastern food on a regular basis. I even have my own hummus recipe... so for me to feel comfortable and satisfied with Pita Shack can be taken as a strong endorsement. When I'm in the PHX area on business, and if I'm staying at the Tempe Embassy Sts., I'll probably choose PS before any other local place.

Review Text :
After hiking out in the Sloan Canyon National Recreation Area, Grand China was my post hike lunch. I had used the Von's Shopping Center as the trailhead to access the Henderson trails leading into Sloan Canyon. Not too far from Von's but closer to BW3 is Grand China. I'd catch their lunch special.   The Grand China lunch special is a hot deal. Literally!  For $6.50 you get a choice of entree, either hot & sour or egg drop soup, fried rice, egg roll, and a beverage. You have to get there before 4.  The restaurant is more of the cozy than take out Chinese restaurant. It is a full service restaurant.  From the time I walked in to when I left, the service was good.   I ordered the beef chow mein lunch combination with hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup was hot and delicious. I am of the opinion that soup is their strength. A yelper and friend complimented my picture of the hot and sour soup saying it looks delicious. Terri. R stated in her review that the soup was good. Plus 1 for me. This encourages me to return to try their wonton soup. The soup was the strong point of the lunch. That does not mean the beef chow mein and fried rice were weak. Not the least. As a matter of fact the beef chow mein was good. But! The beef chow mein was not as good as The Lotus in downtown Henderson and the food was not as good as some of the local Chinese restaurants I dined in.   In conclusion, Grand China is not the best Chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. It is a good Chinese restaurant that features a reasonable lunch special.

Review Text :
Latkes and blintzes and pickles oh my!I just came from dinner here - best NY style deli in the valley.  I am thrilled and a little frightened at the implications of Chompie's opening 5 minutes from my office.I thoroughly enjoyed the crispy, slightly oniony latke (potato pancake) appetizer.  My chocolate phosphate was to die for.  Maybe not that good but it was spot on.My corned beef on rye?  Like buttah.  Oy like I need a great corned beef sandwich 5 minutes from the office.I loved the decor and the hustle and bustle the place already has.  Great NY scenes all around blended in with an open modern feel.Bonus wifi room past the deli counter.  Yes, you'll see me there with my laptop, coffee and some of that divine looking chocolate ruglach I saw in the case.Mazel tov to the Borenstein's on this great addition to the southeast valley!My first visit to Chompies and it was delish!!  So much to choose from on the menu it took me forever to decide.  My waiter was patient with me and offered up some suggestions.  I was bad, so bad.  I had a Monte Cristo Sandwich with fries.  While I waited for my food I took it all in.  I love the NY vibe, the walls with pictures of NY and all the great things about NY.  It made me want to get on a plane and take another trip to NY!!!  And there are several TV's to watch events.  This evening I watched the Mets play and sadly, they lost.  My sandwich was delish!!  Nicely dusted with powered sugar and the ham and turkey were excellent.  The fries were perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffly on the inside.  And my waiter checked on me several times which I appreciated.  I cannot wait to return and try more things off the menu.  I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous.  I took half home.  I am giving three stars for now but I'm sure I will bump it up after I've tried the  potato pancakes and the matzo ball soup.   *drool*The first time I ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I was neither friends nor family at that point (I was discussing a book event with Wendy), though in typical tribal fashion I was adopted by the Borensteins and made mischpucha (translate: family for the non-Yiddish speaking and goyem). Anyway, since that evening I've been there six or eight times. It's always terrific.Though I always order a lean corned beef on rye, I've had a number of things with family and friends. Everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food I ate since emerging from the womb. Though I will caution about the matzo ball soup; it has a sweetness I don't care for. We've had blintzes, latkes, fish, knishes... The list is longer but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Everything has been terrific.Same with the service. I've been treated very well every time I've been there. For good or ill there is now a Chompie's closer to my house. The jury is still out on which it is, I mean, nobody ever said a "latke a day keeps the doctor away." You know what I'm sayin'...No, honey, you're not in New York, Chicago, or L.A.See those tanlines on your thighs? Yes, you're in Arizona.Your backsweat confirms this.Out of the car, sexy. It's time for lunch.Nope. Definitely NOT Brooklyn.NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, "don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's" casual, sit-down restaurant. Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your "I only eat healthy chick food" waistline has a deathwish.What a way to go, ho!- fantastic soups of the day-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token    offering of lettuce- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast    hidden somewhere beneath- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY- pickles. On EVERYTHING.- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your    table, or at least one very fat man.- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?'Sactly.Oh, and mom called.She said f*ck your diet.The first time I heard about Chompie's, I was watching Travel Channel's Man v. Food and I saw Adam Richman taking on the Ultimate Slider Challenge in the Tempe location.  While I had no urge to try and stuff myself silly, the sliders sounded tasty!Chompie's is a casual eatery with a laid-back vibe.  It's not a date spot but definitely a great place for a quick bite and good times.  Some of my favorites are the Jewish Sliders, Greek Benedict, Mark's Monte Cristo, and the Western Sliders.  Don't forget to pick up some rye bread or bagels on the way out.  Yum!I hear they do a Valentine's Day special now.  Oh to be young and kosher...

Review Text :
So we were looking for an ayce sushi place on a Saturday night and called around to a few different places in Summerlin.  A lady answer the phone and said that their ayce is $20.95. Great price for the location! Well we get there and there is no one in the restaurant and upon further examination of the menu, it turns out their ayce is +$4.00 for Nigiri.  They don't tell you this on the phone and basically use the bait and switch to get you in the door.  After voicing my concern that I felt misled and lied to and requested they waive the $4, she came back and said the manager refused to authorize it.  We got up promptly and went across the street to Naka Sushi, which is not only cheaper but also had a better crowd and ambiance.  DO NOT GO. PRICES ARE MISLEADING AND MANAGEMENT REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.I was really excited to get AYCE sushi, I was not impressed that they didn't put how many pieces per roll so when the bill came and they tried to charge me a "left over fee" I couldn't help but feel cheated. It does state "left overs are extra charge" but who are they determine my left over ratio? Alas, I wasn't charged extra and they even didn't charge me for my Sale either.  Also we couldn't get the servers to go away to take our order and then we couldn't get them to come back for our check or to order anything else.Food: 3 starsMenu: 2 starsStaff: 2 starsReturn: nah sushi places are a dime a dozen here.I really don't know where to begin, I wish I could give this place 0 stars because that is what they deserve. The service I received here tonight was absolutely horrible and disgustingly unprofessional. My family and I decided to do AYCE (it was 7 of us). The waiter comes to our table to tell us to write our order down on a piece of paper, we kindly tell her that we know what we want and if she can just take the order. She writes down our order and gives us attitude because it's a big order, but it's 7 of us doing AYCE. Anyways, 3 of the same rolls come out, but we only ordered two, so we kindly tell her that we ordered only two and she visibly gets upset and tells us that we are wrong. She gets her paper where she wrote the order to show us; we feel bad so we just take the roll. The owner (she told us she was the owner) comes to our table shortly after to tell us we have to eat everything or she will charge us. When we asked for spicy mayo on the side she said that the rolls already have sauces on them. As we eat, my cousin tries to ask a waitress for a refill on his tea, but she says "hold on" and walks away never to return. Our waitress never returns for the rest of the meal. After about half an hour passes, we notice that half of what we ordered didn't come out so we ask the owner and she says that our hour long of AYCE time is up and that we cannot eat anymore and if we want dessert. We tell her that we are still waiting on food and she says we are wrong. We tell her to look at the paper in which our waitress wrote the order, AND BEHOLD, HALF OUR ORDER NEVER CAME. She tells us that we past our hour and we cannot eat more. We literally sit there and argue with her but it's going no where. When she brings the bill, we end up splitting the bill four ways. After about 15 min of them not returning, we ask about the payment and turns out they charged the wrong amount on the cards. It takes them 30 min to do the voids and charge our cards again. This experience was so ridiculous and horrible. I wasn't even full when I left and I will never come back here again. What a shame!!!

FINALLY!!! Hitting the streets of Las #Vegas the 1st gourmet @SliderTruck. I took part in their soft-opening event at the park on W Flamingo/Buffalo last Saturday from 11-2. What a great start!!When I arrived shortly after 11 there was already a good size crowd gathered and things were in full swing. Chuy and Ricardo the operators of the truck were real friendly and very personable welcoming everyone to try some of Las Vegas' Gourmet street food.There was a limited menu to keep it simple for the event and all items were ONLY $1 each so I ordered one of each:) Pancakes in Blueberry sauce-A Captains Order Slider and a Monte Cristo.The sliders were FANTASTIC!!! I wanted to make sure everyone got to try some or I would have went back for another half dozen "Captain's Order" Sliders!! :)The pancakes were great too, what I got to try the kid snatched them and ran off to scraf them down;)I really enjoy street food and hope to see the @SliderTruck succeed maybe even encourage a couple more trucks soon ;) I've already passed out 200 flyers in my neighborhood to get people out to try the @SliderTruck this Thursday 3/25 11-12pm. Come join us at 3100 W Sahara just 1 block West of Palace Station!!One word...pissed?I was so excited to go to the Slider Truck today after work - I am in the neighborhood....so I decided to walk!  Yeah, it is cold and windy, but I thought it would be worth it!  I stood outside at the street corner in the cold crazy wind for 45 minutes, and Slider Truck did not show.  I walked all around the area, but no truck.I just checked the web site, and it still says by UNLV 6-8, so maybe they have the wrong time zone?  Now I have no dinner, I am disappointed, and I have somewhere to be at 7.I hate when there is so much hype and then such a let down!!  What ever happened to punctuality?  This thing only operates a few hours a day!Sigh.UPDATE: thanks for everyone who sent me negative messages because of this.  I do not have Internet on my phone nor do I have the ability to stare at twitter or facebook at work.  I checked the slidinthru.com web site's weekly schedule and it never changed so let me update the review when I actually try it!  THANKS!  I promise my review doesn't affect you.The concept and marketing approach are awesome, guys that run it are great and I'm happy they're killing it in LV.  I'm sure they'll do so for a long time.  But this is pretty much a one and done for me unless I know they're breaking out some of the crazy looking specials they got on their site like the montecristo.  Being 10th in line when they opened and having to wait 40 min is understandable but I'm not planning to do it again anytime soon.  My wife and I tried 5 of the burgers w/ the Pep Pep being by far and away the best one and the Barbie coming in 2nd.  Captain was dry and fries were fries.  For $9, I would rather just go to LBS for happy hour.The last time I saw 3 guys in a bus handing things to a huge crowd I woke up a week later on the Phish tour bus with a girl name Love Moonbeam...or Moon Lovebeam...or Beam Moonlove. Maybe it was Nancy.  Whatever.  It was told I had a good time. I was told I was a God.  I was told to get off the bus immediately. Damn hippies are so sensitive.  Make one Grace Slick heroin joke and suddenly you are Pol Pot. Never trust a hippie. Always wash any midget you come in contact with. Two things that will serve you well dear readers.Well, what does this brief moment with the unwashed have to do with anything? I don't know. I just swallowed two green pills I found in an alley way I woke up in last night. (Another long story, but it begins as all long stories do...with a fist full of cash and a woman of ill-repute.)  So, before I nod off or run 15 miles backwards again...I will continue with my words of love, food, and tiny microbes that live in our brains.So, everywhere Rex has hung his hat, his lovely purple feathered hat, one constant thing I hear is "how the hell did you find us?"  After that is how good the Slider Truck is.  Slider Truck. Screams as they run. Faint murmurs of Slider Truck. Silence. Time and time again. The same pattern.  I know why they scream, I didn't understand the Slider Truck obsession.  Well, Rex is no stranger to herpes and taking food from strangers in a vehicle.  Usually with those two things I see a cause and effect.  Thankfully this time I didn't have to do anything untoward, just pay money and the food came.So me and my favorite part time wench went to a park in Henderson to try this local phenomenon.  I got into line. The line barely moved. I waited. The line barely moved. I waited 30 minutes and I was not much closer. Rex became angry. Rex became incensed. Rex cried out to the skies. Rex cried.  After an hour, two beatings, and a slight case of heat stroke I arrived at the window. I had gone to their website and studied their menu. I knew what I wanted. I ordered like a pro. The kid who took my order smiled brightly and called me his hero. I blushed. Me and my sometimes intimate partner I only have to pay scale moved over to wait some more.  We ordered 1 Barbie, 2 Pep Pep and 3 Pulled Porkies. We added drinks and the sweet potato fries.  We waited some more. It took time. Rex hates waiting and this has tried my patience and my left hook to the point of exhaustion.  Finally the food came. We celebrated. We danced. She cried out of her non-glass eye.  It was a beautiful day, only about 200 degrees outside. We sat under a tree. The food smelled great.  I ate the Barbie and the BBQ sauce was great and the caramelized jalapeno balanced the sweetness.  The Pep Pep was like an attempt at a gourmet Big Mac. The sauce was very familiar and very tasty. Tangy and sweet. It was good. Then the pulled pork. Tender pork, bbq sauce and a little heat from the jalapeno. I ate one of the sweet potato fries and then put about 75% of the container in my mouth at one time.  The verdict...decidedly mixed.  I admire these kids and their attempts to recreate the food trucks of other cities...but it needs to be more than just clever and right now this is just clever. The star of the show was the pulled pork, and why...it was the  only thing that wasn't overcooked. It wasn't sauced enough and it needed a little more flavor in the pork when it was cooking, but overall it was very good. The bun has a bit of grease on it and that made it very buttery. That was nice.  The burgers had the potential to be amazing, but they just weren't. They were so far overcooked that the Barbie I had was like a hockey puck. The Pep Pep was very good but again over cooked and under sauced. I loved the fries. They were well done and relatively inventive. Salt, sugar and spice. Excellent. Another surprise flavor could have really stepped it up a notch, but I am not going to nitpick. I want to like these guys, I want to support them. But when I spend almost 30 bucks on dinner I better get more than some really over cooked meat.  The portions were "slider" size but the prices were gourmet (3 for 7 bucks), and the execution was decidedly NOT gourmet. I think the worse thing I can say is that given the wait, the overcooked meat and the lack of some basic fundamentals with the food I can't say I would come back. If I didn't have to wait an hour I would eat there again, but right now the town is obsessed with novelty food that lacks sophistication...why should I spoil that for them.  To me this is like dating a supermodel without a vagina...slightly depressing, terribly irritating and not worth the time you put into it. You want to love her, but you can't.You can love Rex. Try as hard as you can. Rex can't love you.I really hate to do this, but today was a serious wtf on behalf of the Slider Truck.Got to the Lakes location at 5:55, they were supposed to be there at 6 PM. There was already quite a line, but it didn't look like more than 30 minute wait. We didn't wait 30 minutes. We waited 45 minutes and only moved 15 feet with about 20 people ahead of us still. Matt and I did not get food tonight. You know why we didn't get food? We overheard that some lady up front ordered TWO DOZEN sliders. When you are a business that makes items as they're ordered and you see a crazy-long line, you have to draw the line somewhere. Seriously, it should be 6 sliders per customer, period. TWO DOZEN. Who the hell needs 24 sliders?? You should not be ordering for friends or family, you need to drag their butts down there so you can stare at all the people glaring at you for holding them up from eating. I don't think we would have been served in an hour and a half, and there's no way that the Slider Truck is worth that kind of wait. Half hour tops. And that is usually all I have to wait if not less. But once it gets past an hour, it gets ridiculous. I'm seriously thinking about selling my Groupon that I have for them because the wait times have gone up like crazy and I don't think I'll be able to use it anytime soon. Oh and P.S. Anyone who cuts the line at the Slider Truck, you have a separate circle in hell waiting for you.Our friend had never tried the Slider Truck and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to take his S.T. virginity. As soon as he got off work we rallied and rushed over to their spot for the night.We stood in line for over 45 minutes and left empty handed. Not only that, we were insulted by the sheer greediness of some people.It was happy hour; $1 everything. There was a big crowd but everyone was being pleasant, politely waiting their turn to gobble some slider goodness. Since they were at Sunrise Coffee, people were dipping into the shop and getting coffee while waiting. After 45 minutes, the slider guys announce that they "have 40, count 'em FORTY sliders left! Don't be greedy, please, and there'll be enough for everyone!! :D"We see an old woman leave with at least 9 sliders and a big snot-eating grin. And then- "SOLD OUT!"Within TWO customers, they went through FORTY sliders. Whuuuuuuuuhhhh?!Fact is, we probably wouldn't have been able to get a slider even if people only ordered 2-3 each. Any time you wait that long, it can be annoying, but I'm not really upset about leaving empty handed. We were all insulted by the fact that as soon as they announced the shortage, some greedy individuals felt the need to swipe up ALL of the remaining sliders for themselves. Obviously, all of us waiting in line are there because we love the Slider truck- and those greedy few hoarded them all for themselves? Really? REALLY?! Thanks, people, for crapping all over my friend's experience & ensuring that his first impression of the Slider truck is NOT positive. Some of the shimmer has been smudged for me as well. I don't think I'm going to be able to find the motivation to wait in those lines with the knowledge that people so greedy are scattered amongst our midst. I'm over it. My friend, who didn't even get to try to food, will most likely never be back because of this. Greedy fools ruining the fun for everyone, I tell ya!Call me a hater but I'm not about to start giving away superfluous high marks to restaurants simply because their business model puts them on wheels.  I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.Like I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  The guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.  If you pay by credit card, the order taker says "My machine is asking if you would like to leave a tip."  I understand his machine may be asking that, but maybe post a sign that say you can leave a tip when paying by debit or credit rather than put people on the spot.   Jeez, thanks for putting me in a pickle.  I mean are you going to tell the guy no straight to his face?  I just think thats a tad audacious.  My visit corresponded with their new semi-residency at lunch time on Thursdays at UNLV.  Don't let the wheels seduce you...Before you get mad....... Slidin' Thru ACTUALLY gets a 2.5. I get it. They're nice guys, they fist bump you to make you feel special (even though you're not), they have a cool atmosphere with what some consider to be good music (I don't), and they serve (pretty) tasty sliders. I've caught the truck twice before in the past, and both times my stomach was still hungry and the pockets in my pants felt molested.I'm not going to whack around the bush; Slidin' Thru's prices are outrageous. If you are like me and thought that 3 sliders for $7 was a bit much on the truck, you're going to be totally disappointed now. Seven hundred and forty six dollars for a single mini-burg. Just kidding! But you can pay upward of $3.50 for one burger; and as of opening day, no 3 for $7. How cheap! And not the good kind of cheap either. In the end, I agree with the masses that Slidin' Thru has a lot of character and good eats. But unfortunately they also have steep prices and long wait times. Did I mention my slider buns weren't exactly fresh either? If I'm going to pay nearly four dollars for one tiny hamburger; it better give my mouth a boner! While it's good to see Slidin' Thru open a location so close to my house, I think I'll take my three million Carl's Jr. coupons (thanks, mailbox!) to Uncle Carl and gets me some full-sized charbroiled burgers in the future. Call me cheap : I work hard for my money! The menu is refreshing and the fist bumps are a nice touch; but it'll take more than that to get MY yen.* This review is for the Durango location.My First Love.... in Food Trucks that is. I remember going to their truck stop during the summertime by Yogurtland and getting a coupon for a free cup off yogurt after you eat their sliders... Great, great marketing strategy ;) The energy they bring when ordering makes all the difference in the experience of their followers. I didn't even know what to expect coming from having a mentality that "Food Trucks" were dirty and the food was considered.. junk. I had an immediate change of heart from my first experience in trying this particular food truck. Fist pumps, the enthusiasm that makes you smile, and of course the sliders and sweet potato fries... I was literally blown the heck away.Now to the goods... These are my usual:The Barby: Love cheddar cheese.. it's melted on top of the thick mini patty with a piece of crisp bacon, tangy bbq sauce. On the bottom layer.. there are some caramelized jalapenos and crispy fried onion strips. The soft fluffy buns with all these elements of deliciousness. makes this my favorite slider...The Yaya: Reminds me of some greek food, but in a slider form. I'm not a huge fan of Feta Cheese, but in this combination.. it works. This slider was somewhat... refreshing to bite into. The fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and red wine vinaigrette made it like a healthy treat than anything else. Loved it.The Captain's Order: Another feta cheese version that I did like...  You can't go wrong with sauteed onion and crisp bacon in a slider.. I call this a Classy One. Included balsamic reduction, roma tomato, and arugula. Flavorful and nice bite from the balsamic reduction. The feta cheese in both sliders really give it a lot of character and color to each bite. Enjoyed this one very much.Sweet Potato Fries: Long thin rectangular shaped fries... Absolutely LOVE them. Occasionally I'll try something different... I did like the Pulled Pork. The meat was so tender!!! The spice from the bbq sauce and caramelized jalapenos brighten the whole taste and gave this slider a great kick!!! Ha Yaaaah on that! I did go adventurous one night and ordered their Mystery Slider... which was Da Irish Hash!!!  A WHOLE hash brown, egg, chedda peno, n bacon. As I was eating this slider, half the hash brown fell off and even eating that only was so darn good!! Crisp on the outside, tender in the inside... now that's a great piece of hash! This mystery slider made my night... it was so delicious and hearty. I so needed this from dancing like a maniac at work and let me tell you... I left Very happy!!! Now for dessert.. I did try their Sweet Potato Smores. They bring it out to you like a baked casserole. Melted marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and topped with crumbled graham crackers. Dig in and you'll find yourself lost in sweet ecstasy. So warm and so good. This really is soothing to the soul. Some think soup.. but if you're sick of soup.. think of this dessert! ;)  Service has always been exceptional here... Nick introduced me to Jarritos. Delicious lime flavor that goes well with sliders and fries.. Thanks Nick!!! My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she was confused at first on why I chose this spot to have a nice birthday dinner. She goes... you sure?!?! There's some nice places in the hotels you know? I told her.. I know, but you asked and this is where I want to go. So we met up here and she was just pleasantly surprised how good this place was. She told me... now I understand why you wanted to come here :D Damn right girl!!! There were times where the server? would attempt to skateboard with my food in his hands... I thought that was quite cute and amusing... until he dropped a few of my sweet potato fries!!! I was like Oh Noooooo!!! AHhhhhh!!! I almost... almost dived down to the ground to catch it in my mouth, but he ran all those fries over... such tragedy of sweet potato fries in my mouth world. One time they even came out dancing to serve our food.. So entertaining! I thought it was the cutest thing :D It's a treasure to have a place like this here in Vegas... One of my loves for life.Really disappointing!  My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 40% on my reason for coming to this festival was to finally try Slidin' Thru.  First off, the line was really, really long.  I hate waiting in lines.  But, I'll admit its a fairly reliable sign of good food.  After about 15 minutes of waiting in line the person in front of us stated that Slidin' Thru was out of everything but the Plane Jane.  Thanks a lot Slidin' Thru for not telling us sooner.  At this point we were committed, even if I could only try the Plane Jane.  As we got near the ordering booth I noticed a group of girls lingering around the ordering booth.  They were typical high school girls: over concerned with their looks and not particularly friendly.  Perhaps, Slidin' Thru groupies as Slidin' Thru has earned their street credit as a cool place.  Then, it was my turn to order (around 30 minutes of waiting already).  The man was slow to take my order.  I'm sure he was tired because I know they were super busy, but the food festival had been going for only three hours (it was 8 pm and the thing went from 5 pm to 9 pm).  The truck was nicely decorated and hip-hop played on the radio inside.  We ordered two Plane Janes and one Caprese, they were out of everything else.  Then we began our wait for the order to be cooked.  One of the groupies picked up an megaphone and said "Hey, people of the truck.  We are out of everything but the Plane Jane."  Okay, so at least one works for the truck.  They were not all just groupies.  And, why hang out right at the ordering station?  The area was really crowded already.  It did not need 6 or 7 more people lingering.  Especially with their attitude.  Also, why not give the public service announcement every 5 or 10 minutes?  Why wait so long?  People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that.  Our food finally came out.  Total time, about an hour.  The meat was under cooked.  It was pink in the middle and cold.  the buns were dried out and crusty.  The Caprese fell apart as we tried to eat it.  The food was not special.  I prefer In and Out Burger, and I always know where they are at.  The man working the counter apologized and began handing out cards for a free slider at their fixed Northwest location.  It was a nice gesture, but the food was not good.  I overheard him explaining to another customer that one of their storefront locations had recently closed because it could not make enough money.  I understand why.  I think this place probably makes descent sliders on most days and the whole food truck craze and their cool vibe has served them well.  However, they have become a victim of their own success.  Rarely do things meet over inflated expectations.  I'll give this place another try aside from a food truck festival, but for this experience, what a dud!Man, I spoke too soon that it was in good hands. The BF and I were hurrying off to a busy day and needed a snack as we had a early dinner to get to. We both grab a barby and share regular fries. Things have changed since the last visit drastically. The burger patty was very, very thin. Think of White Castle type patty when these originally started pretty fat when Ric owned it. When I grabbed my burger the basket had a pool of oil. The flavor was okay because of the bbq sauce, but it was mostly bread and greasy onion crisps (which probably caused the pool of oil).The fries changed in that the thin crisp breaded shoestring fries are now thicker fries,- think like 5 guys like. They weren't very crisp and were soggy on the bottom since they got crammed in the cu and just steamed themselves. Girl up at front was much more quiet and not as personable as previous counter folks. $9 for this 2 slider, fries and drink combo isn't worth it when those sliders are super skimpy. They used to be worth it when they were fat and juicy. Just look at the photos from the beginning vs. now... they recently fused the truck reviews with the reviews for the brick location and you can see the difference. I should've stopped and taken a picture, but I was in a hurry and just jamming something in my mouth in the 5 minutes I had to spare. This wasn't the burgers with heart that sold itself. Also Ric WAS Slidin' Thru and the personality carried through in the staff he picked. It's missing that little sumthin' sumthin' on top of being skimpy. I regret that I will not be back.I finally got around to checking Slidin' Thru today.  And I don't know why it took me so long!  Hallelou, I have seen the light!My husband and I went here for lunch today while we were out and about.  I tried the Peppep and the Buffalo Soldier sliders.  I really enjoyed them both, but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.  My hubby tried the Porky and the Plain Jane.  I stole a bite of the Porky and almost didn't give the slider back because it was so yummy. I totally couldn't have eaten a 3rd slider, but I didn't want to look like a pig, especially since my hubby only ate 2.  The fries were really good too.  They tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.  YUMMY.  Take a bunch of napkins though.  The sliders were saucy (in a very good way) and did kinda get all over the place.  Double yummy on the saucy sliders!I do think the prices are a bit high.  For what we got on the sandwiches, I think $0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.  Even with that, I think we will be back regularly.  The prices on fries and drinks were spot on though, in my opinion.On a side note, the place was completely empty our entire meal.  Even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.  We didn't really see the staff either.  It was a little weird, but when we did see them, they were friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I think if they were a little more present and didn't disappear for long periods of time, it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.  I hope we just went during a weird time or something, because now I am hooked and want them to stay around!!!Another positive was a free slider just for checking in on Yelp.  Now that is a great deal!  How I love free food!I know Slidin' Thru has been around for some time now, at least 2 years.  But I never had the opportunity to eat here until last night.  Our original plan was Tea Time for boba, but ended up here instead since they were closed at the time.  What you get at Slidin' Thru is basically sliders that are infamously sold through their food trucks.  There's a list of sliders that you opt for, including pork and chicken. It was my first visit and decided on the Captain's Orders and the YaYa. Each slider is $3.50.  However, one is free when you check in through your Yelp app.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Both sliders were extremely tasty and full of flavor.  The YaYa was a little rich for me.  It's all good since I went back and forth taking bites out of the YaYa and Captain's Order.  We also washed down our sliders with some of their delicious sweet potato fries.  Perfect combination if you ask me.  I've been told that Slidin' Thru restaurant isn't as good as their actual food trucks. I wouldn't know the difference since I never had a slider from their food trucks.  All I know is that at this joint, their sliders are good enough for me to want more and cheap enough for me to come back.

Review Text :
Ok, now it's time to talk a little bit about their brunch!  We went for dinner, which was my first review. Dinner was excellent, but on our way in we noticed a sign for their brunch specials on the weekend. Brunch is perhaps my favorite meal of the day, so it was decided --- Mundo brunch for my birthday :-)We had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!So first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire! Genius since I love bloody marys, but bottomless could weigh you down after awhile. Food - I got the Benedict Mexicano --- DELISH.Jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffin.Pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon/ham.Green chile hollandaise instead of normal heavy hollandaise. Genius. It was so good, it makes me wonder why Mr. Benedict didn't just make it this way from the beginning.  Normally I have order envy, where no matter how happy I am with what I order, I covet what my neighbors have. Not this time. I didn't want to trade, I didn't want to share.  I can't even tell you what the other 5 people at my table ordered, but they all loved it too, so I don't think you can go wrong :)In a city with few outstanding Mexican (or TexMex) restaurants, Mundo stands out as one of the best. Located in one of the northern buildings within the World Market Center campus, it's one of the better off-Strip restaurants. Not only does it have wonderful food, it has an interior to match -- as you'd expect from a place surrounded by a design center.With a restaurant.com gift certificate in hand, I brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday. We started off with chips and salsa and a wonderful  guacamole with diced onions and tomatoes, slices of radishes, and topped with cilantro and cotija cheese.The chicken taquito appetizer consists of two taquitos cut in half and topped with sour cream, cotija cheese and green onions, with some lettuce and a sweet chile paste beside them. The chicken was a touch dry, but in combination with the other ingredients the flavors were excellent.My wife's dish was a large chile relleno stuffed with cubes of filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese in a smoke chile sauce. If you like a little heat, this is the dish to get. The tender beef was a great vehicle to soak up the smokiness of the sauce and deliver a bold punch of flavor to the palate.I'm a sucker for some swine, so I went with the carnitas and they didn't disappoint. You'd be hard pressed to find a better version in Vegas. The succulent chunks of pork was sitting in a large mound in the center of the plate with onions and cilantro on one side, avocado pico de gallo on another, and a cucumber habanero salad on the opposite side of the plate. The pork contained a balanced ratio of mostly lean meat with a little fat here and there to offset it with some additional flavor.For dessert we had churros. The eight small pieces were filled with a caramel sauce in the center and had some additional caramel drizzled on top. Also on the plate was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small bowl of chocolate sauce. It would have been a great way to end the meal but they brought out one more thing after that.An order of flan came out with a candle on top and two of the waiters sang happy birthday to my wife. I definitely wasn't expecting them to sing. I thought they only did that type of thing at TGI Friday's or place like that. But, it was much appreciated. As for the flan, it was unbelievably light, smooth and creamy with none of the eggy taste you get from lesser variations of the dish. Mom, I'm sorry to say this, but I've found flan that's better than yours.For drinks we had a margarita and mojito, which we were happy with and we checked in through Yelp and got a free glass of wine!The dinner was close to being perfect, but the service could have been better. Despite our waiter being very informative and friendly, he was too busy to give any of his many, many tables *great* service. But, that's more of a management and staffing issue than a reflection on him. The only other issue we had was when they cleared my wife's plate (of which she only ate about half her meal) and tossed it instead of offering to box it up.So, aside from a couple hiccups it was a successful bday dinner. One where we were able to save a bit through restaurant.com and the Yelp check-in and still have a wonderful meal. Come to think of it, the food here is a little similar to what you would get at Mesa Grill on the strip, but much cheaper.4.5 StarsThe boyfriend and I decided to have date night and dress up.He planned the night and chose this place as his roommate raved so much about it.As we drove up, I was pretty shocked that it was in the World Market Center because I thought only people in conventions were allowed in. Low and behold, it was right outside World Market. The walk up was simply amazing as WM is just a huge behemoth of a structure.When we walked in, it felt so homey and comforting. Like I was in grandma's extremely nice house. All about the lighting, I guess.We had a table with one of those big/king sized chairs. So big that the BF wound up sitting next to me during dinner.Our waiter was really funny and informative about his and the restaurant's fave dishes.Started our dinner with a few cocktails. I forget the names of them but, I know his margarita wasn't as sour/tarte as they normally are so, I liked that a lot.We ordered the ahi tuna pizza app and it was AHHHHMAAAAAZIIIIIIIIIING.Crust was thin and crispy. Reminded me of a really good and waaaaay fancier Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell (but, obvs way better)! I could've eaten 4 of them stacked on each other as a meal!For entrees, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and he had the filet stuffed Chile Rellano; and elote for a side.The sea bass was soooooo beautifully presented. All wrapped up like a delicious gift!His filet was perfectly juicy and tasty; and went very well with the spiciness of the Chile. The sauce added extra kick and spice to the dish.The elote was elote. My FAVE, as always. You can never get Mexi corn wrong.We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert. Which I would love to come back for.What's even more great about this place is that they are vegan/vegetarian friendly. I was excited to tell my roommate who is dating a vegan/vegetarian.All in all, I'm excited for more date nights here. Very romantic and intimate!If you are thinking of trying Mundo for the first time, please readthis. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.Unfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verballyattacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for theexperience only. Here's what happened.My husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, askingif they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and politeand said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had ababy in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.We arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I hadcalled, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHERPERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. Wesat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered acocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. Thebaby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food onits way- so far so good.Then a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, "Iwant you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but childrenare not allowed in the restaurant." I looked at him with a confused look,since we had been seated there by the host, and said, "Well, I calledahead and asked--" and he interrupted me and said, "I don't care. LikeI said, there's nothing I can do about it now." I said, "are youasking us to leave?" and he responded again, "I don't care."I asked him, "Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being sorude?" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and Ipointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant andwe had called and asked. He repeated, "I don't care," and turned onhis heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.We were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurantin my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and havenever seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about thebaby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks andfood, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I gotpunched in the face.He was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved likea child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone whowants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner isunprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him.This review is not for the food.We recently stopped in for drinks at the bar. It was our first visit to this restaurant. While seated at the bar, the manager or owner (not sure which) decided to discipline an employee in front of all of the customers seated at the bar.In all my years, I have NEVER witnessed someone talk to another human being the way that man talked to his employee. I wanted to cry. It was terrible and I knew right then and there that we had to leave the restaurant. I seriously had nightmares about this place after I left.  Never again.

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.The people working here are nice and the inside is clean. I had howie bread and that was hard and the pizza sauce that came with it tastes terrible. I liked the thickness of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself really lacked flavor. The pepperoni and sausage on my pizza did taste okay but the pizza all together just wasn't anything special. The amount of toppings on the pizza was fair. There was supposed to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but I tasted nothing but a so-so pizza crust. I'm a big boy who can eat a lot and could only eat 1 and a half pieces. I'm not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actually has taste to it.

Review Text :
I still dream about the bone in ribeye I had here.  Best creamed spinach ever (Peter Luger's being #2).  We went on a pretty slow Thurs night so our waiter was cool enough to bring us several samples of the huge wine list they have there at no charge.  I imagine very few places are better than this downtown.  You can't go wrong with this place!!How do you end up at Vic & Anthony's? I'd have to agree with the other reviewers..... usually a referal; someone tells you about this high-end steakhouse. For me, it was the concierge at our hotel.I was trying to put together a dinner-show package for clients. Trade shows in Vegas usually come up for me around the first quarter of the year. And when entertaining clients, I've got a short list of reliable spots in Vegas for dinner. And it's not just about the food; it's definitely about an enjoyable evening, which has to include a relaxing, and tasteful ambiance. V&A's is all that, and reasonable.In the past, I would have made reservations at Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crab at the South end of Caesar's Forum Shoppes. But now, I have a very good alternative. And about those "reasonable" prices? Not as high as you might think. For our party of four, a couple cocktails and sodas, two appetizers, the NY strip, a bone-in Ribeye, a salmon entree, a chicken entree, three vegetable sides and a dessert we four split, our bill was about $250. That's very reasonable for a steakhouse meal. Funny thing. When we had been seated for a bit, a group of four young guys came in, sat down, opened the menus........ and then in concert, stood up and walked out. I'm thinking they thought they were in the hotel's cafe? Things that I really like about this hotel restaurant...... it's easy access, just inside the East side valet entrance to the hotel. The servers are formal, but very accomodating and non-intimidating. The atmosphere is really casual, and the food is very good. Even if I'm by myself, I'll consider getting my next Vegas meal here. And I don't like eating by myself, but for their steaks I'd break that rule.I just got back from one of my best steak dinners ever.  When I arrived, I was seated on a great table close to the bar where I can sit on one of their cool leather chairs and watch the NFL Draft at the same time.The decor is totally awesome, a cross between the Capital Grille and Craftsteak.  It is furnished like an old school steakhouse with deep rich cherry woods and leather chairs but with beautiful trendy stained glass ceilings and low mood lighting....very sexy.I love this type of steakhouse....truly a Frank Sinatra hangout with Suits, Steaks, Whiskey and Cigars.My meal began with their delicious warm sourdough bread and their incredible lobster bisque.  The bisque was super creamy and spicy....one of the best that I have ever had.For dinner, I ordered a bone-in rib eye steak and a side of sea salt fries.The steak was super tender and juicy with the right amount of marbling.The fries was a perfect side with the great steak.For desert, I had their famous croissant bread pudding with ice cream and a toffeestick.....super sweet and good.Vic and Anthony's is one of the best steak houses that I have been to in the U.S.The decor and ambience is sexy and romantic.......the service is outstanding.  I felt like a celebrity......the hostess and waitress made me feel as if i was the only customer in  the restauarnt.  The Mgr. came by my table a couple of times to check on me and when I left, they comped my desert and gave me a complimentary glass of cabernet franc to finish my meal.I came in my pants twice.......it was that good.  No sex needed for a week....I am so satisfied!I can see why they are a Michelin rated steakhouse and was voted as one of top 10 steakhouses in the country.I wish there was a V@A in California and NY!VEGAS OLD SCHOOLI'm a trendy Angeleno.  I KNOW good food...especially steaks.  That's because LA is blessed with the swankiest steakhouses:  Boa, Mastro's, Cut ($130 filet mignon). During our stay in Vegas, my sweetie said she wanted to try this place she found on Yelp called Vic & Anthony's.  My face said "sure!" but I scoffed inside.  Why am I leaving our suite at Cosmopolitan, not to go downstairs to dine at STK, but to drive all the way to the business district of Vegas for...Vic & who?My first impression was that this restaurant's decor was dated, sort of Sinatra old-school.  I scanned the room and was surprised it was full of people all seemingly in rapture with their meals.  Probably local Las Vegans whose desert-baked brains can't comprehend modern upscale dining.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, no accoutrements.Juicy.  Tender.  So good I sat up from my slouch.  I was enveloped by a wisp of humility as that savory hunk of steak yelled out to me:  IN!...YO!...FACE!When my sweetie asked if my filet mignon was up to par with those from LA, I answered, "It's not bad".  Damn, I really got ripped-off at Cut.I'm just going to be honest and let you all know that my memory of eating at this particular steak house is a little fuzzy because I had been playing blackjack and drinking champagne for, oh about 7 hours before realizing that if I didn't eat dinner now!, then I would have to eat at a diner or some form of 24 hour place and it probably wouldn't be as good. Also, Nick has a tradition of wanting to eat at a steak house at least once while we are in Vegas and this was our only chance on the short trip we took there recently.With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the meal and I'd easily go back again. I ordered a classic filet and Nick ordered a strip and both were cooked perfectly. We also shared some of the mac and cheese (sooooo good), the Brussel sprouts (eh, average), and a chop salad that I really enjoyed. And while I know it's not part of the menu, the bread and butter were worth mentioning as well. I'm normally not much of a bread person, as I prefer my carbs in the form of purer sugar, but man alive! I couldn't stop eating this stuff.While it isn't the high roller steak houses you can find on the strip I think the quality is definitely great here and you also miss out on the waits and attitudes you might find in some places on the strip. Plus the cost, while high, wasn't as high as some of the other steak houses I've been in Vegas. More money for doubling down is always a good thing!There are some experiences in life you have to live at least once, and dinner at Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is definitely one of them. I've had the privilege of coming here for a third time; two previously with my fave uncle, and this time with my husband, my cousin, and her husband. We sat at a table tucked in a balcony area, where our server, Ben, gave us superb service as he provided us with dinner specials, suggestions for drink pairings, a little bit of history, and entertaining jokes throughout our evening. The four of us shared a bottle of Pinot Noir that Ben recommended. We followed this delicious and smooth wine with individual cocktails, I had the Spiced Pear Martini, which might not have been the best choice to pair with my filet and lobster tail, but it hit a great spot my taste buds were desiring. We shared a calamari appetizer that was mixed with shishito peppers. The plate was just right for the four of us, especially since two of us aren't big fans of this particular seafood. For our second course, we chose different salads. I enjoyed the heirloom tomato penzanella, which seemed to be a variation of caprese. It was rich, light, and scrumptious. Around the rest of the table were Caesar salaf and Spinach salad. The main course consisted of two specials of 8oz filet and I think 12oz lobster tails with fingerling potatoes and sautéed mushrooms (yellowfoot, bluefoot...and one other that I can't recall at the moment, mostly because I have them to my man to enjoy since he is the only fun-guy I like! lol). The other two plates were filled with porter house ribeyes that my cousin and my husband savored until they couldn't eat anymore. Yes, leftover meat taken back to the room and chewed up for breakfast. Our additional sides were au gratin potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and in house made creamed corn. We covered the table with our feast, everything set in a wonderful presentation, flavored amazingly, and eaten with great delight. Ben paid attention when we mentioned we were there to celebrate my cousin and her husband's wedding anniversary, and he generously brought out a creme brulee with a candle. It was just the right amount of sweet for four spoons that filled us to our limit. It was a fabulous evening of food, conversation, service and overall memory making that the four of us will get to share and enjoy the rest of our days.Guys! This place is amazing, and I'm about to tell you how to make it more amazing!!Only at Las Vegas and Atlantic City locations do they have the "Distinctive Dining" deal. $50 for 3 courses.Step one... Cut a hole in the box! Kidding. Okay, go to the website and print out their special menu because It's ONLY VALID IF YOU HAVE THE PAPER!Not valid on holidays, but still valid on weekends. Step two...-order your first course, lobster bisque or salad. Both were fantastic. More deets later. - order your entree, and yes. An 8 oz filet is an option. What. Is. Happening.- pick your side, which is big enough to feed THREE people. - pick yo' dessert- bread pudding, chocolate mousse, or creme brûlée Step three... Stuff your face and be amazed by how wonderful the food is. Step four... Pat yourself on the back for enjoying a three-course meal at Vic and Anthony's for $50. Then go blow some money gambling as you waddle off your food baby. Food:- Lobster bisque 5/5- wasn't too salty and had sweet chunks of lobster meat!- Filet- 4/5- had an excellent crust on it but wasn't cooked to medium rare. One of us ended up with medium, and the other ended up with half and half. Still tastes fabulous. - Creamed spinach- 2/5- omggg soooo much cheese in this that I wasn't sure if I was trying to convince a 5 year old to eat vegetables by hiding them in cheese. Are we eating cheese in spinach or spinach in cheese? Couldn't stomach it.- Au gratin potatoes- 3/5- the guys loved these, but soooooo much cheese again. A few bites of this, and you'll be set for the next famine. - Bread pudding 5/5- the silkiest bread pudding I've ever had. - Chocolate mousse- 5/5 comes on a thin crispy layer. Fantastic flavor and texture. - creme brûlée- 5/5 while a little thin, fabulous presentation with tons and tons of brûlée for you to eat with berries. So basically, just say yes to all of the above in this gorgeous, glamorous old school restaurant. Vic and Anthony's, thanks for the affordable and splendid dinner. I love you. Or y'all, I suppose, since there are two of you.

Im always down to try places I have not been to so I was assuming this place would be similar to Aloha Kitchen or L and L.With that said it was just ok. I ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Spicy Chicken, and Loco Moco. To top it off we ordered a Mango Smoothie with Boba.The Honey Walnut Shrimp was a bit on the sweeter side. The Spicy Chicken was medium spicy and a bit on the greasy side. The Loco Moco was really good but for some reason they gave me way too much rice. Now for the Mango Smoothie with extra boba. Waaaaaaaaay too sweet! I could only take a couple sips and I was done. They are situated in a pretty nice location complimented with a Super Wal-Mart across the parking lot. Their set up is pretty spacious with a decent amount of tables and booths. Service was decent. They get you your food as soon as its done.So overall, I have nothing overly good or bad to report. I would probably go here once in a while. It just wouldnt be my first choice.

Restaurant name  Jack in the Box

Review Text :
So the only things I like at Jack in the box is their Munchie meals and Milkshakes.  They are both very good and fill the fast food craving.  The stacked Grilled Cheeseburger is very nice and is a meal in itself.  The included tacos and pretty good but on the greasy side.  That makes them tasty but you can feel your arteries harden with each bite.  The included fries are the mix of standard and curly but you can choose either one if you have a preference.  We also had the Chicken Tater Melt which was surprisingly delicious.     The Munchie Meals are $6 after 9PM which is a great deal for the amount of food you get.  The Milkshakes are creamy and delicious.  With the yummy whipped cream they are a welcome sweet treat.  I don't eat at Jack's often but when I do it is always the fast food I love and expect.  Nothing fancy just quick and good.

Review Text :
I've visited Athens a handful of times in my search for the best Gyro around the Phoenix area. While Athen's doesn't take top billing in my book, they come in at a close second or third. They make a mean gyro and you can't hardly beat the $3.50 price tag. For just two extra bucks order it with extra meat and you'll walk out for about $6 with an over filled belly! In case you're wondering - they DON'T serve those crummy gyro pre-packaged pieces. This gets shaved right from the cone.The pita is good and they could stand to change up the tatziki sauce a bit - it's a little on the runny side. Definitely a sound choice if you're close by and feeling a good quality Gyro.Quoted in the weekly Yelp newsletter 8-3-2011: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=XY441K1tpmDw830RFs5LBAI had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but it failed me. I can't say the same for my coworkers though, because they liked it. For me, the gyro sandwich was extremely plain. There was only tomato and onion with taziki sauce. I gave them another shot but it was the same thing with a whole container of taziki slathered on it. Traditionally, there is more stuff that comes on a gyro sandwich. The food sat heavy and the toilet was my best friend after eating here.

It's tough... I wanted to hate this place because, well, it's not awesome. But something about it made me fall a little bit in love. It's totally kitschy, it's loud, it's overcrowded and the service is incredibly slow. So what's to like?I was traveling with a friend and we had to circle around the restaurant 3 times before we spotted an open table. There was a woman sitting at a two top who decided to use another table to rest her bags on. Not sure if this is something the restaurant would feel comfortable monitoring or not but they were losing business because people were too lazy and impolite to rest their bags on the floor. We kindly asked if the table was taken and she moved her stuff noting, "Whoops. I've been here for 40 mins. Sorry about that." We take our seats, find spots for our bags under the tiny table and wait. And wait. A woman offered up menus and left us for a few mins to decide what to eat and drink. Wanting some wine I asked, "Do you have a house wine?" And the absolute best question followed, "Yes. What color are you looking for?" Haha. But it got better. The wine comes in two serving sizes. 4 oz and 9 oz. I had a good two hours to kill so I ordered the latter. When it came it might as well have been served in a fishbowl! No complaints there, though. I slowly sipped away on the wine and placed an order for some food. My poor friend got some sort of roast beef sandwich and couldn't even finish it. It looked downright gross. Something made in an elementary school cafeteria. My boneless tangy wings were pretty good though. Having low expectations, I actually enjoyed them. The serving size was huge too, I couldn't eat it all.So all in all it wasn't terrible. Something about this place was adorable in a sad way. It's messy, the servers look like they're all hating life and the food is not so awesome. But with such limited options and everyone wanting one last meal or drink in AZ before taking off to somewhere else, this "diner" will do the trick. Just order the 9 oz wine and life will be good.

Took my Son here for lunch last week.  We enjoy our CiCi's lunches....there's always a great selection of Pizza.  So, why did I bump them up a Star?  Because while we were there a soccer team with over 20 kids plus their families and coaches came in to eat.....and the CiCi's staff kept up with the massive demand of Pizza.  They'e really good at their jobs....and the Pizza is decent too.Will I return?  You can count on it.Customer service here is A-MAY-ZING!Here the managers are sooo sweet and welcoming! They seriously go the extra mile to make sure you enjoyed your experience! You want a weird pizza? DONE! They do whatever you want, bc they want YOU to be happy! AWESOME! What I love is here you can MAKE YOUR OWN SALAD! You can load that shiz up with jalapenos, bacon bits, or whatever your little heart desires! You can also get a cup of ranch for your buffalo chicken pizza! BOMB!!I usually only eat the buff chicken pizza, the deep dish pepperoni with white sauce, or the macaroni pizza! They have awesome others though, the Philly cheese steak, cheeseburger, taco, and whatever you could think of!They also have a good little soda area and a pretty dope game room!Def child friendly and huge!

Review Text :
3.75 FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers, I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef. I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did. Hand pattied, fresh burgers, flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger "traditionalist" I ordered the regular with bacon, lettuce, tomato's, pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much, I may go with the single next time. The building was busy with customers and staff, they run a tight ship. The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart, the frys are large, the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers, share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL I will go back.4 stars for a flat top grilled burger... must have been good.A burger with whatever-the-hell-you-want on it for no extra charges for things like jalapeno, grilled onions or peppers,etc sounds like a smokin deal.  $5 for that burger alone, with no combo deals in sight, brings you back down to earth.The beef is high quality, with no grissly bits, and the toppings choices are many with plentiful, almost too much, volume.  Makes for a deliciously sloppy affair to eat a burger that is just as tall as it is wide!I was worried when I unwrapped my tinfoil and saw that the bun had been pretty much smashed down during assembly.  I looked around and it was standard operating procedure, so I dug in, and the bun held up surprisingly well for being so pushed to its limits of moisture absorbtion and weight support.Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!  free for the taking.  They are everywhere -- something to be aware of if you have one of those allergic kids that they shut down school for when a classmate opens a PBJ sandwich too close.I also worried about their storage technique for the sacks of potatoes.  Either they are wasting hundreds of pounds of spuds, or they plan on using these after storing them out where any kid could poke their grubby little fingers into holes in the sacks, or stab the potatoes with a pen, or punch and bruise them, etc.Prices are high, but I dig Five Guys B&F.  You seem to get what you pay for, except for the drink -- $2.19 for a 32 oz is just gouging.Holy let down batman. I totally got sucked into the "Five Guys hype": reading the owner's story about opening the restaurant with his kids:  how he doesn't spend much on the restaurants themselves, but instead focuses on the quality of the food:  How they don't deliver, that nothing is frozen, etc.  But above all how good their food is. Mr. Boss of all Five Guys franchises:  Please visit your restaurants.  In and Out  = better than Five guysSmashburger  = better than Five guysDelux   = better than Five guysFat Burger  = better than Five guysMcDonalds  = better than Five guysPerfect (twice fried) french fries?  Soggy mess.Fresh ingredients?  I can't disprove this, but to cook said ingredients to death and then dress them up with "as many condiments as I want" ? No high five for you. It's like offering me fancy ketchup with my well-well done filet mignon. (though to be fair, most places cook everything to well done... it was just a mess here though) And the kiss?  I paid 5 bucks for said tasteless krabby patty of woe.  I went in to the restaurant thinking:  WOW ME 5 GUYS, FUCKING WOW ME.   Thats all I wanted!  Give me a reason to come back!  I can't believe you formula for success is to bank on the masses having mediocre taste buds.  Can't say this isn't the right formula for success, but come-fucking-on!Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!Add "beefy" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of "look at me" crap on the walls ("Best Fries in Hoboken!")The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work..."I come from a land down under"...I shuddered a little bit at the part "and men chunder"...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).Anyway...I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you "accidentally" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!) And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.Sometimes I crave a big, juicy burger.  On a recent Friday, a few co-workers and I went to Five Guys to get our dose of beefy goodness.The menu is simple - burgers, hot dogs and fries.  One thing that is important to know is that the regular burgers come with two patties, while the 'little' burgers come with one.  Convinced (or perhaps challenged) by my co-workers to try the full-size, I went with the cheeseburger.  From the long list of toppings (all free) I chose to go 'all the way' except for the tomato which meant mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles,  grilled onions and mushrooms.  The burger was pretty good - juicy and messy.  I think I should have skipped the grilled onions, though, as there were far too many of them.The fries come in two sizes (big and huge) and two ways - regular and cajun.  We shared a large order of cajun fries among the three of us, and I think it would have taken two more people to finish them.  The fries were thick-cut, which I really like, but the cajun seasoning made them very salty.All orders are served up in plain brown paper bags, even if you are not taking the food to-go.  A cute idea, except that the brown paper really soaks up that french fry grease.  I know burgers & fries are greasy.  Duh.  I just don't want to have such obvious visual confirmation of that.  The shiny glistening sheen that had soaked through the brown paper bag was NOT what I wanted to see after finishing my meal.Overall a tasty burger, and so-so fries.  Would I have the burger again?  Sure.  However, Five Guys will not replace In-N-Out as my go-to place to satisfy my burger cravings.  Yes, I will always be a California girl at heart!I like Five Guys Burgers a lot, but this one was just OK.  I came here for dinner the other night and ordered:Little Bacon Cheeseburger w/Grilled Onions, Mustardhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=QkSMzAtjE7aDljIRxLgUfACheese Dog w/Mustardhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=1kvdxxurxO7Xbotp8dDZ1wRegular Size Cajun Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=3SUu_0EAJIJHhCrduGIaVAThe Bacon Cheeseburger was just OK....I don't know why it was so underwhelming, it just was.  The Cheese Dog was underwhelming too, just didn't hit the spot....it was average.The only thing above average was the Cajun Fries.....they were excellent!Not sure if I caught them on a bad day, will have to come back and give them another chance....in the meantime, just 3 Stars for them.Return Factor - 75%

Review Text :
Another izakaya place has opened up in Vegas - this one goes by the name of SHIN Yakitori House.  What makes this an izakaya?  Ultimately, it's a Japanese establishment that serves food to complement drinks.  The food usually served are small bites, similar to tapas.  But what makes SHIN more unique in Vegas is that they have a long list of yakitori items!  And that means various goodies served up on skewers and put on the grill.  And their specialty is Okinawan-style food as well!This restaurant has taken up the former space of Sushi Hana - therefore there are two private tatami rooms, a counter, and quite a few tables.There was a modest group of diners on a Monday evening, and our luck was that we walked in during happy hour!  (Mon-Thurs 9 pm to 12 am)Our waitress greeted us pleasantly and offered us the counter or table.  We took our seats at a table and looked over the various menus given - one for sushi, one for yakitori, the picture menu, and the specials board.Our mistake was not coming here on an empty stomach.  This visit was more of a taster for bigger things to come on a return visit.* Hotaru Ika ($6.95) - This came off the specials board.  It's raw baby firefly squid and served in a sweet sauce.  It was surprising good and something I've never seen before.  * Monkfish Liver ($6) - Also known as ankimo and something we just love.  It's buttery slices rested on a bed of seaweed with delicious ponzu sauce.  Always a favorite.* Wagyu Harami ($4.75) - A tasty beef skewer that was juicy and tasty - we ordered two more!* Tebichi Soba "Okinawan Style Noodle in Soup topped with Pork Feet" ($7.50) - This was probably the one disappointing dish we had that evening.  When ordering, I asked the waitress if she recommended this dish or the Grilled Pork Feet.  She liked this one better, so we got it.  It had only one piece of pig's feet, green onions, and noodles.  It lacked taste.  In the picture, it actually looked like there were a few pieces of feet and a different style noodle.  In retrospect, we definitely should have gone with the grilled feet instead.* Chicken Thigh with Spicy Mayo ($2.45) - Tender pieces of chicken thigh with a drizzle of spicy mayo, sounds good and tastes good!* Smelt Fish ($2.75) - Also known as shishamo, and comes two in this order.  A squeeze of lemon and a light sprinkling of salt makes this grilled fish full of eggs just burst into your mouth.* Quail Eggs ($2.25)  - One skewer consists of three eggs and what we love about this dish is that the egg yolk is smooth and creamy inside.  Makes you want to make it at home.* Chicken Skin ($2) - Who doesn't love some grilled chicken skin?  The fattiness is something you just can't say no to.We'll have to come back to try their shark cartilage, salmon carpaccio, miso cream cheese, deep fried octopus balls, deep fried tofu, stingray fin, pork belly, and honey toast.Service was good - our waitresses kept our tea and water filled all the time without request, something I definitely appreciate.We also noticed that the majority of customers and all of the staff (from what we could see) were Japanese, as in Japanese-speaking too.  Makes it feel even more authentic!  Happy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays from 9 pm to 12 am (Half off Chef's Choice Specials Menu, $1 Sapporo)Lunch: Everyday from 11:30 am to 3:30 pmDinner: Everyday from 6:00 pm to 3:00 amUpdate! (05.07.10)Went back for a second visit and just wanted to add on to this review.* Octopus Marinated with Wasabi ($5.25) - I'm a big fan of this having tried it at Shuseki first.  Now I've had it at quite a few places and it's just yum!  It is a bit slimy and takes some getting used to, but I love this slippery goodness.* Rafutei (Simmered Pork Belly Okinawan Style) ($5.75) - Fatty chunks of pork belly with just a tad of hot mustard for some eat and that means good stuff all around!  It just melts in your mouth!* Okinawan Yaki Soba (Okinawan Style Fried Noodle) ($7.50) - This was a surprisingly yummy dish - red pickled ginger slices, bonito flakes, and chunks of meat mixed in with the noodles and vegetables gave this dish a nice taste.* Agedashi Tofu ($5.50) - Always a favorite of mine and they didn't disappoint here at SHIN.We did order the quail eggs again and we just love how the hot yolk just melts in your mouth.  As a result, I went home and made it myself!

Review Text :
So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my numberThere was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. ...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.This Place earns a solid 5 stars on food, 3 stars on atmosphere, and 4 stars on service, so I'm giving it 4 stars...and here are the details.We went late on a wednesday for the AYCE Tapas, the special is pretty hard to beat, you can have anything from their menu, you get to order 2 plates at a time and once you finish, you can order 2 more, however if there is anything left uneaten you have to pay menu price for the items (like many AYCE sushi places).The atmosphere is pretty good, it's dark and trendy, my major complaint was that the music was really really loud, and the selection sucked, in a place like Hard Rock with a solid music selection, the techno/pop crap they were playing at eleventy billion decibels was out of place.My only major complaint with the service is that longer we were seated, the longer it took to bring out our food, I don't know what was going on but our first plates came out almost immediatley, however with each passing order it seemed like it took longer.I would strongly recommend bringing a friend so you can try a lot more food, share some bites and eat your way through most of the menu.Beer Cheese Dip- (4th Fav) This was our first plate, the dip tasted a lot like the beer cheese you get from the store, but had bacon in it, the pretzel sticks were soft and chewey but could have used a little more salt, however it was a great starterSmalls Balls- (2nd Fav) One of my favorite items on the menu, it reminds me a lot of Arancini, risotto, short ribs, and Parmesan. Not as rich as Arancinis I've had before, which was actually a good thing, I will be having these again.High Rollerz- (3rd Fav) Smoked Mozzarella, Serrano Ham, and Pesto, served in taquito style rolls. You can really taste the Serrano ham and the smoked mozzarella, A great small bite, a little crispy in the wrapper, but all in all really good.Thanksgiving Dinner Sliders- First off thier "sliders" are more closer to a small hamburger than a slider per say. They are bigger than your average slider and come 2 to an order. I was thinking this would be like a bobby from capriotti's however it was quite different, the first bite was mainly over powered by butter that was served on them, the rest of it tasted like a turkey burger covered in sage, it was good, but I couldn't taste the cranberries or the stuffing.Jack and Coke- (my Fav) no this isn't the drink, it's skewered beef that has been marinated in a combo of Jack and Coke, it thought it sounded a little odd, but it was hands down the best thing I ate, just enough seasoning from the marinade but not too much to over power the delicious meat.Pizza Pops- (least Fav) I was really looking forward to this item, imagine if a muffin and a pizza roll had a baby, what could be wrong??? Well pretty much everything was. The muffin was doughy, the "toppings" were decent but not great, the marinara served on the side was Ice Cold, I was really disappointed in these, possibly me least favorite item of the evening.Surf and Turf- Lobster and Filet on a skewer, great idea, vanilla butter sauce...not so much, it was odd eating a nice tender piece of filet and having the overwhelming taste of vanilla in your mouth, it worked better with the lobster, but was still an odd combo, may work for some people, not so much for me.Mac and Cheese Daddy- Sliders served with Fried Mac and Cheese on them. Balls of deep fried mac and cheese served on a slider bun with tomato and arugula. I love sliders and I love any thing deep fried, however these were just carb overload, I really liked the idea, but the execution was missing something.Chicken and Waffles- Fried chicken drummettes, maple glazed waffle fries, and southern style white gravy. The Waffle fries were amazing, the maple glaze and the saltiness of the fries worked well together, I really like them. The chicken was good, a tad too crispy for me, but none the less still good, and when dunked in the gravy got an added pepper flavor that made it even better.Tuna Sashimi- I am not really a huge Sashimi fan, but this was really good, the tuna was fresh, and the slice was just the right size. The sauce was flavorful and not over powering. Not the world's greatest but still a very solid offering.Shorty- Braised short ribs, there were really good, 3 small slices of perfectly seasoned short ribs. Meaty and delicious.Tempura Fried Green Beans- It's hard to mess this up, crispy and delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the Thai Chile sauce accompaniment.Meaty Balls- Good meatballs, a little dry but still really good.Fish Tacos- I didn't try these, my buddy liked them.So Beefy- These were under the beef menu, but were sliders. Good slice of filet and Pancetta, I ate it outside of the bun, and liked it, didn't really work as a slider.Grilled PB&J- Chunky PB :(, but still a good end to the meal.sorry to cut the last reviews short, but I was hitting the character limit...Didn't know yelp had oneMy friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be "in the money".....aka "get your money's worth".I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):Round 1Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)Round 2Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)Round 3Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!Will I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%I tried Johnny Smalls last night with a meetup group. While they were getting our table ready, a few of us sat at the bar and had a drink. I decided to ask the bartender for one of his personal specialties. He ended up giving me something he calls the Naughty Irishman. I didn't really watch him make it, but it looked like it was primarily Jameson and Bailey's with crushed ice. I give him props for hand crushing the ice. The drink was pretty good, but it came with the typical Vegas price tag of about $13.Once seated, we did the AYCE tapas thing for $19.99 per person. Note that you technically need a Hard Rock player's card to get that price; otherwise, it's $23.99. Based on the prices of each item, I got my money's worth. On the other hand, if I disregard how much they list each item, I still probably got my money's worth. I'd say their tapas are a mixed bag. Most of them were decent to very good. Nothing was amazing. If I do this again, I have a few items I would skip.The Good* Poona Tuna - I started off with this because someone mentioned it on Yelp. The cherry limeade was an interesting sauce and the tuna was maybe slightly overcooked, but I enjoyed the dish.* Jack & Coke - One of the better items. Very tasty.* Lettuce Cups - Shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that's just being picky. This was quite tasty.* Sea Bass - I only tried some of this from someone else's order. It was pretty good, but not my favorite.* Tuna Sashimi - It's hard to mess up ahi tuna. This was simple and tasty.* Surf & Turf - The vanilla butter added a strange flavor to the mix, but pretty good overall.* Grilled PB&J - I found it a little strange that the jelly was on the side i.e. you had to add it yourself, but it was still good. Honestly, I prefer the Fried PB&J we had at the Elite event at Republic, but come on. It's Grilled PB&J!The Bad* Chicken & Waffles - Disappointing. The chicken was not tasty at all. I didn't like the breading and (once again) it was overcooked. The waffle fries were pretty good though.* Octapussy - I don't like the tapioca batter that they use. Skip.The Ugly* Tater Tots - It might be the truffle oil, but these smelled and tasted like gasoline. They were nauseous.You can view their entire tapas menu on their web site: http://bit.ly/jsmallsI'm going with a rounded down A-OK on Johnny Smalls. I'd return if someone suggested it. The decor is trendy and there are definitely some tasty items here. $20 is a good price.

Restaurant name  San Gennaro Feast
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
5 stars last year? What a difference a year makes! This year's experience, pardon my language, sucked donkey balls. Let's break down the formula for the San Gennaro Feast, circa 2012 edition. 1: Parking. Fleece your customers to park sort of close or fleece them a little less and make them walk halfway across the west side of Vegas to get a parking space. 1a: Find the surliest, most hateful parking attendants in Vegas. Hire them based on attitude. 2: Find the most disorganized and slow way of getting people to the gate to pay admission. Did the ice sheet in Antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in? 3: Once inside run past the pushy merchants trying to sell you everything. 4: Pay out the nose for food. No let's take an arm and a leg too. 5: Offer a super tiny itsy bitsy teeny weenie little place to sit and eat your overpriced food. (Think Strip prices but on the wrong side of I-15). Oh wait, we don't want you to sit, that would take up too much space we need for maximum monetization of the event!6: Let's charge way too much for carnival ride tickets. 7: Let your friends cut in front of everyone that waited 20 min for a ride. (Happened 4x)8:Fight hordes of rude, stupid people who must have been born in a barn and don't have a freakin clue about basic courtesy.9: Walk back to your car that was supposedly watched by "security" to find your mirror broken off and dangling and other damage done to your car. Las Vegas deserves a San Gennaro Feast that is in the Italian traditions, not the Mafia traditions. I felt like I got fleeced, mugged, and downright abused at this year's event. Someone needs to step back and rethink what the heck they're doing here. This could be a world class event but the way it's going, this will be the last year I go back. 1 Star, posted under extreme howling protest. Eek! Methinks not, indeed!My Italian family back in Pittsburgh would smack me upside the head if I were to bring them here and then call this an "Italian Festival."  Seriously, all I can hear in my head is my Uncle Vince saying, "What the hell is the matter with you??!"  When you walk in, you are greeted by Republican candidates, real estate agents, and several booths where you can "Spin the Wheel! Everyone is a Winner!"  Once you get past the gauntlet, you find yourself amongst the food.So we started to make a lap around the booths.  I was hoping to find some Italian restaurants from town I could try and maybe grab a slice of pizza.  Instead, I found nothing.  Either it was not vegetarian or had been sitting in the hot sun for far too long.  Ummmmm now what?  We made another lap.  That's when I noticed that none of the booths had a business name on them.  They all just said "Italian Sausage" or "Calamari" or "Pizza."  So this is just a traveling festival and nothing they sell here is local?  LAME.I finally found a local caterer and wound up getting a $5 Caprese salad that came in a Dixie cup with a slice of garlic bread.  I'm still starving!!  I then broke down and went to one of the generic booths selling pizza.  They wanted $7 for a slice that looked like it had been sitting out for the last two hours.  No thanks.  I got an ice cream cone and decided I had enough.  I'm out.On the way out we walked past some circus side shows that involved snakes and monkeys.  I knew I would get too depressed looking at them so I kept walking by.  And then I proceeded to get super depressed watching the poor ponies being forced to walk in circles in the heat without any kids even riding them... or the sheep covered in wool that looked like they were going to pass out from the heat..... Then there went someone selling used hot tubs....and crappy jewelry....and ugly t-shirts....Oh, and did I mention that they also sold Mexican, Greek, and Japanese food here?  There goes my Uncle Vince again....So in short: I have been to Greek, Lebanese, Indonesian, and Hawaiian festivals in this town.  They all represent their cultures well and are made up of small businesses or churches.  The people running this mess apparently think that Italians only eat sausage and old pizza and like to buy used hot tubs.  Needless to say, I will not be returning.My friend had free tickets - if I had actually paid the ridiculous $9 admission and then overpaid for food I'd be way pissed right now. The bacon wrapped turkey legs sounded amazing, but eff paying $16.50! that's worse than Disneyland! We tried mediocre Philly cheese steak, garlic fries. Supposedly homemade ice cream that wasn't creamy like non commercial ice cream usually is. The one and only worthwhile thing was the funnel cake specifically from 1 of the 5 or so stands. They had 6" and 8" but we went with the 4" mini trio $8 including toppings like apples and cinnamon, blueberry/strawberry w cream cheese frosting, bananas, chocolate, bday cake, smores and probably a few others I forgot. It has to be from the one next to the corn stand - the rest were flat and looked like crap. It was packed with probably the most ghetto @ss crowd I've ever seen in vegas. Even w a free ticket I probably wouldn't go back - I can go to olive garden if I want mediocre Italian food. At least they have a/c w free soup and salad

Restaurant name  Rudy's Italian Restaurant and Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Rudy's Italian Restaurant & Bar is as awful a place as I have ever come across. Rudy's has really terrible food, really terrible service, very high prices, and to top it all off, they committed credit card fraud. Allow me to give some details about this dreadful restaurant.TERRIBLE food. We ordered two house salads. The menu describes the "Insalata Rudy's" as "Field greens tossed w/diced pears, caramelized walnuts, raisins & gorgonzola honey dressing". What we got was lettuce w/very unripe, hard and flavorless small cubes of pear. Hardly any walnuts and raisins. And no gorgonzola honey dressing. Instead of any actual salad dressing, the lettuce was coated with oil. Not olive oil. The lettuce was oiled up with unflavored cooking oil. I would guess it was either plain Wesson or canola oil.VERY HIGH prices. When you look at the real cost that you are paying at Rudy's, you feel like a sucker for paying so much for such lousy food. The real cost includes the menu price, plus tax, plus 15% tip. So for two "Insalata Rudy's" you are going to pay over $17.TERRIBLE food. For an appetizer we ordered the "Baked artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and spinach in a roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce". What we got was a few marinated artichokes right out of the marinated artichoke jar that is found on the store shelf. Instead of garden fresh "Baked artichokes" we were served unpleasant, sour, vinegary, marinated artichokes. And the "roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce" never made it to the plate. No sauce at all. This was a truly terrible, way overpriced dish.TERRIBLE food. One entrée special was the "Pan seared Tilapia with a garlic sauce". The fish was not pan seared, it was baked. It was mushy. It was flavorless and was served without the sauce. TERRIBLE service. Our server, first thing, told us that "tonight was half price martini night". When our bill came I noticed that we had been charged full price for two unusually expensive martinis. His explanation was that "half price martini night only applies if you are seated in the bar".CREDIT CARD FRAUD. I discovered that a week after dining at Rudy's someone at the restaurant had increased the amount of the credit card charge by 27 %. This was illegally done without my permission and without my knowledge. The lessons to be learned from Rudy's is that what you read on the menu or are told by the waiter is not what will be served at the table. Once Rudy's has your credit card, they may try to swindle you (as they did me). At the end of the meal you will have overpaid for appallingly bad strip-mall-food.

Good idea, poor execution.Being a 5 minute drive from the house and getting a coupon in the mail was enough for us to give this place a shot.  I like the idea of a very basic concept with few options to start and then you can make it your own after that.  It just didn't deliver.Here's the breakdown:Pros:++ The buns - they are made there, are really light, very tasty and a good size.  I don't like burgers with too much bun!++ Three sizes of burger to choose from - something for everyone.++ Ingredients seem to be pretty fresh++ The regular fries were pretty good++ You get to add your own fixinsSo-So:= The sweet potato fries were a little charred - enough to give them a bitter taste.  They also are thicker cut with skins on (which was okay by me) but could have used a little more salt/seasoning.= The place seemed clean overall, but there were quite a few flies around=They seem to have a decent selection of sweets, but we didn't try anyCons:-- The fixins bar is weak.  Not a lot of fresh produce and they offer shredded lettuce (which I think is messy).  It could use fresh avocado, pineapple, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, etc. Something more than raw onion and two kinds of pickles to dazzle up your burger with.--We both ordered our burgers medium and they were both definitely well done.--Watermelon lemonade was a special drink made that day.  I was excited, but it ended up just tasting like watered down watermelon - should have been more like lemonade with some watermelon than watermelon with some water and a little lemon in it.--It's crazy quiet in there. With no music and not many patrons, it was like a library.--There were about 6 people working this small lil' place which probably could have been run by 2-3.  Team that with the quiet and you felt kind of on display for them all to watch and wait for more people to show up.--Weird hours - only open until 7 and I *think* they're only open M-F possibly M-Sat - definitely not sure on that part though.Mediocre at best.  If they worked out the kinks and revamped some of their stuff, I *might* give 'em another shot - only if I had a coupon again though.This place is great! Outstanding burgers that I crave relentlessly, if you are in the area definitely stop by. Not only is it a great deal but it is incredibly affordable. Go check it out today!

Review Text :
¿Qué más se puede pedir? This is what 5 stars is all about, and yes, I'm doing it after only one visit. ONLY?!? This one visit was a near perfect restaurant experience. ¿Qué más se puede pedir? This is another of my favorite combination of a grungy, old strip mall hiding an absolute gem of an independently-owned eatery. Kind of like a geode in restaurant form. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE is a great place to start. All I was doing was minding my own biddness, reading the menu posted in the front window as I strolled by. (Maybe I was going to the tattoo shop, maybe trails, maybe 7-11, maybe cheba hut, who knows? (oh, yeah - me, but who's saying?(i could, but that's not important right now.))) As I began to get a feel for the menu, but still not quite sure if i'd venture in, Raul opens the door and warmly welcomes me inside. Vocalizations of reluctance are futile, as he insists that I sit inside and cool off, even if just to read the menu, which he places in front of me and offers to answer any questions. He's away and back in a flash with a tiny dish of toasted corn (pic), which he proudly declares is what they give in restaurants in Peru instead of chips and salsa. Along with it, he added a sample of what he called Peruvian 'lemonade', which was actually passionfruit juice -- FRESH juice, with tiny, weird, soft seeds floating in it, and everything! Of course, I was hooked, and he knew it. I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes, and even several photos to help a gringo like me. ¿Qué más quieres? EXCELLENT FRESH FOOD Okay, they've got that in Peru, apparently, and brought some here for us! There are a variety of 'regular' mexican items, but flip that menu over and find another page full of Comida Peruana. A multitude of ways to get your fish, chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, octopus, egg, beef heart, corn, veggies, yucca root, plantain, and spices. quieres más? Seco de Cabrito? (goat stew?) sorry....... only on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. My Lomo Saltido(pic) had beef, chicken, rice, onions, tomatoes, and HOME FRIES mixed with cilantro and other spices to make a tiny amount of an au jus like gravy on the bottom of the plate, which i made sure flavored every bite that got into my mouth. Not greasy at all. Yes, there were chunks of fried potato that really were basically home fries mixed in, and yes, it was absolutely delicious.  I did not even use the two salsas that were offered -- i didn't need them -- but watchout! the samples i had were zoomin' hot. Even the milder green was fiery, but the orange (habanero-tinged?) hotter one was out of my tolerance range! es que todo? NO! Although the hole-in-the-strip-mall setting will turn a few folks away before even getting to the door, "Peruvian Corner" has really put some effort into making the inside inviting and clean. They've used stone and tile and vibrant paint to create an environment a half-step up from the typical stripmall pad turned restaurant.(pic) Ahora estoy contento, VAMOS!

Review Text :
3.5Came here for last call and, for a late night bar, I was pretty surprised to see things so empty. Granted, it was a Monday night but closing time seemed to come a wee bit earlier than my local host anticipated. The bar staff was very pleasant to let us have a drink but there was no atmosphere of which to speak. i imagine that in a more populated time, L'Assommoir could be a very fun place. As it was, my experience there was slightly... awkward which was a buzzkill from the fun I was having earlier in the evening. Rather than the perfect place to end the night, LND became the place where the night sort of just... fizzled.Seeing that it was late and a bit on the cool side, I opted for the Jamaican Espresso: rum, Tia Maria coffee liqueur & cold espresso. There might have been some whipped cream/chocolate action on top. I'm not admitting to anything. The drink was just fine for what it was supposed to be: a dessert nightcap for a late night. The Tia Maria was a bit too bitter for me and even the sugar from the espresso & whipped cream (ugh; admitted) wasn't able to offset it as much as I would have liked. This isn't a drink I'd normally get at a bar but for an after dinner alternative to coffee, it'll do. Sorta. I'd need to come back to LND on a busier night and order a drink drink (maybe some apps as well?) to really get a feel for the type of place it is. As it was, it's a-ok.

Review Text :
Plenty of natural lighting, vibrant color scheme (white and orange), and tasteful decor instantly scores an A on my restaurant decorating score card.  And the cheerful greetings and friendly smiles vaporizes any lingering traces of everyday life stress that you might have brought with you as you crossed over the threshold. As far as I was concerned, I was in near Zen state to enjoy whatever deliciously food the kitchen has to offer from their Restaurant Week lunch menu.As I was seated at my table, I was offered a choice of DW's own beverage creation. I opted for the Pomegranate Iced Tea, which was served in a tall slender glass with a wedge of lemon.  It was refreshing and not at all tart, a great start to any meal or a pick me up after a spa treatment. And below is my review of the three courses served as part of the RW DW Bistro's Lunch Prix-Fixe menu. First Course: It was a tough choice, but I went with the DW Spanish Chorizo with Shrimp & Summer Tomatoes (instead of the Farmers Market Fresh Berry Salad with Grilled Pineapple & Jerk Pomegranate Dressing - which garnered a lot of attention from the ladies at the next table while they were still debating what to order).  With the elegant and not over the top presentation, fantastic flavors from the Spanish Chorizo and nicely cooked shrimp and tantalizing tomatoes, this was easily my favorite item of the meal.  And lucky for me, it is available on their regular menu!Second Course: Trio of Sliders. Maybe it was the whole food truck phenomenon in the past year, but my mind was made up when I read sliders.  Although I did forced myself to read the remaining options, out of standardized test taking habits. The plate of sliders on mini brioche buns and sweet potato fries looks great.  The sliders individually are small (smaller than Slidin' Thru's sliders) but all three of them combined into up a fair amount of food.The first slider I tried was the Jamaican Jerk Pork, which left a noticeable puddle of grease on the plate and underside of the bun. My first and only Fuku Truck burger experience, complete with the horribly grease-soaked buns that I suffered through did an instant replay in my head before I managed to locate the mental stop play button.  Luckily, it was a lot less grease, but still a sharp drop from the excitement from the first course. Slider #2 was the mini-me-sized DW Turkey Burger.  The turkey was juicy, and the mango pear apple chutney combined to make miniaturized fireworks in my mouth.  If the regular sized burger has the same juicy turkey, then I will happily order that again on my next trip back.  Favorite #2!The last slider I ate was the New Mexican Red Chili Pork Slider.  It has a kick to it, but I felt that it was missing something. Maybe crispy fried onions for a little crunchy texture or over-easy quail eggs for the addition of the rich and creaminess of the egg.Third Course:DW Trio of Desserts featuring Red Velet Cake (was good), Lemon-Lime Pudding with a fresh Blueberry (a spoonful is not enough,I want more!) and Jamaican Black Bottom Banana Cream Pie (Not sure if this was what I was served? But the chocolate dominated the other flavors, which wasn't bad as I have a weak spot for chocolates).  Overall, the lunch was good.  Definitely top notched wait staff that flawlessly attend to the guests while they dine.  The appetizers seems to be the star here,at least for me, and I would come back just for that section of the menu alone. Ambiance:  5/5  From the other reviews I am not alone in thinking that they hit a home run with their interior decorating concept and execution.  Care to give me your interior designer and contractor as a referral?Service:  5/5  Just simply pleasant without being over the top.Price:  4.5/5  Looking at the pricing and the portions of the regular menu items, it is a nice lunch spot to go to recharge for the rest of your day.  Items are mostly in the $10-$13 range, which is more than the average lunch specials, but is a great deal considering the upscale surroundings and pleasant service.Food:  4/5  Some items are perfect, others needs some more tweaking are needed. Overall, still great food.Location:  SW Las Vegas.  Pretty far for out-of-town visitors staying on the Strip.  Definitely a cool spot for locals that work or living in the area.Solid 4.5 stars!  I am an excited fan hungry for more.  Burp!Yet another place you can throw into the argument for best local restaurant!  My wife and I have had a hankering for awesome Jamaican food ever since we vacationed in Negril a couple of years ago.  While this place isn't traditionally that, they blend a lot of what makes that cuisine great with their own creative twists to it.  We couldn't start the meal with anything but the Jamaican Curry Soup.  Anthony M recommended we have it the night before along with pretty much every Yelp review and it was tremendous.  I would strongly consider just getting a large bowl of this with a side of rice for my next visit.  In fact, my wife enjoyed it so much, she ordered another bowl of it WHILE eating her entree.  Who backtracks back to the appetizer?I got the oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which was rich and filling.  The jerk spice was jerktastic and the portion was pretty generous.  We went for the "perfect chocolate cake" to finish the meal.  Pretty bold to call it that and while I've had better, it was a nice ending to an awesome meal.Love my neighborhood bistro!Came here the other night for date night! Repeat offender, been here 3 times now... and will be back often since I live down the street from this amazing place!I love bringing my friends here! good place to have dinner with your girls or date night!I've tried everything from their sliders, lollipop chicken, ahi salad, lamb, carrot cake, and I'm always open to trying their main entree of the night and the dessert special of the day. don't forget to try their selection of breads~ yumm!On my last visit they gave me the dessert special on the house! Thanks DW!I'm surprised that a lot of people don't know about DWB! I'm spreading the word! A must in Vegas especially if you live in the area!Indoor/outdoor seating. trendy. great customer service. fantastic food!ilovejewelyn approved!I'll be back soon DWB!love it!- Miss Yelp 2012First and foremost I wish I could give 10 stars... by far THE BEST dining experience i have ever had in Las Vegas.came in this morning and sat at the bar with the bartender San. My bf and i have been in search of a good brunch place in Vegas and we've found our new spot! the decor is simple modern and elegant. DW was also behind the bar and he was so humble and nice! I started out with a Strawberry Ginger drink (its on their specialty cocktail list) it was amazing! so refreshing. then i moved on to a Bloody Marry. Amazing! their Bloody Mary mix is made fresh and it has a jerk spice that really kicks up the classic cocktail. for Brunch i ordered a roasted veggie egg white omelet. by far the best omelet Ive ever had. Roasted squash, peppers, and potatoes. and the various hot sauces they have really made the dish! my bf had the turkey burger. the bread on the turkey burger was so light and fluffy it was so good! we finished our meal with a strawberry mojito, but instead of soda water San introduced us to a Jamaican Soda called Ting. its almost like a Squirt but far better! all in all i cannot wait to go back. we almost came back a 2nd time tonight for dinner haha. Amazing place i will be recommending this to everyone!I saved my 700th review for something righteously outstanding. We decided to square in on something difficult for us to get to normally for our staycation time and this was the one place I was I really wanted.The space is modern and vibrant and it was a lovely day so we sat outside. They had a white peach pomegranate ice tea that is a must order. It's fruity and refreshing. After much back and forth on several attractive sounding dishes and suggestions from our waiter we decide on our lunch. While we waited, he came back with a little amuse bouche of sorts. He wanted us to try some of their very popular curry soup and it was quite nicely spiced and complex. Promising for our food to come.He brought a few bottles of hot sauces to the table that were favorites and explained each one. A place of my heart - I love things to be more spicy as of late! Short rib sandwich was a beef dream. The braise on them was done right and it was tender and juicy and the jalapeno bacon was smoky and really nicely crispy contrast and their ciabatta bread was good and held up to the meats. I threw on some Scotch Bonnet hot sauce on this was it elevated it perfectly. Sweet potato fries were really light and crispy, more like chips in that addictive keep dipping in the chipotle mayo on the side and popping it in your mouth sort of way.The "bowl of the day" was spiced chicken and chorizo bowl with roasted corn and chilies. This was such a hearty portion we could not finish. Lovely spice and I like that the chorizo was crisped up on the edges. This went well with the mango hot sauce on our table and was such a addictive combo. Being Asian I've cooked up just about everything and ordered everything with rice that it's hard to make me think it's the best thing on rice since white on rice. I loved this dish and reminded me of what my carribean creole neighbors mango gumbo fed me as a kid. Gah, nostalgia gets you every time. Since it was our first time there,  our server got us a small slice of their carrot ginger cake to taste. We were full and didn't think we can take more than a bite, but we had to eat it. It was moist, had a very nice balance of spice and the frosting was not too sweet. The raspberry and mango sauces and fresh berries on the plate were perfect accompaniments. I love carrot cake and haven't had one make me smile in a long time. My little heart is pining for some right now. I want a whole cake - none for anyone else. Service here was amazing. Our server Lorenzo was so upbeat and friendly and uber attentive to little details. That's what puts this place over the edge for me was all the small things which is such a rarity. Since it was our first time he told us the story of the place and food, took his time running through the menu populars and his personal favorites when we couldn't make a choice. It's rare that a place goes beyond to make your first time special and wanted us a bite of their star curry dish, try some of their banging carrot cake, brought us favorite hot sauces that pair well with what we ordered. It adds a depth of warmth and thoughtfulness that normally is reserved for regulars and even then is lost on many establishments. Something I expect from  ungodly pricey places, but isn't always delivered. Drinks were always topped off and we were checked on in a very present but not overbearing way. Also when we were handling the check, our ice teas were still to the top and he asked if we would like to take them in to-go cups with us and since it was delish of course we did. It was a nice touch. He also showed us their dinner and brunch menus and hoped we enjoyed everything and come see them to try out their other menus. I have been stingy with 5 stars, and almost never give first visits a 5, but this IS as good as it gets! One of the better dining experiences I've had in this city. Vibrant, exciting food, lovely atmosphere and thoughtful service. I put off going because I never have a reason to be in this part of town, but with a experience this strong this IS the reason to come out of the way here, and come back fast. It may even have to be this weekend.In short, DW Bistro is a fantastic brunch spot.  Here are the keywords/phrases to help you consider whether or not DW is for you: FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, JERK FRIED CHICKEN, and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS.There is always a warm greeting from the hostess and courteous attention from the wait staff. As busy as they get (and trust me, they can get busy--I wish they took reservations), they keep an eye on you (and your BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS).  Even the customers at the bar are FRIENDLY. We met a regular named Randall. He was giving me drink suggestions while we waited for our table. People who frequent this place really care about it and want you to enjoy your experience.  And by the way, Randall was right about the Bloody Mary--it was a bit too spicy for me. I'm glad he asked he bartender to let me taste it first.  It was perfect for my Dad-in-law, so there was something for everyone. Of course I didn't need any help from Randall with ordering the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS. When people linger too long, I believe these drinks are often to blame. This is a place to gather and linger.  That adds to the energy of the place.  I can see how that lingering can be both a pro and a con. We've been coming to DW since they opened. Even from those first visits they were putting out a delicious, high-quality product. DW takes a Caribbean/Southwestern angle with their relatively traditional dishes.  I don't LOVE every dish. But I do enjoy them. Their unique take does lead to some less successful dishes for me. But I so appreciate the creativity and effort.  They always have tasty off-menu specials. This trip we tried the JERK FRIED CHICKEN sandwich and it was divine. I have no idea why it is not a regular item on the menu. It was one of the most tender, flavorful chicken sandwiches I have ever had. My mother-in-law declared it was THE best she had ever had. This is a fabulous local spot. I'm glad they are becoming a popular, regular spot for so many.My guess would be this place is a hit for breakfast or lunch, at least that is what the majority of the reviews are raving about. We stopped in for dinner. The restaurant has a very cool and modern vibe to it. Our server came over immediately and brought out water for us. The water was lukewarm and had no ice, which I found a tad strange. The dinner prices on the menu were on the high side and hence why the lower rating. Their "from the grill" section averaged at about $25 per plate... I just ate a fine dining restaurant on the strip and my entree that absolutely blew me away was $32... so the price at this restaurant threw me off a bit. Simple salad averaged at about $15 here.. You get the point. It was pricey for an off strip restaurant in the middle of a strip mall.I opted for the Jamaican curry chicken bowl with couscous ($14). The portion was huge, the veggies fresh, and the curry was adequate; there really wasn't much kick to it. I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper to my left overs which made it more delicious and less bland. Now, they could have EASILY made the portion half of what it was and had lower price points (this is especially applicable to the higher priced items on the menu). This would affect the marginal willingness to pay of the consumer. But, I digress. Boyfriend had Jerk Chicken Scampi over Linguine ($16), and that was very delicious..but once again the portion was quite large.Our server was great, friendly, and accommodating throughout. They brought us a complimentary slice of their carrot cake, and it was amazing. The gesture was also well appreciated.  I would probably try them for lunch or breakfast again, but this would not be my choice for dinner.My suggestion would be to reconsider the portion sizes, and price accordingly. But, something tells me that most of their revenue is generated during brunch/lunch, and dinner is an afterthought, therefore this business model works for them.Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those "I don't care about money" days. Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.Filet Mignon and Eggs:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0W-jiyxIbSz02IOaeaPnGg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQMy only treat from their pastry basket:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KYkm65GAGeA5Esh3aZ8evQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQVery important for every meal:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HL691i6bSmoft7U-i2hWzA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQArtwork by Pamela Nielsen (cooler than the other side the pillow): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vKEXDzm3KTazmz1B0A-4HQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4rIE47Bzm_rgHMCGQfg0uA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=z1irvA2JCL1C0GFMWQZwXQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQThis year, I've had the opportunity of eating brunch, lunch, and dinner here thus warranting an updated review. Overall, I love the location. It's less than ten minutes from my house and it's within walking distance from my parents' house. Extremely convenient. Also, parking is simple and it's easy to find. Can't ask for more. The food is different, delicious, and fun. Mostly simple and fresh. The atmosphere is hip, upscale, but still casual. Great for a quick lunch or a fun date night. Service is inconsistent. I've had really wonderful service and I've had just okay service. Everyone is really friendly and great. However, I felt they were too overwhelmed while busy during brunch and everyone needs to learn to be more aware and not ignore tables (no one would stop at our table or take our order until I stopped a hostess and we didn't get our seasonal fruit, even though everyone else around us did). And they kept hitting our chairs - I'm never sitting in the middle of the restaurant again.My go-to brunch options:NEW MEXICAN-STYLE SLOW COOKED PORK OMELET ($13): Great flavor in the pork with the New Mexican Red Chile and that's what really makes this dish, plus, the eggs are so fluffy! Finished with jack cheese. The breakfast potatoes are all right. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're flavorless. Not cool. I'd eat that pork any time and on anything though. JERK FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES ($15): The chicken is moist and the batter is great, but the jerk spices are VERY spicy! Thankfully, you have DW's signature maple syrup to cool you off. The waffles have a good batter and the crisp is good, but it's also a bit dry. Hard to eat a lot of it. DW NICOISE ($16): Wonderful assortment of fresh, delicious vegetables (haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, cherry heirloom tomatoes), fresh mango, hard boiled egg, and pan-seared fresh tuna. Brought together with a bed of greens and dijon champagne vinaigrette. Really great. FRESH BLUEBERRY & WHITE CHOCOLATE SCONES ($8): Really moist and flavorful. Delicious!Lunch selections:My favorite lunch selection is the DW BLT ($12) with jalapeno bacon, yellow heirloom tomato, lettuce, and chipotle mayo; served with sweet potato fries. Really delicious! If you want a light lunch option, the DW SIGNATURE SALAD ($9) with baby field greens, caramelized pecans, orange segments, seasonal bell peppers, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette, is nice and a great price.Dinner favorites:DW FRIED CHICKEN ($19) has the same jerk seasoned flour, but unlike brunch, it's served with housemade cornbread and jerk cream gravy. The cornbread is moist and gravy is delicious. Pretty spicy as well, so beware. VEGETABLE CURRY ($14) that has seasonal vegetables and served with rice or couscous. Really good. JAMAICAN CHICKEN CURRY SOUP ($7) is made with New Mexican green chile and jalapeno bacon. It's thick and filling. PAN SEARED SALMON ($22) is served with guava beurre blanc and DW house rice. Salmon is well-prepared, flavorful, love the sweet beurre blanc and it completes the dish. The only dish I've ever disliked was the JERK FRIED CALAMARI ($10 for half order). Jerk seasoned flour with a sweet chile glaze and sweet hot peppers. The calamari was not fresh, the size of dimes, and really tough. But with only one bad dish, I call dining here successful.Also, make sure that you ask about their desserts because the menu is forever changing and always seasonal. Always delicious too. Most recently, I had their PUMPKIN GOAT CHEESE CAKE. So, so good. Great cinnamon, pumpkin flavors with punches of goat cheese. It had a graham cracker crust and dulce de leche topping. Deeeelicious. Grab a slice while you can!Brunch is really popular because of their bottomless mimosa option ($20). They're extremely generous with the champagne and your glasses are constantly being filled. Once, we went when they opened at 10 am and it was already packed! So, weekend brunch is great, but tread carefully because it is VERY busy. Also, it is the one time they don't take reservations. I would recommend sitting at the bar. I had a wonderful experience when I did that.Hmmm. I've been back a few times since my initial review and I debate with myself if I really like this place. The food is hit or miss. The dishes they hit out of the ballpark with are amazing and the flops really flop. I've been here for breakfast/brunch as well as for dinner and on our most recent visit, I was less than impressed with their New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork bowl. The flavors just weren't dynamic enough. It was spicy, but bland which seems weird. The jerk fried calamari was the star of our meal. Just the right sweet to spicy ratio. I have enjoyed a number of their breafast dishes on previous visits, but nothing has stood out as something I need to come back for regularly. Service has been hit and miss on my visits to DW as well. Service is always friendly, but can drag at times.When someone asks for a nice brunch spot, I almost always suggest DW Bistro, so I know I will be back, but I can't say they are the 5-star experience that I had on my first visit.JERK!  Yes, the flavor of Jamaica. It's in 30 percent of the menu.  That said, what's a group of hungry, foodie poker grinders to do?  Order every "jerk" dish of course.Side note:  this is not a Jamaican restaurant rather a contemporary neighborhood bistro.  Large portions, good prices, and friendly off Strip service.  Hits and misses on flavor and preparation but overall a great value.The jerk seasoning, a good spice blend with pronounced allspice flavor that lacks the fiery scotch bonnet peppers heat and floral pepper taste.  Sadly it results in an earthy taste not often complimented by the other ingredients.The run down:Jerk oven roasted baby back ribs with grilled pineapple and a buttermilk ranch sauce - Tender but very earthy in flavor.  The pineapple provides much needed acidity.Jerk fried calamari with a sweet chili glaze - Pass.  Oily, soggy, and a sticky mess.Couscous salad with jerk seared ahi seasoned with a herbaceous pesto, heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese and a hint of truffle oil is refreshing but the fish is previously frozen.  All good, it's natural flavor is obliterated by the seasoning.DW fried chicken with cornbread and a jerk cream gravy - Southern cooking taken a little too far south.  Jerk seasoning has a burnt, dirt taste once deep fried.  Flabby dish.Jerk lamb chops - Excellent.  Cooked to temperature.  The jerk seasoning enhances the natural game and mineral flavor of the lamb.Jerk filet - Very good.  Like the lamb, cooked to temperature while the seasoning enhances the mineral flavor of the beef.Jerk chicken breast - Flavorful but slightly dry.  The orange glaze does not pair well.Overall, a solid neighborhood bistro with a twist.Oh DW, why must you be so far far away?! And why must you only be open for, four, short little hours on Sundays? I guess when it's that good, you have this option. Overall, I would say DW Bistro, is THAT good.My most recent experience was my second time dining here. The first time just me and my other half, but this was a group of ten. It is safe to say if there was not a crazy wait time, I would give this place 5 stars. They do not accept reservations, but often seem to get large parties. Considering they offer bottomless mimosas, I could see why. I went against the mimosa and chose the DW Bloody Mary which comes with olive, lime, a pickle spear, and 3 slices of jalapeno bacon. It has a bearable kick, and could be considered a meal in itself. Among our table I tried the jerk chicken and waffles, the eggs benedict served with NM style pork, pork jerk hash, a caesar salad, chicken flautas, and the vegetable curry.  My personal favs were the flautas, the actual chicken on the waffle dish, and the curry. Never would I had thought to order curry from here, but oh man I am grateful Vanessa N. kept shoving it down my throat cuz it was freaking delish! My first trip was superb customer service. And with the group, I would say almost the same. I noticed a couple things that went missed, but nothing too major. And with a loud group of 10 obnoxious Yelpers, (who may have been tipsy), I cannot complain about the service we received. It sucked having to wait over an hour to be seated. But great company made the time pass. This is a solid choice for some above average New Mexico style comfort food with a kick. I hope DW decides to expand. I would love to see another location in Henderson somewhere.Unique culinary expressions with a New Mexico meets Jamaica flavor in a trendy, up-scale malleable environment including patio, bar, and table dining fashioned for relationship-building and relationship-sharing. Come here to meet other people of a like mind. Make new friends over some appealing libations and luscious culinary treats. This establishment appropriately includes the term "Bistro" as part of its name, and the "Bistro" vibe is as evident and obvious as it is workable. That is to say: go with the flow, relax and ease into things, absorb your surroundings, shake hands with someone new, step out of your comfort zone of the static, stoic, serious, sultry dimly-lit jacket-and-tie lounges and feel the energy of this place.  This venue is incomparable within the Las Vegas culinary community.  It doesn't have to be perfect. It is. As is. That's the greatness of it all. An example of a dinner recently: House Salad: a sprinkle of goat cheese complemented by the candied walnuts over a delicious selection of gathered greens and accouterment.Side of Fried Chicken (1 piece): a crusted chicken breast deep fried with a kick of spice. Just right for that "craving" sized portion as an appetizer, maybe to split!Lamb Chops: Recommended medium rare to medium. The jerk seasoning graces the tenderness of the quality meat.A selection of fresh bakery treats accompanies every meal with an inspired spread.  A respectable and varied wine list and an admirable selection of beers and a half-dozen or so cocktails of the muddled-over-ice variety. First time visitor? You get a piece of cake! Just ask.  "Pickapeppa"-brand condiments on every table. The chef-inspired creations are of higher quality than you will find at most establishments in Las Vegas. For example, veal with pancetta and gravy over braised greens and pan-fried potatoes on special was a luscious cut with just the right amount of heat. The story of this restaurant is worthy of recognition: a Jamaican-born immigrant growing up in New Mexico with a passion for food partnered with a business-minded shaker-and-mover. If you are looking for something else other than that, something else than an independent restaurateur experience, something for discounts or assembly line or union or blandness, just go somewhere else and leave this underappreciated hard working group of wonderful people to the folks that appreciate them for what they are: a strong contribution to the local Las Vegas community. Good date night experience. Good business meeting experience. Good hang out experience. Good eats. Good drinks.This place is the best! I can't even remember how many times I've been here. The staff is fabulous! You can tell that they are happy to work there. You won't sit through your meal without a few table touches from either your server or the owners. So rare of many restaurants nowadays, so refreshing to see owners care about their product and customers. One of my favorites on their menu is their Truffle mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms. This side dish blows my mind. The best mac and cheese ever! Please take my word and order it. Their jerk fried calamari is also excellent. All of their desserts are great except for their red velvet cake. It was incredibly dry and disappointing. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it might have just been a bad day for them. I ordered this at night so it might have been the last piece of a cake that has been out all day. Regardless, it would be unfair to give DW anything but 5 stars.Top shelf dining experience for under $100 per couple! Dinner for two...1) App: Plantains with cayenne and honey 2) Dinner: Salmon 3) Dinner: Oxtail4) Dessert: Pumpkin swirl cheesecake 5) Two glasses of wine Total: $90The service is 5-star and the food is exceptional! Great decor and location! If you want great service EVERY time...just ask for Louis! He is the man and never disappoints! Awesome recommendations and always has the meal on the table quickly and efficiently!2 words for you: UNLIMITED MIMOSAS! For only $20 too! That said, I don't recommend coming here for brunch if you have to be sober and productive later in the day ;) The staff is great, the food is amazing, and did I mention unlimited mimosas?! Just plan to wait for a table cause their Sunday brunch is really popular-not just for the mimosas but for the atmosphere. Plus it's a local joint run by locals so it has that special flair to it.I like my mimosas just like my beach attire... bottomless. I mean over seven hundred reviews and a four and a half star rating, DW is obviously doing something right. From the decor of the venue, to the amazing food, and don't forget the drinks. No wonder this place is always packed. Walking up to DW Bistro you can already feel the buzz and I'm not talking alcohol... yet. On Sundays this place is humming with hungry brunchers, and with an hour wait ahead, why not start starting sippin' on some bottomless mimosas. These will cost about twenty dollars a person, which really isn't a deal bad especially if you're here with a large group. They aren't stingy either, every time my glass was empty, before I could look around for a server my glass was being topped off. We finally sat down and immediately ordered the pastry basket. This is filled with chocolate croissants & blueberry white chocolate scones. The soft pastries were very fresh and surprisingly not overly sweet. This basket is overflowing and will easily feed five people, a great way to kick off the brunch party. With a group five I won't bore you with what everyone ate, I mean it's really all about my snacking skills, right? Kidding of course (NOT REALLY) I ordered one of their "off the menu specials". A Mexican-style slow cooked chicken omelet. This was a delicious, and I didn't feel bad about eating an omelet with chicken inside. I mean who cares which came first. The chicken was super tender and came soaking in a New Mexico red chili sauce with peppers, onions and pepper jack cheese. I would most definitely order this bad boy again. Our service was point and our party never had any issues. We ever stayed after they closed and the servers were still pouring mimosas.  This place is a great local hangout spot and the owner, DW, is awesome. He even topped off a few of our drinks personally. PRO TIP: DW does not take reservations. So if you plan on coming here for brunch on Mother's Day, better get here early! Just sayin!First impressions: the interior reminds me of somewhere a desert cult might hang out to recruit rich members, in a good way. The mostly-white interior with orange accents, lots of windows and light, and small decorative touches like hanging lamps and rustic patio seating all come together in a really nice way. BEST OPTIONSSpanish chorizo with shrimp (app)- incredible, the sauce was similar to a curry and the shrimp were perfect. I'd pay double for an entrée-sized portion and be happy with just that. Fun mix of bread options for dipping.Green chile cheeseburger- Perfectly cooked to medium, massive portion, good variety of flavors. The jalapeno pepper bacon makes this dish. Side it with the salad, which has a light dressing, walnuts, and goat cheese. Sweet potato fries are for suckers.New Mexico Spicy Pork Bowl- the most disappointing of the "good" dishes. I'd get it for the great value ($14 for a 2 pound bowl that will last you three more meals) and because the spices remind me of a dish my mom used to make with brisket... but it doesn't actually have much flavor. Eggs weren't cooked properly (one under, one over) and they don't actually go with the other ingredients. Hearty and comforting but underwhelming.SKIP THESEChicken Flautas- these were accidentally brought to our table, then comped, but tasted like they were out of a box in the frozen section. Not particularly crispy or flavorful, but plated in a fun way. Not a fan of the filling.Jerk Shrimp Salad- the shrimp is blackened to greatness, but the salad itself fell flat. Dressing was bland and didn't tie the elements together. Ate less than half.DW Bloody Mary- $12 glass, split among our table of 3, still didn't finish it. The drink is 1/3 garnishes (love that jalapeno bacon!) and the beverage itself is nicely spicy, but it wasn't great and we agreed we wouldn't get it again.Service was professional. Most other parties appeared to be drinking heavily during their visit, so this is probably best experienced as a brunch place. Not sure if Id return without someone else suggesting it.This place doesn't need any more reviews. I just came here to praise the service. I set up a brunch for a friend's birthday for 14 people. The table the set us at was too small and we literally had no room -- so they moved us to an empty room so there was much more space for us. Perfect. We figured that since they only opened it for us, we'd get less service. Nope. These dudes/dudettes were on top of it. They were constantly checking up on us; refilling our drinks without even having to ask, and the food was out so quick. I didn't even mention that it was my friends birthday, but they brought her some cake anyways. I've been here quite a few times for brunch and this is why. Always excellent service, food and I love the atmosphere. I love this place. Probably my #1 spot for brunch in Las Vegas.During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited DW Bistro again for lunch on a Sunday.  The place was jammed packed, which is always a good sign.  We had eight people in our party making the wait for a table even more challenging.  The person (I think he is one of the owners) who checked us in was so friendly and welcoming that we trusted the fact he said it would not be too long, and he was correct.  DW Bistro has a pretty cool check in system that sends a text indicating your name has been recorded and when your table is ready. After being seated, they offer all you can drink mimosas for $20.  After a hectic weekend, we went with pomegranate iced teas, and one person had an amazing Bloody Mary.   The pomegranate iced tea was super refreshing, and the Bloody Mary was exciting.  The Bloody Mary comes with a garnish containing an olive, a pickle, and a piece of bacon...yes a piece of bacon.  There was certainly nothing boring or routine about the Bloody Mary. I started off with the Chicken Flautas as an appetizer.  The flautas were spicy enough, and the chicken inside was perfect.  The presentation was equally impressive.  My main course was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Waffles with homemade syrup.  Do not be concerned when you see the coating around the chicken.  The coating is dark, thick, but it is so delicious.  The coating is complex and contains several Jamaican spices.  Others in our party went with the Eggs Benedict, and they indicated it was delicious as well.  The item is served on fresh biscuits and a side of potatoes.  In regards to the service, it is clearly five stars! If you find yourself in south Las Vegas near Summerlin, you must give DW Bistro a try.  On the other hand, if you need some time away from the strip, drive 15 minutes south and enjoy the unique dishes that DW Bistro has to offer.

At Ondine, when you see food, eat it.One of Edinburgh's top seafood restaurants.   Elegant setting, properly appointed, pressed linens, and well-dressed patrons ready to get their hands dirty diving in to piles of Scotland's best seafood.Straight to it, uber fresh cold water oysters are to die for. 4 to 6 different species, each with its well-defined salinity and incredible creamy texture like nothing available in the States. All show a very clean oceanic finish. It's liquor like sea water accented with just a squeeze of lemon.Do not pass on the roasted shellfish platter. New Haven lobster claws, barely warmed through oysters, roasted Dunbar crab (similar to Florida stone crab), Mull scallop in shell, piles of east coast cockles, sweet, succulent razor clams, plump, fatty creamy Shetland muscles, and tender Tarber Langostines all cooked in rich creamy Scottish butter, a splash of wine, and parsley.  A mountain of seafood for 2 to 4 to share. Simply put, outstanding.  Each item is cooked separately to proper doneness then assembled together for serving. The simple preparation brings out the best flavor of each shellfish.Still craving more? A plate of grilled scallops. Presented and still attached to their own shells. A broad bean purée adding a vegetal touch that heightens the sweetness. Sausages of pork and offal adds a subtle metallic flavor that accentuates further the clean oceanic characteristic of the scallop.The lemon sole, gently crusted with breadcrumbs lemon peel capers and parsley then fried. Crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Sautéed brown trim adds a deep "shrimpy" flavor that greatly enhances the flavor of the fish.Finally a Scottish classic, haddock and chips. What to say. Perfectly cooked. The classic minted pea puree further enhancing the mild flavor of the fish.Very well chosen selection of European, old world wines at very reasonable prices.   Average bottle price £40.Extremely friendly, proper, efficient and accommodating service.Reservations two months in advance required.In a word, wow!

Just LOVE this place!  I always get the all-you-can-eat buffet which has an amazing range of food choices for all kinds of eaters.  The meat section has a variety of chicken, beef, lamb, and goat dishes.  For vegetarians like myself, about a third of the food bar is made up of different veggie-only dishes--my favorite being the Paneer Tikki Masla--I always go back for a second helping!  The servers (who are all very attentive and pleasant) bring out a steady stream of hot garlic naan bread--which is my second fave thing there!  They also have a small salad bar and mango lassi, mango custard, and rice pudding for dessert.  If you go for dinner, they bring tandoori chicken to your table along with the naan--so if you're vegetarian, make sure you tell them not to bring you any from the get go!  Bollywood music videos play on all the TV's.  The place can get pretty packed around peak lunch and dinner hours, so go early!  Lunch buffet costs $8.95 and dinner buffet runs $9.95.  Pretty decent prices for amazing all-you-can-eat Indian food.  Definitely the best around!Hoh. My. Goodness. How I have missed you Indian Food. A trip to India Oven should be on everyone's "Must Do List". Buffet style (unless you wish to order an entree) has hidden dangers. You might eat too much.  The food is clearly labeled into groups. (Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, Salads and Dessert). I recommend diving in unless you feel strongly about eating a particular type of meat. I sampled (like a pack of starving dogs) every item and enjoyed every bite. My pants may not fit, but that has nothing to do with my ability to write. (Full Disclosure: I have eaten tons of Indian food in my hey day.) As the restaurant serves Northern Indian cuisine spice is not a concern. Food items were moderately (to mildly) spiced and the majority were cream based. Dishes were well balanced with ghee (or whatever oil is used). Naan is delivered to the table as is tandoori chicken. (Just try it kids! You'll like it.) Rice is available at the buffet. I was surprised to find mango lassi (a yogurt drink) and chai tea as part of the buffet price. ($12 total during dinner.)India Oven prefers to have groups pay on one check. However have no fear! Our large party was individually able to pay directly at the cashier. However, that might have been possible as we all ordered the same thing. (Buffet!)Thank you India Oven for hosting our very large group. Yelp International Supper Club UYE rocked!After having gone to India Oven a few times now, I'm updating my review for their buffet to 4 stars. I think it's great that they have it for dinner as well which is fairly uncommon to see for an Indian restaurant. For $12, you can have some good Indian food. The highlights of the buffet are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and the paneer tikka masala. Other solid options are also the palak saag, samosa, and pakoras. Everything is mildly spicy. The garlic naan that's brought out is always piping hot, soft and fluffy. I go mostly just for that!Unlike other buffets, their desserts are also pretty good. They have carrot halwa and gulab jams which are served hot. Both are good.I can't give it 5 stars because the service is sometimes on the slow side. I've noticed that when you go in a group, it takes a little bit to get naan and for them to clear plates, get the check, etc.

02/21/11Came here after reading Linda W.'s delightful review.  Had the green tea, gyoza (potstickers), beef and pork egg noodle combo, and a strawberry boba shake.  The gyoza app was good, though the six pieces were too small to share, BUT they were definitely MUCH better than those I'd found at China Magic Noodle House!  The noodle dish was good... preferred the BBQ pork over the beef pieces, but the leftovers weren't as good-- I threw them out after the first bite.  The homemade boba shake was a very nice surprise... creamy and a bit too sweet for me, so I stopped after about a third of it.  Many of the boba (tapioca rounds) were too big to pass through the straw, and that straw was HUGE, as straws go, and that was another reason for me to quit trying.  What I didn't like was finding a bit of plastic in my mouth after taking a big slurp-- the shake was made on site, then mechanically topped w/ a plastic wrap cover that had to be broken w/ a straw in order to drink out of the cup- blech!  Having written all that, I'd order another shake in the future, and I'll be sure to share it w/ a friend, or two!

Not every meal in Vegas is going to be over the top. Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat after laying by the pool all day. Bonanno's is located at the Food Court in the District. It is convenient to the MGM Pool Complex. Also, they are open late(maybe 24 hours? They do serve breakfast)Just had a quick slice of pizza, but it was delicious, cheap, and quick. Exactly what I was looking for. Great option for a late night snack too since most places in the area stop serving food around Midnight.

Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!Thanks to Groupon, I found this place.

I don't know what all the fuss is about CiCi's pizza?Finally gave it a shot and wished that I had not given it a second thought.It's not even that cheap, if you consider the total after drinks are added.The quality is just not there of course. Not going to find anything gourmet in their AYCE buffet.I guess I am one that prefers quality over quantity.The $18 bucks or so we spent for two was not worth it by any means.I am not a fan of cheese covered cardboard which is their version of pizza.Oh well I tried it, now I know what it is all about.Life will go on without ever consuming their cardboard cuisine again.Enough said...

Review Text :
Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.Do NOT believe the hype. I have been here four times.  Each time something worse happens. I'm not sure who is to blame for the poorly behaved and badly trained wait staff, but one thing I can say for sure, after the fourth visit, is that the poor service and way below average food quality are definitely consistent!My last (and final) visit to this restaurant included:  frozen, reheated crab cakes, that were disgusting; an 11.00 spinach salad that consisted exactly of spinach, six raw walnuts, and 5 pieces of artichoke hearts;  and then there was the entree.  The entree was our final knife in the gut and pocket book.  We ordered the lobster and steak special.  We specifically asked the waiter for a filet cut of steak.  He served us a small piece of grisly meat that my giant, sharp, steak knife, literally could not cut through!  When we told him it was not filet, he was condescending and rude and acted like we didn't know what we were talking about!  Grrr!  We were highly insulted that they would pass this horrible quality and poorly made menu items off as authentic Italian cuisine. If that is authentic Italian cuisine, no one would ever lay claim to it!The manager half heartedly apologized, although she seemed more worried about upsetting the condescending waiter than she was concerned about our horrible experience, and she removed the uneaten special from our bill.  I have not ever wrote a bad restaurant review, however, they should not be able to get away with this in a city filled with amazing restaurant options.   I hope that they can address their issues and be an asset to our community in the future.This review is for the deli.I had been wanting to try this place and was surprised to find out they have a deli and restaurant! From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left. I ordered a "Sicilian Sandwich" priced at $6.99 and a "Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of "Pecan Cheesecake" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set. The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point. I enjoyed the sandwiches and dessert enough to return! Inside was clean and the employees were very friendly and helpful.I had no idea they had a nicer resaurant side and a deli & bakery on another. Now that I do, I will be stopping in more for lunch. I always see the parking lot packed with cars when driving by so my wife and I decided to check it out. The deli & bakery side has glass cases of breads, cakes, cookies etc. I originally wanted a sausage sandwich (the sausage is made fresh at the restaurant) but they were out for the day so we ordered a meatball and Sicilian sandwich. Both were good and affordable. The meatball sandwich was cheesy and the sauce had a good taste. I don't know how many meatballs are supposed to come on it but they weren't shy with them at all. The Sicilian sandwich had a lot of flavor for not looking like much. There was either an Italian dressing or maybe oil and vinegar on it but whatever it was I liked it. The bread on the sandwiches was good but I picked out a loaf of bread from the bakery and it wasn't as soft and fresh tasting as I hoped for. I will pick out a different kind next time and give it a try. Good to know there is another solid sandwich in town.Las Vegas has roughly 5000 delis- this is tone of he best.Half of the building is an upscale restaurant and half is a grocery/deli you can dine in- immediately turn to your right upon entering to to to this section. The other half is basically for upscale dinner-quality dates.The bakery-deli-grocery has everything you could possibly need from fresh pastas to calamari salad to real canned peeled San Marzano tomatoes for kitchen adventures and more marinated artichokes, olives, and peppers than you can shake a stick at.Order at the back counter for takeout or dine-in: the first sandwich listed on the "hot" page is what you want to get. It's a chicken cutlet with spinach, fresh cheese, and God only knows what else, and it's frickin' amazing.Runner up is the Sicilian sandwich, the first listed on the "cold" page, with ham, Genoa, and mortadella with mozzarella- get it with everything on it. Fresh crunchy veggies, complementary spices and oil, and the freshest and most flavorful meats and cheeses I've yet encountered.  Both sandwiches are made with the freshest, most delightful french roll bread. Oh, and they're frickin' huge. Like half of a single sandwich is an entire meal, huge.If that's not enough for you, there are two cases of desserts and the service is phenomenal- be sure to get the guy with the thick black-framed glasses, he's delightful! And they have both regular happy hours (3-7PM, daily) and reverse (Mon, Tues, Thurs, 9PM to close) with half price drinks and apps.This review is for the deli only.  I wanted to make something different for family that was staying with us.  My neighbor recommends this place highly so I gave it a try.I bought some boxes of frozen stuffed shells made in house and a container of their house made marinara sauce.  The result when I baked the shells was very good.  I took a look at the other frozen pastas they have, and while the price seems higher than supermarkets. I think the quality is higher.Service was just OK.  Even though it was an hour before closing and no one else was in the store, I had to wait to ask a question until the two young guys on duty finished the conversation they were having.  After looking at me, one of them turned back to his co-worker and continued the conversation.  I was going to give the deli 4 stars, but I deducted one for the lackadaiscal service.While out and about early on a Sunday looking for a bite to eat we saw their tiny lit up sign in the window that read "OPEN".  I looked at the hubs and we thought...why not!  They offer a full menu on Sundays along with a brunch menu. We decided on a full meal rather than brunch.  I split the small chopped salad that tasted great!  It was full of fresh cut meats and cheese along with some red onion and garbanzo beans.  All tossed in their great tasting caesar dressing.  I had the rigatoni bolognese.  The serving was HUGE and was incredible.  We were served some bread that tasted fresh!Service was spectacular!  Our water glasses were filled multiple times.  I look forward to stopping my their deli in the near future or even planning a night out with my husband.  This place has a great warm ambiance.  I noticed they have a nice looking bar too!

Can't say as I was impressed.  They are going to have to improve the ordering system if they plan to survive.  I can get table service an comparable places for the same, or lower price.  We waited in line for 20 minutes (we were only third in line) just to give our order, and only then did they open up a second register well after the line had snaked out the door.  Even then, the cashier (for lack of a better term for her) was robotic, and constantly interrupting us mid-order.Once ordered, we waited a normal amount of time for how busy the place was.  The chocolate shake was bitter, the fries arrived cold, and my wife's Infusion burger was less than spicy.  My classic was supposed to be medium (the "chef's recommendation") but it was more raw than anything else.I would try it again, but this place is on a short leash, as not many people will make a second trip out there unless the service and quality takes a huge step forward soon.  If you like a drive and a burger, your better off going to Greasewood Flats.Kind of a cool retro vibe inside with digital screens for menus.  I was excited until the lush experience began....Don't bother asking the cashier questions about the food.  She acted like they were slammed....1 party of 4 behind me.We waited over 30 minutes for our food (fast-casual??).  This includes sodas!  We were told we were supposed to get the drinks after ordering.......well the cashier was in such a hurry to get rid of us and she never gave us drinks or told us to wait for them.......very weird and confused set up.  They were not busy.  My burger was dry and not even close to medium.  No one at my table said anything positive.  How hard is it to cook burgers?The fries were greasy and soft....not sure if this is what they're going for?  Not for me.Burgers are $8 - $12 dollars.  An extra $4 gets you (or is supposed to get you) a drink and greasy fries.....put a salad, shake, or dessert on top of that and you're looking at $20 per person!!!  Ridiculously overpriced.  Low quality.  No flavor.  I will NOT be back nor will my fellow diners.

I was really disappointed by this place. I went as a double date on a Friday night. Tim had been here before and really enjoyed it. I tried to make a reservation, but was told that they only take them for larger parties (6 or more) - and that if I wanted a guaranteed table, I should show up before 7 because there is typically a 45 minute wait.Harley and Matt arrived slightly before Tim and I and our bottle of wine. However, they were able to easily secure a table. They said the host took a while to appear to seat them and answered the phone a few times before acknowledging them.There was a ridiculously long wait for water and wine glasses. We didn't even get a bread platter. Our waitress was kind and gave us some recommendations from the menu. Other than that, we did not see her the entire meal until it was time for us to pay. Our food was dropped by the host and a busboy. We refilled our own wine and water. Someone gave us a bag of burnt bread with our entrees. The food was bland and not very good - the guys enjoyed theirs, but Harley and I did not enjoy ours. I had the lobster risotto - it was overpowered with chewy lobster. And that is something one would not normally say about a lobster dish. I was starving after finishing my plate and choking down two pieces of charred bread. I ordered beignets for the table, hoping to give e2 a second chance...but the beignets were chewy and bland.We left very quickly.

Review Text :
Just returned home from having dinner here w/ Mom tonight.  I've wanted to try Ocean Trail ever since I heard about a new sushi place opening up at Talking Stick Resort six weeks ago.  The resort opened on Tax Day, April 15th, and Ocean Trail was supposed to open a couple of days after, but its first day was actually Thursday, the 22nd.  The sushi menu was discarded and was replaced by a Creole/Cajun- style seafood.  Specialties include pan-roasts w/ a lobster-based broth finished w/ tomato cream and gumbos, roux-based stew containing andouille sausage and chicken.  You may choose to add chicken, shrimp, crawfish, crabmeat, or oyster, or a combination of whatever strikes your fancy!  (Prices start at around $15.)  The elegant, pearlized one-page menu lists a few starters, such as oysters-on-the-half-shell ($9 1/2 dozen and less than $18 for a full order) and lump crab cocktail ($14.75), and P.E.I. mussels w/ a garlic-wine broth, salads (half- and full orders) and chowders (a New England clam chowder, which I sampled and found delicious, and a corn chowder that looked amazingly creamy and decadent!), the said pan-roasts and gumbos, plus $5 (approx.) sides of red beans, red beans and rice, rice, and steamed collard greens.  Croutons aren't housemade, nor is the wonderfully-balanced caesar salad dressing, but the desserts (no set menu thus far- this week's selections are chocolate cake, berries and cream anglaise, and a key lime tart- so you'll have to check in weekly to see what the pastry chef, who used to create pastries for Casino Arizona's McKellips location, creates.  (If you've ever tried the delightful desserts served at the Eagles Buffet, then you know what she's capable of.)For dinner, we had the crab cocktail, a small order of caesar salad, and berries and creme anglaise for dessert.  The salad was perfectly dressed w/ a nice amount of parmesan tossed in, the romaine lettuce was crisp, and the croutons crunchy and light, and there weren't a gazillion of them, either.  (I feel so cheated when a salad has too many croutons.  I say, light on the bread and give me more veggies!)  The crab cocktail was also very nice, but I'd have preferred a bit more lump crab and less of the homemade remoulade (mayonaisse-based w/ capers, celery, onion, black pepper, dijon mustard, and Old Bay seasoning, among other seasonings).  The martini glass it came in must have contained 2/3 remoulade and a 1/3 of the actual crab.  While I wouldn't agree w/ Mom that we could get this and the salad at any Red Lobster, I did see how paying $15 for this item was a bit too steep.  (I had noticed that the menu at the Blue Coyote Cafe, located on a lower level, also offered a lump crab cocktail for $12.25, but upon inquiry was told that the host imagined the one served above would be "more flavorful."  I'd like to find out if there is a difference.  I'll keep you posted.)  We were also served a big "cone" of table bread and a side of butter.  Just a plain white bread roll, sliced and warmed, but it paired well w/ the crab cocktail and salad.  Thank goodness for the berries and cream.  It was the only item we ordered that Mom didn't shake her head at (she thought the menu was overpriced).  This ambrosial dessert consisted of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries sitting on a well of creme anglaise (a rather shallow well, I thought), and topped w/ homemade whipped cream and a very pleasing rolled cookie.  I inquired about the other two desserts, and we really fell for the description of the chocolate cake-- a slice of four-layer cake w/ a chocolate ganache filling.  Mom isn't opposed to coming back to try the cake :)Loved the blue-tiled walls, marbled round counter, and light fixture above the bar, but have to agree w/ Mom that seeing the serving bowls, open pots and double-boilers, and metal food containers did take away from the gourmet dining experience.  Having to choose to sit at the "back" of the round counter, away from the casino floor, and the excited slot machine player, also lessened the enjoyment of the cool atmosphere that Ocean Trail offers.  However, chatting w/ the chefs and bartenders does add to the fun experience, if you just keep an open mind to enjoying your stay here.This is by far the best bang for your buck without sacrificing quality in this Valley when it comes to Oysters and Chowder.I have eaten at the place on at least 5 seperate occasions. It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's, with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils, and cajun concoctions.First off, the Oysters on the Half Shell are reasonably priced, as fresh as I have had here in the Valley, and everytime that I have ordered them, they have been consistently fresh. I'm not sure that type of Oysters they serve off the top of my head, but they are great!As for the Clam and Corn Chowder, they are both amazing for the Valley of the Sun! The clam chowder has a great consistency, and does not have that taste of fishy, canned clams. The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent, and the clams are just a nice tender, mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup. The Oyster crackers that they garnish the chowder with are actually seasoned, and are very tasty.The Shrimp boil is another favorite dish. They boil the shrimp in a Citrus, Lobster Stock and finish it with a Tomato Cream sauce. They serve most dishes with crusty sliced bread so you can soak up and enjoy the juices of the dishes.The only thing that I am not a huge fan of, was the crab salad slider. I'm not going to knock the rating down, as everyone else loved them, and the presentation was great. I think that it just wasn't what I was looking to have at the time.When you visit, you will most likely have the pleasure of a very nice woman of asian descent cooking your food directly over the bar in front of you. She goes by the name of Tip, which looks as if it's the first three letters of her extremely long first name on her name tag. You will quickly notice that she puts a large amount of love into her food preparation. Chat with her, she is a sweetheart, and deserves compliments on her work. Tip her out on the side if you care to, as the tips are only pooled by the servers at this restaurant. The manager, Frank deserves a couple of bucks for seating you and taking your order, but in my opinion the one who prepares the meal should get the majority of the reward for the culinary experience that they provide, but that's just my opinion. :)  Frank is an East Coast guy with a stratight face and $500 haircut, but trust me, he does have a sense of humor, give him a hard time..lolOne last thing, and I will cut this short. The specials that they served on Easter and Fathers Day, consisted of a one and a half pound lobster with claws, caesar salad, and red velvet cake for around $30.If you decide to order the Collard Greens, make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper, with bits of swine for flavor, as well as a bit of vinegar. It may not sound so great to the untrained tongue, so I suggest you give them a shot and teach your tongue a lesson.Cheers! :)This is my new favorite restaurant. This is the perfect date restaurant and the perfect try something new restaurant. While the menu is small, the food is amazing. I have been three times now and tried several thing and they are all better than the previous! My favorite so far is the shrimp boil. The ettouffee is also very good, better than mine! Oysters and shrimp cocktail are also some of the best I have ever had. This is a very small restaurant but worth the wait. I like sitting at the oyster bar and watching them make all the dishes. The red beans and rice are just as good as I had in New Orleans! The only dish I haven't tried is the gumbo and that is up next on the list for me. They let you pick the spiciness of the dishes you order. I get a 4 which is a little hotter than tobasco sauce which is how they explain the levels to you. 3 is tobasco. Service is really good. Prices are very reasonable for seafood and the portions which are huge. I always have some to take home which I just make some rice and have a whole other meal!

This is a good location. I've never been to a Subway where the staff was friendlier. They really hook up a nice loaded sandwich and sometimes after hanging out downtown I like to stop here for a cold cut combo. No casino marks up here I got my cold cut combo for $5 plus tax. There is seating and the area was clean. I don't know what this Subway is doing so different but other locations could take a lesson because this is a great Subway!

This self-serve frozen yogurt shop is located at Mandalay Place (right where Mandalay Place meets Mandalay Bay).  They had a decent though not great variety of flavors and toppings (fruit, nuts, candy bar, and Ghirardelli syrups; surprisingly, they were missing cereal).  The frozen yogurt (like chocolate and pumpkin) was okay--pretty good flavor and firm enough but not icy texture.The problem with this frozen yogurt shop is that it is quite expensive ($0.49 per ounce).  While that high price should not be too much of a surprise considering that Yogurt In is located in Vegas, this place's quality and variety alone would put it in the average to below average range when compared to other frozen yogurt shops.They also sell crepes here.  Service was quick and fine.Mandalay Place has a complimentary parking structure.  Complimentary valet parking is also available.

3.5 stars -- Somewhat reminiscent of Sidebar, this place has potential! I'd venture to say adding a happy hour is about all I need to bump it to 4 stars. (Of course, a crowd would be cool too but I'm sure the owners want that even more than I do! So, get out there, guys!!) Last night, I enjoyed a scrumptious keylime martini ($8) which went down way too easy and a glass of Hey Mambo ($8). Snack categories range from bruschetta ($3 a piece) to house made potato chips ($3), pizzas and nachos to hummus and grilled veggies (mostly $8-9). We ordered the potato chips which were well salted and not too greasy, but they were a little slow to come from the kitchen which appears to be shared with its sister, Il Posto. The Lounge offers a chill vibe. In addition to the funky furniture and light fixtures, Magic 8 balls are scattered through the room -- Fun conversation starter! Morris J. is right, the beer selection is mediocre but if you're looking for a cocktail or a glass of wine, this place is a real neighborhood gem!!I joined my gal pal Chrissy P for a drink at The Lounge last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Like she said, it is definitely the Sidebar of Sunnyslope!We had great, friendly, attentive service from Chris (and he wasn't rough on the eyes, ladies!!) and he was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks.I opted for a red wine flight and was pleased with the selection. There were two cabs, two zins, a red, a pinot noir, a merlot, two malbecs, and another choice or two. Mostly from California. The flight was $9.They had a ton of variety of chairs and areas to sit, which was really awesome. You could sit on the high-tops, share a table for four in big white contemporary chairs, grab a normal table by the window, or opt for these really huge oversize comfy purple chairs, which we did. Mellow lounge music played over the speakers and there were several TV"s with relevant sports on. The Magic 8 Balls were a cool touch. The place has a really good vibe. I dig it. The food selection was made of appetizers, but unfortunately as a gluten free vegan, all I could eat were the freshly made potato chips. By unfortunately I mean "THANK GOD" because they were delicious!Overall I am really jazzed about this place! A quick five minutes away from my house, this is the perfect way to wind down from a stressful day!I hope they adopt a happy hour and add some more vegan items to the menu and I will become a regular!My apologies for taking so long to update my review! 3.5 stars - pshaw!Probably my favorite neighborhood stop for a cocktail! GREAT drinks -- just tell Chris, the bartender/host, what type of drink you like and he'll hook you up with some sort of fantastic concoction! The service is outstanding. Always striving to ensure we're having a great time and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Even "opening" the kitchen after it had closed for us to get some late night eats!And there's happy hour, now!!

Review Text :
This place served me comfortably the best Sunday roast I've sampled in Edinburgh, so far. A quirky little spot, which I imagine suffers slightly from being a little betwixt and between places, it really is worth seeking out, as the kitchen is serving up some really top quality fare.Overall, we said: "I was delighted with Elbow. I'm sorry not to have discovered it before now, as I'm often asked for Sunday brunch/lunch recommendations, and I know many people who would be as highly delighted with this place as I was, today. For sure, it goes right to the top of my list of recommendations as a great place to spend a Sunday, particularly when you're feeling the need for a hearty roast."The nights are drawing in, and this makes me want nothing more than good food, good company; and make that comfort food! In fact make it a Sunday Roast... for 10 people please!Turns out that Elbow do a Sunday Roast with all the trimmings for £8.95. It's "there till its gone" as the menu states, but when I called up to book a table for "8 for the Sunday Roast" they made enough Roast for us all. It was only 5 of us that went ahead and ordered the Roast in the end but there was enough for all!And what a Roast it was. Chicken, with gravy, potatoes, brocolli, carrots, and a yorkshire pudding. The broccoli was actually delicious as it had been cooked in garlic, as had the chicken. There were also two full breasts on my plate. So much chicken, for £8.95!I then had the Whisky Cranachan for dessert and it was nice. The crumble looked delicious, as did the Elbow Mess. All in all, everyone around the table was very satisfied with the Sunday Roast or Sunday lunch of some sort. Not a scrap of burger was left on the plates, or chorizo and prawn salad; and the chips were cooked in duck fat! (also all gone).I caught a peek at the menu, and they had a pretty tasty looking brunch menu too, as well as a tempting "catch of the day served with duck fat chips".The waitress seemed a little put out that we were there, I can't tell why (perhaps that we didn't all order roast?) although she had been lovely on the phone when I booked. I will be back, and I do hope we hadnt put it her off kilter in someway. We were just a hungry bunch of folk looking for a friendly Sunday Roast together. I'd highly recommend it for a great value, good feed!

Let me start by saying this is a review for me and for another guest whom I do not know.First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.Needless to say I will not be going back. My meal was plentiful but not well prepared nor flavorful.

Review Text :
Forgive me Yelp community, but I had to do it.  I have heard about the Vig opening a new location for months.  Many friends were telling me about the location.  A good yoga friend is actually the designer on the project.  For these reasons and that I really wanted a Vig Azz Burger today(with the fried egg), I had to be there for the FTR.  This place is a goldmine, literally, it was a site of a former neighborhood bank.  I mentioned that on the review that was offered after the meal and my willingness to invest ( i wish...)!  Ask for Raven, she will take great care of you.Imagine the Vig Arcadia, with more of an indoor/outdoor feel and the prerequisite bocce court.  The vibe is similar, yet more open.  From the moment you chance upon the exterior, your not quite sure what is to come.  The anticipation builds, so no interior photos for you on this review!  You have to visit and see for yourself!  I like that and much more.  There is even a firepit!   Go once, go back, go often, but first, just GO to the Vig Uptown, you will not be disappointed.The Vig Uptown is a textural dream. For me? This will definitely be a recurring one. Maybe it was the unique "cactus columns" upon walking in or the herb garden to the left, but there is truly something charming and down to earth about the new Vig location.Do some research and modern enthusiasts will quickly find that the remodel of The Vig Uptown was originally Ralph Haver's AIA Award winning 1961 Arizona Bank building. Sweet....The Vig's food is pretty good. What's great about their menu is that they offer a range of dishes to choose from (many items the same from the Arcadia Vig) so surely there is something for everyone.I always seem to drink wine when I'm at the Vig Arcadia but I couldn't look past the "Take Bethany Home" (Clever!) with Crop Organic Cucumber Vodka, Watermelon Puree, Fresh Lemon & Agave Nectar. A fantastic name with a drink to match.The booths at this place are huge, great for happy hour (1/2 off Apps and $2 off drinks) We sat at the tables by the bar but the patio looked fun and I'll have to feel that space out next time.True to it's predecessor, although it was the "soft opening" there was already the parking nightmare we've all come to know and (not) love about many places in the valley. But surely, a good dream is always worth revisiting.1st experience at the new Vig was great. I sat outside and had a very friendly server, she was prompt and personable. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but worthy of a second try. The new Vig is pretty cool, very similar set up to the Arcadia one, nice open patio and Bocci ball court. 2nd experience at the Vig was awful!! The service was horrendous, but let me back up... I arrived just before 6 and attempted to pull in to the parking lot.. I saw the valet guys making wild hand gestures to cars, but wasn't really sure how to interpret them. Cars were honking trying to get past me on 16th street, I pull in and they tell me the valet is full and I have to park across the street, another valet has parked a car in front of me and there were already 2 cars that pulled up behind me. Where was I going to go? I finally was able to get out and park across the street, and when I walked over I saw about 3 other cars going trough the same ordeal. Here is a tip - Put a sign out saying Lot Full. It's not brain surgery, its Valet parking.I got in and joined our table of about 20. We had one server for our table, he was flustered and had a really bad attitude. He seemed to be only serving half of our table. It took him 25 minutes to make his way over to us and take our order.. Well partially, he took my order an then ignored everyone sitting next to me. He actually ignored Nathan for about half an hour.. At one point he turned to some one and said "You'll have to wait because everyone is yelling at me at once" Sorry buddy, maybe you should have more than one person serving us if you can't handle it. Yes my food is getting cold and no you still haven't brought me that fork I asked for 10 minutes ago. Better yet why don't you take it out on the customers here. What an ass.  In addition to the service, they ran a charge for $348.00 on my card. It didn't actually post as a charge because they caught it, but it took away from my available credit in my checking account for about 6 days. I will go back, because the food is decent and the décor and ambiance are great. I'll just make sure to park across the street and get a different server.Wow. I've never felt so unwelcome at an eating establishment ever before. Last week the hubs and I drive over to his moms house (our old hood). She lives on the same exact block the Vig Uptown resides on. So we walk on over. We are all very excited to try the newbie that just popped up in the neighborhood. We walk in. Where we stand for FIVE (yes 5) minutes before the person who I am guessing is the host finally wanders on over. He looks us up and down. We say there are 3 of us. He looks at the list and says "Oooooh, ya. We are pretty busy. I don't see you being seated any time soon" we look at each other all baffled....One of us asks, can you give us an estimated time when a table might be available.... he looks around and says..."um, yeah, like I said we are pretty busy" Oooooooook then. We walk out, cross the street and go eat at the Phoenix City Grill, where they are always happy to see us, seat us and serve us. Dear Vig, you might think you are all that, but seriously. Get over yourself. The hubs family has lived on that block for 34 years, they have seen restaurants come and go. If you keep up your attitude, you will find yourself pushing your LOCAL customers away.As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.They listened.They created.They named. (after me!!!)We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.Lovers of the Old Vig, I know what you're thinking. Is the new Vig as fabulous as the original Vig with their boche ball clad outdoor patio, live music Sundays and a great hang-out any day of the week? Me thinks my answer is...yes! And here are 10 reasons why:1. The indoor patio is brightly lit, but saves 'zonians from melting in the heat. It's genius when you think about it. Now you can choose which Vig to visit based on your temperature desires. So, if you want an outdoor patio, go to the other Vig, but when it's 115 outside, I'll see you at the Uptown spot. 2. They serve greyhounds with freshly squeezed grapefruit. You can't find a freshly squeezed cocktail very many places in the land of the desert. 3. Boche Ball. See it exists, even at the new location! And it's large and in charge and big enough for a group to play. 4. Friendly staff. They're attentive, friendly and aim to please. 5. Spacious and perfect for a big group. Check out the area by the fire place. It's perfect for mingling. 6. Awesome spinach dip with these tasty (sweet potato?) bread sticks for dipping. 7. Tastilicious flat bread pizza with Tandoori Chicken - it literally melted in my mouth. 8. Lovin' the Central Phoenix vibe and location. It's close enough to the Camelback corridor and within driving distance for most of the Phoenix/Scottsdale neighborhoods. 9. Great HH specials depending on the day. Check out their $5 Vignature cocktails. 10. And let's not forget about the entertainment. The DJs with accompanying instruments make the Vig rock and I heard a rumor live music is coming soon. So check it out right this minute!Go to the Vig Uptown for the bathrooms alone. Seriously. If you are one of those neurotic people out there like myself who judges establishments and the frequency of which you will attend them by the cleanliness among other features of their bathrooms, then I am thrilled to say you will not be disappointed. The stalls are gigantic, completely separated from top to bottom so you have full privacy and don't have to stare at people's disgusting dirty feet, and best of all, they have a little ledge for your cocktails! Why more places don't consider that sometimes we like to take our drinks to the bathroom with us is beyond me, but it creates a real predicament once you walk into a stall and there's nowhere to put it. Oh, and if I ever become rich I am ripping all of the sinks out of the bathrooms in my condo and replacing them with whoever's sinks are in the Vig. In a word, GORGEOUS!The second thing that makes the new Vig a winner is the Kid's Menu portion of Mac n Cheese. It is so freaking delicious I have no words. Almost tastes like fresh pasta smothered in Velveeta. Plus it costs like $5, possibly $6, whatever, I've never once been able to finish it.Drinks are a little pricey for me to spend as much time as I'd like here, especially with regard to their gorgeous bathrooms, but still affordable enough that I'll come party here once or twice a month.Go check it out for yourself, just watch out for their Sunday Brunch if you're not into babies...because they're everywhere!Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.) Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too. Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.  ...And i lived happily ever after.You had me at gluten free menu. Then you sealed the deal with your Strongbow Cider and free ride home service. I'm in love! The tandori nachos are amazing as was their gluten free burger. I don't think you can understand just how exciting it is to eat a hamburger with a bun for once. The patio area had a great atmosphere and my waiter was the greatest!Undoubtedly the best and my most preferred Vig location in Phoenix. Not only is it close to Luci's Market Place (another favorite place of mine) , but it's also just up the street from my mom's place.It was the Vig's one year anniversary the other night, so my friends and I decided to have dinner here. The restaurant  has a minimalist , trendy and modern atmosphere. We enjoyed several half off appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts!  (See pictures) We did order a lot for three people and had plenty of left overs. They were half off, so how could anyone resist? I was also able to pick up wifi here and that automatically gets a boost in rating from me. I'm definitely coming back to bring my mom for brunch next time.Sunday evening my hubby & I were looking for a place to have dinner & The Vig came to mind so off we went. It was pretty early, about 5:45pm, so we beat the dinner crowd. We were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio. I know this is such a girl thing to say, but I love their bathroom sinks! For starters we got the crab & artichoke dip. It was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people. The spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing. I also got a cocktail, captain appleseed. It smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking. For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.Total (not including tip) for a cocktail, an app, 2 entrees & dessert was about $57. A lil pricey but the food was great so I'd say it's worth it!This is my 300th review.The end.Hahahaha, just kidding. Well, it *is* my 300th, but I'm actually going to write something.I met my boss here for a dinner meeting. I can walk to this place, but had never been. I know, I'm late to the Vig trend, but when it comes to trendy places, I bush the system somewhat. We needed to find someplace that had gluten-free options and a lot of people suggested The Vig Uptown.It's WAY bigger inside than you'd think at first. Oh, everyone has to valet and it's free. You go in through a huge orange door (I really like orange. I hate yellow, though.) and can pretty much pick a place to sit unless it's really packed. Luckily, it was a Wednesday night and there were quite a few tables available. We sat in back next to the bocce ball thing. Is it a court? What would it be called? It's just a long strip of green. Whatever.The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation. There was a guy playing the guitar. It was pretty impossible to hear half of what my boss was saying. I bet he offered me a million dollar raise & I missed it. Just my luck.I had the Cobb salad. Holy cripes! The thing was huge!!! Ok, it was $12 but still, I had to take half of it home to eat the next day. Huge chunks of bleu cheese & bacon. There wasn't too much dressing on it, either. I actually like the taste of vegetables and don't like a lot of dressing on my salads.The service was super friendly and quick to refill drinks.Oh, and the bathroom is super cool, too. The sink is one of those flat ones that makes you feel like you're going to flood the bathroom when you wash your hands. How embarrassing, because people may think you just peed a lot but it's really from the sink. Haha. That would happen to me, too, as well as missing my boss giving me a million-dollar raise.Oh @TheVigAZ, you usually do so well, but when you fail me, it's always an epic fail. Last night, you fell flat on your face.I ordered the Vigazz Burger, anticipating greatness.My girlfriend and her daughter received their food, and finished their meals. I got nothing.While my girlfriend was still eating, I inquired with one of the back servers about my burger, and was told it was almost ready.15 or 20 minutes after my party finished eating, I was still waiting.The other people around me, who'd ordered around the same time as I (some before, most after) were finished with their meals, and still I waited.I had by this time decided I no longer wanted my meal, but no server was present to inform.While I waited for the server to come by to deliver the inevitable check, I noticed people who'd arrived AFTER we ordered, getting their meals.And still, I waited.Finally, after over 30 minutes, and nearly having to yell to get her attention (she was delivering more food to people who came long after we ordered, right next to us), our server came over.When we informed her that I did not receive my meal, and that my girlfriend's order was incorrect (onions and tomatoes present, despite a request to not have them), and instructed her to remove my meal, she just asked if I wanted it to-go.When your service comes up so short as to completely miss a meal, you don't merely offer to make it to-go.In fairness, when she brought the check, she stated she'd spoken to the manager, and he'd also removed my girlfriend's burger from the bill.It was a nice gesture, but last night it was too little, too late. I went home hungry, with a major headache.I love The Vig, but sometimes it's a major disappointment...feast for the eyes AND for your gourmet tastes. PROPER kitchen makes everything from scratch and it shows.--freshly-made bloody mary mix, and freshly-opened olives jar (yes, you can tell). i'll have 3. at $5 for sunday brunch you can't go wrong.--shepherd's pie is the BOMB-awesome. they even fuss up the plate so it doesn't look too pretty, but don't believe your eyes: what's under those eggs will rock your mouth with pleasure!--potato coins are fun!--cheese plate was not on the menu, but chef happily obliged to accompany my v.c. yellow-label (no longer on the menu). they even made toast points for me. wowza.--these wings are the best i've had. perfectly cooked and the best sauce ever.--super friendly staff knows their stuff, ingredients, and serves it with big smiles.--great family place (kids can play bacchi or bean bags in the patio), and --goes upscale in a flash too; awesome acid jazz feel--new converted entrance gives the smokers a nice spot and yet keeps them on their own.--free wifi for your business meeting and big booths to boot#argh. dropped the yellow label from the wine list. mumm is motor oil. how abaout tattainger?#forced valet parking is a bust. i know they have to do it, but i just want to park my own car. (if you see the valet, just park across the street if you're as fussy as me)#wish they opened 30 minutes earlier on sundays; 10:00 leaves me standing outside every time.vig uptown gets my award for most-improved food quality. whether it's the temperature, the freshness, the plating, the preparations, the simple but perfect blend of seasoning and flavor, vig uptown should be proud.not many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out.This Vig used to be a BofA hiring center!! What a turn-over wonder!! :)I must mention that I had a bad experience at the Vig Arcadia, and promised not to step foot into that place again. However this location turned my experience with The Vig around, I came her on a Friday night to a co-workers birthday celebration! Those you can't say no to, so I came here thinking I would just sip water through out the night, but no siree. I really enjoyed the vibe, the music and the staff was ever so nice and friendly. Plus the food was delicious, I had some of the cheesy tater tots, YUM!! As well as one of their Hot Vings, wow were those sticky and spicy, but good! Also just half of a Hot Chick sandwich and an Arnold Palmer!! Oh so delicious!!! I was really glad I came and that this place took me by surprise!! The food was great and the staff here was just as good!! Great time with the co-workers and friends!! :)Met up with a friend for Happy Hour at the Vig, it's another place I have been meaning to check out.  I didn't do any research on the place so when I pulled in and my door was opened by some strange man I was sorta thrown off, but overcame that quickly as I walked toward the restaurant.   I didn't see any signs saying it was valet parking, so that's why I was a little caught off guard.Once inside I got to check out the place , its retro with a cool vibe, I could see how hanging out at the Vig has become popular. My friend and I were headed to another event so eating wasn't really what we were into, but after a quick look at the menu we decided on some guac & chips and grilled fish tacos. The guac was fresh and creamy; the added pico went great with it. The fish tacos though stole the show, the tomatillo & avocado salsa on blacken white fish with spicy slaw, explosion of flavors! I might have to go back soon just for that! So good!The Vig is a great place to start your happy hour off at, nice drink selection and food choices! Look forward to coming backI've always wanted to try the Vig and never had a chance. Saturday afternoon we were in the area so we decided to try it. We walked in for lunch and I guess for lunch it's a pick your own table no hostess. Very modern looking. Very interesting inside just can't describe besides very modern. The inside is pretty dark where we sat. They had modern music playing. Pretty upbeat but not rocky. Anyways, I ordered the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was interesting with grilled red onions, tomatoes, cheese, and greens. It looked really good but tasted ok. Let me put it this way. Not a lot of taste. I really loved the sweet potato fries. Overall, I thought it was an okay meal. My wife ordered the Turkey sandwich which had tons of turkey with coleslaw and cranberry on a pretzel roll. Nice combination. I stole a quick bite and it was really good.  The service was really good. We were greeted quickly at our table. Drinks were at our table quickly and refills regularly. They even boxed my wife's leftovers. So overall, we had a really good time. Great relaxing atmosphere, good food, and good service. What else could you ask for. We enjoyed it. I hope you do too.Alright, this is going to be a short review because we popped in on a Friday night just for Moscow Mules.  No food was consumed since we already had dinner but the menu was read with envy.Such a trendy place!  It was super busy, the bar was gorgeous, and the place itself was lovely.  The patio looked really nice from what I could see.  The stylish patrons made me feel under-dressed but whatever.  Give me my draaank!  Music was blasting for this energetic crowd and there were lots of couples on dates.  Kazi didn't enjoy her Bloody Mary and the waitress let her trade it for a Moscow Mule with no grief.  $4 Tito's vodka all summer long, kiddos.  Yes!  Our table already had a trivia game in place so that was fun.  We sucked at it but it was still fun.Thanks for the bev, Tomcat!

Ok here is a shocker... I went to chipotle for the first time when I was recently in Arizona... talk about unexpected. But it was free and ummm yeah it was this or some other disgusting fast burger/taco joint...Why are there no good taquerias in the greater Phoenix Metropolitan area? WTH! I would riot over that if I lived out there. Thankfully I do not...So yeah back to chip-oat-lay. This place is the subway of burrito places. I doubt the tacos are worth it since they are small and the same price with much less food as the burritos I think... Pro Tip: Ask for stuff on the side, you often get a lil bit more if you do!But back to the burrito... I got a barbacoa meat burrito. Not sure what kinda meat barbacoa is, but it was aight i suppose. It coulda been cat meat for all I know. This joint is absolutely overboard with regards to carbs and thick hunnies wanting to eat here. I think I was the skinniest person there and I dont think I am skinny. The build it up burrito/taco concept is solid and better than some other joints that I have been to. I consider the food fair, but nothing special. Just lots of carbs n meat in a burrito bun =P So yeah, not sure of a reason to go back unless everyone I am with must go here, but otherwise, its all good!The Chipotle chicken salad is the largest food group in my nutritional pyramid. And I treat this Chipotle like my personal home kitchen! Except I really don't do any of the cooking. And it tastes delicious every time..The workers here are for the most part very friendly, generous, and efficient. Like all other locations it gets busy during peak dining hours but they do their best to keep the line moving. Until you get those n00bs in line that speak too quietly or don't know what they want which in that situation nothing can be helped. My personal recommendation is to order ALL THE SALSAS! Go for it. Don't be shy.This is a typical Chipotle location. Service is attentive and efficient. The line moves swiftly even when they are crowded.

I was extremely excited when I heard about a vegan food delivery service in town! But opposite of Misti Y,  I cook so much that it took me forever to find a time that I wasn't gonna be able to cook to order some food.  I'm so glad I did! I ordered the ginger pear bread, mac n cheez, peanut-tofu-kale noodles, lasagna, tofu curry, and chick'n and dumplings.  Plus a container of bananas foster "ice cream" which I got for my friend (she did let me have a taste though! YUM!)Entrees run about $7, for a healthy-sized serving of homemade, mostly organic food.  (Read: you will be pleasantly full, but not stuffed.)  I think this service would be great for vegans who were staying on the strip and had a microwave and fridge/freezer in their room.  Or anyone really.  Eating out healthy in Vegas isn't necessarily an easy thing, especially for vegans and vegetarians who are visiting! This food is tasty and filling without having the overbearing fat and salt of restaurant food.My dishes took about 10 min to heat up in my home and work microwaves except for the lasagna which took about 30 min in my oven.  I really liked everything except for the lasagna; it was very filling but pretty bland, overwhelmed by whole wheat noodles.  The peanut noodles were delish - probably my fave- but the mac n cheez was damn good too.  I would order the noodles, mac, curry, and dumplings again for sure! The ginger pear bread was perfect- great banana bread-like texture, just sweet enough, with delicious chunks of pear! My dog agreed with me, as she stole half of it off my kitchen table! (and yes, I ate the rest, it was that good.)They are now offering Holiday baskets that sound like a great deal: bread, cupcakes, cookies, and candy (hello, vegan peanut butter cups!!) for only $25.  Someone on my holiday list is definitely getting one of these, and I might have to get one for myself.I highly recommend trying them out! There is a $5 delivery charge, so I would suggest ordering lots of stuff to make it worth your while.  They keep in the freezer for over a month, so you'll have time to use it up.  Great for folks who are looking to eat healthy (especially lower sodium!).

Review Text :
I remember going to Thelma's in Waipahu. My aunty loved them and we would always be there at least 2-3x months. She called to tell me that they were opening up in LV. Lately we've been going to Elena's but it is pretty far from us, and because of the Yelper's, now I don't have to drive that far.Thelma's serves Illocano food and it is very familiar  and almost as good as Grandma's cooking. You read that right...ALMOSTas good as. LOLThey have a good menu and offer either dishes or  combination plates.We ordered:Pinakbet, Pancit, Chicken adobo, and a Halo halo.They were all good especially the pinakbet- its been awhile since i had pinakbet.The restaurant was very spacious and clean. You can't see the restaurant from Sunset Rd. or Marks St. But they are in same complex as Aloha Kitchen & Vitamin World across from Best Buy.The service was also very good and the food came out quick. My little pinoy princess also got a free treat. Salamat!I will definitely be going back very soon. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu.Aloha!!When my boyfriend and I arrived to this cute little bistro, there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied. The walls of the interior are painted a light green color that I enjoyed. There are gold statuettes along the walls, as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light. On most, if not all, of the tables are little vases with orchids. It was a pleasant dining area even with the TV playing in the background. It can be hard to spot if you don't pull into the parking area behind Aloha kitchen. The menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties. J quickly decided on the lechon kawali, a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy, fatty meat on the inside. It came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion. It was REALLY crisp, crackled when you bite into kind of crisp. I found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3-4 pieces- but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat. I ordered the adobo, which was a large bowl full of super tender, soy and vinegar-spiced pork chunks. The cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas I've had, with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel. The flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would've disappeared easily. It seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time, a signature of many comforting dishes. I would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness, but it was a delicious dish. The texture of the rice was great with the pork. We also got an order of the Shanghai lumpia, which would have all vanished if I hadn't caught J before he got to them all! Crisp, narrow cigar-shaped little pockets of deep-fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce, it's easy to see why. We also had an Ilikoi passion drink and Kona coffee. The coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non-dairy creamer, which saddens me a little. It's really a small detail, but when having such a nice variety of coffee I want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose/hydrogenated processed things. Not a huge deal because it still tasted great, but something I find worth pointing out. I was really excited that they offered kona coffee! The passion fruit drink was also tasty, though J drank most of it. The water tasted like tap water, so we barely sipped any.Overall, the food here was great. If you're a fan of the Hawaiian Sun drinks I imagine you'll be happy. It's a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and I'd rather go here than to another McChipotle or Pei Wei. Not my usual neighborhood hang out, but I can see going back sooner rather than later!Took my mom out for a shopping trip and since we were near Thelma's, I figured my mom would love it. AND SHE DID!She, literally, wanted to order the whole left side of the menu. She had 4 item mix plate AND we still ordered food (oxtail, chicken long rice, fried fish) for home. My mom said: "You have to take me here every week!" Oh gawd, what have I created.Another great thing about this restaurant is the service. They are so friendly and helpful and funny. Like they're family =)And FYI - if you're mail is late, the mail ppl are prolly having lunch at Thelma's cuz, I SWEAR, I saw like 5 postal service trucks parked outside.I had to try this place since I am Filipino and am always looking for great place to remind me of mom's and family home cooking!!Lunch Orders:3 item combination: Gisantes(Filipino Marinated Pork and Peas), Thelma's Special (Pan Fried Pork with onions, tomatoes and soy/vinegar sauce) and Pork Adobo with white rice. Gisantes was Addicting, Thelmas Special was Especially Delicious and Pork Adobo Much Better than most Adobo I've had!!Lechon Kawali: Pan roasted pork dish with a brown dipping sauce. Came Neatly sliced, Crispy Skin, Succulent tasting meat and Not too oily! Dipping sauce was the Best I've had and was a Must with every bite!!Sinigang Soup and Veggies Only: Filipino Sour Soup/Stew was a nice to sip on between bites of meat and rice. However, I've never tried a Sinigang with a mild sourness and I believe under seasoned soup.. Although, it wasn't my type (I've had Many versions of Sinigang, I like more sourness)  it was still heart warming and the chunks of tomaotes and green beans felt healthy compared to everything else I was having!Damn Close and Comparable to My Mother's and Family members Cooking!!! Reasonable Value, Corteous and Polite Staff and Clean dining space makes me a Fan For Sure!!!Wow. This has instantly become my favorite Filipino restaurant. I first heard about this place a while ago from my coworker. I wish it didn't take me so long to finally go.Since I'm not in the area much, I figured I'd try as many things as possible. I went with a four-item combo consisting of Mongo, Pinapaitan, Thelma's Special, and Pork Adobo. Of course, I added a small bowl of Sinigang for $1.The Mongo intrigued me because it's Ilocano style, which I've never tried before. It's less soupy than the Mongo I'm used to. In addition, it's white as opposed to green. But more importantly, it was delicious.Pinapaitan isn't something that would normally interest me. I don't like bitter dishes and the name screams bitter. Thankfully, the lady told me their version is more mainstream. And I do love tripe. The end result is very good, but I can still taste the bitterness obviously.Thelma's Special is basically lechon with onions and tomatoes. It's pretty hard to screw this up and they certainly don't. Delicious.As for the Adobo, this was the one thing I ordered that is probably the most ordinary. The large chunks of pork didn't really look like they would be tender, but they indeed were, surprisingly.Make sure you check in before you order so that you get your 10% off. I actually forgot, but then when I mentioned it to the lady, she was totally willing to redo my ticket and give me the 10% off. I saved a whole 95 cents! It pays to pay with cash sometimes.First off, I had to drive all the way around the building to find it. They are located in the back. If they didnt have a sign in the front of the building, you would never know they were there! Make sure you check in to get 10 percent off your order. Just about everything on the menu is dee-lish. I usually get the lechon and pork adobo with steamed rice. I love the fact that they give you a small cup of diced tomatos and onions mixed with soy sauce and vinegar. You gotta have that along with the Mang Tomas sauce for the lechon. It's not lechon without it! Now I don't need to describe it to you if you're a first timer. I would say its a safe bet for your first time. Once you get a taste of these two items, you will come back for more. Of course you gotta eat it with the steamed rice to equalize the flavor. Otherwise, you will complain that it is too salty.To top it off, you gotta get the Halo-Halo for dessert! Its so good that they named it twice! Good to share but if you are able to finish it by yourself than you better get checked for worms! LOL. Service is ok. When you have a grip of people in there, don't expect to get your food with a snap of your fingers. They take cash and cards.Gustung-gusto ko ng masarap na pagkain.I am honestly somewhere in between a 3 star rating and a 5 star rating for this place, so that is why the four. Not perfect but pretty damn good.We came with an appetite and ordered a crap load of food. We ordered so much food, they moved us from a small table to a big table. Yeah, it was just me and my hunny and my son.The following is what we devoured:Spam MasubiLonganisa MasubiLechon KawaliMarinated BangusA mixed plate with: rice and macaroni salad, shoyu chicken, pancit mix, and squid guisado.Another mixed plate with: rice, squid guisado, pinkabet and dinuguan.I fell absolutely in love with their lechon. Some of the best in this valley that I have tried to be honest. Their mang sauce is definitely not watered down like other restaurants do. (My mouth is watering just thinking about the lechon now). It was fried perfectly with a perfect ratio of skin, to fat, to meat. And most importantly, it didn't leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.The bangus was on point and was boneless. An extra plus for my hunny. The squid guisado was delicious as well. Not overpowered by the bagoong.I find that a lot of places fill their pinakbet with squash and this was a good balance of all veggies. Both of the masubi's were delicious and the fact that I could order a longanisa masubi made me very excited.  Honestly, it was all good. Except the dinuguan left me very disappointed. I was not a fan of the taste or texture of this one.We spend a little under $40 for all the food and had plenty to take home. Just know that if you order hot tea, it is simply a lipton tea bag and they give the hot water and lemon and honey. And if you like they play TFC on the TV.Gawin ang iyong sarili ng ilang mabuti at kumain sa Pilipino restaurant na ito nang hindi bababa sa isang beses.HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #5What started on a whim last week has resulted in the 5th day in a row of halo-halo for Mel C. and I.  Tonight we brought the challenge to the other side of town and invited a couple of Henderson Yelpers and the Asian Persuasion family to join us.  Shirley B is the duchess of Thelma's, a spacious restaurant near Sunset Station.  First tip:  use your Yelp app to check-in and get 10% off your order.  Ian A. checked in after he ordered and paid and missed out on the discount--sayang!  Next time, na lang.  There are two halo-halo versions here:  the plain one for $5.25 and the special one for $5.75, which includes macapuno and ube ice cream.  We had the special version and the ingredients were:pinipig (first time in 5 tries.  These are toasted rice grains--think Rice Krispies)macapuno (coconut strips)ube ice creamkaong (sugar palm fruit)nata de coco (coconut jelly)langka (jackfruit)cherries**See, we are learning the real names of the ingredients as we go along, instead of saying "those red stringy things," and " these green balls (!)."  Yes, Mel and I are both the kind of Filipinos whose parents didn't really teach us Tagalog growing up stateside so we've had to learn as we go.  BUT, I can understand a lot, especially when you're not saying nice things  ;)What was missing:ubeleche flanred beans (azuki)Everyone's halo-halo preferences are different, so we're just doing the leg work for you and letting you know what we find along the way.  I am still on the hunt for the halo-halo that has ube, leche flan, red beans, langka, kaong, nata de coco, macapuno, and ice cream in ONE bowl.  The search continues.  Halo-Halo Contender #1: http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwHalo-Halo Contender #2:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaAHalo-Halo Contender #3: http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQHalo-Halo Contender #4: http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQI came here with friends due to the glowing yelp reviews. Service was excellent. Of the dishes I sampled, their Kare-Kare was the shining star with real peanutty flavor and lovely oxtail and veggies. This Sinigang Stew with Shrimp  (a sour soup made with a tamarind base) was pretty good and arrived with ample shrimp. I personally wish it was twice as sour but it satisfied.Less impressive were several dishes:The Lumpiang Shanghai, a deep-fried meat-filled spring roll with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, lacked flavor and texture.The Pancit Palabok craved seasoning and any anato seed flavor. The rice noodles were unexpectedly thin like a vermicelli but the lack of flavor was the main issue.The Halo-Halo (mix-mix) Special as dessert was just pure disappointment.  In their menu, the regular Halo-Halo description included several components while the Special seemed to include the regular ingredients plus Ube (purple sweet root crop) ice cream. The special arrived in an okay-looking presentation of crushed ice with condensed or evaporated milk, red nata de coco (coconut gel), something else that was red and seemingly coconut-based, as well as Ube ice cream. It was missing red beans, garbanzos, macapuno (shredded, sweetened coconut) and pinipig (crunchy, crushed young rice). Any addition of even just one of those ingredients would make it truer to its name.STILL MY FAVORITE FILIPINO RESTAURANTWe had our UHE "Unofficial Henderson Event" with several other Henderson community Yelpers. Lunch was family style for the five of us. More than enough food with plenty of leftovers for a snack later on. It was also a chance to catch up with Thelma's two daughters who operate this restaurant.Great place to meet, chat and enjoy great Filipino cuisine.I have to start this review by saying that I hate Filipino food at restaurants. I grew up with the traditional Filipino mom who made a home cooked Filipino meal every night. So my expectatios are really high. Restaurant Filipino food tends to be on the bland side to cater to everyone. I'm used to all the fatty, salty, greasy deliciousness. My family lives in California so I don't get to eat as much Filipino food as I would like to. However, the craving can get overwhelming at times. So where do I go?!?! Here!!!This is the closest it gets to Filipino home cooking. Everything I've eaten always comes out piping hot and fresh. Everything is flavored correctly. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. My favorites are kare kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in a peanut butter broth served with shrimp paste) and Thelma's special (pieces of lechon with tomatoes and onions served with special sauce). All sounds off if you aren't used to it, but trust me it is delicious. Only reason why I docked a star is because this isn't my mom's cooking, but it satisfies the need.This past Tuesday, I was feeling adventurous in dining. I wanted to try someplace new. I set out for a dining adventure at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant. What really made this adventurous dining is that this was my first meal in a Filipino Restaurant. My real-life and Yelp friend Shirley. B would be my adventure guide in my very first dining experience in a Filipino restaurant. In similar style to a first-rate adventure guide, Shirley. B did some research on the food that I appreciate. She concluded that I have reviewed plenty of Chinese restaurants. Consequently,she matched three of the four items with an entree and appetizers that I have ordered in Chinese restaurants. We shared a plate of pancit mix (similar to chow mien noodles), beef vegetable lumpias (similar to egg rolls), garlic fried rice, and BBQ pork on sticks. Thelma's makes sharing easy. They provided serving spoons and extra plates to share the food. This eliminated the worry about germs that many diners have. Thelma also made the pace of dining relaxed by bringing out the different items separately. My favorite item was the pancit mix. If I wasn't dining here with Shirley. B, from looking at the pictures that yelpers posted, the pancit mix and the garlic fried rice would have been the dishes I ordered. Although, pancit mix is a different entree than noodle style chow mien,it was just as delicious. Anchoring each side of the plate was a lemon, that I did not need to squeeze to add flavor to the noodles. What can I really say about garlic fried rice besides it tasting similar to white rice with a garlic flavor? The lumpias tasted similar to the delectable egg rolls that are my usual appetizer before the entree. Finally, the BBQ pork sticks tasted similar to the BBQ food that I have enjoyed in L&L BBQ. I tasted the quality in each bite of the meat that was more taste than messiness. Complimenting the food was bottomless cola.   The trail-head for this dining adventure is a restaurant located in a small strip mall in the shadow of the colossal Sunset Station Casino & Hotel. It is off Sunset Road just west of the Marks Street traffic signal and Gold Rush Casino. Thelma's faces the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. The inside of Thelma's looks more similar to L&L BBQ than an elegant restaurant. The elegance is the deliciousness of the food. To kick off this dining adventure, there are menus along a partition separating the cue from the kitchen. It is in a spot where nobody is watching over you, and you can take your time. The adventure initiates when you order your food and pay. If you are drinking a soft drink, they hand you a cup that you serve yourself. Ultimately they deliver the food for your dining adventure.   In my opinion yelping is about being an adventurist in dining that tries new places, then shares them through reviewing. Its very similar to the concept of living life as an adventure. In my pursuit of living life as an adventure I will occasionally step out of my comfort zone by trying cuisines and restaurants that I never experienced, then ultimately sharing  these experiences. With that said, "Thank you Shirley. B for being a fantastic guide in adventurous dining."A Filipino co-worker/friend suggested several foods for me to try. Yelp reviews suggested Thelma's. Made the drive to Henderson last night...Challenging location, at least for me, to find Thelma's. Located on Sunset Rd., west of Marks, in a strip mall shopping center behind Vitamin Shoppe.The moment I walked in, the wonderful smell of authentic Filipino foods urged my stomach to speak suggestions my co-worker recommended to some of the nicest ladies I've ever ordered food from.Take out or dine-in. Clean restaurant, decorated w/ pretty Filipino wall art, well lit, 4 ceiling fans providing excellent ventilation, a comfortable 77 F thermostat, a single flower @ each of the 20+ tables spaced well apart, all added to the encouragement of me choosing dine-in. (see photos below)Order & pay in advance @ the counter. Served food within a fast 10 minutes @ table of choice. TFC (The Fiipino Channel) on TV showing music videos, soap operas, and Filipino commercials in English.Was told Thelma resides in Hawaii, and her daughter runs this place. Her daughter is doing a great job as this restaurant has earned an A Grade from the So. NV Health District and several awards including Best Of Las Vegas RJ Poll.Considering so many suggestions given to me prior to my arrival, I sampled several entrees ordering the mixed plate w/ 4 choices: (see photos below)1. Pork Adobo - Juicy & melts in your mouth upon each bite! 2. Dinuguan - Two spoonfuls of this pork blood stew was enough, as I'm not a vampire!3. Pancit Mix - Bihon rice noodles/canton noodles w/ pork, onions, carrots...very flavorful!4. Thelma's Special - Chopped Lechon Kawali (crispy roasted pork) w/ tomatoes, onions, soy sauce...delicious!Appetizers included: (see photos below)1. Shanghai Lumpia - deep fried eggrolls w/ ground pork & vegetables served w/ a sweet chili dipping sauce. Very good!2. Sweet Longanisa - Sweet tasting pork sausage.Thelma's serves breakfast all day, offers lunch specials M-F til 4:30pm, stays open til 9pm every night but Sunday til 6:30pm, and will prepare special orders by pan of Small (15-20), Medium (30-40) and Large (80-90) w/ 24 hour notice.Please take a look at my photos below to hopefully encourage you to patronize Thelma's. I know I'll be back!

Restaurant name  El Chorro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest "staid."  Perhaps even "stodgy," but that may be more harsh than I intend.Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with "the best Caesar dressing ever" and "polenta croutons?!?" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.Last night I went to the new El Chorro. It's nothing like the old El Chorro and it pulled on my heart strings to tour the beautiful, yet unrecognizable, restaurant. Nothing stays the same and I love change, but not when it involves my valley institutions. Soon nothing in my life will resemble my childhood and I will have no attachment to this town. When Avanti goes, that will for sure be the end. Ok, I'm done whining. Hey, I wasn't the only one. I noticed plenty of others reminiscing... they did happen to be my grandparents age, but I guess that just means I'm wise beyond my years. Ha.  The new El Chorro is incredible and if you knew nothing of the Old El Chorro, you'll like it that much more. It was a last minute idea to swing by for dinner and the place was packed. So packed that we couldn't get a table. I've never been without a reservation and I figured a weekday was a good time to try... think again. Luckily, the bartender (where the old bar used to be) told us not to worry because she wasn't going to turn customers away. She obviously wasn't working there the time my uncle threatened to burn down an umbrella because it was blocking the view... he did tip $100 to the guy for moving it, though. His personality allows him to say things like that without causing anyone to feel alarm... or maybe it was the $100? Anyway, El Chorro lacks nothing in the customer service department.So we sat, my mother, her ex and me. An odd group of three. He is totally still in love with her, so I encourage these little gatherings. Between the three of us, we ordered the filet, trout, and escolar. All delicious, but I am still saddened by the menu change. No beloved eggs benedict (that was served all day). No chicken livers. No jumbo shrimp (even though it's on their menu). The only thing retained- the sticky buns. Thank God for that.  Highlight of the meal was when the bartender made some after dinner shots when he overheard us discussing dessert. I asked him, "what are these babies called?" He responded, "wet dream."  Great, I was having a shot called a wet dream with my mom and her ex. Not awkward at all. Actually, it was pretty funny and the shots were deliciously cinnamony.   El Chorro, I still love you. You're like a relative who got a facelift and although I no longer recognize you, you're still the same inside.The parking lot here is a dirt lot. Keep that in mind ladies when you're picking out your shoes. There is a beautiful fountain as you walk into the courtyard (minus the yard) which is made up of two large patios. We chose to sit outside even though it was still quite warm out because the atmosphere and view outside was much more appealing. They have live music set up on the patio that is to your right as you walk in so if you want a bit more of a quiet atmosphere sit on the patio along Lincoln Rd. After we ordered they came out with a relish tray, which consisted of cold olives, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrot sticks and some peppers. The sticky buns were brought out at the same time and were pretty good, but quickly got a bit hard and were almost inedible. We both had a French onion soup which had pieces of steak in it as our starter. It was pretty good, but after I noticed a couple of patrons with the house salad I wished I had ordered that instead. For diner Mike had the pepper crusted sirloin with frites and I had the pork chop with a green chile risotto and green beans. The servings were pretty big so we were definitely not leaving here hungry.  However, nothing really stood out about our meals. Mike commented that he couldn't even taste the pepper on the steak and that the steak was pretty bland. He immediately asked our waiter for some A-1. My pork chop was pretty good. It came with a salsa relish on top. If it wasn't for the salsa my dish would have been pretty bland for the most part as well. The risotto was ok. Lastly for dessert we both had the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake was a little rich for me so I had trouble finishing it, but it was pretty good. The food was ok. However, it's not worth the regular price.  For restaurant week it was a decent deal. The service was great. Our water glasses were constantly being filled and plates taken away in a timely manner. Skip dinner here and come and enjoy happy hour at their outside bar and partake in the amazing view.Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for any place with ambiance. Even if I'm in the middle of nowhere and I find a place with ambiance and character, I'm sold. Now, El Chorro Lodge is nowhere close to being in the middle of nowhere. In fact, it's in the heart of some of the most gorgeous homes in Phoenix, and the ambiance gets an A+ in my book. When the weather is nice, I think this could be one of the if not the best patio in town. It is calm, comfortable and overlooks the beautiful Camelback Mountain. Inside El Chorro Lodge is just as nice, especially after the renovation. The white stucco and blue accent coloring play off each other and I enjoy the tile that compliments the character. El Chorro represents old Phoenix and has been around forever. The food here is good but on the pricey end so only come here if you're planning on dipping into the pocket book (but it's definitely worth every penny). The sticky buns deserve a yelp business listing on their own. El Chorro's known for their sticky buns and although the restaurant changed a good amount with the renovation, they kept the sticky buns. Bravo. Did I mention that the sticky buns come with every meal? If you really like them, you can take some to go too. So while this isn't the latest and greatest place to hit town, it's one of the oldest and is filled with history, great food, an amazing view, ambiance and it's the perfect place for brunch or dinner.Maybe my expectations were super high since El Chorro Lodge is like an Arizona institution, but after experiencing a meal at this restaurant, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars.  Don't get me wrong, it was "A-OK," it just didn't blow me away.The history of this place dates back to the 1930's and is pretty amazing.  You can read about it on their website.  The outdoor dining area is huge and has great views of Camelback Mountain.  The live music provides for a nice ambiance as well... at least live music when we were there on a Saturday night.  And our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticky buns - yum!  But the service was really slow and the food was nothing to write home about.  We found it to be overpriced as well.I'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns "to go" sometime, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner.We went to El Chorro Lodge for brunch the other day and what a wonderful experience we had. There are a lot of reviews already written about this Arizona landmark restaurant so here's another review to consider if you're thinking about trying El Chorro Lodge.Restaurant ~ they have one of the best dining patio's in the metro!  Great views of the desert and mountains, everything is shaded with umbrella's and they have the misters going full throttle this time of year.  There is usually some light entertainment in the evenings on the patio.  The restaurant is somewhat a "mission style" clean lines, exposed ceiling rafters and white walls with some nice art work.  It's smaller inside than what most people might think, so you will most definitely want to use Open Table or call them to make reservations before going.  Service ~ good servers here. Most of them are very attentive to your needs and very accommodating.  There were a few times we saw some of the servers blast past customers without a "pardon me" while going to and fro to the patio. Food ~ WARNING, eater's discretion is advised here!  Yes they serve you  sticky buns throughout the day and they are sooooo good and very addictive!  You'll want to order more but dont!  It will spoil you appetite before you get your main course.  These tasty little buns or goodness will swell in your tummy so just enjoy one (or two) that way you'll have something to look forward to on your next visit.  On this last visit I had smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, capers and some other goodies.  It was awesome!  It came with a side of hash brown potatoes and toast.  We also had their Creme Brulee french toast and ordered a side of bacon.  This sounded much better than what it tasted.  They use thick challah bread that must soak for a very long time, for this french toast tasted more like and eggie bread pudding.  The apple wood bacon was slightly over cooked but still tasty.  We also had their  eggs benedict which was delish.  You have your choice of proteins with your EB ~ canadian bacon, smoked salmon, lump crab or beef tenderloin and served with asparagus.  El Chorro Lodge has a great ambiance, good food and service.  It is what we expected most of the restaurants would be like prior to moving to Phoenix.  This is a great place to go with friends and family.  I recommend dining on their patio for brunch or a late dinner.  Hope to see you there sometime!I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? Easy question, you say?Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise.What am I missing, class?Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch.This review has to be broken into the tale of two worlds - happy hour and dinner.First review will be our experience in the bar for Happy Hour and the Second in the dark, dark world of the outdoor dinner seating.We valet parked our car without a care in the world. It was my wife's birthday so we thought we'd get to the restaurant early and enjoy the happy hour in the bar. Rachel was an absolutely lovely waitress. Our cocktails (party of five) and appetizers were simply a very warm, inviting, and lovely experience. The arisan cheese plate was enjoyable along with the grilled sausage trio. The happy hour buffet that is advertised simply didn't exist. Cocktails beyond their house pours were overpriced as expected. Overall the experience was very nice and I'd return for this portion of the evening. (but, you might want to read my review of the dinner experience).---After a lovely experience in the bar for happy hour (separate review) we were seated in the outdoor dining area (no one "got" us as we requested when our reservation was ready, and they didn't come to our table but asked us to come up to the hostess stand - no big deal but a bit tacky and awkward for all). (This is very sad as we're Phoenicians for 25 years and have experienced this restaurant over the years)Our waiter, Eric, didn't seem to want to be there or make our experience better in any way. Eric seemed to have had a bad day and so would our table of five along with my wife, for her birthday celebration. We ordered directly from the dinner menu as we had just enjoyed app's in the bar. It was obvious that Eric wasn't' pleased with this but he marched off and placed our orders. Upon delivery (next time we saw Eric), all was just fine until I cut into my $44 strip steak. After some time, Eric stopped by and asked how dinner was. I showed him the steak and asked if it was medium. No, and he took it away. He came back and asked if I'd like another glass of Cab - well, no, unless your manager is buying so I might have it with the steak I ordered. Ten minutes later, when the rest of the table was about done with dinner, my steak was delivered. And, yes, it was cooked to a perfect medium (although, who's hungry after sitting that long and nibbling off everyone else's plates?). How's my wife's Birthday going? Well, not real well. Did Eric bring the wine, dessert, or anything to enhance the experience? No. I spoke with Alec, the manager, and he simply could not have cared less. His eyes were glazed-over as I explained the experience and lack of response from his staff. Alec was truly the manager of a restaurant that I would never want to experience again. He didn't sympathize, apologize, or even care about me or my family. DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT A GOOD EXPERIENCE! Spend your $ elsewhere.This has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. It reflects the feeling of Old Phoenix and it makes you feel like you are visiting your friend's beautiful southwestern estate. Plus, I could probably eat a dozen of their sticky buns in one sitting. When we were planning the wedding and looking for a rehearsal dinner location, we immediately thought of El Chorro. They have multiple areas for private parties, the atmosphere is lovely, the restaurant has a lot of character and the backdrop is just stunning with the restaurant being nestled against the north side of Camelback Mountain. El Chorro lived up to expectations! We had about 40 guests attend the rehearsal dinner and we had a combination of an indoor and outdoor event. They set up several tables with nice linens outside while twinkle lights light up the area. We also had the indoor area that had dark wooden paneling and felt like a beautiful southwestern home. The servers were friendly, the drinks flowed and the food was simply phenomenal. We had a buffet style set-up with a combination of Mexican food, a meat station, a slider station and french fries! It was elegant comfort food at its finest. I personally think that this is one of the best (if not the best) locations for a rehearsal dinner!For our last night in Arizona and family obligations over I figured it would be a good opportunity to take my wife to an outstanding restaurant.I made reservations three days in advance on OpenTable.com and they actually called me the day before to confirm and check whether we wanted indoor or outdoor seating.  Since it had been so cold the last few days we were there we opted for indoor dining.A little history about El Chorro.  The main building was an old grammar school.  They added on the courtyard, dining area and gardens when it became a restaurant.  It includes their own garden for herbs, produce for the chef.  It also includes several outdoor fireplaces and a bocce court.For an appetizer, we started out with a small cheese plate which consisted of parmesan, provolone, bleu cheese & brie with cranberries, dried apricots and candied walnuts.  While we were working on our appetizer out came the famous sticky buns.  They are delicious, not too sweet and definitely worth trying.For entrees, we ordered the Niman Ranch Pork Tenderloin and the Pan Roasted Duck Breast.  The pork tenderloin came with green chili risotto and butternut squash.  The Duck came with celery root mashed potatoes, pearl onions, brussel sprouts with a pomegranate reduction.  Both were tender and delicious.  Even though having tried Duck previously and not really being a big fan I have to say the duck here was done perfectly and not as fatty as my previous tries.For dessert, we split a piece of their vanilla cake with carmel sauce garnished with a blackberry and cappuccinos (they were very strong but not bitter as some can be).This was a perfect way to end our stay in Arizona.  You cannot beat the views.  Next time maybe we will be able to do a weekend brunch and sit outside to enjoy the fabulous views.On a side note, they even called me the next day to thank me for patronizing their restaurant.  I was very impressed.Unpleasant. I could write an essay on my disappointments here but I will just choose the one that put me over the edge. They charge $5 PER SLICE if you bring in your own cake to celebrate an occasion. That's right folks! If you go to their restaurant to celebrate any occasion that requires you to bring in a cake, they will gladly take your cake in the back, slice it up, and serve it to all your guests for $5 per slice. I don't like getting nickel and dimed at a brunch that costs me $350 for 6 people in the first place.  I am far from cheap. I didn't bring a cake in to save from spending money at your restaurant. I brought it because that particular cake is a tradition for my mother's birthday and I will not pay you $30 for my 5 other guests and I to enjoy my already purchased cake. On my final note, I was advised by the server if I cut the cake and served it myself, I would still be charged the fee!!! Classless... Absolutely classlessI'm writing this review based on the despicable service I received when attempting to make a reservation for a holiday party. I've never been here but have heard that it's a beautiful venue. I called the hostess who was very friendly and when I told her I had a group of 20 was transferred to someone who handles larger events. I told her I was looking for something for 20 people on a certain date but we wanted to do more of a drinks and appetizers type set up. She cut me off right away "we usually run 100 dollars a person so...." READ: "You can't afford this place." I found it to be incredibly disgusting. "Ok I wasn't sure....I've never been there before so wanted to know what you have" cut off again "well we are booked out anyway so try happy hour..."Yikes. Not once did I tell her my budget. Will never understand why people who work in more upscale places often think of themselves are exclusive and celebrity. I will never come here for any reason now. Sad.Not even sure where to begin on this horrendous experience. First off I was giving El Chorro a second chance as I last ate here a couple of years ago and did not have a great experience but that was nothing compared to last nightMy girlfriend and I wanted to treat her kids to an "iconic" Phoenix dining spot with a patio as her daughter was home for spring break and she graduates from college in a few months. Needless to say we wanted this to be a special evening. Unfortunately it was quite the opposite. After being seated we had to wait 20 minutes before our waiter even acknowledged us and then it was 45 minutes before we had cocktails served. We were not in a hurry and wanted to have a leisurely dinner but this was a bit much. After appetizers and ordering a bottle of wine for dinner we waited over an hour for our meals and also had to order an additional bottle due to the long delay. In the meantime the table next to us who was seated after us had finished their meal and we're leaving. By this time myself and my girlfriend were not only frustrated but embarrassed by the situation as we really wanted this to be a special evening. We expressed our frustration to both the waiter and the manager who never once during the course of the evening stop by our table. To their credit they did comp part of our meal but that was not the point as the evening had already all but been ruined. Then to top things off when the waiter dropped the bill off at the table he copped a whole lot of attitude about my being frustrated and stormed off. Then this morning we realized that we had never even been offered the so called signature sticky buns which pretty much demonstrates how messed up they were last night. Needless to say we will never be back and will certainly warn anyone not to as well.

Review Text :
4/6/12My first visit, and it's been a long time coming!  According to my bookmarks page, I've wanted to try Chez Vous since 4/25/2011!  Funny that it took almost a year to do make it over here...Liked the interior, which is a mish-mash of dark brown leather seats and tables near a playable piano (I know, bec. I played "Long Long Ago" on it!) and regular wooden chairs and tables across the display cases.  It is intimate and very cozy, yet not too claustrophobic.  I met Romain, the affable young son of the owners of CV, who informed me that he'd just arrived from France less than two months ago.  I also enjoyed the music selections playing that morning and mentioned this to Romain, who replied that the music was from his iPod.  It was easy to like Romain, whose enthusiasm for music was clearly evident when he'd sing along as he did his tasks.  Ah, how do I love the French accent... too bad Romain's a bit too young for me-- perhaps he has an older brother?  ;)  For my fist visit, I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to start http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ#88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ, and a Chef's Choice savory crepe for my main http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ#y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ.  The cappuccino was beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste- the foam in it was perfect!  The chocolate croissant, I was told, was fresh from the oven, although mine wasn't warm to the touch.  However, it tasted marvelous, and the crisp layers of the croissant revealed the freshness of the pastry.  (I did order another croissant to go, which had just come out of the oven.)  It was all I could do to eat only half of the pastry, since I still had the savory crepe to look forward to.  The buckwheat crepe was filled with warmed cubes of green apple and chevre, and drizzled with honey and chives, and it came with a side salad (it automatically came with a brown sugar mustard dressing, something I cannot have, and which Romain replaced with fresh salad and Caesar dressing for me).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw#5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw  It was dee-lish!  Sweet enough to satisfy my sweet breakfast cravings, yet not too sweet that the back of my lower jaw, where it meets my ears, hurts.  It felt a bit weird to have salad that early in the day, but I tried it anyway, in case it wilted before I had a chance to try it for lunch.  The dressing tasted very fresh, and I asked if it had eggs in it, to which Romain replied that it didn't, but didn't it taste like it did?  "Yes, it does."  I truly enjoyed breakfast here, and, as you can see, it wouldn't be too long until my next visit...4/10/12Cappuccino, chocolate croissant, Exotic (sweet) crepe, and Lorraine omelet.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0A#iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kA#890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw#tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw  The croissant was once again very good, but the cappuccino wasn't as pretty to look at as the first... I now wonder if I may have ordered the latte the first time around?  No matter- the coffee still delivered.  The Exotic, a white-floured crepe filled with dark chocolate ganache, bananas, and toasted coconut, was very nice... A little bit too sweet, but not so much that I couldn't finish the whole thing!  I made a note to perhaps wait till I have someone else to share this with the next time I order it, as it is so smooth...  One second it was in front of me, and the next, it was gone!  :(  So, I had to order something else to keep me company-- the Lorraine omelet.  Oh, my goodness, what a disaster!  It is my preference that my eggs be soft and tender, and the yellow more on the darker side; in other words, not overcooked.   This omelet arrived very light-yellow and looked hard.  A quick touch confirmed my suspicion.  Didn't like the cheese nor the bacon that the egg enveloped, either- the bacon had a gamey scent and flavor, and the cheese... Eh, I'd rather not wax on about this dish.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutw#wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutwStill loved the coffee, croissant, and sweet crepe, so still going to give four stars!4/13/12Cousin-in-tow, I ordered the Moka (with double shots of espresso), chocolate croissants, and the Brittany for us to share.  Cousin asked for the roasted tomato to be omitted, and chives substituted instead.  The Moka is fantastic!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q#kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q  Our order was accompanied by a mini-carafe of more hot chocolate, and we finished it!  OK, so cousin had another cup, and I had a total of three during our breakfast course.  :PI initially ordered one croissant, since cousin didn't want any, but I offered her a taste, and it didn't take long for me to see we'd need another one STAT.  The Brittany, a savory buckwheat crepe filled with roasted chicken, caramelized onions, creme fraiche, and the substituted chives, was d'lish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA#09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA  Definitely something to order again.  :)Arrived around 7:30 am to find CV closed and not due to open for another 30 minutes, so I drove further down to Wildflower Bread Co. to check out its breakfast selections.  Perhaps it was the few bites of the two scones I purchased to-go there that caused me not to thoroughly enjoy my staple selection of a raisin croissant ($2.75) today. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=52oY8x3SL4Rc4R4xt9BNOQ#52oY8x3SL4Rc4R4xt9BNOQ  (I agree with an article I'd read years ago that only the first few bites (four, I seem to recall) are the most pleasurable, and succeeding portions lose their potential to cause excitation of the sensory nerves.)  I also ordered a Moka ($3.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=ABggPbd3PviD8f9pdwEBgg#ABggPbd3PviD8f9pdwEBgg and tried a new (to me!) crepe, a savory one called French Favorite (shaved ham, Swiss, and sunny-side egg in a Sarazin buckwheat crepe, $9.50).The Moka was delicious- it came unsweetened, which was OK with, since the bites of scones and croissant had enough sugar to sweeten the occasional sips I took of it.  The crepe was very tasty!  I forgot to inquire how the fried egg would be presented, and I wasn't asked, so I'm assuming the kitchen cooks it sunny-side up.  If you like your eggs cooked differently, make sure to speak up!  Today's version wasn't so bad, and it made for the "money shot," anyway. (Or maybe not!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=VoSHxUsHFXKGGQS_wPfjNg#VoSHxUsHFXKGGQS_wPfjNgIsabelle was sweet and accommodating, as always, as she did not rush anyone out of the cafe, switched out the salads when I asked if the vinaigrette contained mustard (it did), and brought me regular coffee when my Moka ran out.  Tip- order the Moka when you are with a friend, as you will garner not only two cups of delicious mocha coffee, but a pot containing about three extra servings!  Then again, the first and last time I did order this coffee selection, I was with my younger, and ultra-sexy cousin (guys NEVER fail to look twice when she's around!  My Mom and sisters also have the same effect on men, I swear!), so maybe it was a one-time deal...  I won't name names, but I think someone had a crush on my beautiful cousin!  ;)  In any case, I enjoyed my delightful Moka and savory crepe, and, at a lesser extent, the raisin croissant, so thank you Chez Vous!

Review Text :
Wow -- thanks to the sole Yelper who reviewed this (an out of towner, I might add...) I took my fellow foodie adventurer out to find this place in the Commercial Arts Center (always sketchy...).To be honest, I was on a hunt for KFC = Korean Fried Chicken...but I just can't pass up bipbimbap...so we had the stone pot version with an order of their "KFC."    Our server, a lovely bilingual Korean woman, was surprised that I knew about banchan...and in seconds, out she came with a rolling cart (yes, there were that many), and began to set us up.  From potatoes with jalapenos, spinach bean curd pancakes, kimchee, sprouts, fishcake, seaweed and daikon, pickled radish - and more (there were at least 10) and they were all delicious.  The dolsot (stonepot) bipbimbap is such a treat...perfect for this weather...the egg was fresh and the yolk was still runny.  The beef had tremendous flavor.  Add chili sauce, stir, mmmmm  But then she brought out this ENORMOUS plate of chicken wings - with the bipbimbap, it's really more than 2 can eat, but we soldiered on...because...that's what we do...but it needed one thing to make it all perfect - Hite!So we shared a hite beer...and I've decided if I can get through the rest of the day without needing a nap, it will be a huge accomplishment.  We also came to the conclusion that not only will we go back again but we'd help spread the word... and instantly this has moved up to our #1 lunch treat...Don't expect to find Ma Dang on the door -- look at the reviewer's picture of the exterior -- see the word Garden?  That's what you need to look for -- it's down a few doors south from Birria Jalisco...  As the previous yelper said, it's a hidden gem.Ma Dang had been bookmarked forever, but I finally got to try it last night.  I was joined by Jun A., a Korean student that I know from work, and Eric R.  The first part was finding it - I knew about it because I had seen "Ma Dang" on the restaurant in the past when dining at Komol.  However, it now says its name in Korean and then its translation "Garden" so I was not sure if that was the right place.  Luckily, Jun A. was already there when we walked in.They key is to come here with a Korean speaker.  The menu has all of its items in English but everything sounded so good I would not know where to start as a first-timer.  Jun A. ordered LA style beef short rib and spicy chicken stew for the table.Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Jun A. called out to her in Korean whenever we needed something, so we had great service.  We were the only ones in the restaurant initially but soon it had 3 other large groups of Korean eaters.  A rolling cart with banchan brought out 8 initial dishes: cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, fish cake with jalepeno, potato with jalepeno, scallion pancake, plain bean sprouts, spicy sesame bean sprout, and broccoli with sweet chile paste.  Everything was delicious, with unlimited refills.  We also got a 9th banchan dish, very similar to dashimaki tamago in Japanese cuisine (layered egg crepe).  I really liked everything but was especially fond of the scallion pancake.Our beef ribs came out first on a sizzling plate with onions.  They were deliciously flavored and hot.  We each got a bowl of rice which was refilled on request (I am not sure if there was an additional charge for refills on rice though - don't think so).  Then, a table burner with the chicken stew arrived.  Once the stew boiled we were able to eat it.  Tender dark meat chicken, potatoes, and green onions in a spicy broth surrounded us with great scents.  We ladled the stew into bowls and ate it with rice.  The flavor was great, but the chicken needed work with hands and mouths to free it from bones.  It was hot so a few fingertips were burned, but it was worth the effort!I would definitely return.  There are some interesting menu items to try including monkfish, sable/black cod, and mackerel dishes that may be calling my name soon.

we have a new 5 star casino Buffet in the valley and it is great!!! Rand H. and myself went there on opening day and the place was pact at about 11:00 am .I started with a great bowl of soup and then I had a plate of salad items. they had this one macaroni salad that was unreal it was so good it had sun dried tomatoes,feta cheese and barbecued shrimp in it yumm!!!! After that i tried the hot food items that were all excellent. Then it was on to my favorite part, dessert.Well they have quite a selection of mouth watering sweets but the one that really got me was this hot caramel cake. It was so good i went back for more even though i was stuffed   YUMM!!!!!!!It's Monday and I am still stuffed...maybe that will resolve itself through the course of the day today...we'll see.I had clients in town yesterday (and they are friends, as well...always nice to do business with friends:) and they wanted to see the new casino at the 101 and Indian Bend and have brunch...all in all, excellent ideas!The casino and resort (which has been under construction since I moved to town) have really turned out nicely (at least the portion that is finished...some of the landscaping, pools, finish work inside...well, about 80% of the resort is done...so they have that going for them:) is really very lovely...2 or 3 giant steps ahead of what I expect from a local casino (we aren't in Vegas, after all!).The important pieces are done...and by important, I mean the pieces that make them money!...the rest of that stuff is just for show.The casino itself is very nice for a local casino...the restaurants are open and going...they actually serve Peet's coffee here (if you are a Bay Area transplant, you'll know what that means:) and the staff is super accommodating!We showed up for brunch on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait to get a lovely table near the window so we could look down on the construction of what will become a desert nature walk area (probably kind of "Disney" version of desert and native American life...lots a dirt and concrete right now...should be nice when they get it done:)The dealio seems to be essentially unlimited champagne, bloody mary's, blini's, and mimosa's with brunch...for $25 a head...and given the quality of the food...and the quantity of the food and drink...that's a terrific deal:)We sat there (well, sat and ate, went and refilled, repeated as directed) for 2 and  1/2 hours...the place wasn't busy and it seemed we had our own wait staff making sure that our drinks were never dry and that dirty plates never piled up...in short, assuring us of a wonderful time:)I have sampled a few breakfast buffet brunches around town over the past few years, from the Phoenician to the Fairmont to Eagles Nest to the Wrigley (The Beautiful Carin loves no meal quite so much as a Sunday Champagne Buffet Brunch), and I can tell you that this place measures up in every way...and exceeds many of those much more expensive brunches!* The food is presented so appealingly...on porcelain instead of in steam trays!* Chef's at the ready for any special request (if you don't care for the pizza that is available, they'll make whatever you want...no extra charge:)* Gelato, as well as pastry for your sweet tooth:)* Fresh shucked oysters on the  1/2 shell...on ice...with all the accouterments!* A grill next to the carving station (you want your prime rib with grill marks on it?...no problem:)* You want sushi fresh cut, or a fresh stir-fry for your meal...they whip it up while you wait...wonderful!The buffet is laid out much like the Wynn in Vegas...tucked behind the massive bar and easily accessible, but not in line of sight, so you can enjoy your meal('s)... without all the clanking, cooking, and other things that often accompany a buffet.None of that would matter if the food and drinks were crap...but they aren't crap...in fact, the food and cocktails were terrific!I talked to several of the chefs and told them how really good I thought this place is and they just beamed with pride...they are having a good time and making some good chow and it shows in every bite:)And for me, the bites kept adding up...I didn't find anything that wasn't tasty (and I ate pretty much everything:)The good news is that I was wearing my "eatin pants" so I was ok right up to the time we dropped my clients off at their hotel...then it was all I could do to drive home and drag myself to the couch...moaning...in pleasure (no, food pleasure...I couldn't have done anything else:)Even Carin needed a nap Sunday afternoon (in spite of eating a much "healthier" brunch than I did, with her special request stir-fry and what have you)...those champagnes glasses do add up:)It looks like Sunday has become "Brunch Day" once again, now that a good one is so close...and so reasonably priced!Now I just need to figure out a new workout program that will allow me to deal with the extra 12,000 calories every Sunday:)Lunch - 4 stars ($12.95)Weekend Dinner - 5 stars ($24.95)Sunday Brunch - 5 stars ($26)Three visits, one week.  Hopefully, this is enough to pacify my husband, and we can take a break from the all-you-can-eat concept.  Big open dining room that includes a bar with seating is nice.  I always liked the wall of windows that opens up to additional outdoor seating.  It should be really nice when the view includes more than dirt, and it's not stinkin' hot outside.  We found drink service to be excellent at all three visits, and plates were promptly cleared.  Servers were also very accommodating in providing new utensils upon request.  First visit was lunch.  As far as buffets go, this one has plenty to choose from.  We found Asian, Mexican, Italian, steak, chicken, fish, and pork at the carving station that day, in addition to plenty of salads, cheese, cold cuts, and desserts, including a gelato bar.  There were a few minor issues that need to be resolved.  The steak was not a tender cut of meat, and a few of the dishes were not as hot as they should have been.  Also, some of the items were not labeled.  Yes, I don't need a label on fried chicken, but one on the soup might have been nice.  While I found this to be an above-average lunch buffet, I think for the price I would prefer to just order off a menu.Sunday brunch was the second visit, and worth every penny as the price includes unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's, bellinis, etc.  Although I can't personally vouch that it really is unlimited, I do know I had two and my husband had something more than two, and there was not the ridiculous wait that often comes with "unlimited" drinks.  Buffet had upgraded options from lunch, including oysters, shrimp, prime rib, smoked salmon, and eggs benedict.  Also more selection of cheeses, breads, and fruit.  So much to try that I had to restrict my intake of inexpensive fillers, and focus on the value-added items.Third stop was weekend dinner.  Similar to brunch, minus the breakfast items and champagne.  New York steak was at the carving station and mussels were on the menu that day.  No crab legs, but smoked salmon, oysters, shrimp, and some other fish entrees made an appearance both at the buffet and on my plate.  At all services, the buffet was very clean and plates are available in numerous locations.  My only suggestion would be to include an extra fork with the utensils.  Since there are none at the buffet, you need to ask if you accidentally leave it on an empty plate or you don't want to finish off your key lime pie with mashed potato residue.  Those potatoes by the way, had a ton of butter in them!Hands down the best buffet in Arizona. Seriously!I tried the sirloin, roast beef, shrimp, mussels, mahi, and pork. All were well prepared and fresh. I also saw crab legs, salads, pasta, pizza, and calamari. They have a ridiculously large desert selection too! The atmosphere is very modern and open, with an optional outdoor patio.It helps that this is in the new Talking Stick Resort & Casino, which offers several other upscale restaurants to explore. *Check out the 15th floor bar while you're here.Just a note that I overheard the manager at WHB tell a customer that when he was training staff, he used Yelp to find out what things employees should not do!  Yay for managers who find value in our reviews!After consulting the Great and Knowledgeable RAND...my plus one  and I went out to Talking Stick for our bimonthly  Mommy -Daddy Date night . This night's excursion was all about Talking Stick. We wanted to see if it was worth having a stay-cation there. First off Low Carb  heaven here folks!!   If I jump back on the Low Carb band wagon again this will be my Mecca.   Prime Rib, big sweet shrimp, lovely oysters ( actually better than we have had at Durant's and Bandeaux..seriously. ) Loads of fresh salad bar faves, like blue cheese , choice olives, mushrooms, bacon , nuts  etc. They also had a cheese / lox/ fresh fruit area that looked super healthy  , I must tell you the Kobe beef was very delicious and I wish I had had that first instead when I was full.  They also had some uninspiring Asian food and a pizza area..not necessary  for me but I guess somebody would like it. Desserts were good ..not stellar , but pretty tasty,  they had some great gelatos, and cute little Brulees, fruit tartlets, good banana and coconut pies ..THE WORST ...surprise, the   Cheesecake, it was sticky, sweet peanutty..what's up with  that!? the had an interesting fruit bread puddingish  dessert that reminded me of desserts I had in Germany...yum.Service was great , drinks were refilled way before they emptied , good service, nice staff.   We will be back ...In my book 25.00 was worth it. Want to make it 5 stars..give me tender Prime Rib and tastier Desserts.I came here today for a birthday get together for fellow Yelper Arana W.  Being a Saturday I was expecting the place to be slammed.  It was only about 1/3 full and it only took a few minutes to set up a table for 10.  In good weather there is additional seating on the patio.  This is a new building and I noticed the layout could be easily remodeled to a full service restaurant with a full bar and a private group dining room in place of the buffet serving area.There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good.  I have finally come to the conclusion that 2 plates of food plus dessert are all I can handle any more so I had my two plates of food and in that I had at least 20 different items in small portions.  I skipped the dessert trip (well I did try some of Arana's gelatos) because my next stop for the day was Sweet Republic.  Everybody had positive comments on the foods they had, including the desserts.The service, both at the table and the serving area, was excellent.  We were there 2-1/2 hours and at no time did we feel rushed.  In fact they were still coming around refilling waters and drinks.At $12.95 this is an excellent value and I am not sure why it wasn't packed as the casino itself was quite busy.  Lunch is only 11-3 and then they shut down and get ready for dinner, which I think starts at 5.  I very seldom think of a casino buffet as destination dining but this place sure comes close.My friend and fellow Yelper Robyn N. put together a little birthday UYE for me at this amazing buffet.  We were joined by Jeromy H. and Scott W.  And of course my daughter, Claire.  This is by far the best buffet I have been to in years!  Since it was a Sunday we induged in the mimosas and Bloody Mary's they offered with our meal.  Walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream.  There was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups. And several different areas of asian food with my daughter's favorite, fried shrimp, as well as my favorite, coconut shrimp.  There was an omelet station, delicious bacon and yummy potatoes.  I had the best salmon I have ever had!  It was like butter and metled in your mouth.  And there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven.  My daughter and I watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping, black olives!  She loved it!  There were so many choices and everything was delicious.  And desert.....omg!  They have a gelato station with about 12 different flavors.  I tried the Limoncello and it was delicious!  There was pie and cake and pudding and cookies.....my daughter was in heaven!!  We had a great time with good friends and delicious food!  I can't wait to go back!Consider this Sunday Brunch buffet the Godfather to all buffets in the Valley. If you're like me, you won't quite realize what you're getting yourself into until you've been seated and you make your way into the buffet room. Yes, I said buffet room and I mean that it's an entire room dedicated to the buffet. Here's how it works: you stand in line to enter the restaurant, you pay upfront, you're seated by a hostess and then the feeding frenzy begins. Once we were seated, we took a moment to take in our surroundings. I looked to my left, I looked to my right and everywhere I looked, people had food piled (and I mean piled) high on their plates. Had they eaten in weeks or had they just eaten last night? It's hard to tell, but really, it's also hard to blame the gorging-like behavior because the second you see this buffet, an animal instinct triggers in your body and you must attack the buffet as if it is your last meal on this earth. People piled entire meat shops on their plates and then topped it off with heaps of fried Chinese food, cheesy Mexican food, Seafood glory and any pastry, dessert or breakfast dish imaginable. For the amount of traffic this buffet gets, the staff, service and structure is spot-on and even with just one person working the register, we got through the initial line pretty quickly. Once we were inside, we were let loose to discover the culinary creations on our own. The buffet room is clean, stocked high with food and organized in a structured way. People pile the food high on their plates and this results in the food disappearing off the serving platters faster than the chef's can put it down. But the chef's aren't phased and keep cooking as fast as they can. There is every type of food imaginable and there's no possible way a human could enjoy everything this buffet has to offer. But it's definitely worth a shot. The Sunday Brunch Buffet is $26 for adults but it's absolutely worth it. I was told it's pricier because it's a seafood buffet. It's not your 5 star resort "stuffy" brunch but rather a nice quality casual buffet and probably the nicest one Phoenix has to offer for this price range and quantity. I will be back soon to try out the $9.99 buffet they offer on Saturdays. This is absolutely the buffet to check-out in Phoenix. You'll walk away as in awe as I am.Let's see there are not enough words I can use to describe just how great this buffet was....so I will just put it this way:Brick Oven Pizza.....CheckMashed Potatoes....CheckCreme Brulee......CheckShrimp Fried Rice....CheckFried Shrimp.....CheckChicken Casear Salad....CheckClam Chowder.....CheckAll Non-Alcoholic Drinks included......CheckKEY LIME PIE.....my favorite......CheckFirst Class Service......CheckAwesome Dining Area.....CheckNow that was just a small sampling of what was available at this establishment. If your into Red meat.....chips and dip....Bananas Foster...Sushi....Crab Ragoon....Gelato......Apple Pie....Cherry Pie....Fresh Fruit Parfaits.....Pasta.....etc.....I think you get my point.....They had all of that as well. Now it will cost you about 26 bucks per person....but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT.....I will definitely be back to try Sunday Brunch. So let me wrap this up by simply saying this is the BEST BUFFET I HAVE EVER TRIED.....and trust me for those of you who know me that is saying something. So if your ever in need of a buffet dining experience or just simply hanging out at Casino Arizona here  in the valley of the Sun......run don't walk to The Wandering Horse Buffet.....I promise you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!The place.Cant talk about Wandering Horse Buffet, with out mentioning Talking stick casino, its the tall building east of the 101 in Scottsdale. Im glad the people decided to ditch the tents and build a nice building with a golf course around it, and by the way the rooms are really nice with out a big price, if your a local check out  their deals during slow seasons.  Yeah and its hidden as well in the maze of slot machines and black jack tables. Well for the buffet, no problems here close as you can get to a fancy Casino Buffet in Vegas.  The menu is always changing so keep up to date great specials.  Another tip, the Wandering Horse Buffet also hosts great food for holidays.  As for the service staff, I leave a nice ti. Im being real when I say, I don't tip at all buffets.  For the atmosphere Clean classy casino buffet.  you don't eat in a smoke haze. the seats are nice and comfy if i remember right they have wheels, don't tell me that not fun.  Personally any place that can satisfy a dessert feast after a large meal wins me as a fan.  Anyways casino prices,    * Buffet Breakfast - $9.95    * Buffet Lunch - $13.95     * Buffet Dinner Sunday thru Thursday - $20.95     * Buffet Dinner Friday & Saturday $26.95     * Sunday Buffet Brunch - $27.95     * Holiday Buffets - $42.95 kid prices as well.Took Mom and her sisters for lunch here last week.  While I couldn't eat (was still full from breakfast), they had a very good time- especially my aunts.  The items that garnered the most "oohs" and "ahhs" were the sweet potato fries and the desserts-- aunt loved her coconut cream pie (it did look very fresh and rich and creamy... I was almost tempted to take a bite!), and Mom and another aunt really enjoyed the sorbets (mango was the fave).  Service and the views outside were excellent.  My aunts definitely want to go back.  Maybe next time, we'll dine outside and I'll be able to try the food.Sadly, WHB has slipped off its pedestal for me.  Lately, there have been some disappointments.  Actually, many disappointments.  As usual, prices have gone up while quality has gone down.Even though items are put out in small batches, many times they are not fresh.  I used to regularly enjoy their petite steaks, but now they're just dry, tough, and overcooked.  The pasta dishes may or may not be worth considering.  The crab legs on occasion are just bad.  At times, I have wondered if they were left over from Sunday brunch.  And when I asked for a freshly made tortilla (per the sign that says "made to order"), I was directed to the ones sitting in a basket that were already stale on the edges.  Really?  The guy manning the station was doing NOTHING.  While there are days WHB is nearly a 5-star visit, those days are becoming further and further between.  We used to eat here almost weekly, but have dropped to maybe monthly because of the inconsistency in quality.  It's become a "we have to eat now" situation, and usually not worth the $45-$60 price tag for dinner for two.What a deal, $13.95 per adult and $8.00 per child at lunch.  11-3 Monday-Saturday.  We enjoyed the lunch pricing and enjoyed a $47 bill for 2 adults and 2 kids.  What a great lunch.  Where else you going to eat for such a low price and eat white truffle oil infused ravioli, duck pot stickers, duck legs, prime rib with Au Jus sauce, mash potatoes and gravy, shrimp, oysters, scallop low mien, pistachio gelato , cheese cake, apple pie, banana cream pie, and plenty of other deserts that I could no longer look at.  Delicious calories waiting for me to fill my belly.  Seriously I almost ate all of that at lunch.  This buffet totally blew my diet and it should with so many great items on the menu you should find something that you will like.  In fact you should like it to the point that you will have to loosen you belt a notch to make room.  This could be the best buffet in Arizona, I have to agree with Rand H. on that one.I love buffets!  One of the main reasons I go to Vegas is for the buffets.  Wandering Horse is the closest to a Vegas buffet but at less then half the price.My daughter chose to go here for her birthday.  My husband takes a look at the prices for lunch online and is shocked.  It was $8.95 for kids and $13.95 for adults.  Wow!  That's a deal!They have a good variety of food to try.  I loved the bbq duck legs.  Yum!  The dessert bar was wonderful! The kids love the gelato and so do I!  But my favorite dessert was the chocolate chip cookies.If you are dining on a budget and want good variety, this is the place!Plate 1: Chocolate donut, strawberries, blue berries, blackberries, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, 2 pork egg rolls, a maple bar and a yoplait yogurt.Plate 2: steak, sausage, bacon and icecream.Beverages: Water, orange juice, coffee and a diet coke.Servers and bussers: SUPERB!Cost: $9.99+tip on Saturday morning...AMAZING!So obviously I am not going to become known for my food pairings, but the point is they have all kinds of stuff to meet anybody's desires at the Wandering Horse Buffet.  I think I only tried about 1/4th of all the options available!  It also all seemed very fresh.  The donuts even seemed to be made fresh in house as opposed stale ones that have been sitting around and sourced from somewhere else.  The fruit bar was my favorite.  I was too stuffed for the Mexican breakfast bar and cereal bar, but they also looked appetizing.   I am not really a buffet person, but I definitely left fat and happy!  If you leave this buffet hungry, it is your own fault.Upon the upcoming of a 2nd The Breakfast Club UYE, I realized I did not write the rave review of the last one as I intended. The mind get's a little slippery with age I suppose!I for one have never been a breakfast person but this was an opportunity to hang out with some Yelp friends and make new ones too, met at The Wandering Horse Buffet at the Talking Stick Resort & Casino. All you can eat and drink for $10.00 sounded like a great deal to me.The food was fabulous! Where else can you get any breakfast food you desire from fruit & yogurt, eggs made to order, fresh cut bacon,fresh pastries, with the baker making them onsite, the list goes on and on. Then to my surprise food of the Asian Persuasion for breakfast, I was in heaven! As if the first two plates of food wasn't enough, I decided that hey if you can have dessert after dinner and lunch why not have it after breakfast?I had melt in your mouth gelato, a small scoop of pistachio, salted caramel, and caramel cookie crunch, soooooooo good! I can hardly wait to go back, taking my Aunt when she comes to town and sweat pants!  Wandering Horse definitely converted me into a breakfast person! Thanks Monica for setting up an awesome UYE and choosing the best breakfast place in town!We just came here yesterday for lunch and still full today.We were a group of 6. We wanted to take my Mother for an  Early Mothers Day. Since my girlfriend has to work on that day. Anyway, this is very much like a Vegas style Hotel ,and it was packed. Everyone gambleing on the Wednesday afternoon.The Buffet was nice,although there was a party in there of about 26 people who thought they were the only ones in the place. After they left it was clam.The resturant is very clean,nice dining area. Our server was very attentive.He refilled our drinks many times and was always coming by.The choices are good. Lots of fruit and cheese,salads of all sorts.Mexican, chinese, and meats and potaoes. Lots of choices.Gelato was amazing. cakes and pies, Berry tarts.I always over eat at this type of Buffet.it is a really nice place to go with a nice view from the dining area. We had arrived about 1:45 so the girl did come up about 2:45 and tell us it would be closing in 15 min and to make our final selections for food. That was nice as well. They did add the tip on the bill in the beginning ,I am sure because,there was 6 of us.The Breakfast Club UYE was back at Wandering Horse Buffett again! Guess we cannot get enough of this place! Since our last visit in Jan, this has been the most talked about place, and we have been eating breakfast all over the valley the few months!  We met up on a Sat morning at 8am,,,oh lord was that early for me, but it was the perfect time, it allowed us to eat, socializing and well eat some more!The food was amazing, I always wonder if a place would live up to the 1st experience you had, and well Wondering Horse does, this is a really great breakfast buffet, it has everything you can think of, and more. I caught out of the corner of my eye a huge bowl of fresh blueberries, my hands were already full, but I wanted to take the blueberries with me!! haha  I tried breakfast potatoes, more like potatoes Obrien with fresh peppers and onions, a breakfast burrito, BACON!!!, waffle, chicken chow mien, fried rice, egg rolls, danish, donut, salted caramel gelato, coffee chocolate chip gelato, raspberry gelato , oh and coffee and orange juice haha.  Everything was perfectly pleasing!If you haven't been to the Wandering Horse Breakfast buffet, go and give it a try!Wandering Horse isn't the cheapest buffet around, but OMG what a buffet it is.I can sum it up in all up in five words:All you can eat steak.And not crappy shoe leather steak--delicious mini kobe or other steaks, as much as you want, pile it high.And you can do the same with the chicken, the fish and shrimp, the pork and crab legs, the Mexican food, the Asian food, salad, veggies, and tons of different kinds of desserts but. . .The steak--endless steak, tasty, tender steak, eat until you pop steak.  Just go back and get moreWalk into the casino, head in, pay once. and let the beef commence.* Review is for the SUNDAY DINNER BUFFET which was a GOOD DEAL *it's random that we ended up here of all places but several people had mentioned it at the airport. thought we'd check it out since it was close to scottsdale.now, as a californian, i hate smokers.  hate is a strong word.  totally appropriate in this case.  i am probably bothered by smoking many times more than the average californian.  (in fact, when i was a kid, i used to pretend to cough my lungs out while walking around vegas at the sight/smell of a smoker.)  really dislike places where they allow indoor smoking. in phoenix downtown, we would smell cigarette smoke almost everywhere we walked since they had to smoke outside.  don't people know that they can save themselves $3000+ yearly for kicking the smoking and starbucks daily habit (probably more with the healthcare they have to pay when smoking leads to cancer, etc) ??? *SIGH* sunday dinner buffet was a great deal at $20.95 per person.service was prompt. your drink orders arrive quickly. when you get up to do round 2 (or 3) of the buffet, your plate is cleared within a minute or two. their selection of teas are peets teas. so many desserts. i walk in trying to focus on what to eat before dessert.  all i see are plates of pie, cake, mini parfaits/puddings, the gelato station, bananas foster station... the soups were okay. i had the viniagrette tomatoes, olives salad that was refreshing. put some chicken (dark meat), honey smoked salmon, mashed potatoes with gravy, veggie ravioli, potato salad, etc. don't remember everything i ate. the asian station didn't look appetizing though..they didn't have prime rib but the beef brisket was delish!!my favorite dessert was the banana cream pie.  i wanted another piece but couldn't do that to myself.  the chocolate brownie with walnuts was also an indulgence.  the little cups were pretty but not worth grabbing. mini fruit tarts were yummy.we also noticed that some people ate a short dinner so that they could get back to gambling. haha. 3,5 starsThis review is a reflection on the UYE Breakfast Club get together that we all enjoyed so much. Monica O is definitely the Queen of putting together large groups of Yelpers and she does a swell job of making the event fun and exciting.This is my second chance to visit the Wandering Horse and always seem to have a great time. Brought my wife so I could introduce her to some some of my really cool party animal friends. She always hears me talking about them and this was a fine occasion to take it to the next level.The food at the breakfast buffet is always very good and fresh. They serve everything that you would need to get your tummy filled up and make your belt buckle loosen on it's own. There is really no reason that you should still be hungry by the time you are finished and leave this place.Service is always delightful and the place is usually very clean and tidy. Would like to see a faster process up front at the money takers. The line was very long before they opened and it felt like it took forever.Big shout out to Monica again for all her efforts and time. You are the Best and deserve a gold medal or a new cute badge. Hi to everyone who came and to those to did not make it. Hope to see ya again next time. It's going to be awesome. PARTY TIME!5 STARSI was expecting Vegas quality but this is just a small casino in Arizona.  Get real, Joyce W.!  :(We arrived at 6ish for a Saturday Dinner Buffet.  I believe it was $14/pp but I'm not entirely sure since my MIL picked up the bill.  They had NY Strip, oysters both raw and fried, king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, tilapia ceviche, a fajita station, pizza, a cheese selection, fruits, salads, Asian stir fry, a very impressive dessert bar, et cetera. Sure, the king crab legs were plenty and always stocked full but it was all frozen firm meat.  At one point, my brother-in-law asked someone to heat some up for us because it had ice chunks inside.  The raw oysters were sadly not fresh.  I was telling everyone I was going to down at least a dozen by myself.  Two fishy oysters in, I gave up.  You just can't choke down oysters that can't be pried off their shells.  I also ate one with too much horseradish to try to off-set the weird-taste but all I got was a clear sinus from it.  Whoa!  I heard the NY strip with au ju was pretty decent.  I regret not getting a cut because I was starting to feel like an ice cube from all the cold foods I was eating.  I think the highlight was dessert.  Everything was small and dainty and the serving size was perfect since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Give me more creme brulee and I'll be a happy camper.  I even had some sugar-free spumoni in honor of Brett B. and Jasmine F.All-in-all, it was a decent dinner buffet for $14 with an okay selection.  It's a very clean dining area and the wait staff is friendly and on-point with clearing dishes away.  They keep the glasses filled and the tables stocked with wet napkins.If you haven't been to the Wandering Horse Buffett for Saturday morning breakfast, what are you waiting for?  It's from 8am to 10:30am, for $10.95 (plus tax)  per person,  but if in parties 6 or larger, gratuity is added, but with tax included its still under $14 bucks!  They have everything you could possibly think of, from breakfast burritos, omelet station, yogurt & granola, waffles, quiches, slabs of thick juicy bacon SLABS!!!!, chicken chow mien, Thai spring rolls, fried rice, general Taos chicken, donuts, pastries and more!  I have been quite a few times in the last 3 years and each and every time service was great and the food was delish! My family and friends really enjoy this breakfast spread!If you haven't been, you really need to go, it's one of the best Saturday morning breakfast buffet I have been too.

Review Text :
Came here last week with an old high school buddy since we decided to try out a place from the Montreal episode of Anthony Bourdain's series, The Layover. so we settled on trying this place since neither of us had gone.First up, we decided to order 2 appetizers and share, what came was a very tasty dish of fried chicken and a second dish of fried pork under a mound of fresh watercress and sliced radishes and onions. Both were very tasty and by appetizer-standards quite large dishes and very filling. We began to wonder if ordering mains may have been a bad idea and overkill.I ordered the Green Tea spare ribs and my friend ordered a Ramen noodle dish with beef and eggplant. My ribs, if a bit dry, were OK, (FAR better than Bar B Barn, which I can't stand), and the green tea sauce at the bottom of the dish was very lightly flavoured with matcha. It's not the best ribs I've ever had but I'll give them points for originality. My friend however was very disappointed with his dish, he described it almost as if it was a Taco which they just threw into a soup with Ramen noodles and vowed never to order this again.The décor is very funky and clever and yes, it does almost have a cafeteria-style and vibe to it. The service we received was friendly and casual. I'd come back here if for anything else to try out more of these appetizers!

Some 3 stars are better than other 3 stars.  That's because The Yelp won't give us half stars or quarter stars.  Or any portion of stars.  No stardust either.  I did get some pixie dust at a Yelp event once but that is a completely different story than I am not prepared to relate today.All I am prepared to tell you today is that we had dinner at Flaming Kabob 2.  It was overall pretty good.  We started with flaming cheese (we felt that with the word flaming in the name of the restaurant we needed something flaming and we couldn't get certain friends to join us so we had to order burning food.  Actual burning food).  The cheese was served fajita style, that is, on a small skillet with a wooden holder.  It was very tasty but rather greasy.  What did I expect from burning cheese?We followed that with a couple shared entrees:  a gyro platter and some kind of chicken platter...I'm afraid I don't remember the name.  Both were tasty.  The chicken was heavily sauced (haven't we all been once or twice) and flavored strongly with garlic (haven't we all been once or twice).So to bottom line this for you (don't we all just want to go straight for the bottom sometimes?  The bottom line)  I would eat here again.

Nice little local spot for boba in the Spring Valley area. Boba City Cafe is a good place for a daytime snack or for those small get-togethers with a friend or two. It's really convenient because it's right around the corner from where I live. I came in to get a quick snack before running errands and had the honeydew fruit slushie with boba and their order of chicken wings.Usually when I go to boba places that offer slushies, they're not blended well and I end up having to chew on little pieces of ice. Boba City Cafe's slushie was blended well and had no bits of ice, just the full flavor of the honeydew. The boba was close to perfect with it being not too gooey in texture, but not rock hard either. It was more on the softer side, which I prefer. The chicken wings were pretty bomb. They were golden-brown in color and had this seasoning on it that had a little spicy kick.Seating is limited (each table had two chairs each) and they didn't seem to have a "small" size (the smallest size is their medium). Great place to pick up a little snack and drink if you don't want to venture into Chinatown for boba.

I was really looking forward to this spot, as Hotel San Carlos is such a dynamic location and lends itself so well to a lounge environment. But my experience was less than stellar. Less than mediocre, actually. But I can see this turning into a prime night spot if some changes are made. Like: neutralizing that funky odor; lowering the bartender side of the bar area, so they aren't towering over you; banning staff from using cell phones on the job; discouraging staff from sitting on the bar (this should be alleviated once the leveling of the bartender zone is completed); educating the staff on the history of Hotel San Carlos [come on, people! You host a haunted hotel event every October. It's fun to learn the freaky side of the property along with the hip end of it.] Will I be back? More than likely. But some serious attention needs to be paid here. Prior to being served, I envisioned this as a primo location for hosting a '30s gangster event, with cigar smoking on the patio, martinis, clappers and all the glamor of that era. I can still see it, just not as passionately. Fix your issues, or be prepared to vanish like a ghost after a proper smudging.

As the chosen restaurant for the Yelp Christmas Dinner, I had high hopes. Adorable traditional British gastropub that serves cocktails in teapots alongside bangers and mash? Yes please.In the process of booking the table of 20 people (which turns out to be their entire dining area) the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, patient when waiting for orders. So big kudos to the staff for pre-event arrangements and also service on the night. There were 20 of us, they staggered the meals well and kept us all well fed.The pub itself seems to be really popular with the locals, and other parties. When we arrived a wedding party were filling the bar. It has charm it's old-worldly but like I said, does cocktails in tea pots (which are called 'pot-tails' not the other way of fusing the two words, which I blurted out without thinking...)The Salamander Slapper that Catriona C and I shared was quite nice (we're talking pot-tails here) although I couldn't really taste the alcohol or feel the effect. There was a lot of ice in it. But good for the novelty value.It does pain me to then lower the stars somewhat and give an 'a-ok' review. The food itself is where I was a little let down. We all had to pre-order our meals off the Christmas menu. I went for the smoked salmon starter and then the "Haddock with Oat Risotto, Applewood and a happy egg". Now, on the menu that seems to be 'haddock WITH risotto', not 'risotto with haddock.'So when the mains arrived and the waitress asked "who ordered the risotto?" I thought 'uh oh'. I don't like risotto much but was willing to sacrifice it as a side for a delicious piece of haddock and a happy poached egg. What arrived was a bowl of risotto with a few wee bits of haddock on top, and a poached egg that was overly poached so wasn't runny.The risotto, being oat, tasted entirely of porridge. It was, as Aidan put it very well, glutinous, overly filling and bland. The fact that it was in abowl and the haddock was on top meant there was no space to cut the haddock apart from on the risotto, so the haddock tasted of porridge. And the un-runny poached egg gave no yolk to mask the flavour. (see uploaded photo)The result was like eating a big bowl of porridge with fish and egg. Weird. Bland.Luckily I was able to share a little of Kay L's butternut squash and nut wellington, which was far more flavourful. And the pork belly disappeared faster than you can say "cock-pot". (Damnit, I just said it again didn't I?) And the beef pie looked amazing. (See all uploaded photos)The smoked salmon starter was really great, the salmon in such thick slices. And the chocolate tart I tried, witha soufflé consistency was nice. But as Louise C said, there were no coffees or mince pies after. Yes, we make consessions that it's Christmas so it might be slightly higher priced. But...I did come away just feeling a wee bit disappointed with my main option. I'd be willing to give Roseleaf another go based on other good reviews and photos I've seen. The burger looks epic. It's  agreat cosy wee pub too. I was just a little let down by my main and had a wee bit of a sore tummy for the rest of the night because of it. I want to like Roseleaf, I do and I will come back. Just please don't serve me porridge with fish.

Review Text :
Definition of Meh.The place is brand spanking new, but the fact that it's the carcass of a former Village Inn, as opposed to a new build, is obvious.There was a lot of unfinished look around -- not that they weren't done with it, just crappy quality of workmanship.Look at the new light fixture on the newly painted wall, and see how the paint is smeared all up on the fixture.Everything sure looked pretty dirty, for only having been open a couple of days....made me think it may have been left over construction filth.There are sarcastic posters saying they'll eat bisbehaving children, and other such nonsense, framed in RAW sheet metal frames, complete with child-safe sharp corners within little hands reach, for your bloody dining pleasure.Burger and fries, a diner staple, shouldn't be too hard.  Supposedly fresh, never frozen, burger but who could tell?  It was bland and in a stange paradox, looked barely cooked to medium rare in the center, and yet was dry and crumbly upon eating.Fries were ok, and they gave a very generous portion of all the standard burger veggie toppings.Service was pleasant and friendly in a normal, expected way, but nothing stand-out.  One of the supposedly witty signs said something about "Sassy Servers" but I saw nothing of the sort.  (Probably a good bet, since I don't think the NoPho'er Denny's/Village Inn crowd would enjoy attitude ala "Dick's" in Vegas)I would say I'd be back anyway, and very soon, to enjoy their Daily breakfast special -- 1.99 through April 15, then graduating to 2.49 and 2.99 after that -- except that they won't allow substitutions, and I don't eat eggs.Whenever the dreaded "No Substitutions" appears on a menu, or is mentioned at all, I always think of the Peanuts cartoon special where Charlie Brown goes to that Chateau in France, and they keep wandering around finding that everyplace has a sign that says "No Dogs Allowed" (and there was a cheesy song to go with it, too)I am a 70's TV baby.  (which made me laugh at the children's menu items named The Cunningham, The Ralph Malph, and the Pinky Tuscadero)

Review Text :
I came here for burgers, I saw burgers and then I ate them.On my 'best burger in town' self-imposed mission, when I had a craving for a burger one evening I skipped my usual go-to option (which is currently my personal favourite) to try something new. Always risky, as if it doesn't live up to its predecessor, disappointment can abound.Holyrood 9A specilaises in two things: beers and burgers, and great ones at that (according to its motto). The burger menu is pretty big, with more inventive options from Italian (mozarella, pesto) and one meat-injection overload that I can't remember the name (burger with turkey AND prosciutto) with a few chicken options, and then some 'special' ones like Lamb (that did sound delicious with cumin etc.) and venison.I pipped for the peri-peri chicken, which I was promised would be a whole grilled chicken breast. Immediate bonus points, as I don't like the bread-crumb covered chicken breasts that were so popular in my childhood. As we were waiting in the back restaurant area, it was a pleasant ambience. A complete mix of students, and all us other folk over a whole age range. Big props to the staff who were all really friendly, attentive and genuine. They seemed to enjoy working there.When I passed the kitchen I looked in and could see them frying the chicken breast burger alongside the beef patties - no grilling. This wasn't what was promised so let me down a little.The burger itself was presented on the thick wooden board that is so in vogue right now, along with a purple cabbage coleslaw and skinny fries. Nice fresh sourdough bun, big chicken breast and PICKLES. I've realised that my other burger-place doesn't do pickles and how much I've been missing out as a result.The chicken breast burger was really quite lovely. Very filling but in a healthy way (despite being friend, not grilled). My partner's bacon and cheese burger disappeared fast which I take as a good sign, although the beef patty - on my very close scrutiny as I am on a real mission here - wasn't quite as exciting as it could have been. I like to see bits of fresh coriander or chili mixed in with the beef. But still, it was hand-made.The skinny fries were ok but I've gotten very used to hand cut potato wedges that have that rustic feel and I think that's my prefered potato option.As you can see, I am analysing every part of this burger experience. The reason being it wasn't my *favourite* in town and I can't quite work out why. It was good, and I would come back, and next time will probably try the lamb. But my quest for theeeeee *best* one continues.Overall though, great ambience, fantastic staff, filling food that is hand-made and not overly greasy or heavy, and I assume great beers (not being a drinker of such stuff myself). My ONLY complaint is its 3 doors down from my gym which I have to pass to get there. Guilt trippin' before the beef, sad times.

The latest in the Saga of Eating Challenges.....Stoney's North Forty was selected as the location for the 4 lb Omelet eating challenge.  Scheduled for a 9 AM start, I had to rush to get there in time to witness the action.  Four guys in our group of 12 were going for it.I didn't participate in the Challenge, but posted some pics of the Giant Omelette & participants.  I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn't feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.  The Skins were topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, and Green Onions....Ranch was provided for dipping.  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.Our food came out pretty fast and the waitress was pretty cool to handle our huge order.  The Omelets came out first.....they are really, really BIG!  Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it's covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.  Scott T gave it a valiant effort and came up a few ounces short of finishing the Omelet....seriously, check out the pic....he was soooo close, but couldn't do it.  Ken M who organized this thing did ok....respectable.....plus had ate it with a Shiner Bock....+1 for Ken for a Beer at 9 AM!Our Skins were very tasty.....the combination of toppings went well together.  The Sour Cream was drizzled over the top of the Skins instead of a blob of it that you have to put on yourself.....for some reason I prefer it drizzled over the Skins like they do it.  The Skins are very large too.....and stuffed full of the toppings....I'm glad I split it with my Son.....I was full after eating 1/2 of the order.Looking around the joint, it's a Country Western Dance Hall at night with plenty of room on the dance floor.  There's also a mechanical Bull in the corner for those who dare.....needless to say, nobody in our group was in the mood for a Bull Ride.....not after trying to house a 4 lb Omelet, ha!Overall, it was a great time....Will I return?  Yee haw!  that means "Yes" in Cowboy....I think.

I love the pizza here! After living in Arizona for the past few years, I've tried a variety of different places in addition to the standard chains of Pizza Hut/Domino's and I have to say nothing really compares to Stevie's! I love that they make a good, simple, delicious New York style pizza for an affordable price. They have the perfect balance of crust/cheese/sauce and every slice is delicious as the last. Everyone that I've had try their pizza has been converted into a fan. I'm definitely going to miss this pizza when I move back home. I hope they stay in business forever so I can come back every time I visit AZ!

When you enter this quaint little buffet you are greeted  (my best guess) by one of the Two owners (again I am guessing) a husband and wife team and maybe a dishwasher. She is reserved yet friendly.Directly to your left there are 4 booths that seat 4 and the rest are tables that each seat 4. (I'm sure if you had a group they would hustle to accommodate whatever arrangement you chose.  Rand H. and I paid and immediately chose a seat . We sat in a corner booth. I ran straight to the food and got some Hot and Sour soup. It was perfect!! I also grabbed some of the entrees. Yummeeee!!Okay 4.5 stars !!!!! This quiet little buffet with 23 items and a capacity of 28was a pleasant meal where I was actually able to try everything except the fried chicken and the fried fish (wasn't in the mood) Egg fu young looked like a hockey puck but was Tender and TASTY . . . plain or with the sauce! Thanx Iain B. for nudging us to try it!! because of work I'll not be partaking with Mike C and Rand H. on our next usual Monday buffet run. =( so anyway I personally didn't miss the salad ... a star crusher for the great and mighty "salad loving" Rand H. I also wonder about Mike C's feelings for this place because he is ALL about the DESSERTS. they had 2 kinds of pudding and 1 or 2 kinds of jello.,. WHATEVER I'm with iain B. if a small but sufficient dose of Chinese Buffet is what you are down 4. Come support one of the worthy small businesses in your hood!!!!!!!!! This is what makes America Wonderful!

"She barely knew your name"-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------Quick Review™+   Service -- in the morning -- is great.+/- Smoothies are alright. Aaaaight. Service during lunchtime is hit or miss. Don't come here in a rush. Like at all ... -    Free smoothie during birthday was not honoured. Check the check-ins, yo. I ain't a newbie. They wouldn't honour a single birthday freebie for a stupid ass reason and I will never set foot in here again. One-star all up in yo' face! -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------I am not necessarily proud of this, but I have tried nearly every smoothie and sandwich on the menu. Not every smoothie at some Tropical Smoothie Café® at some point, but almost every smoothie from their menu exclusively at this location.  Why? Well ... ain't shit else open (besides McDonald's®) around here that early. And I need shit to eat early. It is right across the street from the CSN campus. Service is fine in the morning.Now, what is my proverbial beef here? I've been here dozens and dozens and dozens of times (verified check-ins: 58, although I have been here more times than that) after all. I received a birthday email for being in their E-Club (which is worthless, by the way [not just because they won't honour what is sent, but because there is no point to it]) and printed it out like a good lil' soldier. Pro Tip: The E-Club is useless. Don't join it.For whatever reason (I am not IT), my name did not print with the stupid email. I don't know. Don't really care. My name is on my ID card and I have the printed electronic mail. If one would go through the trouble of searching for the email template just to ... what ... photoshop someone's name off of it ... don't you think that you would just also insert one's own fucking name in there? I mean: seriously. Pro Tip: Photoshop your fucking name on there if it prints sans. No one accused me of photoshopping another person's name off of it; however, how else would it be nameless if they are insistent that they are never sent that way and they cannot honour it. The manager said fuck off in not so many words. I had been here over sixty fucking times in a relative short period of time. If they shit on a regular customer like that, what kind of service do you think you will get while going through the drive-thru or just dropping in one day. Possibly the second worst run Tropical Smoothie Cafe® on Planet Earth* ....*Second last to the Red Rock Resort one.I don't play games: enjoy your one-star from a long-time customer that will never patronise this location again. Cheers!Pro Tip: Ask for the manager to be fired.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------Rating: One-star, "Eek! Methinks not." (Consider this a corrective mechanism.)

Review Text :
It was the summer of 1994... Salamanca Spain.I was there for a six week study abroad program, and I loved every moment of it, but I particularly loved the culture and the food!This all came back to me last night when I went to Iruna for their grand opening.  I felt like I was back in Spain as I drank sangria, people-watched, enjoyed the fabulous service, and of course, savored samples from Aaron May's latest menu...The tortilla espanola was my favorite, but I was also a fan of the gazpacho and the artichoke and clams.  One look at the regular menu and there is a ton more comida that I'll have to try.If you like any of the following, let me know:*ensalada de arroz con atun*pulpo a la gallega*paella*spinach and goat cheese croquettas*calamari con pimenton*gambas al ajillo*any / all of the vegetable sides - gotta get that verdura in!We can set up a tapas date and share!And it looks like their "hora feliz" (4:30 - 6:30 daily) has some awesome deals!I'd like to eventually travel back to Spain to relive that summer, but in the meantime, I look forward to making do at Iruna!It's true!I haven't been one of Aaron May's biggest fans over the past few years.Ranging from the mediocre and puzzling "Lodge" to the execrable and gloomy "Over Easy" (and it's lamentable cousin at the skating rink in NoSco)...I just haven't cared much for his offerings...no pizzazz....at least to me (oh sure, I saw the Travel Channel special, too...I know the Sasquatch is gigantic and gooey, but even I have my standards).But I'm prepared to change my thinking about the AM empire, all because of a few small plates of food...tapas...done the way tapas should be done!I wanted to stand up and applaud after my first few bites of the first plates to reach our table last night!But The Beautiful Carin was nibbling my ear and murmuring about love, the wine, the food, the warm night and the mood and well...standing up and applauding would have been embarrassing!So we sat there and snuggled in our little booth-like corner on the patio for a couple of hours and had a number of marvelous small plates and a couple of glasses of excellent wine and thought "How very, completely civilized!"And, then we thought, "Why haven't we been back to Espana, lately?"...Well, why bother with the flight when Iruna is within walking distance!Spend the airfare on tapas and wine!Iruna is a marvelous little Tapas bar that would be right at home in Malaga on the Costa del Sol...no kidding!From the communal bar/table to the walled patio to the colors and the lighting, somebody got the décor just right!And Iruna got the menu right, too!Crispy Chicken with garlic and pickled onions; shaved ham, quince and cheese cold plates; spicy scampi with a soothing aioli and chilled asparagus with spicy romesco all hit just the right note...well thought out and well executed dishes...satisfying, tasty and delightful!We even had room for a little dessert!We shared (so sweetly intimate) some sort of chocolate/vanilla crème pudding with orange liqueur and dark chocolate sauce...decadent and the perfect accompaniment to the very solid selection of available porto's  (I really did feel like I was back on the Iberian Peninsula for a while last night).While we didn't hit the bar too hard last evening, we did glance through the selection of single malts (a big "hello" to Mac and all the Glen's) and took note of the decent selection of brandies, cognac's and bourbons  (and for my buddy Brian...Blanton's, Woodford's Reserve and Rowan Creek are on the menu, too).After a busy week and a hectic Friday, it is hard to imagine a much better way to spend a warm Friday evening than a leisurely and sensual dinner of tapas and wine with the girl of my dreams, followed by a slow stroll home and...So here's the scenario:A foodie website with lots of citizen reviewers is holding an event at your restaurant.  You go in knowing the people at the event will in all likelihood write reviews of your restaurant.Do you:A. Treat the attendees as if you are doing them a favor, run out of food early and generally put out the feeling that you would like the whole ordeal to be over as fast as possible so you can get these folks out of your establishment.B. Seize the opportunity to put your best foot forward and capitalize on the opportunity to present your great food and friendly, professional staff to the reviewing community, in the hopes of receiving praise and business in return.If you chose B you do not run Iruna.To be honest, I am not privy to the negotiations and such that go on between Yelp and a restaurant hosting an event.  I do however have a solid grasp of business and marketing.In my opinion, Iruna's behavior at the recent Yelp event reflected answer A above rather than B.  It was unfortunate.  The food varied from good to mediocre.  I heard some folks got more than a few morsels, I'm not sure who they were.I experienced attitude from staff members myself and witnessed a number of other people receive the same.  I was frankly quite surprised.  It was clear to me the staff did not grasp the opportunity they were presented with and viewed the event as a problem to get through.As a contrast, I attended a Yelp event at The Breakfast Joynt over a year ago. The staff and management was pleasant and welcoming and the food was very good.  I have returned to The Breakfast Joynt 6-7 times since the event.I won't be back to Iruna.

There is the road now go away you F#$%ing skinhead. This is very nice for my first and last time ever eating there. Now everyone will know what a raciest this owner is.

I finally took the time to take my butt over to this spot. My brother has been telling me that this place was bomb dot com for weeks!! He also kept comparing it to the neighboring Chipotle and how humongous their servings were!!Everything previously stated were all true, but I still find myself under Chipotle's customer satisfaction list.  Yes, Cafe Rio is similar to Chipotle because of the whole burrito, tacos, and salad assembly line (where you choose meat, beans, rice, veggies, and dressing), but the tastes make it totally different and incomparable.I had the Fire Grilled Chicken salad and it was pretty good.  The portions are definitely huge and can be taken to-go as your second meal of the day!! What turned me off was the rice though!! There was just something weird about the taste and texture (I can't seem to find the words for it). The lime rice at Chipotle is definitely undefeated!!! I did like the avocado ranch dressing though! That added another star to my rating! Haha, but overall it was an OK place. You'll definitely need to hit it up on an empty stomach so good luck & eat well! =D

Review Text :
Oh wow oh wow. I'm a big fan of Charlotte local eateries, but Dressler's takes the cake...the CHEESECAKE. For days, I've been talking about Jon Dressler's mama's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. OMG it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. But I won't get ahead of myself, let's go through the digs and the meal first. This new location is nestled into the upscale Midtown shopping center and is easy to find and to park. Inside, it's a nicely styled upscale restaurant, complete with comfy booths and a decent sized bar. There is also a nice patio, but it was hella hot, so we chose to dine indoors. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, offering suggestions and personal feedback on potential menu choice for all parties. I ordered the Tuna Seared to Perfection - a sizeable piece of sashimi grade tuna, you know it, seared to perfection over a tasty rice cake. The best part was, however, the insanely delicious peanut sauce that was drizzled over the tuna and the plate. It was just enough not to overpower the item. Price wise, it's comparable to other upscale eateries, expect to pay roughly $20-$30 ish per entree, but it is worth it. Completely. All six of us ordered different menu items and adored them. Make sure you hear about the specials too, they sounded great. And back to the cheesecake...it was peanut buttery goodness in one little slice of heaven. Creamy cheesecake with the right amount of peanut butter and the perfect number of chocolate chips, all set on the most delicious chocolate crust. They should seriously make it a menu item, as it was a dessert special the night I went. Jon Dressler made a call to his mother as we were making our way out, and let my mom and I pay compliments to her dessert handiwork. Not only was she extremely humble, but she was just as sweet as her creations. I can't wait to go back to Dressler's for the fantastic food, great service, and, of course, the peanut butter cheesecake.

Stopped in for a quick takeout lunch today and was very impressed. The menu offers, typical Chinese options, plus sushi, curry and some Thai! The lunch specials are very affordable for the portion!I went with beef broccoli, which came with choice of soup and rice...all for $6! The container was even high class and not your typical Chinese containers. I also got the veggie egg roll app for $3 which came with two rolls. I'll be a regular in no time!Fancier Japanese sushi restaurant, Wild East is dark and dim and has lots of wood. Well decorated and quite fancy with bamboo inlays for the chairs and tables. The sushi menu had a good selection of "creative" rolls and the usual list of regular rolls. As well, some cooked food available for those who aren't into the raw fish (you know who you are).We ordered four rolls with a soup and a seaweed salad to start. The soup and salad arrived swiftly and we had plenty of time to enjoy them before our rolls arrived. (Yes, she asked if it was okay that all four were on one plate.)The rolls were tasty and fresh. Nicely arranged, nicely topped. Very nice.A good amount of sushi and while the prices were a little higher than I'd usually go for, it was good. I would return.Very good sushi. I usually get Chirashi plate, since you kind of getting sashimi and rice. But a little pricy!

Review Text :
WHAT TIME IS IT? Sorry, had to say it. Anyways, I have always had a soft spot for teriyaki places so when I saw these guys I was excited to try them out.Originally I was gonna give them 2 stars because I have actually had better. But since this was my first time, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.Since I don't usually eat breakfast (I know, people tell me that's a bad thing), when lunch comes around, I am starving. So I ordered the Chicken n Beef Combo Bento. Comes with one scoop of rice and salad. This is where thoughts of 2 stars were dancing in my head. When I received my food, everything was lukewarm. Believe it or not, the teriyaki sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle was actually hotter than my entrée. The salad was decent, which was I thought was better than the beef and chicken. Kind of sad if you ask me. Lastly, the portions were not much. At some other places, I get almost twice as much food for what I paid for which was around 9 and some change. After I got done, I admit, I was not all the way full, like I can eat so much more.Im hoping my next visit will be much better because I am gonna order a different entrée. If it disappoints again, it's going down to 2 stars. Some positive notes are that the place is pretty spacious, they take cards, and the wifi is free.In closing, I will try them again, that is, if Cugino's Deli doesn't call my name.

Review Text :
This is now my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley. It is modest in appearance both outside and inside, but the food is awesome, and Joann (the business card says "Joann's Kitchen - Thai Buffet & American Sandwiches, etc.") gives the service such a friendly, personal touch. At the start of your meal, you are served a delicious chicken lemongrass soup and appetizers of chicken satay, beef, sticky rice, and green papaya salad. The selection of main dishes may not be as extensive as in most Asian buffets, but the dishes are excellent, freshly prepared, and have a comforting home-cooked flavor. As my fellow yelpers Rand H. and Robyn N.  noted when we had lunch here, it's like dining in a Thai family home rather than in a restaurant. As with most buffets, you can eat all you want. But in this establishment, you go to the food counter and choose from the array dishes to be served to you. You can also ask Joann to prepare dishes to order, as Hector F. mentioned in his review - another departure from the usual style of Asian buffet restaurants. Fresh fruit is also served, at the end of the meal or with the meal (fresh fruit is eaten with the main courses in a number of Asian cultures), and if you have room after all the feasting, coconut ice cream, lychee rice pudding, and pumpkin custard cap the meal. This place is a bit far from where I live, but it's definitely worth the drive ... and I'm so glad it's not far from where I work. Yay!!!I loved this place!  It's like going to your Thai Mother's house for lunch, but better.  I was here a week ago with Norm R and Rand H and we all agreed it was a wonderful experience with fantastic food.  It really did feel like you were eating in someone's home.  They say it's a buffet, but it's so much more than that.  For $7.50 a person ($10 each including a diet coke for me and tip) this place is definitely a bargain.  Don't let the outside fool you either, it may not look like much on the outside, but they put all their effort into the food and service.It's not the typical buffet where you serve yourself from 100 items - our first course was served to us - a plate of papaya salad, chicken and pork satay, jerk beef and sticky rice.  I could have just had all that and been satisfied.  But no, there is more.  We walked up to the counter and they made our plates cafeteria style, a little of this a little of that and more of all the rest.  Yellow curry, a noodle dish, a veggie dish with eggplant, fried rice, jasmine rice and more that I don't even know what it was.  I'm not usually an adventurous eater, but everything tasted great!  Just when we were about full and done - there's even more food!  Served to us at the table was a plate of coconut ice cream, homemade pumpkin custard and lychee with sticky rice and a cup of hot tea.  OMG unbelievably good, my mouth is watering just remembering how delicious the food was.The most amazing part was they offered to make us other food that wasn't even on the buffet and suggested if we wanted something special to call ahead and they would prepare it for us next time.  This little place is all about service and homemade food.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks Norm for turning me on to this place!Seriously, Joann... raise your prices.Not often I would say that, but the very last thing I would want to see from this family business is for it to fail because of low margins. You get so much for such a low price here, its really ridiculous. And I know Joann (the chef/owner) reads these reviews, so having told her this last night I wanted to repeat it on Yelp as well, because this is the kind of dining experience most people will probably never come across, but is amazing. Im now sitting here wishing other restaurants were ran this way, because it would make people like me (I want to try everything!) SO HAPPY.Im the date in Rons review, so you can read that for most of the details. Just know I have never liked Pad Thai anywhere before, and when we finished off the large plate of it and Joann asked if we wanted anymore, I think my heart stopped for a sec in pleasure. And the dessert? Oh my god... oh my god. I could eat that every nightCouple of warnings though- the papaya salad is spicy. Unassuming too, so be careful.The 'green bean' in the curry is NOT a green bean. It is a very spicy little chili, and apparantly it was quite funny to watch me discover this informationSeriously. Speak slowly and clearly when saying 'peanut sauce' or you will have two 30 yr old men giggling like little school girls. Go, support Joann, and take a peak at her old photos on one of the tables in the middle of the restaurant. Shes smoking hot.I'm sorry. I feel guilty writing this review.  The people were nice, friendly, accommodating. But I have never been so let down after finding good reviews on Yelp.I don't mind that the location is a touch sketchy or that the interior needs some love.I did mind that the food varied from good to not very good and I paid 55 bucks for it.I did mind that there were ants...in several places.  On tables.  In the bathroom.  Deal with your pest problem please.I see why some reviewers say it feels like you are at someone's house.  That's probably why I feel guilty dropping a 2 star review on them.  For the money, skip the buffet and go somewhere else like Palee's Crown, Thai Lahna or even Thai Rama.Be warned if you go here and write a poor review you will be attacked by the owners and possibly a customer or two thru messages.  I won't respond to their childish messages which are one step above "I know you are but what am I?"For the record, my bill was $55 and for the record four of us dined there and all saw ants - including on the table.  My review is not the only one to talk about ants, read the filtered reviews.Message from owner:"When did you come in and pay 55 dollars? We know all customers and dont know you, a 55 dollar bill has never been written, unless you can prove otherwise. Customer satisfactory is very important to me. Please come back and there will not be any ants.from joann the owner"Message from another Yelper:"Thats funny that I go there once a week and have never saw any ants, yet someone like you goes there, and there are ants every where.  If you bathe and wash your clothes, ants wont follow you where you lay."If I were the owner I might have responded privately with something along the lines of:"We are very sorry to hear about your experience with our establishment.  While we have not seen any ants we have had someone out to make sure this is not a problem.  We would like to invite you back to try us again, we're confident you will have a different experience.  Thank you again for the feedback."

Was going to do an afternoon study session at the Starbucks next door and stopped by this joint for lunch.  If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?Back to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.They make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.The Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?The Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.Overall, it was OK.Will I return?  Eh....maybe.

Pricey yummy upscale diner food type stuff here but what you can also get is a watermelon smoothie.  A watermelon smoothie that tastes like a real watermelon. Like seriously, surprisingly like a real watermelon.Like I was with someone who was in Vegas two years ago and had one and insisted on bringing me here to have one. Watermelon.No artificial flavoring, just watermelon.WaterMelonWahTerMelOnW.My ladies and I decided to have a nice girl's day out, so we headed to Rachel's Kitchen for brunch. I was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service!!! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical. Heat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite. All in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though.Occasionally, I try to undo all the damage yelping does to my arteries.  So...I head on down to Rachel's Kitchen.My go-to drink is Sweet Greens with kale, cucumber, lemon, ginger, spinach, apple, etc.  Yes, it sounds revolting unless you're a hippie.  However,  I tell myself it's good for me (guh, who actually likes eating kale??) and gulp it down.  They have other, less intense juices like watermelon, if you're a wuss.They also serve food and it's pretty good.  I enjoy the vegetarian sandwich.  It has goat cheese and I truly believe most things taste better with goat cheese.  They also have some great vinaigrette salad dressings. Also, randomly, they serve alcohol.  I'm tempted to order oatmeal and wine one day.  Maybe I'll head there right now...Finally got around to trying Rachel's and I'm so glad I did!I met Ms. Fake-Up herself, Dana S, for a spur of the moment lunch and jaunt around The District. I had a hard time finding her in the restaurant because I'm not used to seeing her without all that fake-up lols. I was hungry but also trying to just be a healthier person (don't tell that to the peanut butter cookies I just snarfed) so I got a curried chicken salad over top a green salad. The green salad part kind of ruined it--personal preference...I just don't like vinaigrette and I didn't realize it had vinaigrette on it. No matter, though, because the chicken salad was good and next time, I'll get just the chicken salad with a sandwich instead.Also got the watermelon juice. Yes, it was tasty. Yes, I can understand that it's winter and the prices have to pay for more than just the juice. But over $4 for this juice was really pricey. I will skip it next time to just save a little change. As for the other aspects of business--service, excellent. Decor, excellent. Dining al Fresco? Gotta get on that before it gets to be like stepping into the seventh circle of Hell outside. Skip Panera and come here. Actually go to Panera just for the cookies after lunch. No Danas were harmed in the creation of this Yelp review.I met the Moll-tern here for lunch since both of us had this place bookmarked for a while. The high ratings are definitely well deserved as the food was delicious and fresh and the space plentiful and clean. Also, I am loving the patio seating until it gets scorching hot outside.I parked in the plentiful lot behind Lucille's BBQ at The District, and it was only a short walk form there.I ordered off their "Lighter Side" menu and opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. Both the salad and the sandwich were delicious. The sandwich had grilled chicken breast, grilled eggplant, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and reduced fat mayo. Clocked in at about 330 calories with the salad. Not bad for a filling, quality lunch. Calories well spent.My only gripe is that the calories are only displayed on the "Lighter Side" portion of the menu.This is a great go-to spot for a healthy lunch.Definitely not in love with Rachel's Kitchen, but something keeps drawing me in. T: Too loudH: Have earplugs. Holy fucknuts it's so loud in here.R: Read the menu for calorie counts. Some of the meals are in a healthy range.E: Eat the Chicken Curry Sandwich. It's in the awesome range.E: Eat the pasta not the pancakes. I've tasted the pasta and it is light and has a great garlic flavor. My banana chocolate chip pancakes had craters where the bananas must have fallen out or stuck to the pan. FAIL.S: Sit in the chairs and not the bench against the wall if you have short legs. T: Tasty beverages. I will give them that.A: Awesome cucumber water. Nice touch Rachel's.R: Ridiculously loud music. Did I say that already?S: Sit outside when the weather permits so you will have more space and won't be sitting close enough to strangers to scope their chunky earwax. Even though I feel they are VERY three stars I will absolutely be back several times because shopping makes this hippo hungry.This is going to be my number one place to eat a healthy and wholesome breakfast in Henderson, NV,Rachel Kitchen is in The District which is a shopping center,there was a lot of work going on in the area,so it was like a maze getting her kitchen,you know you are there by the cute patio in front of the building,the place is not that large but a nice size to enjoy your meal,the staff was very friendly and helpful with our order,I had the french toast,with fruits and a side order of turkey becon and a cup of O/J,wife had pancakes with fruits,becon and a cup of watermelon juice,she said it was soooo good,the decor is pretty cool,there is one TV on the wall,I think there may be two restroom here,but I used the one of the left which the sign says male/ female only a stool ( so mens don't for get to lift and lower the lid) Oh they also have gluten free food,cleansing juice,protein and smoothies,burgers,warps,pasta,and salads,definitely recommend.I've been to Rachel's Kitchen twice and both times were very enjoyable. The first time I had the cobb Salad (several months ago, back when gluten and dairy were part of my diet) It was delicious. I ate it out on the patio and enjoyed the nice April weather. I ate here for a second time this weekend. I ordered the Angel Hair Bolognese with gluten free pasta. It is a homemade meat (beef only) sauce. It was really quite good. I also ordered the Malbec. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place offered wine. This time I sat at a table in the back and I was happy to find that they had a outlet near my table, excellent for charging my always dead phone. So far both times I've come in alone... I think next time I'll bring my tablet and catch up on my book, rather than sit on FB/Yelp the whole time. ha.I wish they had a few more gluten + dairy free choices... but I'm sure I'll be back soon.Located inside the District at Green Valley Ranch.. Rachel's Kitchen has never disappointed me!Small, up-to-date, cute restaurant. Friendly staff and good service!They have breakfast and lunch items to choose from! Wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc. My favorite items have to be their pastas -- either Signature or Garden Pasta, substituted with their gluten-free quinoa pasta! Very tasty, healthy food!Suggested for your reps to bring this in the office for lunch meetings and such!My review of Rachel's Kitchen in the District is long over due.  I have enjoyed many a meal people watching at this location!  When the weather is nice, it is a fantastic casual place to dine al fresco.  They serve breakfast all day, which I love, and have beer & wine.  I was worried that when the District added parking on the interior road, it would make dining outside less enjoyable but I have not found that to be an issue or bother at all.On this visit to Rachel's, we started by sharing the yogurt parfait, which comes with fresh berries and their delicious housemade granola.  This vanilla yogurt parfait has the perfect mix of salty and sweet with a great crunch.Then I got the scrambled eggs w/ tomatoes & basil meal.  This comes with toast and breakfast potatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and the tomatoes & basil were fresh and light.  I ate a couple potatoes, which were good, but I was already full from the parfait!The BF got the sautéed mushroom cheeseburger.  He said it was fantastic, but since I hate mushrooms and swiss, I will have to take his word for it.

If you are looking for good pizza at a low price and not the cheap little ceasars type ingredients and flavor then this is the place for you! NYPD serves great pizza with just the right amount of seasoning , cheese and sauce . My experience here was average . I was here on a date we ordered pizza and wings. The pizza was fast and hot and delicious . The waiter was polite and courteous for everything. Te wings however did not come on time . We had to wait and eventually ask the waiter where they were. Me and my date ate our fair share of pizza in saving for the wings. Im guessing the staff dis not take me serious since i was only 16. , they believe teens dont deserve the se respect and priority as adults. After expressing my thoughts to the waiter and stating the manager will hear about this and that i wouldnt pay for the wings if it took any longer they took me a little more seriously and the wings came 5-10 minutes afterwards . That service took it away from 5 to 3 stars!

HOT DOG - HOT DOG - HOT DOGNaughty treats for drunken souls! This may not be the best place to go if you're a girl that doesn't want to see your man (or woman) looking at other girls dancing in scantily clad clothing 15 feet away from you. Directly in front of the Pussycat Dolls Casino, MunchBar's greasy, all-American menu sounded great at midnight. We were buzzed and craving some serious naughty food. The fiance ordered the wings (honey and spicy) and I ordered the hot dog w/ pretzel bun & criss cut chili fries!OMG did that hit the spot! It was soo good. He's a wings aficionado and raved about the wings. They were fantastic. The spicy wings were more on the spicy/vinegary side and not gross and buttery. They were meaty and very crispy. The hot dog came out perfectly grilled on a warm and squishy pretzel bun. This wasn't some $1 after hours hot dog. This was a real treat. When my hot dogs are delightful, I like to dress them up with the honor they deserve: mayo, ketchup, pepper and mustard. My baby got the works and it was among the best hot dogs I've eaten. The chili fries were very good, but frankly, I was transfixed by the glorious hot dog to notice the nuances of the fries and the chili to cheese ratio. Service was fine. The view of the dancers and other female diners evil-eying their boyfriends all added to a glorious night of hogging out. I carbed out and it was totally, utterly worth it.When you only have a 45-minute poker tournament dinner break and won't be allowed into Mesa with your jeans, hat, and poker shades, then Munchbar presents itself as the only option. Located right next to the Poker Room at Caesar's, Munchbar is a small, open burger joint with some tables and a half dozen stools at the bar. The menu items are scribbled in chalk-like print all over the two enclosing walls, so you have something to look at while waiting for your grub.I ordered the Turkey Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wyPkRQg3F5Yz2WqRFax7-g?select=ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA#ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA) with mushroom stuffing, cranberries, and herb mayo. The turkey patty was pretty juicy and I liked the cranberry and herb mayo combo. The fries, however, were absolutely horrible. They were mushy and tasted stale like they had been hanging out in the fryer basket for a couple of hours. I'm sorry, but a burger joint should know that it is important to change the fryer oil on a regular basis so you don't end up with mushy, rancid fries. They won't get crispy in old oil! Also, fries should be made fresh to order - they only take a few minutes (way less time than my turkey burger patty takes to cook through). My boyfriend had the Bleu Cheese Burger with applewood smoked bacon and mushrooms. He also enjoyed his burger, but pushed the fries aside after trying one. This seemed to be a pattern with all the other patrons at this place. I almost laughed out loud when the bartender asked me if I wanted to take the fries to go. I would have sent the fries back for new ones or at least explained to our bartender that they were horrible had I had more time, but I was on a ticking clock. Not a big fan of having to wait 5 minutes to get my card swiped when it is laying right there on the bar while the two bartenders are cracking jokes with what seemed to be the manager of the place. Go here if you're on a budget, or have no time, or are not going to get anything that comes with fries and you'll have an average experience. I really wanted this place to be better. Shame.

Restaurant name  The Duce
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Duce is an interesting space with big ambitions. I'd happily visit again and again with a group of friends, but it's out of the way enough I don't see myself seeking it out on my own. There's a ton of potential for the space. If someone's involved that can put together events that make good use, Phoenix may have a new hot spot.There are so many things going on here I'm going to have to break it up to tackle it.- The building (five stars)It's a cool repurposed warehouse. Lots of intentionally retro touches. The different areas flow into each other. There is the food area, which is open air because the roof burned down a few years ago and they decided to keep it that way that serves food out of a 60s travel trailer, the bar that was transplanted from a rat pack era Chicago jazz club, and the retail area which has vintage clothing, novelties, will have produce, and houses the gym, an area with stadium benches and an LCD projector, the coffee shop, and the soda shop. I wonder how they plan to keep an open food area tolerable once the heat of summer sets in.- The food (three stars, four if the prices were better)There's a brunch menu, a selection of sliders, salads, a hot dog stand, a couple dinner items, and some deserts. They're obviously going for fun and casual. I had $8 meatball sliders and liked them, the bread was good, and the tomato sauce tasted savory and homemade. The price seems a little high to consider eating them for lunch though. I discounted the hot dogs this visit, but thinking about it, I'm kicking myself for not seeing if they offer a real chicago style loaded dog, because Chicago street food staples should be the focus of the food here. I actually wish the experience was a little more "street food."- The drinks (same as the food)They have a selection of $4 beers, fruit juices, and several cocktails served in jars. I had a spiked lemonade, and enjoyed it, though I hate paying $11 for any drink. It had decent lemon flavor and came with berries in it. If you're with a group they have a large size for almost double the price that gave two of the people I was with two glasses each. Seems like a better deal, but they way they talked their drinks had to have been more watered down (from melted ice) than mine was. They really need to offer (reverse) happy hour specials.- The coffee (four stars)I don't know where the beans are sourced or roasted, I should have asked. But the prices were great, $1.90 for bottomless drip, I had a decent mocha for under $3. The coffee shop has a walk up window facing the street, which I thought was a nice touch. - The retail (two stars)Not everything was done / operational in this area during my visit. As far as the what I did see, it was mostly novelty. I'm too cheap to pay over $50 for any item of vintage clothing. My friend found a neat bartender's cup with tools and cocktail recipes for $12. The gym is $5 per use, but seems like more of a novelty than even the clothes.If you go by what Mayor Gordon and the owner Steve Rosenstein said tonight after their Chicago lovefest, I witnessed the rebirth of an old downtown scene by attending The Duce's opening night. They talked about a scene called the deuce, based in an area along Second Street that used to be a vibrant part of Phoenix. The vision is to bring that back to Phoenix by renovating the old produce warehouse district. The Duce™ (get the double reference now) is intended to be the seed of big change in the area. Time will tell if I witnessed history in the making, I certainly hope so, but I'm already seeing the typical backtalk about the owners and food (some of which I don't necessarily disagree with). Ryan C says this place is just cashing in on projected nostalgia. It's way too soon for me to be able to make that call.Wow, this is a tough one. I first heard of this spot a few weeks ago and have been dying to try it.Today I decided to take my Mom out for breakfast and we hit The Duce. Getting there early, we had the place to ourselves. As others have mentioned, there is a LOT going on here, it can be a bit tricky to navigate/comprehend what all is going on, but it's very well done.The Duce is housed in a beautiful old warehouse in downtown, and if you loathe strip malls like I do, you'll find The Duce a welcome change. Concrete floors, old brick, reclaimed wood, it's great.We were warmly greeted by a friendly woman who explained how things worked and gave us the lay of the land. The staff member told us about the great food and told us to either order at the bar or trailer.  We wandered around, taking it all in and then went to the food service/bar area of the business.Because we were having drinks with breakfast, we decided to order at the bar. After waiting seven minutes to get someone to come over, an angry looking guy ambled over (picture a chubby Amish guy with terrible prison quality tats)I say hello to the .bartender and tell him we wanted to order breakfast. He grunts, looks displeased and says that we're supposed to order at the trailer. I inform him that we were told we can order here, and since we want drinks we decided to take care of it all at the bar. Speaking of booze, I ordered two bloody mary's. The bartender made a face that would have made sense if I asked him for a kidney. He looked under the bar and said he would only be able to make ONE bloody mary. Keep in mind we are the FIRST customers on a Sunday morning. I was truly puzzled that they could not have the basic ingredients for a breakfast drink staple, much like how it would be if In-N-Out ran out of hamburger.I pay for our stuff and he mumbles something that could be Mandarin, or Pig Latin, I was unsure. I asked him to repeat himself and he was able to use his words and tell me to listen for my name to be called  when our food was ready. We found a seat and my Mom was asking what the guy's problem was, and I told her I wondered the same thing. Fellow Yelpers, please know- I am a really laid back guy, I don't get stressed, and can tolerate a lot! That ends when you're treating my Mom poorly, that is NOT okay, especially when we passed over 100 different breakfast spots just to try out The Duce( Matt's Big Breakfast anyone?).Moving on, sorry this is sooo long, but it was so shocking how shitty the service was, really! The place was really cool, the food was pretty good, and the other employee was SO sweet, but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender. He truly was a turd. Yikes.I will be giving this place another shot, and hopefully they find the bartender a personality transplant and/or the right combination of meds so he no longer a prick. If not, they will need to change the name of the place from The Duce, to The Douche.godi really really don't know what to give the duceas i am writing this spiel im still considering...okay okaypros and conseasy way to make up my mindpro:-favorite old timey domestic beers available for $3 a pop-great food-awesome concept-a real playground for adultscons:-bermuda triangle/wormhole/vortex/blackhole telephone booth-trying to be everything at oncewell despite being trapped in their vintage phone booth, abandoned by my carefree and ambivalent yelp friends and rescued by two chuckling meat head types who proceeded to deride my foolishness at getting locked inside a confined space and then panicking like a lost child separated from his overbearing jewish mother in a crowded wal-mart shopping center, i still happen to think that the pro's vastly outweigh any con you could dream up for the Duce. and ya know whatboom5 stars.ok. man. i'm on yelp pretty frequently, and although i usually just opt for posting photos of restaurants and their food instead of actually writing reviews, my experience of the duce just has to be told. so it's your average sunday. the weather outside was perfect and i wanted to get out and try something new for lunch and possibly get some day drinking in.  after looking over a few places downtown on yelp, the dude and i settled on the duce.  WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, MISTAKE. now don't get me wrong, i knew that the duce was going to be in an old warehouse downtown that someone had turned into a restaurant.  in fact, that's what drew me in in the first place.  that and the menu sounded like they had some choice lunch items. meatball sliders? yeah man, let's do this.  that and in addition to the restaurant, they also sell clothing and other accessories. it was all sounding pretty good. when we first entered the warehouse, we were in the area that sold clothing and other knick-knacks.  because the place is pretty huge, we weren't exactly sure where the restaurant was, and were hoping one of the MANY employees who were standing around might steer us in the correct direction. but no, not a single word from anyone. ok fine, whatever. so we locate the restaurant portion of the warehouse, and see many long bench style tables, a bar, and an outside portion with more seating.  we spot the bartender and say hello as we're walking up, hoping that she'll inform us of how this all works (do we just sit wherever and have a waiter take our order? do we order at the bar? etc.). the bartender shoots back a quick hello and then immediately begins to chat it up with another waitress, completely ignoring that we're even there. ooook, i guess we're just supposed to figure this out ourselves!  we see that they've got their menu posted on the wall, so we begin looking at it, trying to figure out what we're going to order since we're assuming at this point that we just order at the bar.  after deciding on what we wanted, we stood around for literally another five minutes while the bartender and the waitress continued to chat and totally ignore us while we were just standing around clearly looking confused. oh, and did i mention we're THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE? eventually we became so annoyed with this that we decided to go outside and have a seat at one of the tables hoping that would get the attention of someone.  so we have a seat and anticipate that maybe one of the ten or so people outside who clearly worked there would maybe attempt to help us or even acknowledge our presence at some point, but again, no! literally no one said anything to us! after a few minutes of discussing how severely uncomfortable this was and whether or not we should just leave, the bartender comes rushing out and says, "so did you guys want to order or what?".  uh, ok! whatever! let's order now that you've decided we exist!  she then tells us that we're going to have to actually get up and come back inside to the bar to order, and that they'll call our name when the food is ready.  the hell? you can't take our order here since we're already seated and were too busy having some chit-chat time when we were standing inside trying to order before? screw. this. place.  and i haven't even tried the food yet.  oh, and you would also assume that since we ordered the food at the bar, we would pick it up at the bar as well, but again, no. you pick it up at the trailer that's parked outside where they're cooking it.  and yanno, this would have been fine had the bartender taken five seconds to actually mention this. so the food was surprisingly quite good (shocking!), but honestly, who even cares at this point.  i was so angry at how annoyingly awful this experience was that it just didn't matter to me how the food tasted, and i really just wanted to get the hell out of there.  upon leaving, no one said goodbye to us or even acknowledged that we were exiting, but i was pretty much expecting that.  and just in case you forgot,  can i say again how we were THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE?  the concept of the duce may be a good one, but with such extremely rude employees that can't take five seconds to tell you how the restaurant works (oh hey! you order at the bar, we'll call you're name, you pick up the food at the trailer!) or even acknowledge that they have customers, i really can't understand how this place is going to survive.  i honestly do hate to be hard on a local restaurant, and wish i could say that maybe this could have been an isolated incident, but based on a lot of the other reviews, i can see that it's not. so in summary: i would never, ever, under any circumstance, go here again. this was truly the worst restaurant experience i've had in...uh, ever.The Duce is a disaster. As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.01/20/11A group of girlfriends and I met here for happy hour and really enjoyed ourselves!  I arrived first and so was able to secure a parking spot right at the entrance of the venue.  The shopping area of this establishment was an eclectic mix of "vintage" and contemporary items ranging from leather jackets that sell by the pound and tree-hugger organic tees to hand-painted glasses and nostalgic candies in old-fashioned wrappers.  There's even a boxing rink for those who suddenly feel the itch to go a few rounds!  (Back to those vintage jackets- I took this to mean that every jacket was weighed and charged a fixed price per pound, but this wasn't so... Each jacket I tried on had a different dollar amount per pound assigned.  A gimmick that initially piqued my curiosity suddenly made me want to leave the shopping area and just head over to the restaurant and check out the drink and food offerings.)  The indoor dining area was set up for community-style dining, w/ long rectangular tables and high benches.  Outdoors, there were picnic tables and chairs on one side and a silver streamliner at the other where all food orders are placed, w/ people lining up to order, pay, and then retrieve their orders when called.  Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside, but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends, a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't, away from cigarette smoke and the cold air...Two of the three girlfriends had arrived before the 6p HH cut-off, but one, Linda, had to take a call, and she was therefore left out of the "duce off" each drink deal.  This was the first time I ever had a grasshopper (cremes de menthe and cacao and cream over ice), and I enjoyed it very much!  So much, I bought my own supplies  to make my own version a few days later!  The friend who was not given the discount had originally wanted a light beer (@ 5:50p), but was told none were offered here.  We all liked our selections and agreed that we'd very much like to meet again for HH.One of us is allergic to gluten (no, not me!) AND a vegetarian, so after she had asked HER set of questions, she ordered the omelet skillet, first w/ ingredients that the kitchen was out of (asparagus?), so she settled w/ mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.  She enjoyed the dish, and stated that the veggies were very fresh!  I had the Brisket sliders and an order of house-made potato crisps, which I was told were coated w/ EVOO and baked, not fried (the streamliner kitchen was not equipped w/ a fryer).  I found the chips to be too greasy and overcooked (see photos), but my gluten-free vegetarian friend found them addictive!  I liked the brisket sliders ("the best you've ever tasted," said a co-owner) at the restaurant, although I did find some of the meat tough to chew so I put those aside, but found the leftovers fatty and sinewy- a chore to chew- the next day.  Not worth ordering again.  Linda decided to order dessert to share- the baked cinnamon-pecan French toast.  This sweet looked so enticing that I finally broke down and tried it, even though I have a pecan allergy.  I ate the caramelized toast pieces around the nuts (which doesn't prevent an allergic response since the oil is baked throughout the dessert) and found THIS delight addictive!  I hope the kitchen comes up w/ other versions that use other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, even hazelnuts...Those of us that sampled the food agreed that while we may not be in a hurry to come back for a meal, us meeting here for happy hour is certainly not out of the question!This is a long one but I think you will get some good info....I hope. I had a blast at the Duce on Saturday night. However I don't think the Duce had anything to do with it. I was there to see super happy fun time burlesque show. It was amazing! The only reason the Duce received 3 stars instead of 2 is because they allowed this show to go on. Lets start from the beginning. Parking - Free valet - Awe-some! I had read past reviews that said parking was an issue. I am not sure if the free valet is for show nights only or if it's just a fix based on past reviews. Either way it's good work!Entering the Duce- It is pretty cool to walk into the outside. You really can not tell you are still outside unless you look up. The decor is old school and I love it. You order your food in the first leg of the Duce race. It's a little streamline trailer that cooks the food. When we arrived we stood in quite a line. Everyone coming in or leaving were bumping into you in line because the douchy scottsdale people decided they would stand and fist bump each other right in the middle of the isle way. I really felt like I was in Scottsdale for a minute. I mean they had tons of seating in that area that wasn't in the direct path of EVERYONE. I guess they wouldn't have been noticed as much though. Uhhh this is why I stick to Phoenix. They shouldn't be allowed in our hood! ;)Food - We ordered our food and it suuuuuucked. We got the brisket sliders and the sweet potato chips. They put brown sugar on the sweet potato chips! They need salt to balance them....not more sugar. The sliders had a sauce that was not pleasant at all...even my partner in crime did not like them and he eats anything. * read below about the horrible employee who takes your food order. Saving Grace- Pudding Cake with banana, walnuts and whipped cream on top. Oh my .... it was one of the best deserts I have ever had. It wasn't too sweet but just the right yum a yum yum. That same partner in crime is not a fan of sweets but he helped me with it. I was bummed because I wanted to try the baked apple pancake but they said they didn't have it. So I got the pudding cake and I am happy I did. Next you enter the bar area. It's your typical bar area with an old B of a bartender. Thank goodness I got the nice guy. I was able to order my drinks really quick even though the place was pretty crowded. I decided to try something different and went with a Moscow Mule. It was really good! They do not skimp on the alcohol which is fantastic for all involved. They are all made in super cute mason jars and garnished to eye catching perfection. They also use a lot of fresh fruit etc. Awesome! One of the best I have experienced. Then you move into the boxing ring/ store area. They have vintage military items and old girly trinkets. It's very cool. They didn't have any of the lights on to buy anything which I thought was crazy. I would have spent a ton but oh well. Then the show went on in the boxing ring. The show was awesome!Later on in the night I wanted a strawberry lemonade so I went to where we ordered our food because that is where you get the fresh lemonade. The same two people were there and one had 5 people she was helping at her little mixed drink bar and the other was just standing by the lemonade. So I asked her can I get a drink from you? She said in a nasty tone "not a mixed drink". I said how about a strawberry lemonade? She said NOPE you need to get it from her. I was thinking how weird that was because she was standing by the lemonade and just needed to grab 2 strawberries. But I guess I was interrupting her doing nothing. So I slid back over to the line and the nice lady put 2 strawberries in my cup and that stupid younger girl with the blackish/reddish bob brought over a glass of lemonade! WTF?!? The only reason she did that is because the bartender supervisor/manager guy had come over to check on things. I was so pissed. Lazy! Avoid Her!!!Oh, and I am dying to know why the owner was interrupting the leader of the group at the end of the show. He looked mad so it was either he was mad it ran a bit over or it was too much. I think he was mad it ran late. I mean who wants to make a ton of money and only have to stay open until 12:00am?So to sum it all up - Service terribleFood- TerribleEnvironment - Good Parking - GoodThe Duce is a truly majestic place. If there's a place even remotely like The Duce in Los Angeles, then I need to know about it, RIGHT NOW. Please? Their whole set up is unconventional, which I love. Confusing, but wonderful. I'm rooting on their team for sure. Where else can you watch a guy practice boxing in a real boxing ring, shop for vintage goodies, sit on wooden bleachers your grandparents probably sat on in high school, buy a pie from a pie bar, get a soda pop from a soda bar, order your food from a trailer AND eat an out-of-this-world brunch, all in the same building. That's incomparable folks! Let's talk about their brunch. Fresh squeezed OJ? Divine. Cinnamon pecan french toast? Count me in! A bowl of fresh fruit? You'll never have to ask me twice. But the egg sliders? That's some crazy deliciousness goin' on right there. My sunnies are off to whoever came up with that idea. You did my stomach right and I wish I could shake your hand(s). I'll definitely be hanging out at The Duce when I'm in Phoenix again. Until then, I'll be recommending this place to every. single. person. I. know.I don't even know where to begin with my description of the Duce. I guess I will start with my first impression. I learned about the Duce about a year ago so decided to stop by and check it out. I drove to an industrial area of Downtown Phoenix behind the stadiums and found myself at an old warehouse claiming to be The Duce. I parked in a tiny parking lot and walked through what looked like use to be an old garage door entrance. As I entered, I didn't even know where to begin looking! It's filled with every fun and quirky element around. There are small pods owned by different vendors who sell things like vintage college attire, natural products like soap and lotions, locally made jewelery and yes, even items like vintage beach cruisers. They have a huge vintage boxing ring in the middle along with other antique workout gear that's still able to be used (and it is used!). To the left, they recently brought in the famous Rock Spring Pies! You've GOT to try one if you haven't yet. They melt in your mouth. Especially the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. Then to the right lives a garage-like restaurant with great drink specials, a picnic/backyard atmosphere with a large patio and they host a variety of special events and live music throughout the year. This spot is definitely cool and worth checking out many times over again.The Duce is fuckin' rad.  They make the best screwdriver.  Screwdrivers are typically boring, but I urge you to get one here.  So bomb.  So goddamn bomb.I've been here a few times and I've always had a great time.  Great desserts, great drinks.  Some of the reviews say they got shitty service.  Not I.  I've always had great service.  Ordered a shot one time with my girlfriend, there was a bunch left over and got quite a bit of free booze.Are you kidding me with this place! As a foodie who likes to try new places, I always keep an open mind going in.We went on a Wed night after work.We were never greeted by anyone. I finally got up to ask someone who I thought worked there. You can't tell because everyone that does looks like they just crawled out of bed! I was told that all orders are taken at the bar.So we head to the bar to order a drink and food.We placed order for the fod and waited for 10 minutes for a beer. The one and only person behind the bar was busy mixing two cocktails and had one speed, verrrrrry sllloooow. The only thing he had going for him was his looks.I continue... No one tells us that are food isn't going to be delivered to us from the diner /camper /car in the back. So it sat there for a while and finally someone came and asked if we ordered food, that it was "over there". Again, Are you kidding me? Two of us had meatballs sliders, OK tasting, but cold. One of us had the ribs. OMG, 5 ribs , nothing else came with them, mediocre at best and $14.00! Again, are you kidding me? No one asked us how anything was, picked up plates, nothing! We had no idea if we were to clean up after ourselves or what. We just left everything sitting there , in the rain outside. As far as leaving a tip..to who? and for what? Are you kidding me?I watched the video from the owners on their website. They say they are going for some kind of gritty , Chicago feel. Well I'm from the midwest and have been to Chicago many many times over the years and I can honestly say I have never been in place like this there or anywhere in the miswest! #1 in the midwest , service is key, here , not so much. If your are looking for grungy, no service, uncomfortable go ...if not , stay home, or go somewhere else. If I could have given this place a -10 stars I would have. You have been warned!On a side not: I always wonder if the Owners read the reviews? I would love to hear a response if so.......The Duce was the last stop for my last night of 39 and got their before the midnight hour forced me into the Fab & 40 club. I have never been to The Duce and had been looking forward to going.  As soon as I walked into The Duce, I was awe struck, I absolutely love this place! At the last stop my friends and I were at, I left a lil tipsy and was in need of some food, so when we 1st got to the Duce, 1st item of business that needed taken care of was order some food, after surveying the menu and debating on if I wanted something sweet or not, I went with the cheeseburger sliders.  Let me tell you, these were the best cheeseburger sliders I have had in a very very long time, the bread was soft, tender yet held the sliders together well, the cheese was perfectly melted over the burger, oh it was just delish!The Duce has plenty to offer everyone, corn hole, foosball, Ping-Pong, hula hooping, dancing, singing, drinking or just chilling, The Duce has space for it all!  Only down side I have is that it's hot, but that's the Phoenix summer weather, I am sure when it's no longer summer ticket, The Duce would be rocking! I am looking forward to coming back and playing some games for sure!Stopped in here once just to check it out. I asked the bar tender if he had anything on special. Immediately  he told me to "Get a job". Then he said he can understand some locals coming in and wanting cheap drinks but not someone with an ASU hat and an American Eagle shirt. I apologized to the guy because I didn't mean to come across as being cheap. Blew it off and he got me a drink.Other than that one incident, the place looks pretty fun. Perhaps I just had a stressed out bar tender. However, it's not okay to treat friendly customers that way. I don't plan on going back or recommending this place to anyone.Dinner and dancing, both are top notch. The pie crust is perfect, I had the chicken potpie.  Trust me, anything will taste great in that little pie crust lined mason jar.   My wife had the sliders wrapped in lettuce, between the grilled onions and seasoned beef there is a ton of flavor in those little guys.  On Tuesdays they East Cost Swing and Charleston.  When we were there the crowed was a great mix of 40-60 people of all types and skill levels.  It was a super cool sweaty celebration with more smiling and laughing then a comedy club.  Until you are inside this place is sketchy; the downtown location, parking and the building itself give off a vibe after dark somewhere between urban decay and warehouse district.  The payoff is inside and well worth the adventure.  See you there!

Restaurant name  Golden Nugget Buffet

Review Text :
Nothing to write home about. It's your typical low budget buffet. I wasn't expecting to see an elaborate spread so I really didn't have high expectations. I should've lowered my "low" expectation. The reviews are mixed so we must've picked an off day to eat dinner here. Nothing really stood out expect for the pizza alfredo which the pizza guy hand tosses and makes from scratch. Everything else was just blah. The roast beef was dry and tasteless. When the guy served it me, he practically flung it on my plate and looked angry. When I asked for the au jour sauce, he acted like it was inconveniencing him. I was handing him the bowl to put the sauce in but he ignored the bowl, grabbed my plate and dumped the sauce all over my food! Literally. I mean he didn't just put it on the meat, he put it all over my whole plate. Sheesh, who does that? My plate and the rest of my food was drenched. The fried chicken which was now drenched in that sauce was also tasteless. The mashed potatoes were good, not fantastic but good and yes they were drenched in that dumb sauce too. Like I mentioned the pizza alfredo was really good. Even though it was drenched in that stupid sauce, I really liked it. In fact that's all I ate after that.As for deserts. it looked very good but looks can deceive. The pastry guy was putting out new deserts and me being one who likes to talk to anyone (annoying right) told him the deserts looked awesome and asked him if they were made in house. He said they weren't and that they were bought at a store! LOLOLOLOLOLZ! OEM! I would never admit that. I did have a good laugh though. The deserts were dry. Nothing special. Will I go back here? Probably not, oh wait, we did go back for breakfast which was pretty good. You can order your eggs how ever you want them. I ordered over medium and asked for 1 egg but the guy misunderstood me and made two. Not a biggie, but the funny thing is, he kept dumping the eggs and making new ones because he didn't like the way they had turned out. I kept telling him it was ok, but I guess he was a bit of a perfectionist...lol. Gotta love Vegas.No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Absolutely not. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You can't be charging Strip buffet prices for crap food. Well, I mean you CAN do that and the Golden Nugget DOES do that, but you can't expect it to go unnoticed.A dish of "steak" is filled with small cuts of very tough meat that are smothered with a sauce that is actually worse than the crappy gravies Heinz sells in a can.The carving station turkey managed to taste like fish. It's a miracle, because I saw the guy cut the meat off of a turkey carcass. But it didn't taste like turkey.Surely the pasta offerings would be better. Wrong. I think they fill their cheese ravioli with toe jam. It's terrible. Terrible.I have a standing rule: I never rave about a restaurant's mac'n'cheese or mashed potatoes. I believe that those two items are simply impossible to screw up and none is truly as AMAZING as people claim. However, I can honestly report that the Golden Nugget Buffet's mac'n'cheese could very possibly be the worst ever created by human hands. Mushy, awful, chemically-tasting artificial cheesy nastiness. It's truly crap-tastic.Do yourself a favor. Take the $25 per person that you would spend here and bet it all on black at the next roulette table you pass. It's a better value for your money.

Restaurant name  China Wok

Review Text :
It si exactly what you would expect for a strip mall Chinese place, except for one thing, the people there are really nice and willing to talk to you about the food or anything really. For example, I noticed that there was a distinct "smoky" flavor to their fried rice. So I was thinking maybe it was the pork they were using, but after talking a while figured out that it was the oil they had. That combined with the 700 degree woks impart a very pleasant smoky aroma and taste to the fried rice.You can dine in (simple seating for about 16 people) or take out or have delivered. The dining room was clean and the restrooms were spotless as well.The prices were good, my wife and I got away for under $15.00 for the lunch special (which include egg-drop soup if you dine in) but the dinner prices were not much more. To me any time the wife and I can get away for under $20.00 for a meal we feel lucky. Heck, two people at McDonald's can easily pay more than $15.00 for a meal.If you are in the neighborhood and want lunch, give it a try.

Decided to go this place because it's very close to my house and I was in the mood for Indian food and didn't want to make the trek to Saffron.  OMG!  Most menus at Indian restaurants are the same--you won't find too many varying entrees to choose from, but still, the Paneer Tikka Masala (I think that's the name) was out of this world.  I've gone back a few times since and have nothing but positive things to say about the staff and the restaurant overall.This is a great place to get some solid Indian food at a pretty decent price.

Restaurant name  Surang's Thai Kitchen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Oh what a wonderful find this joint was. After my disappointing visit to Benjarong, I gave up my quest for a great Thai restaurant within a 2 mile radius of my neighborhood. But literally a few days later, driving home from work famished, I noticed this unusually placed restaurant with a bright neon red sign as I was driving by. I almost shrugged it off, until I realized I didn't register the word "Thai Kitchen". I immediately crossed two lanes and busted a biznatch. When I went in, there was only a single party of two in the middle of their dinner. I took a peek and the food looked and smelled good. The waitress/host quickly and cheerfully greeted me and provided me with a menu after I told her I was taking-out. She was very genuine and even asked me if I needed anything to drink while I was waiting. Got home. W-o-w. I haven't had such a fine tasting Styrofoam-plated meal in my life. Everything I ordered (Which I'll list below, because I've been to this place about 5-6 times after my initial visit) was piping hot, vibrantly flavorful and most importantly, satisfyingly spicy. Which, on second thought, might be sweat-inducing for most other people. I usually get a 10.. hey, I was raised on Kimchi and Sriracha sauce.Must-haves: Beef Pad Kapow (Spicy Basil Dish), Chicken Pad Thai, Pork Pad Kea Mow, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang CurryOverall, this is a "cute" little place, that serves excellent Thai food, amongst the best I've had, at a reasonable price and served with a smile. Only downside that I can even think of is that the restaurant can fit 40 people at best. Dare I say it, when it comes strictly to the food alone, Surang is giving Archi a serious run for his money.I ended up at brunch and then spent the day with a few Yelpers until it was dinner time so we settled on grabbing something closeby. Anthony M, David S. and I did family style. Chicken tom yum - this was nice since it was cold outside! The base tamarind, lemongrass and keffir was bold which I appreciated. I don't like mild tom yums so this was happy indeed. Crispy pancake w/ mussels - I've never had a Thai pancake but love all forms of savory. The batter that holds it is chewy in like a mochi like texture and the outside is crispy and eggy. It's served with a sweet and sour type sauce which was good with it. Country curry with tofu - I've never had country curry and neither did they so we figured why not? It wasn't like any curry with sauce, it was a broth. It was plentiful with veggies and tofu but this dish wasn't memorable at all. We also already have a soup and it felt like we had two and this curry broth/sauce wasn't very strong at all. Pass on this. Crispy pork - oh noms! I love crispy pork and the garlicky sauce is great with it and zucchini slices. It's thin sliced and then fried so all the surface is crispy. It's great for fans of crispy pata, chicaron, or any other crispy pork bits. I like a tiny bit with vinegared chilis which kicks it up for me. Service was quiet, but decent and filled out waters and our hot tea. It's pretty obvious I love Thai food and am not normally in this area, but have been meaning to try it. I think it's rather solid and would say to give it a try.(Yelp 100 Challenge 21/100)

This might be the biggest bang for your buck in the entire valley. Lenny's serves up good old fashioned burgers, shakes, and fries... The decor is cute-over-the-top 50's and it just works just fine - Well done you guys! They even have a drive-thru!*Again, I am astonished that reviewers would give this little family-run joint such a hard time - one star??? A freaking McDonald's in Iran doesn't deserve that. How would you rate the What-a-burger down the street?  Huh? Seriously, save the one-star reviews for food poisoning you drama queens. (I'm mostly kidding - no death threats this time)

Review Text :
I love szechuan food. This place is very good for that. I can't quite remember what I had ordered because I only read the chinese name for it. I believe it was preserved pork with vegetables and rice. IT was pretty salty - but you're suppose to combine the flavors with the side dishes (rice and vegetables). Overall, it's flavors are indeed: authentic. I wished I had ordered something more spicy - but my friend had a sore throat. Next time for sure though! I only come during the winter though - because eating here gives me that cozy feeling of being surrounded in spicy aroma (if that makes sense). You don't need to wait for long either. Customer service is decent - but I didn't expect something extremely fancy or anything considering the decor.

I would say the same in regards to trying not to smile upon biting into the Belgian waffle ice cream sandwich at The Lunch BoxCan't comment on their international themed hot dogs just yet, since I was tweaking-out like a cocaine addict coming down from a bad high for this delectable treat.  Probably the only thing you will need to *waffle* over is in regards to which ice cream you want in your sandwich and whether you can handle the full (3.99) or the half order (2.50).  Being my first time, I went with mint chocolate chip and got the half order sandwich, which I promptly inhaled within a few minutes.  Your tongue will be delightfully confused by the interplay of hot and cold, crispy and creamy, crunchy and smooth.  It's safe to say the entire Bluth family (Arrested Development) would have a love affair with this ice cream sandwich....taste the happy for less than 5 bucks!2012 WSOP Day 30I arrive at the Rio; crumbs everywhere, drops of melted ice cream on what was my last clean t-shirt and jeans, a napkin stuck to my hand, and a huge smile on my face.It's all thanks to a fresh, lightly sweetened, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside,  chocolate chip waffle sandwiching ice cream.  So simple.  So seriously good.    To all the ice cream snobs, this is not gourmet ice cream or frozen custard.  There are no organic fruit toppings, jams, or sauces.  Don't mess with perfection.The lunchbox also serves authentic Chi town dogs and an excellent Milwaukee style brat.  Other types of meat in a tube and out there topping combinations complete the menu.Check their FB or Twitter feed for unexpected closures.Just one of those little unexpected pleasures.

Review Text :
Sambalatte has become one of our favorite hang-out spots.  It's a large open space with plenty of tables, chairs, outlets for laptops, magazines, books, and board games.  There's also a small second story- loft style- with a tv and more seating.  When we were there, twice now, the background music was nice and upbeat- very W-hotel-esque. It's located in the back of Boca Park area, in the same plaza as Cheesecake Factory and Gordon Biersh, where it's a perfect area for just hanging out and people watching. The coffee and espressos are delicious.  The coffee is individually brewed and the latte/cappuccinos have designs in the foam.  Definitely a nice touch by the owners and staff.   They also have gelato, teas, sandwiches and an assortment of desserts and morning pastries.I would love to see them close a little later on the weekends because it'd be a nice place to get dessert after dinner.This is it. Ive been to many coffee shops around my neighborhood here in Summerlin, but allow me to say how so overwhelmed I am by the beauty of this place. Not just the looks but the culture and vibe.  This is by far the chillest and abundant place to catch up with a friend, read a paper in the corner, play board games with your nieces, or even study alone or with a group. Aesthetics of this place brings me at peace and drown in my relaxed thoughts. No bad vibes.The 2nd story has a big table, and small  love seats to hangout. The wall of shelves the holds an eclectic collection from books, to references, to magazines, and board games bring this distinguished old english architectural design. Theres a big flat screen that allows us to watch current events. Picture frames of a coffee motif bring warmth. And the lights that accentuates the place, makes this place overall breathtaking.Just one less star. This one star was my one true disappointment. Trust me I have been to many coffee joints, I always order a chai tea latte as I like to compare. Of course Sambalatte focus' on coffee. But they serve tea here but can't deliver it in latte form. Really heartbroken. But then I tried the caramel latte along with a chocolate coffee cake. Presentation is sweet and simple. But when I tried the latte, it was a little disappointing. Being a coffee connoisseur, I like my espresso strong with a hint of sweetness. It was weaker than brittle. the milk tasted watered down. Yikes.  hopefully it tastes better next time, as i will be back.P.s. Hopefully the business starts to incline so we can have this place open a little later. 10pm is standard. But sometimes people need late night study caves.A while back, I was living in SLC, UT for 6 years. I slowly became a coffee drinker since the winter in SLC was pretty long and chilly :) I was introduced to this great coffee shop called, 'Salt Lake Roasting Co.' which is located in downtown area. I loved this place because of their cozy atmosphere and the great taste of coffee. I am very happy to find out that Sambalatte is opened in town :)   My favorite aspect of Sambalatte is the atmosphere!!  Just like the one(SLRC) in SLC...The downstairs is a little bit bigger than the upstairs area (loft style, big wooden table with a plenty of comfy chairs & sofas, board games, books, magazines, & new papers are available to use). There are various sizes of tables you can set up on free wi-fi as well, awesome!! If you are a espresso drinker, I recommend a 'Affogato with Vanilla Gelato'-it's simply put, a shot of espresso with a scoop of your choice of gelato in it.  I usually get a regular coffee(Sumatra) and it is divine! When I order my coffee, the barista pours water over the coffee bean grounds, stirring them, and pouring the water (A hand drip coffee, yay :P)  But more importantly, the service was out of this world. All the staff were friendly, nice, and helpful. They also provide you a drink card (ask a barista before you pay). It is a great local coffee option if you want to do your work or hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  You don't get hassled or interrupted.Maybe they read their yelp reviews, because my service here was great.  After ordering the pear tree green tea, the clerk asked me to wait right there and the barista would bring it to the counter.   When I ordered an apple tart and a choco-cappuccino (c'mon, I was there for 3 hrs), a server brought everything up to our seats on the second floor....quickly.  No questions.   Thanks yelpers!  As others have said, great ambiance but could use more seating.  And bigger little tables.  I sat in fear of an overturned French press for the better part of an hour.   Excellent friendly clerk who answered questions warmly and recommended teas to our party.  Bonus points for the flatscreen, book collection and table games on the second floor.  Just wish I lived closer to Boca....GUESS WHO'S BACK! =DWHERE: Charleston & Rampart, inside the Boca Park area (right next to Kona Grill).WHEN: Sunday through Tuesday from 7am-8pm, Wednesday through Thursday from 7am-9pm, Saturday from 7am-10pmWHY: To drink tea/coffee, eat super yummy sweets, and most importantly... socialize and finally catch up with some of your friends that you haven't seen- just to have some sort of excuse to get up and go.! =)WHAT: Thank goodness for good past reviews and recommendations through word-of-mouth! If it weren't for those two, I wouldn't have stepped foot in such an amazing cafe! It reminds me of a cafe I went to in New York. The atmosphere is calming, you can even enjoy, plop down, and read a book while chewing on something yummy or drinking something caffeinated.I personally have this somewhat new addiction for macarons. So, that was my purpose when walking through the door. I noticed they had about 13 different flavors! My eyes lit up due to excitement! The macarons aren't as big though, they're bite size and almost 2 bucks for one, but you might as well "seize the day" and order all the flavors (which is exactly what I did)! haha, and from doing it I now know my favorites! Yes, I know you're waiting for it... so the "must-tries" have got to be: pistachio, mango, paradise, caramel, raspberry... ok, most all of them were really good! But those are some of my favorites. =DAside from the macaroons, I tried the carrot cake parfaitI It was a different way to prepare a carrot cake indeed, and the uniqueness made it perfect!These are the only things I have got the pleasure of trying so far, but it will be my goal to try everything on their menu! hahaha, which will probably turn into a LIFETIME GOAL on my bucket list. LolTake my recommendation now, and see for yourself! =DLove the great energy here, and a feeling of Europe.  Beautiful pastries and sandwiches.  Oh, and the coffee, fantastic.  Seriously, this has the just the right amount of distraction, perfect for writing the great American novel.  It has lots of outlets for plugging into, and a dozen outdoor tables.This beats a trip to that Bean place, or the Bucks...anyday.Hey Peeps - and they also have afgato (espresso with a scoop of ice cream, vanilla or chocolate).  Love, even more so.PS.  I'm pretty certain it's supposed to be spelled, "Affogato", but perhaps in Portuguese it's different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AffogatoI'm prepared for Yelpers to come to my house with pitchforks and giant logs threatening to tear down my door and have my head, but I'll admit that I was not blown away.I have been aching to try the Nutella latte forevs, and when I did today, it seemed like just a regular latte. Not hazelnutty, not chocolatey, just a latte. Meh. I wanted something so rich and thick that I couldn't guzzle it down, but I guzzled it like I could any other latte, and it was $4.50. Eep! I wanted to get the delicious looking fruit salad, too, but it was $7.75. Double eep! Not a budget-friendly coffee shop.The croissant was, I'll admit, a fairly good imitation of European croissants. However, it, too, was pricey, and not as delicious as I felt it could have been. I love macarons, and I do mean love, but they were also pretty meh. I want a combination of crispy AND chewy in my macarons, not just chewy. It gets major brownie points for the outlets, decor, and cool location. It's on the other side of the world for me, so I'm not sure I'd make a special trip. I'd be willing to give its sandwiches a try, and just stick with regular espresso.I wanted to like you, Sambalatte. Actually I wanted to LOVE YOU...but you just weren't worth the hype.Come on yelpers, you should've helped a girl out! I read many reviews prior to making the drive here. A lot of reviews were saying "good coffee." "omgosh best coffee i ever had!" "sure beats the hell outta starbucks" etc...etc... BUT WHAT DRINK DID YOU ORDER!?!? Besides the Nutella Latte I kept seeing, there wasn't any other drink that stood out in reviews.So what did I end up ordering???? What I normally order at unfamiliar coffee joints. A 12 oz. iced hazlenut latte. I played it safe. Yes, I know. (what else was I supposed to order!? send any suggestions over, please) At almost $5.00 for their SMALL SIZED drink....it was a total letdown. To me, it tasted like a waterdown generic iced hazlenut latte. I've had better lattes than this. =( I also got 3 maccarrons. Again, I read reviews warning that these are small in size. Ugh...these must be the smallest maccarrons I've seen. $1.50 isn't a bad price for these...they're about the same in LA. So with a large java chip iced blended drink for my boyfriend, a small iced hazlenut latte for myself as well as 3 maccarrons ran my bill up to $14.50! Oh lord have mercy. With that price...I could've gone to my one and only Starbucks 4 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There's two sides to Boca Park. You have what I call the Charleston side and Tivoli Village side. That's how I describe a location of a place when I'm meeting someone out here.  The Tivoli side houses the best of the best..REI, Cheesecake Factory, Kona, Embers, and Sambalatte.  You'll find a busy parking lot and even busier establishments. Smack in the middle of these establishments is Sambalatte. You can't miss it. Just look for a bunch of people outside enjoying their company and a cup of joe.Took me awhile for this review for a couple reasons.  First, I've never tried any of their food or treats. And second, I've never took advantage by hanging out long enough. Okay I lied. I once sat in here for about 3 hours while a friend did some shopping. I got tired watching her shop so I found myself at the Starbucks then migrated here.  This place has wifi and wished at the time that I had my iPad or laptop. I kept myself occupied with their iced mocha's, which is a good change from a the hot ones. Their iced drinks are perfect on a hot Las Vegas summer when caffeine is needed. Their mocha's are creamy and doesn't hit you all at once. I love a strong coffee, but not so much a strong tasting one. Their mocha's are exactly this. As for the my other choice, it's the good ol' Americano in the AM or an iced one in the afternoon.  The ambiance actually changes throughout the day and even the week. I'm almost always outside, but also look forward to take advantage of their desks and tables inside.  Service is a bit slow compared to a SB, but that's expected here. Their drinks are served in glasses, not disposable paper cups. This means you're meant to stay and hang out.  Until last night, it's been awhile since my last visit. This visit reminded me to come back.Ahhh Sambalatte where do I begin...This place is great if you enjoy a cliche vegas place trying too hard to be something it is not, trendy/local/hip... Its completely kitschTheir subpar coffee is prepared by uneducated (coffee-wise) and rude employees their latte art is cool but it adds to the already long wait to get some coffee.  #gagI don't frequent coffee establishments...in fact it takes a special place to make we want to go in for a visit.  Sambalatte is just that!  In fact it annoys me now when someone wants to meet somewhere else for coffee.  They are serving quality products here, work with local small businesses and have great customer service.  It is a little trendy, but not terribly pretentious.  The best part is they are carrying She Bakes products now...SO GOOD...they have summoned my taste buds twice in the last week!This place rips off customers! $4 large green tea, yet no refill hot water! Not even I offer to PAY for the hot water! Wanna drink more tea? Sure, buy a new one! I can't believe what I hear... The the so called "large" is about the size of medium than other cafe place around, and almost double in price. Don't waste your money here!PS: their cake is over priced & taste just like sugar...WARNING!! This place is super over priced! Low quality small cake cost $6+None Refillable Hot Tea for $4! You can't even BUY hot water for your tea, but only pay for a new order! lol~ funniest thing I have ever heard! No refill for hot tea? Really?? LMAO!It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup.  "Why is that?" Brenda asked.   "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.) "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.This location is a perfect spot to get work done. 1. There is a lot of space. 2. It's not too loud where you can't concentrate on work. 3. The staff is extremely friendly. 4. Bomb.com drinks!Currently, I am obsessed with their Iced chai latte. It reminds me of Christmas...but in the summer time. Sounds crazy, but Sambalatte has me returning every morning for the past week.I order this with almond milk and 2 shots...so it's actually an extra dirty almond chai latte. Opera cake is also amazing!!! Not too sweet and just enough to satiate that chocolate craving.In true, English Major/nerd fashion, I've taken it upon myself to start a book club, and I was searching for places to hold it.  Someone recommended Sambalatte to me, and I was hesitant...I had a less than great experience at another location, and felt that they were a little pricey for the quality.Well. This location was very different.  First of all they were PACKED, inside, outside and upstairs.  Luckily, it was only going to be me, my fella, and one other reader, so I found a cozy spot upstairs, got settled, and then went down for a drink.I ordered a chocolate cappuccino, and 2 almond macaroons.  It was about $7 with tax...still a little pricey, but when I got upstairs and took a sip and a bite, I was happy. The cappuccino had a great flavor, and while they could have mixed the chocolate a tiny bit better, I was really pleased.  The macaroons were light, airy, and amazing.  Fella got a ginger peach hot tea.  He enjoyed it, but the girl did not give him enough tea leaves in the press of hot water...it was REALLY weak.  Next time, we will have to be more vocal about needing more leaves, as he mentioned it, but was ignored.My service was friendly.  Fella's not so much, but I'll let him write his own review.The kid who rang me up was friendly, and curious about the book club.  I enjoyed my stay. They had a musician playing the lap steel guitar, which was awesome.  I will definitely come back.Chic coffee house that's great for getaways!This place is ultra cute. It has a little nook area upstairs and its the perfect spot to come for some quiet time or catching up with friends. They have a wide selection of drinks, coffee or teas and a lot of beautiful & delicious pastries. Indoor & outdoor seating is available and the little area upstairs is perfect for catching up on some work. Outdoor seating offers great views of Boca Park and is conveniently next to some great boutiques and restaurants.If you're a fan of Nutella I highly recommend the Nutella latte! The chocolate & hazelnut flavors are captured so well! I will be back for the hot stuff once we cool down...

We ordered the Cabo appetizer platter and taco salad. The food was very good and service was okay. The only issue I had was the wait to be seated. They had empty tables that were not open on a Friday night. They seemed to be shorthanded.I like Cabo but since they aren't consistent between the Station Casinos they are hit and miss. They were not busy and service was good. The decor is different depending on the Cabo you are at and I did like the blue lights they have at this one. Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to us. The chips and bean dip were decent but the salsa needs a lot of work. I always like to start with the "Con Queso Dip".  At this Cabo it is priced at $5.99 and was delicious. For my meal I ordered "Cheese Enchiladas" made with flour tortillas. I asked for very light sauce and when my meal was brought out the enchiladas were covered in sauce. I mentioned it to the server who said she told them to put very little. She then walked away and I figured I would see if I liked what was brought. Well, I didn't. The sauce tastes like it maybe comes from a can and is just nasty. The server must have seen I wasn't eating it I don't know but she brought me 2 more enchiladas with light sauce. I did appreciate the gesture. The food is just A-OK and nothing spectacular.  The rice is kinda dry. Hubby had "Beef Fajitas" and said they were good. There is a happy hour if you sit in the bar. They have tv's. Currently they don't open until 4 pm daily. With your players card they sometimes have monthly meal promotions.Came here with a group on a Friday night before our dinner reservation- the bar is rimmed with cocktail tables for couples or those grabbing a light bite. We were provided complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, and drinks came out quickly. Unfortunately, our server was a total Debbie Downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn't intend to order a full meal. Our waters stayed empty, a bill was slapped on our table, and she repeatedly walked by and said "thanks for coming" as if to shoo us out early. Considering we each bought $10+ margaritas (the mango-jalapeno is tasty!) and tipped well, her attitude was totally unwarranted.

After many attempts to issue a complaint about the horrible service we received I have officially given up reaching Doug the Cafe Supervisor. They just don't care or give a shit is how I take it so Binion's Cafe can piss off!Alright so we were downtown Fremont enjoying a fun date night out and happened to smell the burgers a sizzling over at Binion's cafe. We were hungry and  remembered the yummy burger we had last time. Our service and experience from the previous visit was horrendous and we decided to give the Cafe another shot! We decided to stroll through and check out the wait and to our surprise there was no line and plenty of open seats.We grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by the main cook who is Awesome! He took really good care of us all of the way through, kept our drinks filled and even chatted with us for a bit.The burgers were delicious and our tab was low so you can't beat that with a stick!I am pleased to announce our visit was much better this time around so we will be back for burgers!Real food, real conversation, really standard cuisine. This review is long overdue, about a month and a half to be exact. This was my secret spot for peaceful meals and funny conversations after each night of the Life is Beautiful festival. I also parked my car here and would get it validated after each meal, which I'm assuming they will change this for next year. The last day of the festival, parking attendants were getting wise to the real use of their spaces, and trust me it wasn't for the nickel slots. This place is not fancy, not pretty, but it gets the job done. From Thursday to Sunday I was parked at the cafe counter, usually around 1am, ordering everything your fitness trainer yells at you for eating: chicken fried steak, chili cheese dogs, the lumberjack breakfast, chicken fingers, and for good measure some type of fried westernized version of an egg roll. The standard color scheme of each meal usually landing somewhere between gray and brown on the spectrum. Still, I savored each bite like it was my last. Yes, this food is terrible for you, but who wants to order a salad in the wee hours of the morning? The service was good. I ordered food and it promptly came. This no frills style of eating can be enjoyable especially with the right company. I was usually solo when eating here so I would chat with my fellow snackers. Mostly old school gentlemen who would complained about how Vegas has lost it's "class". Apparently this dude has never witnessed the people dressed up as cardboard Transformers and bootleg Pixar characters on Las Vegas Blvd. In-all seriousness the guy has a point. The Binions Cafe is by no means something to rave about, but like a blue collar worker, it's reliable and gets the job done no matter the situation.

This past Saturday my mom was surprised when I insisted on taking her out for prime rib at lunch.  So we approach the smallish, dark, slightly smokey sign that says, "Please Seat Yourself. " She smirked when she saw the special Weekend Only price of $3.99 - it's normally 10 bucks, still a good deal.  Well,  mom you taught me the importance of good value for the buck, and this place is it.  The other awesome specials were Steak and Shrimp for $6.99 and steak and lobster for $9.99.  This place ain't no fancy rest-oo-rant, but if ya likes ya some grub fo' cheap, dis is da place, chile.  For less than the price of a Big Mac combo, you can haves ya self the Prime Rib special fo' fo'...well, ok -- fo' 3 nineteh nahn!  $3.99, not $13.99 like at second rate restaurants or $20 plus at the fancy tie and tail places.  On Fridays and Saturdays, this crazy price is the favored special.  Come early, and your prime rib cut will be large.  Mine was about a half pound.  And rumor is, as the day wears on and the place fills up, they start to run out. Well, guess what...your meat becomes smaller.  That's just awful when that happens.     I ordered my prime rib medium, and so did my mom.  It came out perfectly medium, warm with just a slight amount of red.  It comes with a baked potato and mixed veggies. You may get turned off by the excessive amount of black pepper the chef douses the prime rib and veggies with.  But scrape it off or tell them, ".Salt but no peppah here... please".  We also ordered sodas.  All told, the bill was about $12.50 plus tax and tip.  We each only finished half of the slab, neither of us wanted the flab.  So we took the rest home to eat later.This is basically the restaurant for Lucky Casino. This place is great if you love singing karaoke Sunday afternoons in Spanish, because that's what makes this place rock after the locals go to the noon Catholic mass. English is the second language, however. Speaking of tail, please don't be surprised if a few disheveled chica's de la noche, or Lady Marmalade shows up.  Hey business is down and even les girls get hungry and need to save money.

Do you like tender, fall-off-the-bone stewed meats that are rich with flavorful spices and unique to the average palette?   If so, then you should pick a night you don't have much going on and head over to A Taste of the Caribbean.  My roomie and I have been here a handful of times and are always happy with our visit.  Things to try:Jerk ChickenGoat CurryBrown Stew ChickenBeef Patties (not sure why they call them that though)Yucca dessert - tastes coconutty!Notes:They are on their own clock so don't be in a hurry!I wish they'd have some music playing instead of the TV all the time.  That'd match the colorful design a bit more.  Sometimes the beef patties are too dry but I like them anyway! lolNow that I'm writing about it... I kinda wanna go again!  I wanna get their oxtail... they were in between batches when I tried to order it last time.  See ya there.Bruce Banner has to fight to keep the Hulk contained. I fight the same battle with Vanilla Heat. Born in Jamaica's Hedonism 3 resort I regularly feasted on jerk chicken, rice, and plantains. While I have managed well over the past couple of years to keep VH under control, I did have a hankering for Caribbean food this weekend and found A Taste of the Caribbean at Baseline & Mill. I could feel Vanilla Heat fighting to get out.From my table I could hear the sizzle from the chicken as it cooked and I began looking forward to its arrival. While waiting I looked at my mobile app and saw several Yelp reviews and the only negative thing I really saw was the level of spice. I am not sure if the owners made a change, but the jerk chicken was spicy on my visit. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and had an excellent flavor. It came with a side of red beans & rice, cabbage, and 3 plantains. The owner told me if I needed more rice, cabbage, or plantains to ask him.The restaurant is small and colorful with very pleasant decorations, and Pandora played nice reggae rhythms. This restaurant took me back to my trip to Jamaica and provided the best jerk chicken I have had since. Thankfully it didn't take me all the way back, else I would have ran naked through the parking lot yelling SHABBA! But any time I need a jerk chicken fix this will be the spot!You know when you get a huge plate of delicious looking food and all your dining companions comment that in no way could you ever finish all that food? A Taste of the Caribbean is like that. Only the food is just that good that you WILL finish your gigantor plate of grub!They have only a few drink options (your typical Coke products, some tea and juice options).  The spot is super cute and bright, and reminded me of some of the hole in the wall joints I've visited on my Central American and Caribbean travels. I don't know about you, but brightly colored walls just make me happy!My only complaint was some super Evangelical TV show was on. Sure, we probably could've asked for it to be turned off or volume down, but I didn't want to offend the adorable cook, "Mama."Will I be back?  Heck yes!When I heard that there was a place serving vegan Caribbean food, I was so excited to check it out. Caribbean Spice did not disappoint.They have a menu board, with a "Vegan Corner," where they list the most popular vegan options, like Vegan Jerk Chicken and Vegan Curry Chicken. Other vegan options on the board included, Jerk Tofu, Veggie Curry, Curry Tofu, and Vegetable Roti.I spoke with one of the owners and she went over their vegan menu with me:They have Tofu or soy chicken (Beyond Meat) available as a vegan protein; you choose which.Vegan curry comes in a tofu or veggie option. The veggie curry is made with chickpeas and curry potatoes.Beans & rice are made with coconut milk; no butter, animal milk or broth involved.Cabbage and plantains are vegan.She said that they have a veggie patty that is vegan too. She added that they cook everything fresh, so even if you don't see something on the board, just ask for vegan.They do not have any vegan desserts at this time.  Per owner, they don't use animal milk (they use coconut milk), but they do use eggs in their cakes. I ordered the Vegan Jerk Chicken for $9.95, which comes with 2 sides: beans & rice, cabbage, or fried plantains. I  ordered the beans & rice and cabbage, but with a side of fried plantains (@ $3.50).  That jerk "chicken" was beyond amazing, and they gave me a huge heaping!  I spooned some of the jerk sauce onto my beans & rice and the result was heavenly; deliciously divine. The cabbage was nicely seasoned, but it had more of a crunchy consistency than to what I am accustomed. It was good, nonetheless. I left not one morsel on that plate. My plantains never came, but it was ok because I was too full to eat anything else anyway.  I simply asked for a refund, which I was given without hesitation. My DD, who's non-veg, ordered the regular Jerk Chicken plate, and she loved it. For drinks, they had ice tea, canned sodas (Coke products) and some bottled drinks, which appeared to be from fellow Caribbean nations.  They have a juice bar and smoothies as well.Order and pay at the counter; they'll bring the food to your table.  I particularly liked that they brought me a straw with my ice water, so I didn't have to ask.  I went for lunch and arrived around 11:30am. There was only 1 other table at that time, and they were already eating, so my food didn't take long to arrive. Don't expect typical American friendly service. They're nice in their own way, just not the friendly-bob, perky, smiley faces that some people like and want. Cozy little inside. One wall is hand-painted with pictures of South America and the Caribbean Sea. The owners are from Guyana, so their flag is proudly displayed. There was an air-suspended TV,  playing some reality show, which kept me entertained. I really like the outside, which has a wraparound porch with tables. I'd love to eat out there once the weather cools down. Shares a parking lot with neighboring businesses.  Their sign is visible from Baseline, so it was easy to find.Delicious vegan Caribbean food at a reasonable price. I'll definitely go back; I want to try the curry too!For December's International Supper club, we headed off to Caribbean Spice to give them a try!It's a small place with a simple menu on the wall, but we were a party of 6 and there still was plenty of seating room for others.After checking out the menu I went with a small jerk chicken, it came with beans & rice, cabbage & carrots , thigh and drumstick. The flavoring of the jerk chicken was amazing, perfectly blended spices, the only complaint I could have is that there wasn't enough chicken to enjoy all those flavors, the thigh and drumstick where are on the tiny side. The rice and beans where plain in flavor but cooked perfectly, and the sautéed cabbage and carrots lacked in flavor as well. The jerk chicken was the star of that plate.Service was friendly and good. I'm going to have to come back and try them for lunch.

09/08 and 09/29On my first visit here, I ordered egg rolls and a stir-fried beef noodle dish.  It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.Really loved the egg rolls!  They're so good, I'm going to have to order them every time I visit.  The noodles were good, but the meat portion of this dish was pretty dismal-- the noodle to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1.  No exaggeration!  (I had hoped it was a fluke, but it wasn't-- more detail to come later.)  Once I'd exhausted the beef content (and there wasn't much), I wasn't satisfied enough w/ the noodle flavor to continue.  (If only the noodles were as tasty as those I'd tried at Saigon Bowl the night before...)  There was no doubt, however, that these noodles were freshly made--  I really enjoyed its texture!Took Mom w/ me on my second visit.  Decided to try the steamed gyoza and a noodle dish w/ ground pork.  Wished I'd ordered the eggrolls, instead :(  The gyoza dish was, without question, the worst WE'D ever tried!  Too heavy on the batter, and steamed was definitely not the way to go.  (Once you have a look at the photos, you'll agree!)  Same thing w/ the pork.  Too crumbly and unexciting flavor (salty and lemony), and again, the meat to noodle ratio was very low.  Two visits, and it's Hit-1, Miss-1.  At least I'll know that the app will be a hit (egg rolls), and if I remember to order a double- or a triple-serving of meat, maybe the noodle portion won't be a miss...If you want noodles, this is the place, they have them stir fried, steamed & in soups, the menu is simple, the prices are cheap, and the food AMAZING!I wanted to go check out China Magic Noodle House Friday night for dinner but was having a hard time getting someone to go with me, so finally I got my daughter & her best friend to say yes they will go. They both work and it was rare that they had a Friday night off and they wanted to head over to the Ostrich Festival and not hang out with a parent unit LOL .  Each one of us ordered a different dish, one ordered the noodles with minced pork sauce, another ordered the beef fried noodle dish (forget its name or number but it looks like chow main) and I ordered the beef with oyster sauce, Let me tell you, each dish was delish! The noodles are so fresh! The girls enjoyed watching the noodles being made through the window. I can't wait to try out other things on the menu.6 star food, 3 star ambiance, 4 star review.It is the real deal for Chinese food. I have pretty Americanized tastes, but even I could appreciate their menu watching them make the noodles right then and there is so cool for someone who does not know much about the process. The food itself is very darn tasty. The shredded noodles are thick, filling, and delicious especially with beef. I have gotten beef tripe stew here and it was awesome; it felt like I was eating Asian menudo and that's a great feeling.Service was good, but this place is just not special inside. It is not very nice inside to impress people which is a shame because the food is great and priced very well. One last thing the portions are also very large, a definite plus.I've been coming here for awhile and I love this place. It's all about the food and the freshens of the noodles. Don't come here thinking about great atmosphere, decor, or service. This place is all about the good. Fresh noodles. The place is very casual and either you pick  a table or they will pick a table for you. The table already has a bunch of chop sticks and soup spoons stack on each table with paper napkins for your liking. The servers there speak mostly Chinese but can speak English. Sometimes you have to repeat yourself to make sure they got the order right. I always order the seafood noodles with shrimp, squid, and fish balls. It has cabbage, carrots, onions. I have order the different noodle types. Usually order the normal or thick noodles but any noodles you order are always good. They have four or five different noodles you can choose from. Oh yes, the pan fried dumplings are huge. It comes with eight in an order. They are so juicy and always cooked perfectly. I always have to order their dumplings. I think they are probably the best that I've found in Arizona or California. It's that good. Overall, I love this noodle place and have no problem coming here all the time cause the noodles are so fresh. Yum yum. EnjoyThis place is really cool and has some of the freshest Noodles in town. Just happened to be in the neighborhood and had to check them out. After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.The menu here has a large assortment of different types of both noodle sizes and shapes. You can basically pick the type of noodle you want and they will make one of their tasty dishes to your specifications.Inside is very nice with all the condiments you need right at your table. Some of the tables are bigger and can suport those crazy noodle parties that can spontaneously erupt.Started with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Order the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.So many different things on the menu with several choices of flavors and textures. This place is really fun and a delicious treat. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items. Hear that the Spicy Pig Ear is also very good. No Pun intended.Located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee's. See ya there next time. MAGIC TAKES THE SHOT ... SCORES!4.5 STARSThis review comes long overdue but hey, it's better late than never, right?The entourage and I came in one rainy monsoon night to tuck into some delicious noodles.  I've been hearing about this place for a while --- about how their noodles are all hand-stretched and made with love.  I wanted to experience that for myself!  Walking to the restaurant was like walking into your typical cha chaan teng.  Service is speedy and not very personal and they do seem to treat people who speak Chinese a lot better from what I've observed.  Lucky me for being the table's representative, right? After ordering an assorted marinated meat combination plate with pig ears and other succulent pieces of cold-served meats, we all got our noodle dishes.  Honestly, I wasn't too wowed by my dish.  I had ordered something that they assured me was similar to dandan noodles, what I was really craving for on this rainy night but it didn't really taste like it.  I think it was more like zha jiang mian.  Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but it just took me by surprise. Anyways, this is a pretty solid place and it definitely makes you feel like you're eating in Chinatown, San Francisco or something.  Place gets packed around dinner time so unless you want to rub some elbows with strangers, come for a late lunch or early dinner!This place is kinda no-frills, but it deserves five stars because it is a tremendous value and a rare treat. I mean, it's all about the hand-pulled noodles, which makes any other pre-made pasta develop a severe inferiority complex. Enough anthropomorphizing the noodles though... the window into the kitchen to watch the noodles being made is such a cool feature! The dude I saw working the impossible noodle slinging had really impressive forearms... I'm sure he earned them from years and years of pasta wrangling.This is the kind of under-celebrated hidden spot that is worth showing off... and picking up the tab will not hurt you dearly. I blew my roommate's mind by trotting this one out, although I had only been once a couple of years prior. What reminded me about this place was another friend raving about the potstickers. The pan-fried dumplings are huge... and essentially pure meat inside. The only "filler" is a smidge of green onion. Share these as an appetizer and then pound your delicious entrée (I had #22 - noodles and minced pork). And then the Oompah-Loompahs can roll you out the door afterward, because my friend, you will be stuffed blissfully full with noodle goodness!Do yourself a favor and pool your couch change. Then come down here to see the Asian Popeye whip your noodles from fresh dough. Get the fried dumplings as big as your fist! Stuff an ungodly pile of steaming pasta down yer gullet! But you might want to wear a bib, if you're hesitant to cut your luxuriously long noodles. The need to slurp them up is very strong indeed... and you know it's just that good when you soil your shirt.My Dearest China Magic Noodle House, I have lived barely a mile away from you the past three years and have never given you the time of day.How wrong was I to neglect your heavenly cuisine and ambiance (suspect olfactory assault included) that brings me right back to the Bay! Dude and I dropped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Based on many of our friends' Yelp reviews, we knew going in that we were going try the XO Spicy Beef Noodles ($8.25) and the Pan Fried Dumplings ($4.95). Oh, those dumplings. Not your typical Chinese restaurant freezer dumplings; these babies are on 'roids! There's eight to an order and they're practically a meal on their own. We were pleased to find these weren't overcooked or greasy, a common mistake. My only complaint is I wish there were more vegetables. As for the noodles, you can pick the width (really thin, really wide,  somewhere in between, insert your dirty jokes here). We went with the standard C noodles. While they were fresh and delicious, the beef was just OK. I also wish the XO delivered a little more heat as promised, but nothing a little chili oil can't fix. Next time, I'll ask for them extra spicy! Can we also talk about the portion sizes here? Between a heaping plate of noodles and behemoth dumplings, we were able to take home leftovers that heated up perfectly the next day for lunch. Prices are similar to what those corporate Asian food establishments charge, but it's obviously so much better. Sit by the window and you're in for a real show. So much fun to watch all the noodles being hand stretched! Already plotting another trip to this little slice of home on Dobson and Warner to work my way through that extensive menu. Yay, I'm a fan indeed!

It was 8:30 in the evening, we are driving to Phoenix from San Diego and we are worried we are not going to find a place open for dinner.  I consulted Yelp and found that India Garden was in between where we were and my sister's house.We arrived on NYE's eve and were promptly greeted.  The restaurant is large and only had two or three tables.  A buffet was ready to go but we decided we wanted to order from the menu.The Lamb Vindaloo (44) was very good as was the Naan bread.  However, two dishes really stood out.  First, the Bhindi Masala (85) Okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices.  Wow.  Really fresh and great flavor.  Next, we ordered the Chicken Achari (40) Chicken cooked in "exotic Indian pickle masala".  This was the surprise of the evening as the pickle flavor mixed well with the chicken and masala to make a very fresh and pleasant tasting dish.Finally, the service was spectacular.  At least three different people constantly (but not in a bad way) checked on us to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed.  Reasonable prices for bottles of wine that matched very well with the food makes for an experience that is as good as it gets.Thank you.

I'm giving this a reluctant 4 stars.i am a fan of JJ's. Every location that I have ever been to has served up quality sandwiches....and everyone who knows me, knows that I love a good sandwich.This spot is no different. Great bread, meat and vegetables. Fresh, tasty and delightful. The motto for the chain is "Freaky Fast". Usually, when I make my purchase, my sandwich is ready by the time I put the lid on my cup. This time around, I waited for several minutes. There were no customers ahead of me. No new employees learning how to make sandwiches. Just very slow-paced employees.I'm not upset or angry. It's just not the "freaky fast" service that the other locations have provided. Not to worry. If I am in the area and want a sandwich, I will still come in.JJ, you rock my world.As I have mentioned in several reviews before, I have my own ATOS (Amber Terms of Service) in which my #1 rule is to never review a place that you have only been to once unless you know for certain you will not be back.As I sit here eating this giant pickle, I find myself IN a pickle... because while this is the first time I have eaten at Jimmy John's, they DID deliver free samples to the office yesterday... so is that technically 1+???Well, even if its not, I don't care. I am impressed beyond words at their incredible ability to serve their business clientele... Let me explain. Yesterday, out of nowhere, a nice delivery boy from JJ just drops by 10 or 12 mini subs for the office to sample. Super nice. Great marketing tool. Everyone was happy as a clam. Who doesn't love free food?So, today, I felt like it would be a good idea to return the favor and give them our business. We had 12 people order subs, and the entire ordering process was incredibly easy. You can order online, or call in the order. When everything was delivered, each sub had the correct name, they itemized the receipt by our names so that each person could have the correct amount deducted from their paycheck, and everything was 100% correct. No mixups. Aside from the incredible convenience of their ordering, their friendliness, and the awesome delivery, the subs were incredible tasting and at a fabulous price point. The bread (even though I'm not supposed to eat it - whoopppps) was fresh and delicious, the veggies were all fresh and piled on, and my pickle was huge and incredibly satisfying. (get your mind out of the gutter)You can choose 7 grain bread or a french roll, or for those who want the low-carb route, you can wrap your sub in lettuce! They have a great variety of subs, including two veggie options that can be made vegan, chips, pickles, drinks. Their website is really cool too - you can figure out the exact nutritional value of your entire meal, and the site is fun and easy to use. Anyway - incredible all around. I am very impressed and can't wait for our next group order!!

Review Text :
King's Kitchen fills many voids in the Charlotte area. First it's a meat & three, which has been long missing since Gus Sir Beef left Latta Arcade years ago.  Second it's a GOOD, upscale meat & three which is part of the Noble family of restaurants (one that even I will enjoy going to). Third it is the most wonderful concept: it is a nonprofit conceived by all proceeds are leveraged to donate to soup kitchens, and other food charities. Beyond that, they employ the otherwise unemployable (formerly incarcerated, rehabilitated, etc.) and are integrating a 40-week job training program to teach life skills. They also hand out box lunches to homeless. There isn't a place like this anywhere around, so I wanted to support this nonprofit even if the food wasn't good. Maybe their motto should be "Do Good, Eat Well" because lucky for me, it was delicious.They said they have the best pan fried chicken in town, so that's what I tried along with some of the best grits I've had in Charlotte (Anson Mill stoneground grits with some corn kernels), stewed squash and fried green beans. The squash was absolutely delicious, and the beans weren't really what I expected- I thought they might be battered and crispy, but they were possibly stewed and then fried so they were definitely more crispy than stewed, but not crispy crispy. My chicken's breast was very tender inside and I would definitely get that again.  I will refrain from commenting on my husband's pot roast since I never like fatty meat. He said it was tender. He accompanied the roast with mac 'n cheese (good but not plentiful enough), collard greens which were tasty and not too vinegary, and creamed corn which weren't too creamy. He was very pleased as well.  Other meats included fried flounder, grilled chicken breasts and Eegads! chicken livers!! We are in the South, Jules, get over it.  There were several other things to choose from as well as some sandwiches.  Desserts included a banana pudding with a torched meringue top from the pastry chef from Johnson & Wales, a brown sugar pound cake, chocolate pie, coconut chess pie and others.  Service was very friendly, but we got the sense some of the staff was underemployable. Since they've been open only a few days they're still in training mode, but was very encouraged about the friendliness.Right now they are only open for lunch M-F, but they hope to open for breakfast and eventually dinner as well and are going to play with opening for breakfast/lunch on weekends.  Their spot on Church & Trade has a great spot for outdoor seating but I would understand why they would opt to have it be weekdays only.  My office is right next door, so I will definitely be going again. Probably not every week because I would need to change my nickname to Fat Jules, but definitely every other week, perhaps only with a veggie plate!The King's Kitchen moto speaks volumes....  "Where you FEAST TO FEED SOMEBODY.  We're a not for profit restaurant serving up southern cuisine made with fresh, local ingredients from right here in our community. And the proceeds go back to the community, helping to feed those in need. So, come on in. Because when you dine, the whole community thrives." This is what we had on our first visit....Pimiento Cheese with House Crackers, Deviled Eggs, Grandma Bennon's Pot Roast (falling off the bone good!), Mac & Cheese, Butter Beans, & Coconut Chess Pie!  YES, I LOVE TO EAT!!!  :)NEED I SAY MORE???  Go support this great restaurant!  Chef Jim Noble (Noble's and Rooster's) is the mastermind behind it!Anyone who says it's tough to screw up fried chicken obviously hasn't made much of it....or eaten any "bad" fried chicken. Thank goodness the fine folks at King's Kitchen have that dish down pat! I have been waiting to head over to this nonprofit phenom for quite some time and finally got a chance to grab some dinner here. I'll put it out there right now - I love the concept of a nonprofit restaurant. I love the idea of feeding those who are without and putting people to work who are in transition. Now that that's clear, let's focus on the food & experience. The restaurant hosts clean lines, bright walls and nice lighting. Hubs and I chose to sit out on the patio and enjoy a late dinner. Our waiter, Stuart, was incredibly friendly and led us through the menu with ease. A few glasses of wine later, we were ready to order. As mentioned, I chose the fried chicken with roasted carrots and mac & cheese. The bird was perfectly crispy and super juicy - honestly, it rivals my grandmother's fried chicken and that's say a whole lot. The carrots had the perfect amount of sweetness and were by no means overcooked. And lastly, the mac and cheese was heart attack worthy and delightful. Price wise, I think $13 was a completely fair (and affordable) price for this plate of food. The portions aren't gargantuan, but they are plenty large for the price! We finished off the evening with strawberry shortcake - made with biscuits, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. While the treat was refreshing and tasty, the biscuits were a bit stiff and the portion was on the smaller side. Thus, I need to come back and try the coconut chess or chocolate pie. Oh woe is me. I'm looking forward to coming back for another royal dinner at King's Kitchen...if I were to grab lunch here I may fall into an afternoon food coma!Overall, good food, noble mission... It's a place that you feel good about eating a meal at :) I absolutely love the concept behind King's Kitchen. They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! I had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections.I have waited three years to write this review ladies and gentlemen. The King's Kitchen is just a remarkable place all around. From the relativley modern and simple yet solemn interior design to the wonderful group of people who make our visit such a delightful event. The location is also super convenient from all sides of Uptown - for those of you who aren't in Charlotte, that's our downtown. Today I had the salmon for dinner and it was just great. I love salmon in many different forms and enjoy various sorts of recipes. Unfortunately, as we all know, not all places do it good enough. The King's Kitchen was on point. Not too mushy and not too dry inside covered with seasoned and (most importantly) crispy outer layer for an excellent experience. I cannot end today's review without mentioning the mushrooms. Yes, they were perfect. Last but not least, the lady who brought extra pimento cheese for our baguette, you rock. The manager was super quick and smart too. Keep it up!There is a unique story behind this place which I will save for all of you readers to go find out for yourselves. You will like it just for that, and love it for the tuna sandwiches, the salmon, and their amazing desserts.

I used to grab money from my moms purse and then walk up the street and find ways to spend my money. There was a circle K, a hair salon, a video store complete with a beaded curtain section (of which my step brother was a fan. I know this bc I was a snoop), aaaaaand a donut shop. It as an oriental run donut shop and those always seemed to be the best in my experience of eating donuts while living in the bay. they had a mean maple bar. It wasn't overly sweet and had a perfect amount of saltiness and chewy-ness while remaining fluffy and moist. it was a great donut and what I consider a 'bay area style donut'  for no other reason except that i ate this kind of donut while i lived in the bay area. i didn't think anyone else made donuts like this.until I arrived at Bosa. it's run by orientals which is a good sign when it comes to donuts so I tried a maple bar. oh my gosh! the donut brought back all of those memories of tattling on my step brother when I found his naughty movies and regretting my choice to get a perm at the hair salon once while bored. this is a bay area style donut! it's not krispy kreme(which is also a delicious donut) and it's not dunkin (which isn't a delicious donut) it's a different donut class of its own.if you like them chewy and fluffy while a tad sweet and salty go here for your donut pleasure!I blame Bosa for resurfacing my donut obsession. I thought all donuts tasted the same. I thought they all tasted fluffy, sugary and heavenly, but the same. I have been a lover of the donut since my early childhood when my Dad would surprise me with a stop at our favorite donut store during a round of errands. The owner also happened to know my Dad so my one donut turned into a full bag of donuts and I felt as if I had just won the jackpot (even though my Dad still only let me pick one out to actually eat at that moment). But now let me fast forward many, many moons and I'll actually begin my review of Bosa. Bosa does not sell your ordinary donut. Well, actually they do sell some of the classics but the difference with Bosa is that they make their donuts truly holey (pun intended). Whatever they do to them makes the donut victim enter a world of pure oblivion as an sugar high hits instantly upon first delicious bite. So you go to Bosa for the first time, you walk into a very sparse shop that was definitely once a fast food restaurant and you see a counter of donuts staring at you. Like my Dad taught me all those years ago, sadly I can only have one, so what to do? The answer is easy, even for someone with major menu anxiety like myself: get the BUTTERMILK donut. Don't ask questions and just do it. Don't think to yourself..."that's way too big, I'll just get a donut hole." No. Order the buttermilk donut, have a serious talk with your will power, tell your will power to hold you back from eating the entire thing and get the buttermilk donut. Why? Because it will allow you to taste a donut you didn't know existed. It tastes like pure buttermilk immersed into a delicious fried sweet baked good. You'd think the bread inside would taste like normal donut bread, but it doesn't. It tastes like your eating donut bread infused with buttermilk cream and yet it's just the donut being that fluffy and moist. Now thanks to this donut, I will have to avoid driving on McDowell until I allow myself to have a donut again because I know that if I pass by Bosa (that has a DRIVE THROUGH by the way), there is no way I'll be able to drive by without stopping inside to say hello to my favorite donut.I am glad I do not live close to this donut shop.  With the 24 hour drive thru, excellent selection of donuts, boba drinks, and even shaved ice available all day it is a diet killer.I stopped by late, about 10pm  and they still had a large selection of donuts, I picked up a dozen to "sample" the flavors.  I enjoyed the old fashioned, Boston creme, chocolate filled, raspberry filled, and some classic sugar laden regular donuts.  Delicious and I was on a sugar high.To add to my sugar high I added a boba Thai coffee large.  Pretty of boba to enjoy my long drive back to the west valley.  I really enjoyed the coffee and it is a rare treat by my home.  I am still craving another excuse to drive here and get another.I also did sample some shaved ice in the unconventional rainbow fashion. The staff was not use to serving a rainbow shaved ice, but were very accommodating.  He noted they usually only do one flavor, but attempted a 4 flavor ice sample.  It is still great to have shaved ice at 10pm when its 50 degrees outside right?I also noted breakfast croissants and other breakfast treats, bagels and creme cheese, etc.  I could not really concentrate on that part of the menu, the donuts in the glass cases are mesmerizing.  I imagined sampling them all while I reduced my selection to only 12 donuts.  I can say that the 12 donuts did not last a day on the kitchen island and the donut box is now a empty box of memories.  I hope to visit Bosa again and enjoy another dozen and maybe sample some other items they provide.  I hope you have the opportunity to sample Bosa donuts as well.So, my childhood donut shop is still safe atop the donut throne.   I would never cheat on my favorite donut shop (except with Krispy Kreme a few times).  But I was drawn here after having their buttermilk donut.  I finally brought myself to stop in this donut shop after having had a Buttermilk Bosa donut a few months ago at work. What an amazingly good donut, when it is fresh.  I've had that donut 3 times and the first 2 times I had it, the donut was simply AMAZING.  Something that tastes that good scares me.  I was afraid I would be drawn to this place over and over for that donut.So, on a weak day, when I just wanted something sweet.... NOW.  I pulled into this shop at about 4 in the afternoon.  I see the yummy "specialty donut" in the display and quickly order it.  I get in my car and I don't immediately pull off as I whip out that donut to break off the first piece.  I take a bite and I'm suddenly shocked.... disappointed.  It was STALE.  I wondered how long that donut had been in the display.  It wasn't very good.  i have resolved to never return -- a lie!  I should stop lying to myself.   Nothing that good could possibly, truly be that good. Someone at work brought 3 dz of these donuts this week.  I resisted.  I resisted.  but I'm sure.. in that weak moment, I'm returning for that buttermilk yummy goodness.  But I've learned my lesson, I'm going first thing in the morning... I want a fresh one.Yumms!

This is the only place inside Crystals at City Center that I can afford to indulge in. We took a break from window shopping (the only thing you can really do at the stores here), and had a really nice lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria. The ultra modern restaurant is open and airy, located in the middle of the mall. While no one in our group of four ladies was particularly starving, we just got three things to share. I guess the motivation behind that was the skin tight size XS dress that was waiting to be worn a few hours later. So, we ordered the fried calamari appetizer, one basil pesto grilled chicken panini and the calzone pizza which we had them make as an open faced flat pizza. They were kind enough to cut the panini into fours, and surprisingly, we still had leftover pizza! Loved the delicious panini, and the thin crust pizza was very tasty. The calamari was nicely fried and not oily at all.Service was top notch here. I'm really starting to notice the high level of hospitality in Vegas, which is pretty refreshing. Will definitely be back to do do some casual dining when I'm staying at Vdara. The bar area is also super swank with TVs projected onto a piece of glass. Nice job, Wolfie.We made a reservation for a party of 20, but when we arrived at the scheduled time, the staff was still "setting up our table" so we had to wait for nearly half an hour to be seated. As we got seated, we had to wait another who knows how long to get some service. Some people were getting impatient, so they went to gamble as we placed their orders in for them. As we all got our food after the others returned, they assumed their orders were still being prepared. 10-15 min later, we had to wave the server down to check on the orders as well as refill our glasses. He comes back to tell us that their orders were never placed and forgets to get us more water on top of that.The food was okay, but for the price we were paying for mediocre food, I wished their service was a bit more attentive. They also charged us a hefty cake cutting fee of $50. FIDDY! They didn't even cut the cake for us!Located at the CityCenter Crystals shopping complex, Cucina by Wolfgang Puck caters to your drinking and food needs.When I arrived, I wanted to cry.I had myVegas loyalty points I could have used up here...... :'(Got the white wine sangria. It turned out to be the best drink I had all vacation. It has fruit slices. It brings white wine and makes it sweet. Omg it tastes REALLY good and it still has the alcohol taste in there. I think it was during happy hour, so I got a dollar or two knocked off its price. I don't think I would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though.Friendly service and friendly bar service as well :D

The pupusas revueltas here are so freaking good. Like, so good that I don't order anything else. Grab two for under $5 and that's a meal. Try to have the patience to let them cool so you can consume them without burning your fingertips and tongue, but if you can't, I understand.Tiny restaurant is situated in a busy lot, but the cozy interior and friendly staff more than make up for any minor parking inconveniences. Prices are low, food is fresh. Fellow diners recommend the soups and grilled meats (specifically the steak/shrimp plates?), similar to other centro-Americo style spots.But the pupusas are the best thing here, and the revueltas are the best of them. A tiny bit greasy, but thick with filling and such great flavor. I'm tempted to go get some right now...

Marco's Pizza is amazing. If it were more affordable, I'd order pizza at Marco's more often. This is exactly why you should only order when you have a coupon or order on a Monday, when you can get a large 1-topping pizza with delicious cheesy bread for $13.99 (online offer). Yup, I pretty much bide my time like an evil genius until a glorious coupon opportunity arises. The pizza here is irresistibly cheesy and the ingredients are fresh. You can pick a crust topper flavor for free. I usually go with garlic parmesan. The cheesy bread is the bomb diggity! Love it! The cheesy bread is the size of a small pizza, seriously. One (or maybe two) sauces are included with the bread. I'd recommend the marinara or garlic sauce.  I usually order carry-out from here. Customer service is great. They have four locations in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try!YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #145

Restaurant name  Argentos Pizza

Review Text :
I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about- I'm wondering if that review wasn't written under a bogus ID that is a front for a competitor of Argentos. The fact that he reviewed three pizza places in one day, and then reviewed two others on the same day 34 days later seems fishy to me- who orders pizza from two or three places in the same day or even the same week? Anyway,  Believe me, if you've read my review of Landini's Pizza in San Diego, then you understand that "I know from pizza" as the saying goes in  NY.  Pizza is one of the trinity foods of the greater NYC area, the other two being bagels and authentic deli.  All three are frequently imitated but seldom duplicated accurately outside of a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.I moved to AZ for a variety of reasons, and specifically to Buckeye in order to be in proximity to family plus for a great deal on a house.  Why else would I subject myself to the hinterlands of Maricopa County, the epicenter of AZ?  Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that in a sleepy town best known for farms and rodeo (as well as the only way to LA prior to the completion of I-10) a pizza man from NYC would decide to relocate his family and business. The owner, who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian (a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy) cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs, dinners, and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years.  There are no conveyor belt ovens, no round pizza grates or pans, just pumice lined pizza ovens fired up over five hundred degrees. Relatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza, a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best. Not only could I recommend Argentos, but I encouraged them to order.  The Jerseyites were not disappointed, and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious.What better validation could a pizza shop get?

Restaurant name  Kazu

Review Text :
I had been looking forward to trying out Kazu after reading a positive review in Montreal Mirror last week, but unfortunately they were closed for renovations the first time I popped by. Thankfully they're back in business and it was definitely worth the second trip out.Upon entering the restaurant my friend and I were greeted with a friendly round of "irasshaimase", which means welcome in Japanese (and is something you will hear every time you enter a restaurant or store in Japan). Off to a good start!I already knew I wanted to try the salmon and tuna bowl based on reviews I'd read and my friend settled on a bowl of ramen (I believe this is only on the lunch menu). The salmon and tuna bowl was delicious and I'm pretty sure this will be my standby meal at Kazu, because yes, I will be returning. It was composed of rice, a good sized serving of tuna and salmon sashimi, and salad all topped with a sesame dressing and some crunchy noodles. My friend enjoyed her ramen and we both agreed that the broth wasn't too salty at all. All in all, with the traditional decor, friendly staff and tasty food I'm sure this is a restaurant I'll return to again and again, which is encouraged by the owner who will shout out "see you tomorrow!" as you leave.NB: They only accept cash.Update: I've been here twice now and there was a lineup the last time I went, around dinner time. It's a pretty tiny restaurant so it fills up quick, and you may end up seated at the bar. But despite the extra heat from the open kitchen, I like being able to see all the food prep. Just be prepared to wait a bit to get in, looks like word's gotten out!Just go there. Order some sake. Order any appetizer. Order the Tuna Bowl. Order the ice cream (I prefer sake or matcha flavour). Have one of life's culinary fantasies fulfilled.I'm not kidding. This place is amazing. Sure. you'll wait over an hour to get in because they don't take reservations. Sure, you will be squished while you eat, but it won't matter because everything is so delicious, the staff is so friendly, and you are in one of the most fun places in town.Seriously.So delicious and fresh and friendly, the reviews here say it all, this is a really special place. Come early or do take out if you're not into lines. We did a take out picnic from Kazu the other day in the sculpture garden at the Canadian Centre for Architecture which is just down the street, and the incredible food combined with the illuminated art across the skyline on a warm summer night made me awful thankful to be alive. Ribs! Tuna and Salmon skin bowl! Starlight! Beers in a park! Hey thanks, universe!So many reviews for this place. Why do we need another one? Good question...... I asked myself the same question when they announced another Star Wars movie. Anyways, after 2 failed attempts to get in Kazu (Due to long lineups) I decided to give it another try. And boy I'm glad I did. One of the best Izakaya's in the city. You have to wait in line until everyone from your group arrives. Its a tiny place cramped with tables and bar stools. The service is great. They churn out dishes really fast. We ordered the 48 hour pork (Buta-Don), Beef bibimbap, shrimp burger & the tuna belly.  The Buta-Don is stewed tender pork sliced with onions on rice. The Bibimbap was awesome. Perfectly cooked tasty beef with homemade pickles & eggs sunny side up. The shrimp burgers were good. The spicy mayo adds the zing. The Tuna belly is ginormous. Enough for two people.  The fish here is really fresh and yummy too. All the dishes are  full of flavor. The only thing that bothered me is that they don't serve Ramen for dinner. But all in all a great place. Definitely worth waiting in line for this food.Food -  Awesome Service - Friendly  Ambiance - Casual / CozyWorth the money - YesIf this is the best Japanese yakitori of Montreal or Eastern Canada... has some low standards for Japanese food. Granted, I did not have high expectations coming in. I came in hungry, tired, & wanting some food. Also came in with the understanding that it wont be nyc level or la or even chicago.  got to experience kazu from the bar.The good: -Food comes out fast. Less than five minute wait from ordering. -Nice enough workers. The bad: -Long lines in cold, rainy weather.-Sat at the bar and found that NO food was really grilled or made on the spot. In fact, all of the food was premade and essentially assembled (hence fast turnaround time from your order). The shrimp burger was a premade patty heated on the grill but it didn't sizzle sizzle like all burgers should!! And the pork for their ramen was precooked and heated under the stove.... Pretty disappointing that they don't even sear it at any point. -The 48 hour pork was essentially pork over rice. It was much like the food at Yoshinoya (Japanese fast food) but definitely underwhelming and not that warm. -Salmon and Tuna bowl was more rice than anything with small bite-size pieces of salmon and tuna. It was not bad but it fell short of anything standout.All in all, having any sort of Asian cuisine is a break from the heavy (albeit delicious) food of Montreal. Would I come back? And have to wait?? Not really. This place is packed and does well on its own so people must not be too demanding. However, I will just bring a nice shin ramen cup and be sated the next time I am i. the city hankering for something Asian.Visited on a Monday night with a crowd of 10 people waiting in line outside at around 8:30 p.m. The small restaurant with open air kitchen seats 8 at the bar and another 8 to 10 at the few tables. They give you menus outside while you're waiting in line. The food was unbelievable! Really enjoyed the octopus leg,  eggplant dip, shrimp pancake the beef plate. This deserves being my first 5 star rating.Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!

I would love to be able to review the food / drinks for this 'Hot' Spot, however I can't! I called around 1pm on a Friday to reserve a table that night for a friend's birthday celebration. I reserved a table for 10 people at 10pm; and told the host that answered the phone I would call back around 8:30 to let them know if the number of guests would be significantly less than 10 (he had said it is hard to hold a spot for 10 people that late... I thought I was being helpful by offering to do so...)I called that night around 8:50pm (20 minutes late, I know....) to let them know it would only be 8 people, not 10. I was told by a different hostess that answered the phone that my reservation was at 8:30, and I had missed it. I explained to the hostess there must be a mistake, and that my reservation was at 10pm, not 8:30. She said that NO, my reservation was at 8:30, and the table was gone, and there really wasn't anything that I could do. I asked to speak to a manager, as now we would be scrambling to find a new spot, should the reservation not go through. (**Note, you do not need a table to go to Primebar, however it was the birthday girl wanted, so I wanted to make that happen.)The manager, Sean, got on the phone, and told me that I had missed my reservation, and that they had called me two times to see if we'd be coming, but I never answered. Now, seeing as that my phone hadn't rung at all that night, I asked Sean if he had me confused with someone else. (Hey, mix-ups happen!)Sean then told me that he is sure they had called me, yet wouldn't confirm the number dialed, and continued to speak over me and not answer my questions about if there was anything we could do to get a table set aside for us. Due to his 'jerkiness' I said he was being a real Jacka$$, as I was trying bring him business. He then got REALLY mad, and said "Listen, Deary, this is how this is going to work" and "This is what we are going to do" and other ridiculous comments (during this time, I wasn't getting a word in edgewise, he just kept repeating how I messed up and that we couldn't have a table, etc etc). It was really shocking how nasty and vile his attitude was. He wasn't interested in all in problem solving, but rather a power-trip and scolding me was all he focused on.I then was forwarded to speak to his General Manager, Matt, who was nicer, but didn't apologize for the mix-up or for Sean's ridiculous behavior. He offered to buy a round of drinks for us, should we go there at a later date.. but I politely declined. I am shocked and appalled at what Primebar considers to be 'customer service'. To the management's credit, I did speak to the Marketing Director of the Scottsdale Quarter today, and she was very nice and apologetic; however she doesn't run the day-to-day operations of Primebar. Based on the other reviews it looks like the food is pretty good - but I can say that the management team they have in there is horrible... which can't bode well for the rest of the staff.

So I've ordered from here a few times and I must say i have never been disappointed with any of the items Ive tried from here.Ive tried several different items from there huge menu the funny part is Ive never tried there pizza but here are a few items I have tried...The 1st thing I ever was the Fettuccine Alfredo it was generous portions of saucy creamy goodness I was surprised at how tasty it was being that most pizza places don't have the best tasting pastas.Next time I ordered from here I tried the wings i got half Garlic Parmesan and half Hot wings bone in and they were very tasty and delicious, not to mention I must say they have the best ranch dressing Ive ever had in my life so i really enjoyed dipping these tasty critters into there wonderful ranch dressing. next time i tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which was very yummy how can you go wrong with a good quality chicken patty hot sauce and mayo hmm hmm good.Last but probably my favorite item Ive tried at this place was their Philly Cheese steak OMG juicy, flavorful, cheesy goodness this by far is one of the best cheese steaks Ive ever had I could of sucked down 2 of these tasty things my mouth is watering just writing about it. This is definitely a must try if you go to this place.I absolutely love this place Ive never found a place where everything Ive tried on the menu is truly delicious and i must say they are reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when I order from here I do delivery and it takes about an hour for me to get my food, other then that there is no going wrong with Angelina's.Ordered from here for lunch today at work form Eat24, and our reviews were kind of mixed about the whole experience.I got a Chicken Ceaser Wrap with Cross Cut Fries, And my co-workers ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger with Fries and a "Build-Your-Own Calzone." We all got an order of Garlic Balls to share.The food got here on time, and thats where the experience started to go down hill for me...My Chicken Caeser Wrap was hot...? I don't know who in the world though hot lettuce and caeser dressing would be a good idea but they were terribly terribly wrong. I can feel my gag reflex creeping up on me just reliving the experience on here.The burger was decent, and so was the Calzone. The only bad thing about the Calzone is it came out to $20.00!! That Calzone better have been made out of Truffle Oil and Gold!The Garlic KNots were definitely the best thing we ordered but looking at all the grease/oil/butter? At the bottom of the container they came in instantly made me sick to my stomach. I felt my face trying to break out mid bite and I had to put the Garlic Knot down!I can honestly say that I will probably not be ordering here in the future unfortuantly.

Review Text :
As the Camelback Corridor Burger Wars escalate it is becoming more and more difficult to stand out from the pack.  Grind makes a great claim for originality by putting water cress, candied jalapenos, and ratatouille on one of their burgers.  Is this originality a good fit (think Mick Jagger) or is it just weird? (think Lady Gaga) I'm not sure.  I liked my burger although I don't think that the water cress added much other than being a new garnish to flout.  The sweet potato fritters were decent, but not enough to make me want them over their cousins, the sweet potato fry.Good vibe and probably a good place to catch sports....especially if you are into following five games simultaneously.3.5 - but I'm rounding up because I obviously liked it since I tried to subscribe to their text message specials distro advertised on the receipt while still at the table! Alas, either the instructions on the receipt are incorrect or the marketing strategy has been discontinued -- my attempt was unsuccessful. Maybe the email version on their website will work. :) Here are some highlights: * $5 wine at happy hour which runs until 6 p.m. * The rosemary roasted cheese with strawberry relish & croutons - relying on the menu description what type of cheese is a mystery. It's brie. Standard brie. But it's roasted in the coal fired oven resulting in a smoky black char on the rind. And, the "croutons" are thinly sliced, crisp bread toasts. I felt like the rosemary flavor really transferred onto the cheese and preferred it without the strawberry relish which was very sweet and citrusy (lots of orange rind). * I had the crisp pork sandwich, which I'm assuming is not hormone free or organic because the menu only proclaims "hormone free and organic beef & chicken"; still, it was quite tasty. A thick slab of pork marinated and roasted in such a way that it easily pulled apart. BBQ sauce was decent, not spectacular and someone in the kitchen forgot my "house pickle" so I'm not sure if it would ordinarily be served on top or on the side. (When I pointed it out to the waitress, she brought me a plate with several pickle sliced - whatdaya know... tasted just like a homemade pickle!) Had a side of the scalloped potatoes which were awfully black peppery and not too creamy. And finished with the donuts and salted butterscotch. The salt part was missing. Perhaps a more obvious use of fleur de sel as a garnish or something would give it that missing magic touch. Overall, I was full. It was yummy. I would go back. P.S. - There may have been salt in something, though, because I woke up in the middle of the night PARCHED! I can't say for sure it was a result of that evening's meal because my food didn't taste "salty" but I'll keep an eye on it and see if it happens next time. And, there WILL be a next time...!The Grind isn't so much a grind as a pretty nice looking bar with solid burgers.  They are huge-I shared one with my wife.  We also had onion rings which are tempura battered.  It was a nice, light batter but they were a little underdone.If Yelp had the old half star I would have rated The Grind 3.5 stars.I like the decor here, especially the appearance of the front from the inside/outside.  Also upside but not downside.  I'm looking for more upside than downside in general...I like to think of myself as a very fair-minded person...almost the embodiment of the word...not "person", "fair"!I am like a living "Spirit of Justice"...right down to the blindfold, the scales and the toga (exposing  one manly boob).No one is going to put the peek-a-boo brassiere of prejudice on me (like the Bushies tried to do to the actual Spirit of justice a few years ago)...no siree!So it was with love for all burgers and objectivity in my heart that I rolled in to The Grind on a couple of warm afternoons, not so very long ago.And I just wasn't very impressed...the burger wasn't bad by any means...but it wasn't great either...esp. at the price point...unfortunately.I expected more!* More burger choices...only three choices on the menu...it's called The Grind...do they only "grind" enough beef for three burger choices? Maybe they will cobble up something else, if you want, but frankly...I'm paying for them to figure the menu out and prepare the food for me...if I want to figure it out myself, I'll stay home and make my own.* More flavor...I've tried the place twice, burgers both times and the peppercorn burger and the Sweet and Starchy burger (I may have that wrong)...both were...what's the word I'm groping for here...adequate...completely...adequate. I kind of expect a place like this to knock my socks off (if, of course, I were to ever wear socks), but it just doesn't.* More for my money...it's $16 - $17 for a burger and beverage, by the time I tip...I'm not complaining about the price...I'm complaining about what I get for the price!* More better service...OK, I know...bad grammar...I should say "better more" service...the joint wasn't exactly jumpin' either time I dropped in and yet getting a beverage and lunch took a long time...a really long time...a 90 minute long time one of the times I was there...How long does it take to undercook a burger on a super duper unique and special "One Million Degree" grill? The burgers should have vaporized in the time it took to get them to the table!But in fairness to the Grind (always the hallmark of my little Yelp stories), I made sure that I re-tried some of my other favorite burgers...you know...WCG, FEZ, Daily Dose, Modern Burger, Davids, Zinburger, Lucky Boy, even In-n-Out!OK, you caught me...it was really more of an excuse to go on a burger binge...I do love them so!At any rate, all of them still measure up quite nicely...and all of them make better burgers than The Grind!The Grind is certainly nowhere near the bottom of the barrel...the décor is very nice on the inside (although the little old mall at 40th and Camelback is where restaurants go to die...not pleasant from the outside).The wait staff seem nice enough whenever you get a chance to see them and interact with them (which isn't that often during the course of a lunch, as it turns out)...I don't know if it's a kitchen issue or that the wait staff is "slower than ass end of hard times" (a saying from the depression era...no, the other depression era...although it certainly seems apropos enough these days).res ipsa loquitur...So, as I stand in judgment...the very physical embodiment of the Spirit of Justice...my judgment is that The Grind is a 2.75 star experience, and as everyone knows, Justice is blind, favors no one (except the wealthy) and never rounds up...so 2 stars it is.Holy mother of huge burgers! This weekend, I entered the dark and mysterious restaurant hidden on 40th and Camelback. I immediately noticed staff walking to tables with burgers so popular, they deserved their own plate. I sat down, opened the menu and let my burger adventure begin. Thanks to the Yelp iPhone app, I browsed the quick tips and reviews. Spicy burger with jalapenos, a peppercorn burger, sweet potato fritters... so much to choose from! But, the spicy factor scared me just a little so I went with the Peppercorn burger. Out comes this massive burger that looked like it was nearly half a foot high. It was dripping with a sauce equipped with a kick, watercress, charred onions and matchstick fries. I'm pretty sure it had a mind of it's own and was too huge to mess with! But, I didn't let it scare me and dug right in. I pushed myself to eat as much as possible but there was no way I could finish it. I did get pretty far though. The burger was decent -- not the best I've ever had but not the worst either. I asked for cheddar cheese and my friend asked for blue cheese but sadly, they switched the orders and there's a big taste bud difference between cheddar and blue cheese! The service was quick, the staff friendly and the drink refills plentiful. Not a huge fan of the sweet potato fritters. I couldn't tell if they had any flavor or not because the burger taste was pretty overwhelming, so if you are looking for some tasty fries to go with your burger, the sweet potato fries aren't it. So that's concludes my burger adventure. I left full and beef satisfied.You know that Groucho Marx quote: "I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member."Well here's my version: "I wouldn't want to dine in any establishment that would have a fucking GINORMOUS photograph of Sheriff Joe Arpio taking up half of the wall as though his presence there is a good thing."The only thing that could have made me more uneasy would have been if they superimposed good ol' Joe onto a giant 'last supper' painting, stuck tooth pics in my eyes and forced me to recite the ten commandments while force feeding myself mediocre sweet potato fritters and a ridiculous burger the size of my head, man vs. food style. The burger itself was......good. Not fantastic, just good. The sweet potato fritters were a joke. When something is that boring and uninspired it really needs to come with something like, oh...I dunno...25 dipping sauces. I'm sure I've seen deep fried boring remedied by flavored lard in the past. Get on the ball Grind. The service was okay. The whisky tango flavored waitstaff, all brunette with a similar 'look'  was interesting. Like if you took all of the servers at The Vig and secretly replaced them with Famous Sams waitresses; that kind of interesting. The beer and wine selection was clearly lacking and again, uninspired. I suppose the focus is supposed to be on the specialty drinks which actually seemed well thought out though none seemed to appeal to me in the moment. Also, if you're going to name one of your signature cocktails after a classic James Bond martini it should be made with the proper ingredients, or at least as close as possible. I think they sell Lillet Blanc at Total Wine, hell, the bf has some in his fridge, I'm sure he'll let you borrow it. All in all, an odd experience that kind of failed my expectations. In closing, I'll leave you with another Marx quote that kind of sums it all up: "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening. But this wasn't it."This is based on my first visit to The Grind. I am surprised at some of the low ratings because I had such a good experience. I met Chrissy P for an early dinner at The Grind one evening. I was struck by how narrow this place was. The booths were small and kind of uncomfortable in my opinion. We had arrived at the tail end of happy hour and our waitress was nice to put a couple of glasses of wine and bubbly in for us before the happy hour cutoff. We started with the baked cheese with strawberry relish. I thought it was very tasty. The saltiness of the cheese was really good with sweet relish. For my entree I chose the special of the day which was the tenderloin sandwich with cream cheese. It was SO YUMMY. The tenderloin was well cooked and tender and the schmear of cream cheese was fantastic. We got talked in to dessert. We chose the salted caramel w/mini donuts. That's where they fell short for me. I was wondering where the salt was in the salted caramel. I think if they topped the caramel with a little Fleur de sel, it would have been fantastic. I plan to visit The Grind again. I hope my good luck with the good food and service doesn't run out!Let me start by saying that I was a VERY good Yelper regarding the Grind. After my first visit, I thought it deserved 2 stars but waited it out to see if it was an acquired taste. After heading there to watch the BCS National Championship Game Monday Night (which, by the way, was possibly the most BORING game I'd ever had the displeasure of watching. The most interesting thing about that game was Oregon's footwear.), I now feel confident that the Grind falls squarely on "A-OK". You know how sometimes you get so used to associating one thing with another thing, you start to mentally associate them even if the second thing is missing? Like Affliction shirts and being a huge douchebag. You could be a very nice person. A gentleman and a scholar. But if you talk to me with a shirt that has holographic angel wings on the back, it will be absolutely impossible for me to get the thought of you being a huge douchebag out of my head long enough to give you a fair chance. Maybe that's me being judgmental, but I prefer to think of it as excellent time management. Who has time to get to know everyone?This is kind of how I felt about the burgers at the Grind the first time I visited. Their whole shtick is they grill them in a bajillion degree oven, which gives the patty a charred finish. I tend to associate this charred taste with "dry, overcooked burger", and it was hard to get over that association the first time I visited.  However, on my last visit I came to the conclusion that just because the outside has that interesting almost-burnt flavor, the inside is still actually quite juicy and delicious.  Not to mention, the toppings for this particular burger (I had the Sweet and Spicy both times) are spectacular. So, yes, even though it took two visits, I finally did acquire a taste for the Grind's burgers and now I can say I'm a fan.However, it bothers the shit out of me when restaurants serve $10 burgers that don't come with a side of fries. Considering that potatoes are like the cheapest thing on the planet and french fries are possibly one of the most delicious food groups to ever exist, this should be standard practice. We did order a side of fries (a la cart), and they were good (not as crispy as I would have liked, but fair), but come on, nothing on the side of a $10 burger? At least Fez gives you a salad. I would have probably given the Grind 4 stars if it wasn't for this, but this review only comes with 3. The other one is a la cart, on the second page of the menu.Cool name + Cool Sports Bar + Cool burger + OBSCURE Location = 3.5 StarsHaving them bookmarked for awhile now, I decided it was time.  I had asked the bartender what was the most frequently ordered burger on the menu.  Without hesitation, I got a response of: the Sweet and Spicy.My bubble thoughts went to work: "Sweet + Beef = Potentially Disastrous"So, I probed the bartender on her take of the taste and assured me that the sweetness was going to be A-okay! Alas, I went for it!For sides I went with regular fries plus a cold, refreshing ice tea.  As time elapsed, the moment of truth arrived, the burger that made them famous on Bon Appetit Magazine.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=y2GXX-6hg6cZ67E5lbLIcABefore taking down this delicious work of art, I couldn't help but to admire the contrasting layers that was well put together.  Snap, snap, I tried to capture the best angle:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=aGGO64eLJtYt4ch4TVTnRABack to business, first bite into the burger, I was sold.  My worries of sweetness went away.  In fact, it was kind of faint but still bold enough to call it Sweet.  The Spicy aka Candied Jalapenos was just as light and noticeable.  If I was to order this again, I probably would prefer a little bit more heat! The other two ingredients that worked superbly well were the tempura fried ratatouille and fresh, green watercress!  The buns also played a critical role in its overall taste.  It was lightly buttered, toasted and slightly burnt to give it texture and that smoky taste.The only negative that stood out was in the patty.  While parts of it was semi-moist with some pink, the outer layer was evidently dry.  And actually, the fries was a bust, it was just too crispy and anti-fluffy.  No love on that.  Hence, a deduction of .5 stars!If there's one gourmet burger that I could have a craving for, it would have to be this Sweet and Spicy.  The bar has a stylish, contemporary finish to draw the sporty, trendy crowds with plenty of alcoholic options on tap.  The setup is well designed as patrons sitting in both the bar and booths can enjoy watching content on all the LCDs.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=vhZuCNn94Cmq_PzpOvle7wAll their burgers run $10-11 exception of the Kobe which will cost you a little arm and leg of $17.  I love Kobe meat, so I may be tempted the next time.Happy Hour runs M-F, 4-6PM.The Grind is a strong contender in the burger wars. I had to try the Sweet and Spicy burger after hearing about the candied jalapeños, and it was so good I ordered it during a return visit. My only problem with the burger is that it is, in the words of Tiny Elvis, "huge". In order to feel halfway human after eating here, I really ought to split one with my dining partner. That will leave room for their incredible buffalo wings, which I've noticed have escaped mention in most Yelpers' reviews.Simply put, the wings here are exceptional. Although they only offer one flavor of hot wing, their take on the classic buffalo wing is a keeper. The sauce is bright and tangy (and I recommend ordering some of the wing sauce on the side as it would even make a flip-flop dipped in it taste AWESOME). What really completes the wings here is the char. I guess that bajillion-degree-oven really adds the finishing touch, as the burnt and smoky flavor that comes through is pure wing bliss.So I recommend if you go to The Grind, do try the burgers. But split the behemoth and save room for the wings. That way you won't need the Oompah-Loompahs to roll your bloated ass back to your car and you will have a dining experience to remember (and to salivate about, in retrospect).The Grind has grown into a nice little neighborhood bar.  Often, the wife and I will walk over there for a burger, fries and a tasty microbrew.  It's never too crowded, service is great and the food is pretty darn good.  They've expanded the menu over the years and perhaps next time I will try the wings.

After walking in, I wanted to be able to give more than 3 stars, I really did - it's a cute, clean but TINY place that completely belies the strip mall location.The good: My fresh berry crepes were wonderful!  Two crepes, stuffed full and topped with a night light crème fraîche - and the berries truly were fresh - delectable!  My wife enjoyed the pancakes, though they were not especially notable beyond that - good size, and done as expected.The cramped: I did mention this place was tiny, right?  Yeah, we were squeezed in to a table next to a hutch that had the silent radio and cookbooks and a little display.  The radio was turned on a little after we got there, which did warm up the place a bit, but couldn't cover that we were literally twisting to stay in our seats and not bump our neighbors while eating.  It will likely get better if they can get a couple tables outside as the temps drop, but for now, I'll skip if there's not elbow room.The place does have some charm, and I'll be back to see how it matures, and to try the eponymous dish.

Review Text :
Quite a while back I found out Pomegranate Cafe was coming to Ahwatukee and I was pretty stoked being that there really isn't much in the way of vegetarian fare around here. I joined the mailing list and anxiously anticipated their opening.Well, I never got any kind of notification that they opened, which seems weird, but whatevs. I ended up stumbling across PC on the way to Star of India for lunch the other day and I was stoked! Finally! I popped in asking for a to-go menu.. but they didn't have one. Oh, okay, well.. is your menu online? "nope, everything is seasonal so we don't update." hmmmm.... Okay, maybe I'll check back after lunch.So we pop back in to grab a coffee after some Indian grub. The menu looks good and they have vegan pastries. Right on. I'll go with the soy coconut latte and Dally G. went with some iced spicy chai tea thing. Well, we waited 12 minutes to get our drinks, even though there were only two other customers there, and what a disappointment. My latte was so bland and his tea was just... wrong.I wasn't pleased with the actual place (weird setup... and incredibly uninviting), neither of our drinks tasted good, the wait was excessive, and it was definitely up there cost wise.PC - I unfortunately think you are striking out. Hopefully there are enough self conscious soccer mom's in Ahwatukee to keep you going because I love the idea, it just falls flat.Sorry!This review is a two with a burning desire for five...I want this place to succeed like I want a million bucks. I have never operated a food-providing establishment but I suspect it's quite difficult. But I've consumed a lot of food and beverage. My recommendation to this sweet little Pomegranate Cafe is don't skimp on the ingredients. I haven't eaten there but I had a spicy chai. One of my favorite places in town is called Sens and they have a drink called the Hot and Dirty. This drink takes a sledge hammer and hits you in the chest. Then it spits on you and its friends are dragging him away because they hear cop sirens in the distance. I don't even know if I like the taste or not but the experience is so powerful it is literally "an experience" to drink it. The way you described your drink and the way it came to me was abortive. I mean that in a "trying to be helpful way." Sincerely. Punch me in the face with this supposed spicy cayenne. I know, you said it's a hint. But I'm a man. Subtly is dust in the wind. Be better. I'll be back. Please try this place. I want it to win. One final thing. Get new lids IMMEDIATELY. First sip soaked me and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt.I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!Had lunch here for the first time and was pleased to know that everything is organic and vegan unless you choose to add dairy or eggs to the meal. I ordered the Smokey Tempeh B.L. T. (see pics) First of all the portion was HUGE! Generous helping of Exotic Veggie Chips and a side salad along with a sprinkling of cherries Plus this Amazing Sandwich. I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!! Seriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds. My salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking. I'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home. 4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....Here's my take on the burger:The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a "traditional" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef.Unfortunately I have to do a review update that is not good for Pom Cafe. I really, really wanted to enjoy this place the second time around and give them another shot, but I'm totally disappointed.First off, they got my order wrong and only sent one sandwich instead of the two I ordered. They just combined the two together. It didn't even make sense.Second, when my receptionist got there, they left out two items and had to call her back to come pick them up. By the time she went back and got the food they forgot to give her, everything arrived back at the office cold and the bread was soggy. The side of "crispy tofu" we ordered was not crispy at all. Overall everyone at the office thought their food was okay, but not great...  probably because everything arrived cold and limp... and for an $8.50 egg mc-muffin sandwich, I'm certainly hoping for better than okay.  I don't plan on going back. :-(Hi everybody!This is a tough review for me because I shop at trader joes almost exclusively and my wife and I watched and waited for this restaurant to open. Granted it has been open for awhile it took us some time to get to it. I am not really sure it was open many times as we passed and were hungry. Finally we checked the menu and CHACHING!So we moved it to the top of the list for trying and we were excited to come. As we only eat out on shopping day. Maybe too much. As usual whenever we eat at any restaurant we asked our "vegan" questions. We were told that someone there was a vegan nazi and if it says vegan it is, and this is very good. I will say that i do trust that Pomegranate Cafe serves what they say they serve and the food was very high quality and very delicious. We shared the lentil burger ($12) that was on the menu board behind the counter. I really wanted to try the desserts but decided to wait till next time.Everything was going great and we waited patiently for our food. Granted it was busy so it took a little time and this also is ok. Here is where my problems begin. Bellieve me I do not want to give ANY business ANY time only 2 stars.  Trust me i just don't and i feel bad for doing so however, I did say on my profile that the reviews i do are very important to me. I am the kind of person who does not mince words and you will know where you stand with me. If i see something i do not like i will say so.  That being saidNow I will say that I have worked in the restaurant industry since i was 16. I have done every side job known to everyone who has set foot into a kitchen. (explained later) I have helped build business for many. Though I do not have any degrees or anything I have seen many meals being sent to customers in many differents ways, and styles. Some were good, some were bad, some were happy, some were mad. But they all ate and they either came back or they didn't. Currently I work in not one but two very popular digs. I work very hard to make sure my customers are happy, and i know how hard it is to work in a small family place. I worked at a local chinese restaurant for 6 years and barely got  a day off.Do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the food here. my issue is with one small thing or two. Why does a new business in the realm of Pomegranate (a higher class cafe which serves vegan food) charge a plate splitting fee which i believe was $2.00. Then give us our food on a paper plate. Please, this is ridiculous. We always split our food no matter where we go. It is pratically the only way you can stay healthy these days. Not to mention we believe that there was no more food for this charge. (for example: if there were more chips or pickles or fruit, then i do not have a problem with this fee. however I would say when asked to split. " OK, no problem, however there will be a $?.?? charge, and for that you will recieve ....) if i would have known this i would have gotten it to go and this review would be totally different. And in my humble opinion it is not a good idea to charge this fee in an uber difficult restaurant "genre".  Believe me there are lots of people like me who want food like this. Do not make it harder on yourself by adding on fees which really are not necessary! Are you not making enough money off of $0.25 worth of lentils?I also have to say that I had trouble choosing something to eat from the menu, because many things were scratched off. ???? Were they out of that item? I think the thing that bothered me about this was there were so many that i wanted to try but could not. I saw many that had promise, as I am a vegan nazi and i really was stoked to eat here. It is my kind of place almost to a t. Too bad that did not work out.Now for the side job part. While we waited for our food i noticed that this restaurants dining room was not very clean. the floor looked as if it had not been cleaned for a few days, the windows were very dirty, and the window sills were covered, and i mean covered in dust. Complete with cobwebs. From what i could tell the kitchen was clean. Here is how I see it. Please do not serve a $14.50 burger on a paper plate EVER! To me this says that the staff does not want to do dishes, If something is on your menu keep it there, when people find something they like they will come back no matter how much it costs if they know it will be there. Clean your dining room! it is uber, uber ,uber important that your customers see a clean dining room. it does not take that long and it will go very far impressing your customers, especially when you are first getting started. When a restaurant does not take the time to clean thier dining room they most likely are not cleaning thier kitchen as well. I hope this is not the case with Pomegranate because I really would like to try more food here. I only will know by stopping by again. Thank for reading. Late,GregWe were really happy with our first visit to Pomegranate.We went in for Sunday breakfast, and were very piqued by the menu and everything else this place has to offer. It's almost too much to take in at first--as you glance around, you see lots of interesting stuff that could take a while to explore. The unique menu aside, they have many types of tea and a great selection of coffee. The best part of the menu is that everything is fresh, and most things are configurable with different options depending on whether you're vegan.I got the breakfast burrito, which is available with egg or tofu. I got tofu and the vegan cheese. I had a little moment with the cashier when I ordered coffee with cream. See, I'm not a vegan but I was trying the whole vegan experience to see how everything tastes. As soon as I said I wanted cream in my coffee, I realized the paradox and my folly. He kindly offered me vegan options and I chose soy cream after putting his mind at ease and letting him know I was just a vegan poseur. My wife got the french toast.Hey, at least I don't claim to be vegan and go around sneaking bacon whenever it suits me.Everything came out within a reasonable amount of time and was absolutely a home run. The burrito was so damned good that I considered eating the three beans I had dropped on the table. It came with fruit and a fresh pico de gallo type thing whose ingredients remain a mystery, but it was delicious.Some criticisms I've read in here are understandable, and in the end this place isn't for everyone. If it gets busy, I could see the food taking a while, but this is a place where everything is made from fresh ingredients. It would take me an hour at home to make the burrito I had this morning. All in all, I don't give out 5-star ratings often, but this place is deserving. If you want a fresh, delicious meal, whether you are vegan or not, and like a friendly, casual, non-pretentious atmosphere, check it out.The Pomegranate Café was recently named "Best New Restaurant" by Phoenix Magazine, which is a lifestyle rag for urbanites with dollars to burn.  The restaurant in question is in Chandler, home to many of these people.However, Pomegranate Café is family-owned and vegan-friendly, so I had to check it out.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian and can be made vegan.  There are also gluten-free and raw options, so there's something for everybody.  The restaurant serves breakfast foods like tofu scrambles, French toast, and breakfast burritos, but when I went, I chose a vegan BLT from their lunch menu.  It was made with delicious smoky tempeh "bacon," and the addition of avocado was nice.  My hot date ordered a pesto sandwich, which he declared pasty but tasty.  Neither sandwich was huge, but they come with a spinach-pomegranate salad and some veggie chips.  You get a full plate of food, and everything is extremely fresh, but I wasn't too stoked on the salad, though my hot date liked it.  It would have been nice to have a choice of sides, like some fries or potato salad or something, but that was not the case.We also split a berry smoothie, which was pretty tasty.  It was no tsoynami, but...what is?  They also had a good selection of vegan desserts, such as cookies, donut holes, cakes and even cheesecake.  We got a slice of chocolate cake topped with pomegranate seeds to go, and it was delicious.  It's so rare to find dairy- and egg-free desserts.The atmosphere was bright, clean and cheerful.  It was an enjoyable meal for sure.  My main gripe about the place brings me right back to my first paragraph: everything was sooo damn expensive.  Sandwiches are $8-$12, the smoothie was friggin' $7, and the slice of cake was $6.  So, if you wanna splurge and try a new vegan place on the far east side of town, it's definitely worth a try.  But unless you're one of those rich people that can afford things, you might want to bring a friend and split some stuff.  The food is tasty, but I don't think I'll go back because I wouldn't dream of spending that kind of money on a meal these days.12/15/10Cool bright, happy colors w/ a hippy-chic atmosphere.  Enticing-looking natural "treats" everywhere you look- cupcakes, brownies, cookies, energy bars, and fruits.  There seemed to be only one cook and one cashier/helper that day of my first and only visit (so far!), both eager to be of help w/ my questions on the ingredients of their fare.  The coffee, though expensive (or so I thought, at $3 a cup, no refills), was very good, and came w/ a tiny bit of homemade cranberry-pistachio biscotti- delicious!  I enjoyed the Berry Pepita French toast, which consisted of bread made w/ a house seed mix, and loaded w/ raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, plus slices of kiwi, apple, and garnishes of grapefruit!  I believe PC offered blue agave syrup as their pancake syrup, but I didn't need it, as the fruit provided most of the sweetness I needed.  (I did whip out reserve bottle of 100% maple syrup from my bag...)  This gratifying breakfast kept me full, w/out feeling bloated, for more than seven hours!Why I haven't returned, which I promised myself I would the next couple of days, I don't know... Perhaps on my next "weekend" off!4.5 Stars.Over the past few months I have given Pomegranate Cafe another try, or two, or three... and I have been very pleased with the improvement in their menu, the service, the speed, and the food itself. Everything in the restaurant is vegan and can be made vegetarian which means I can eat anything there... heck yes! They even have a wide variety of raw items including desserts.They have all-day breakfast and are always posting delicious looking brunch items on the weekend (Facebook). I haven't made it for a weekend brunch, but it is on my list.My favorite items have to be the Lumberjack sandwich, the southwest mac n cheese, the hibiscus cooler, and the cowgirl cookies. They are in the middle of a remodel right now, doubling their space, and the past two times I have been in there the place has been absolutely packed... so I'm not the only one taking notice of this great spot :-)Keep up the good work, PC!So... I think Pomegranate and I might have more than a spring fling. I don't want to jinx it, but this could be really serious. I introduced Pomegranate to my mom, my best friends, and even my current boyfriend, but everyone agrees, they can see me spending the rest of my life with Pomegranate. Here's my recount of our classic love story, one dish at a time.I knew I'd fallen after tasting the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast (griddle-dipped banana bread, drizzled in rhubarb sauce, strawberries, and topped with cream) Then, the Tiramisu (coconut-based espresso, cream, and date-nut crust layers) sent me head over heels. The Breakfast Burrito left me satisfied, but didn't create that same spark that the flavorful Ranchero Skillet once did. Luckily, the hemp milk latte and famous cowgirl cookie quickly helped me remember why I committed to Pomegranate in the first place.Our relationship moved to a new level - raw - a few months ago. The rainbow wrap was ridiculously huge and filling (much more so than the basic, but tasty, Mediterranean wrap). It was almost more than I could handle. I tossed the bland Indian sweet potato hummus it came with and focused on what really mattered... finishing the wrap. I cared too much not to. After stuffing myself into oblivion, Pomegranate surprised me with a coffee-choco-nana & coconut milk ice cream shake afterward... topped with crushed chocolate-almond pillows. Within seconds of my first spoonful, the fire was back, and burning hotter than ever.Shortly afterwards, I fell into a confused rut, messing around with vegan meats and cheeses of all varieties. The southwestern mac 'n' cheese, much like the Philly cheese steak, tantalized me with its decadence, but left me feeling sick and low afterwards. Even the delicious, nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl, brimming with sprouts, veggies and quinoa, was only posing as Mr. Right. Tainted by the presence of faux-chicken, I shied away after only two rendezvouses. Not even dessert could lure me back, for both the chocolate cake (dry) and almond butter square (boring) were a disappointment.It was all my fault. What was I thinking? A few weeks later, I rushed back, determined to mend the gaping hole in my heart. I downed the mushroom bisque and half a pesto presto sandwich (Kamut baguette, fresh avocado, pesto, fresh veggies) in under five minutes. Oh, how I missed the fresh ingredients, the whole foods, the homemade flavor in every bite. Still, I needed some sugar after being away. Lucky for me, the Cannoli (brûlée'd sugar shell, cashew cream filling, dark chocolate chips, and berry sauce), not only provided that, but was better than any Cannoli I'd ever had. And I've had a fair share of Cannolis in my day. What more can a girl ask for? Pomegranate, I do.10/06/12Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a "female hormonal concoction" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was "grape seed oil extract."  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to "flavor" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!I'll be back!I got a lemonade and a burger.It was $26.No thank you.WAYYYYYYYYYYY too $$ for what I got.Local, Fresh, Organic, Vegan, Raw. Healthy indulgence at its finest. Finally . . . A little slice of Unprocessed Heaven in Ahwatukee! My favorite? The Sizzlin' Sesame Salad! Mixed greens, vibrant purple cabbage, tofu, brown rice, broccoli and carrot, topped off with chili almonds and orange miso dressing. Very unique. Southwestern Mac and Cheese and the Bountiful Bowls were great too, just a little heavy for a work day. Raw Almond Joy bars are delicious; even better than the original. OMG!!!!! So good.   Adorable décor! Nice remodel and expansion.   Staff is always super friendly, and the owner(s) will come around and chat with you personally which is always nice to see. Just don't be a jackass and bring in food from Los Dos Molinos (or anywhere else)! Don't let the vegan / vegetarian labels scare you - there's something for everyone at Pomegranate!First and foremost, I am not a vegan or vegetarian (I did have a little stint back in high school during my XXX hardcore days, but that's another  story). I enjoy eating meat. However, I do enjoy Vegan/vegetarian food as well which drew me to Pomegranate Cafe when I lived on the east side. To be honest, Pomegranate Cafe is an acquired taste.  It's not for everyone as with most restaurants similar. The food is organic and non processed and most dishes I have tried has an "earthy" taste.  The juices are freshly made and is exactly that JUICE. No additives, sugars necessary.  You get the full nutrients from the food you're eating/drinking. Whenever I come here (2-3 times/mo), I usually get the Lumberjack, hearty and delicious. I get it vegan even though a non vegan is available (when in Rome).  I also order the Abundance, a mean unpleasant looking green juice that is beyond delicious.  If I have room, as the portions are generous, I'll share dessert with friends.   As I've stated earlier, this place is not for everyone.  The prices are on the higher side, but for what you get, it's well worth it. Can you spend the same amount of money and get 25 cheeseburgers from McDonalds? Sure. If that's the case, then you have wasted your time reading this review. If you want a different culinary experience with healthy food, knowledgable staff, and relaxed ambiance, then give Pomegranate a try!My husband and I are just a joy to cook for. He's gluten and dairy intolerant, and I'm a vegetarian. Pomegranate Cafe has us both covered with numerous menu choices plus a great dessert case.I first tried this place with Laura L., and I was delighted with the lumberjack sandwich (tofu and regular cheese) and sweet potato hash . The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30. Perhaps Pomegranate Cafe isn't a great value, but all the food is delicious. It's an excellent choice for those of us with special diets.I love pomegranate seeds so why would Pomegranate Cafe be any different? This little mix matched spot is adorable, it's what my Pinterest boards dream to look like. Wooden tables, chairs with fresh words on them, mason jars EVERYWHERE and all fresh ingredients to boot.    I've had a sun warrior smoothie and the Raw! Tacos which were to die for. The walnut meat was spicy and delicious wrapped up in cabbage leaves. I'm hooked on their food pairings and the vibe they give off. P. S. Their dessert selection is to die for. Lemon bars? Gluten free goodness.Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the "order here" sign. I got up and asked, "is this where I order?". They responded, "wherever....". It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink. Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.I've never seen a place with such confused employees. I mean, who can't say whether its seat yourself or not? Who can't say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter? Ridiculous.Let me explain something to you: I am a man. I like to eat MEAT, and I don't want some fru-fru ingredients that I've never heard about. Don't try to serve me brocolini - just give me broccoli. Or better yet, just give me a small tree because I am a man and when I eat, I mean business.Due to this, I avoided the Pomegranate Cafe for a long time, because what am I going to do with a tofu burrito? That's not real food. And a taco made with walnut meat? Walnuts aren't meat - they're wood. I don't want that.Anyway, my wife talked me into coming here, and I have to take everything back. This place has serious flavor - flavor that would scare lesser men. I had a burrito without any meat in it - not even eggs, and it was both filling, and really, really delicious. Also, they have some pretty wild deserts here, so even if you're not willing to try bread made of cauliflower, try the chocolate cake, or even better - the banana cake.Do know that they are slow - like... extremely slow. If you have the time, it's worth it, but don't come here if you've got somewhere to be afterwards.Also, they have fake bacon, which is nothing like real bacon. I'm not saying it's bad - just don't order it if you're like me and expect what you're used to.Other than that, enjoy! And I recommend sitting outside - they've got a lovely patio and a basket full of squirt bottles to ward off any adventurous birds.FINALLY, The Funk has come back to South Phoenix.Have you ever done something one day and was more upset the next day about what you did? Well that's how I feel about dropping $45 on Pomegranate cafe for a late veggie lunch - solo. (I can imagine the heads shaking from all the carnivores. That's steak money, right?) Yeah, I feel ya'. My support for veggie eateries is quickly waning. They are over-priced and can be quite pretentious with the creativity.So, I was down south on a hot afternoon and really worked up a sweat. I remembered reading that Pomegranate Cafe sold fresh juice and was located somewhere near 40th St and Chandler Blvd. Had I known to look for the shopping center with Safeway and two doors down from Trader Joes....Landmarks, folks! Very important when giving directions.... PC's white and pink sign is a tad dull against the building. If I wasn't specifically looking for the cafe, I probably would have missed it and gone somewhere else to eat. But anyway, I walked in, grabbed all the menus (regular, HH, and juice bar), and had a seat. (Only order at the counter if you want take-away). Asked for a juice right away and despite the "slow service" comments that other reviewers have posted, I wasn't too bothered by the several minutes it took for juice to make its way to my table. I pushed aside water and guzzled it down. Aahhh. I could feel, see, hear, smell, sense, taste, perceive the essence of life coursing through my veins. That must be the feeling Popeye gets  after eating spinach (mmmm, love those greens).Why only three stars for PC?One for just being veggie +One for being freshly made +One for serving fresh juice Fresh juice was the best part of my afternoon. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered off the regular menu like an idiot and hit myself later for not giving the happy hour menu a chance. Could've saved myself half the price. Truth be told - I should've stopped with the juice, paid the bill, and walked away. But, ooh, I spied with my little eye jackfruit tacos and jackfruit sliders. - BBQ jackfruit sliders (3) for $12: jackfruit, peppers, onions, jalapeno cabbage slaw, chimichurri on bun. Even though I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side, the jackfruit itself had a sickly sweetness that cancelled my enjoyment. What I really liked, though, were the silver dollar-sized buns. - Jamaican jerk street tacos (3) for $12: jerk seasoned jackfruit, cabbage slaw, pico, baja sauce, chimichurri on corn tortillas. Did that say jamaican? Show me the jerk who thought of that because wurnt no part of those tacos Jamaican. Spicy? Nope. All I could taste was that sickly sweet jackfruit. Created and tasted exactly like the sliders.  The jackfruit wasn't prepared the way I'm used to having it. In fact I couldn't even tell that it was jackfruit by sight because it was mixed with other stuff and only one spoonful of it was buried under the mounds of cabbage slaw and sauce.When I mentioned the sweetness to the two staff members who checked on me they blamed the jackfruit. Really? I know what jackfruit tastes like. Even when fresh it's not overly sweet. Either this jackfruit was sweetened and then packaged, or one of PC's sauces used in the dishes was too sweet. Won't order it again. - For dezzert, a slice of tropical cake. Good cake, real cake, but could have used more tropics and less sugary lemon frosting. AGAIN with the sweetness.Overall, PC's dishes are very colourful and look beautiful. I'll try a wrap and/or salad next time, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again any time soon.  Four items averaged to about $10 apiece, then tax and probably a surcharge for a take out box.  You would think that would have filled me up, but actually I stopped somewhere else on the way back to central Phoenix.I've been here a bunch and the food is always delicious. It's a bit on the pricey side for veggie fare, but I just tell myself I'm back in Los Angeles and get to enjoying my iced Pom milk latte with my $14 breakfast bowl. The coffee is really great, especially when it includes their house blended non-dairy milk. I tend to like the breakfast options more than lunch, the Pom Muffin, bowls, and scrambles always well cooked and tasty. For lunch, the nachos....are not good so avoid those, and get one of the salads, bowls, or sandwiches instead. Service can be a tad spastic, and you do have the sense that the regulars get way better service post-yoga class than any newbies in town. They have a lovely pastry/dessert case up front, too, so grab a gluten free power bar, a cup of coffee, and get prepared to eavesdrop on people extolling the virtues of hot yoga and wheat grass.

Restaurant name  Bachi Burger
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This is in my 'hood and I came in really wanting to be WOW'd by the place. But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.Service 101 memory lane.1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out "Hello" or "Goodbye" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something.BUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.What's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, "Hello! We'll be right with you!"2) Bus the tables, immediately.It's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables.Again... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, "Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!"Great.But just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables. When I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.What really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs.Hey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you.Better yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.3) Know the menu.I've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating.We're not at McDonald's. 5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.Finally... for the food.....I had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.The truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try. Pork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.What was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.The potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.If I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.I know these guys are new and working out the kinks. I really want to love this place so I'll come back in a month or so to see if the service has changed and when I do, I'll update this review.NEVER AGAIN. I would end the review there because I refuse to spend more time on this place (and hope that no one else wastes their time either) but I guess this deserves some explanation. Got here a little before 1 PM and was seated with the boyfriend. We were handed menus by a girl who said, "Uhhh I'll let you have a minute to look this over and then send someone over." Uh oh. Already knew that no one had any clue what they were doing and could already tell this was not going to be a good indication of what was to come. 5-10 minutes go by and we haven't even gotten drinks yet - or have been able to order them for that matter. We push our menus to the side and gaze at the workers behind the counter to see if someone is going to wait on us. A guy finally comes by and takes our order after explaining that there was some issue with the computer. Rule #1: The customer doesn't care what is wrong. We are just hungry. Let us order and just apologize quickly for the wait. When I ordered my edamame I physically had to point to the item on the menu since he wasn't sure which of the three I ordered. No, I'm not kidding. 5 minutes after ordering we finally get our drinks - water. Yes it took about 20 minutes to get water. About 5 minutes after that we get our edamame. It doesn't look like the truffle oil and garlic oil edamame I ordered and I ask him if this is the correct one. He says yes and walks off. Well guess what? It wasn't. It was the chili one. I physically pointed to the menu which one I wanted, then ask as it is set down if it is the correct one, and it's not? It's not like there are 100 different edamames on the menu - there are three. Had to get his attention to get us a new batch which came out a lot quicker this time. It was good, but had too much garlic oil that overpowered the truffle oil, and it was way too oily. Each piece was dripping - not too appetizing. The waiter comes by a couple minutes later to give us the sweet potato fries (which were very very good, although I didn't like the sauce too much) to tell us our food is ready but they're waiting on the pickles. WTF? Then he tells us he is going on break and someone else will be covering our table. Right. Food comes out a couple minutes later. The grilled cheese I got was okay, but totally not worth $7. Matt got a Ronin burger which he thought was alright as well but didn't like some of the mix of flavors. The same waiter who I guess didn't go on break comes by and asks us if we want dessert which we say no, and then asks us if we want the check and hands it to us. We walk up to the counter to pay and I hand it to the girl there and say I am going to be paying cash. SHE WALKS OFF. SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF WITH NO EXPLANATION TO GET FOOD AT THE COUNTER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Our waiter comes by a minute later, my mouth agape and I pay and get out of there. I said in a previous review that Macaroni Grill was the worst service I have ever had, but this takes the cake. I would rather exclusively eat at the Macaroni Grill for the rest of my life than return to Bachi Burger. All in all it took us over an HOUR to have what at other places would be a quick 30-40 minute lunch. No one knows what the hell they are doing and they also seem like they don't care either. The food was alright, but not enough to make me ever come back with that kind of service or lack thereof. Jesus Tap-dancing Christ on a cracker, if you hold your sanity dear to your heart do not go to this place because the service is absolutely appalling and I refuse to return to this establishment because of it.With all these glowing reviews, we finally hauled our bootays over to the other side of town to try it.  Boy, were we satisfied!-Apple Lychee Soda - way too sweet for my taste.  however, for those sweet drink lovers, this had plenty of lychee flavor.-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Didn't care much for the sundried tomato aioli on the side, but these truffle fries are the best I've had outside of a gourmet restaurant.  They stayed crispy and salty with just enough of the truffle parm aroma and taste.-Garlic Salt & Pepper French Fries - I didn't enjoy this as much.  I've had really bomb diggity salt & pepper flavor at other Asian restaurants on various other accompaniments.  So in comparison,it could have used more flavor blast.-Kalbi Burger - This was great!  The flavors of a kalbi short rib in a burger patty made it super flavorful and the patty was juicy.  The kimchi inside gave it that extra tangy and spicy kick.  The pickled cucumber panchan on the side was good.-The Crusty Crab -  I enjoyed the crab cake inside, but I did not enjoy the mango chutney paired with it.  That's probably me just being biased because I generally don't like salty + super sweet together.-The Lonely Bird - This was actually really enjoyable also.  Chicken and Turkey usually scream "i'm-too-healthy-don't-eat-me," but the Herb Pesto sauce made it moist and flavorful.-BBQ Bachi Burger 5 oz American Wagyu - This was just a regular burger combination, but what made it stand out was the wonderful bbq flavor char and juicy burger patty.  Bravo, Bachi burger.  Bravo.Vietnamese Coffee - I quote my friend, "nasty," and she's the queen of drinking Vietnamese coffeeConclusion:  Fun, flavorful and juicy burgers with above average fries.  Tip:  If you can help it, go before lunch time rush because I can see how it can get to be a little touch and go with the service.  We came right before the lunch time rush, so service was decent right up until the lunch time rush started and we were waiting forever for one Vietnamese coffee.Big ups to my ninja, Reid.  I'd be down to donate blood to you, you iron deficient sumbitch.  I promise it'll make you smarter, faster, stronger, but won't increase the length or girth of your.....sentences?If you're a strict cheeseburger purist, I got one thing to say to you, put an egg in your shoe and beat it.  This place puts an asian touch on burgers (I use the term 'touch' because the term 'fusion' should only be used when speaking about coitus).Ok, so I'm only going to talk (type up) about the burgers only.  It's Friday and I don't feel like doing anything and I'm sure you don't feel like reading any more than you have to.  I'm glad we have agreed upon this arrangement.  Let's shake on it to make it official.The Ronin Burger is aptly named.  The Ronin were samurai with no lord back in the day.  In this case, think of the patty as the Samurai.  Even with all the ingredients used in describing this burger, it stood alone.  No master, or in this case, ingredient to follow.  Not a bad thing.  The burger was still good.  Though description of it would lead you to think it was going to be layered with different flavors and whatnot.The Kalbi burger is like eating Korean BBQ in burger form.  And much like eating the actual Korean BBQ, you'll be burping this up all the way home on that picturesque drive on the 15 southbound.  I would've never have thought about putting kimchee in a burger.  This was better executed than Sadam Hussein was.  You know, with his head all on the ground rolling around and whatnot.I'll take a couple of those Portuguese donuts for the road. Thanks.Met up with a couple of friends that live nearby here and had a great dinner.  Started with 3 orders of fries for the appetizer (not my idea but hey..sure!).  All of them were tasty and went well with Asahi..garlic salt and pepper, truffle parmesan and sweet potato fries.  On a sidenote...has any restaurant truly found a good dipping sauce for sweet potato fries??  I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..it's all just chemicals isn't it?  I got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread. Will definitely be back!Celebrating the Husband's birthday (two months ago), we were looking for somewhere new that was children-friendly and had a variety of things to order.  Bachi Burger was his place of choice.  I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there.  Once everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit.  Since the Ronin Burger "Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma,  Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger "Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share.  The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite.  Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different.  One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger.  He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).I started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean "Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food.  It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy!  It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!You can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries "Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli" ($4).  It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.Another thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries "Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli" ($4).  They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.The kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken "Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce." ($6) that they ordered a second round.To close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts "Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato" ($5) with a birthday candle in it.  (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.)  They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it.  The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.Service - we got the waiter that everyone talks about.  He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong.  You can't blame the guy for trying, right?  They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter.  Overall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.  3.5 starsThis is one of the best burger places in town! I have been here about ten times in the past couple months probably, and I am still satisfied and trying everything on the menu!  If you like the whole Asian-style burgers, you will have to try this! Oh, and don't forget to try the Oxtail chili-cheese fries! To die for!!After reading numerous reviews on Yelp about Bachi Burger I was finally in the area around lunch time so I stopped in for a to-go order. The reviews on Yelp made it clear that Bachi Burger had two areas they could improve in: Service and speed. Since I was on my lunch break I didn't have all day to wait for my order, so I asked how long it would take before I even looked at the menu. 10-15 minutes is what I was told by a pretty friendly employee.I decided to get Kiki's Burger, sweet potato fries and a cantaloupe milk tea with boba... Total was a little under $20, isn't Micky D's that's for damn sure! My drink was made immediately and it was so tasty, my first cantaloupe milk tea definitely will not be my last! My food really did take 10-15 minutes. No complaints at all on the service, I was treated respectfully and they got me on my way pretty quickly.Kiki's Burger comes with cheese, two types of mushrooms, bacon, an onion marmalade that was nice and sweet and a sauce on the side that I did not bother with. It was cooked perfectly, medium as I was told they recommended it. What a great combination of flavors! I would absolutely order this again. The real standout was the sweet potato fries though. I shared some with my co-worker because I know how much she likes sweet potato fries and she told me that these were "Off the hook, best she ever had". I agree with her. So I'm not sure about some of these negative reviews. Has Bachi Burger stepped their game up in recent months? Did I happen to go at the right day and time? Or were people just too critical? Not sure, I think I will need to go back to Bachi Burger again to find out.Freaking A!  What a place, what a place!  I just can't get over how exotic and flavorful everything is here so far!  A friend from out of town came in and first on our list was Bachi Burger!  Like the last time, the place was pretty empty, not too busy, but the one thing my gf and I spotted was a new burger!*The Shogun Burger* (not on the website) $23Features the Wagyu beef, eel, poached pear, and foie gras! Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.We also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.Another great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!i don't even know where to begin. 3 hours later i am still, happily, in a food coma. a turkey burger hangover.After Jesse B.'s review with the awesome sweet potato fries, bachi burger has been on Dan T.'s and my list to eat. We lucked out and even convinced his parents to venture out and try this place with us. Melissa was our server tonight. She was very nice and helpful. went over everything with us and even told us a little background on bachi burger. We started with some chicken karaage, oxtail chili cheese fries (complete with a fried egg on top,) and edamame. out of all three i highly recommend the chicken karaage. so crispy and tasteful. and that sauce. i don't even know what it was but i was loving it. the oxtail chili cheese fries had jalapenos all over them, but they were not spicy whatsoever. more sweet actually. they were still good and i enjoyed them.moving onto our actual meals i ordered the lonely bird burger protein style. a chicken and turkey patty combined? I'll take it! the pesto sauce on it was quite lovely and i won't deny that i wiped that little saucer clean of it. i tried a bite of Dan's cheeseburger with bacon and was quite pleased but i will stick with my lonely bird personally. we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. my choice was to order the truffle parmesan and i wasn't TOO impressed with them for the mere fact that about only 6 or 7 fries actually had the truffle sauce on them. all the others were pretty basic but still good to dip in the sun dried tomato sauce. I'd go for the sweet potato fries over those. the sweet potato's were crispy and packed with sweet potato flavor. i didn't feel the need to dip those in any of the fancy sauces.needless to say, after all that yummy food we were all too stuffed to order dessert. I will be back though to try some of those little donuts with some ice cream and maybe sneak in a coffee. I was pleased. thank you bachi burger for filling my little stomach and putting me in this food coma.After a day of slingin cookies for Rise Up Japan, I needed some fuel. I am rarely on this side of town and this has been on the list of curiosities for a while.The BF and I shared:Ronin ($8,Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli) - from the description, you can clearly see there was a lot going on. Somehow it worked for me but I think it's because those are familiar flavors I would find in a bento lunch but I know for some folks this won't work. It was very rich  specially when you're biting through the egg yolk area. You didn't need the yuzu aioli sauce served on the side (I ended up dipping fries in it). Both the BF and I were glad we split since neither of us can really eat a whole of that flavor. KiKi ($8, Sautéed Shiitake & Eryngi mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Ciabatta Bun, Garlic Chili Aioli on the side ) I love me mushroom and onion burgers and happy that they were generous on the onions and mushrooms in it. I did use the chili aioli to add a bit of zing to it to balance the rich earthiness and sweetness of the toppings.Truffle Fries ($4)- they drizzle a bit of truffle gravy on the fries but I wish they just give you that on the side. The fries were crisp and light and well seasoned. They had a bunch of different drinks and I respect their nicely selected craft beers, but I was just feeling on a simple and refreshing matcha ice green tea. Overall, service was friendly and decent with keeping up on the drinks. I liked the sweet bun on the burger. I thought the meat was good quality, juicy and cooked right. I think the concept is good and I am curious to try more of their offerings. However, I don't think I would drive all the way from the NW to come down to eat here. If we're in Town Square I think this will be something I'd much rather go to instead of eating in the mall.Forget everything you knew or thought you knew about the burger when you go to Bachi. These burgers are gourmet creations deserving of the high praise that has been bestowed upon this little restaurant since it opened. Maybe for those who like their burgers with the standard mayo and ketchup, Bachi burgers may be too intense, have too many exotic ingredients or may be on the pricey side. But for those who want to tickle their tastebuds with explosive flavors, Bachi is the place for you. Reading over the menu, a couple of the signature burgers called out to me, but in the end, I ordered the Bachi Fish- Furikake-sprinkled Marinated Seared Cod, Tartar Sauce, Lettuce, Onion, Tomato, Bubu Arare Rice Crackers in between a pillow-soft bun. The fish size was nice and meaty, and I loved the sweet soy-sauce marinade (a cross between Teriyaki/Kalbi) that gave the cod wonderful flavor. The tomato, onion and lettuce were fresh, and the mini rice cracker balls were fun to eat. Pretty to look at, but even better when eaten. I also enjoyed the Iced Barley Tea (unlimited refills). The waiter made frequent trips to make sure my glass was never empty. Speaking of the waiter, the service here was good. I have no complaints. I only have one question: When can I go again?As the flavors of my Green and Blue burger flavors burst into my mouth I secretly thought this was most definitely the best burger I have eaten. But, I should clarify that this isn't the best burger-tasting burger. It's just an amazing cornucopia of flavors that all seem to come together as one to create a complete sense of food satisfaction.The Green and Black burger was made with grass fed beef and topped with bacon, blue cheese, mushrooms and spinach I believe. As I said before it was simply awesome. We also shared an order of Parmesan Truffle fries and the pickle appetizer. The pickle sample was really good - only one was hot and the pickled garlic was one of the most interesting on the plate.Besides food, Bachi Burger makes some really interesting drinks like the strawberry jasmine lemonade I had with my dinner. The atmosphere is quite simple, almost the opposite of the complexity of the burgers. And if I lived in the area I would definitely come back again and again to try everything from the "Banh-Mi" Burger to the Crusty Crab.I heard and read a lot of good things about this place however my first experience with them wasn't a good one. I ordered the Ronnin burger $8? and parmesan truffle fries $4?. Let's just say the pictures I've seen were a lot better looking and larger. My fries were terrible they were all shriveled and over cooked, super salty. it was as if they got some left over fries from the fridge nuked them in the microwave and dumped a pill of parmesan and  garlic salt on it, no lesser in size than a medium fries from McDonald's. The burger was pretty tasty, but under cooked and sloppy made, buns was completely soggy and ingredients falling out before the first bite. there was also some nasty after taste from the slaw. I just expected more and wonder if I just caught them on a wrong day. They do have a unique menu that looks delicious which I'd like to try. So until then I'm fine with saying that this place is just an ok burger place.The decor and eating environment is nice.  Friendly service.**UPDATE**Just spent the last week suffering from wat couldve been food poisoning hence the 2 star now. Only out of the ordinary food i've eaten was this place maybe it was the under cooked burger. I usually have a strong stomach and can eat just about anything. I probably won't be coming here anytime soon.Nooooommmmmmers! Bachi Burger is delicious with extra delicious on top. We ordered: -The kids meal (of course) which includes a grilled cheese, fries and fruit. - The Crusty Crab ala Misti Y.'s recommendation, (Pan Roasted Crab Cake, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, Onion, Mango Chutney, Tarragon Remoulade, Butter Glazed Sweet Bread Bun). - The Kalbi burger (Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo )- The Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Portuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato      - Iced Passion Milk Tea with BobaEverything was equally mindbogglingly delicious. My fav was definitely the Steamed Buns and Passion Milk Tea. The Boba was a little mushy, but the tea was outstanding. The Crusty Crab was the best crab cake creation I have ever had. Mr. R adored his Kalbi Burger. The Portuguese Donuts melted in my mouth and the coffee gelato took the dessert to another level altogether. I will return just as quickly as I can return to Vegas. The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is the shotty service. Our server was fantastic, but we hardly saw him. It was extremely busy, but most of the servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They were literally bumping into each other. The manager came over to our table at the end of the meal and apologized for the bad service, she said she felt bad and that they are working on it. I will update my review after another visit.*I don't usually write reviews.  But for this place I had to.**Good (albeit extremely over-priced) food vastly offset by TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE that runs on Filipino time.First thing I did when I moved to Vegas was check out all the burger reviews/joints/best-of-lists.  You'll see In N' Out, Burger Brassiere, LBS, Burger Bar...  and Bachi Burger.  So I had to check it out.When I arrived there, there was a wait and I was hungry so I figured I'd just order To-Go.  I ordered two burgers (Kiki Burger & their Special at the time w/ blue cheese) and two fries (sweet potato & parmesan truffle).  Simple order?  I thought so.Like the reasonable prudent person, I asked how long it would take.  Melissa let me know that it would be 15 minutes.  15 minutes sounds reasonable, right?  That is if it were really 15 minutes.So after waiting for more than 30 minutes (I timed it) and giving a dozen different looks into the kitchen/Melissa, I asked politely how much longer would I have to stay hungry.  "Three minutes", she replied.  "What a completely arbitrary number?" I thought.  But I'll trust her.  So 10 minutes later, wondering if I was high because it didn't feel like three minutes, I asked again how long it would take.  I think she finally started to feel guilty, so she said it was coming right up.  I'm so gullible.So five minutes later, magically as I approached they started bagging my food.  It took another five minutes to finish bagging me up (they forgot my sauce) and ring me up.  Because I was far beyond annoyed after waiting for so long when I was told 15 minutes, I asked if I could express my unpleasant experience and offer constructive  criticism to the owner/manager/person-in-charge.  Melissa told me he's not there and she's in charge.  Great.  She told me to just call later and the owner would talk to me.So I called later...  In fact, I called later multiple times and on multiple days.  I left messages.  Nothing.  He never talked to me. Don't get me wrong, food was good.  But spending $32.43 and waiting more than 50 minutes for 2 burgers & 2 fries is not justifiable in any sense unless I was told from the get-go what to expect.  Instead I was lied to repeatedly, never apologized to or compensated, and was not even able to express my displeasure to those who count.  Arrghh... Just thinking about it makes me so angry.  Like a big emo tornado of emotion.  Thank God for In N' Out. Peace Bachi Burger.Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I wish I could return for a do over but as I live in another state I'll just have to lay out my experience for what it was. A-OK. When in Vegas on vacation I scoured Yelp to find a truly "local" eatery that we could visit for lunch with our friends. All the Vegas yelpers and some Honolulu yelpers I know were all wowed by Bachi Burger so I insisted we drive off the strip to eat there.First off the decor is not the greatest, just a dimly lit space with tables and chairs. I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it's clean and the food is great. We were seated quickly and our waiter gave us the run down on popular dishes. I ended up ordering the kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries and a peanut butter chocolate shake. Our food took awhile to come out but as we were catching up with our friends we didn't really care. My Kalbi burger had less flavor than I expected. I think I had it in my head that it was going to be sweeter but the size of the burger was good. With all the ingredients in and on the burger I think I expected it to be a small miracle of flavor bursting into my mouth. Talk about high expectations huh? The sweet potato fries were overcooked and too stringy so I only ate three of them and didn't finish the rest. My peanut butter chocolate shake was $4 and much too sweet. I'm a sweets fiend so if a place offers a peanut butter chocolate shake I am guaranteed going to order it. I think there was too much syrup added to my shake so there wasn't a good balance in the flavors. Sad panda.Our waiter was a really nice guy but one thing which was very odd was that in the middle of our meal he asked us a question from behind the countertop that adjoined our table. It just felt a bit rude, almost like your neighbor listening in on a private conversation and chiming in from behind a fence. I don't think he understood why that was rude, but it's something that could be fixed for future diners. Overall very good service and smiley service.I'm sure many will disagree with me about Bachi Burger, but I really, really wanted to like it! After reading all the stellar reviews I think that I just didn't order the right items for my particular palate. Maybe on my next trip to Vegas we will meet again Bachi Burger and we'll have a redo. I always believe in second chances. Yelpers obviously love you so there's got to be something that I missed during my visit!Yelp 365 Challenge: #45/365 (The High Expectations)My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.I placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!I have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.In addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.  I was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.Perhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed.The word bachi means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.                                                                                            That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye"...GOOD GOD!Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg                Mr. Ho's Burger- Angus beef & pork patty, green onions, cilantro ginger, garlic, Hoisin Mayo, Lup Cheong, sautéed mushrooms, mizuna & a TARO Bun  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=aMy63-xKofPONtJqkZTVqg  Ronin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw       Truffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0ADipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kwPortuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcgWatermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkAWe started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUSTListen up folks, yelp exists for a reason.  See all those 3.5 star reviews for all the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  You know the ones that don't live up to and are more expensive than the original locations in New York and Los Angeles.  The ones that don't really care about how good the food is, because the celebrity chef whose name is on the marquee is at least an entire desert and mountain range away.  Those famous name places in the hotels, they care as much about return customers as those slot machines do.  They both know that as soon as they take your money, the next stooge is going to sit down in that same seat.Bachi Burger belongs on the strip.  It so good and different that it should be featured in the Bellagio or the Wynn, but you aren't going to find it there.  You are going to find it tucked away in a hard to see corner of a strip mall south of the airport.  This gem who MUST expand to other locations, is a concept from Chef Lorin Watada, who has worked for Roy's for many years.  The fusion of Asian flavors and burgers are so perfect together, I have no idea why nobody else has really come up with an entire menu of it before.  Sure you sometimes see a Teriyaki burger on a menu, but this is a completely different level.We started off with Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns.  While not listed as an appetizer, they are like 3 mini sliders, so good for sharing.  The buns were nice and sticky and folded taco style around a slice of sweet duck breast, cilantro, slice of egg, thin slice of radish, scallions, black Chinese vinaigrette, and hosin BBQ sauce.  While they were a good starting point, never order them in place of a Burger! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#3zjM4SbAXTNr8cRrcyHDegI split two burgers with my brother.  Both were so good, we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  First was the Ronin Burger.  7oz of Angus beef topped with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, miso goma dressing, and katsu BBQ sauce.  On the side was yuzu citrus aioli.  I also had them add Gruyere cheese.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was nice and pink.  The juices of the burger and the katsu BBQ sauce went so perfectly together I couldn't distinguish them as separate entities anymore.  The Japanese cabbage slaw had a nice crunchy sweet vinegar flavor to offset the texture of the burger.  I'm usually not a huge fan of a fried egg on my burger, but this just seemed so right.  So many times, burger joints throw on a fried egg for "shock value".  Somehow on this burger it was tastefully done to enhance the burger.  The miso goma sauce was on the slaw side of the bun.  The sweet rice wine/ sesame flavor worked perfectly with the slaw.  At this point my taste buds were just singing.  How could you need more flavor?  What was this yuzu citrus aioli about?   I added some of it just on one bite, and  found that the burger really didn't need it at all.  In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#8s5ab8tv_OI9keGxjmPErwThe second burger may have been even better!  More unique in flavor for sure.  The Banh-Mi Burger.  Ok, brace yourselves.  The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices.   It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce.  The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side.  Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl.  But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger.  Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere.  For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!!  I actually thought the bun held up well.  A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#ETcasvkOZaGaNUM3ZVIoQAA burger isn't complete without some fries.  We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share.  This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream.  WOW it was great, but not very much of it.  I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more.  The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin.  Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese.  Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone!   We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#z7-52AroniBC5F63yI0D4ANothing left to say other than GO NOW!This is NOT the place to go if you have anywhere to head to afterwards.  Went in during the work week, it is right around the corner from my office.   Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).  We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.  At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.   12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..  I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.  I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.  He asked what I wanted him to do about it.    I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.   If it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.  Give them the opportunity to walk out.  Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!  This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!  Will never go back, I don't care how great their burgers are.I liked it.  There's no doubt about that, but I guess it just wasn't what I was looking for.  I love Japanese cuisine, and I enjoy pursuing the elusive, better-than-In-N-Out, perfect burger.  I only tried the Ronin Burger and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, but I wasn't left with the idea that I would be back.  (My bill came to about $25 without tip.)  The novelty wore off very quickly.You'll enjoy your experience, however.  The restaurant itself was very busy--Los Angeles will have one of it's own this Fall, 2012--and the staff was very personable and all smiles.  The food is a new and refreshing twist on the sometimes commonplace hamburger, and the presentations are eye-catching, as you would expect with a Japanese influence.  Myself, I thought what I had ordered, which was highly recommended by our server and host, was too sweet.  I was expecting to bite into something that was much more robust.  Again, I hadn't tried everything; but for now, it's "been there, done that."I have read many reviews and have seen the episode of Triple D of Bachi Burger.Knowing that I would be in LV I made it a point to stop and try out this place that is reviewed so highly! I ordered :* Miyagi-San Burger which is a Grass Fed Wagyu Beef Burger. Topped off with a Fried Egg,Bacon,Crispy Onion Rings,Chili Mayo and Furikake..OMG! Holy Cow! This burger cooked perfectly medium as ordered, I must say  that this is the best burger I have ever eaten to date. The fried egg and ingredients work harmoniously to make it taste (In Hawaiian terms "SO Fricken ONO!!) . One more thing I judge my burger on is the drip test and yes it passed!. I could not put the burger back down on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g#egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g*Caesar Salad: Good size portion, Baby Romaine,Slices of Avacado,Tomato and Chicken Breast was good and refreshing.

After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :DI wasn't planning on eating a "dirty" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can't go in lookin' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.I didn't have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!Now onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!**The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**Appetizers: 1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There's really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries.2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.Burger:I went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I'm a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!I also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here. You get free refills with their teas and it was delicious. Service is top notch here. They are very attentive and efficient. I'm definitely returning to Bachi the next time we're in Vegas. It's a f*ckin must I tell ya!Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger.

Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!Update and upgrade alert. I finally made my way back to Bachi after nearly two years and I was pleasantly surprised. We came here for lunch and they were extremely busy. We waited for about twenty minutes before we were finally seated. I decided to order the Kalbi burger this time around. I was enticed by the kim chi and it definitely delivered. The meat was perfect flavor and was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the pickled cucumbers quite a bit on the side as well. The bun, which is usually my biggest sticking point for finding a great burger was soft and delicious. My friend's burger was a little on the undercooked side, but still looked good.Service was a little lackluster and that's the only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars. We waited quite a while to order, then another agonizing wait for our food and then when they finally brought our check, it was incorrect. Another long wait for them to rectify that and we were finally out the door. I wish they came by with refills a little more often as well. Service was friendly, however. I'll definitely be back, but I'll make sure I'm not in a hurry when I do.I use to live a few blocks from here and when it came to burgers, I had choices from the strip, In-N-Out, and Steiner's.  I wasn't aware of Yelp at the time, so I took the advice from a friend to eat at Bachi and became a fan ever since.One thing about Bachi is the presentation.  Bachi goes out of the way to make a burger look so beautiful.  I have to admit that I've been here 5+ times and the Sahara location 10+ times in the last 2 years and have yet to try any of their actual burgers. I know, what's wrong with me right?  I guess it's because I love their Bachi Fish (Alaskan Cod), the Lonely Bird (Chicken/Turkey), the Oxtail Fries, and their Bachi Dog.  All are good, very rich due to their sauces, flavorful, and a little messy.  Out of everything I've tried here, their Bachi Fish has to be my favorite.Couple of side notes about Bachi in general.  Sometimes there's a wait to get your order and served.  Because of this, I rarely hit up Bachi on a weekend.  The Sahara location is bigger and faster in my opinion.  Also, the burgers are little pricey (most over $10). Overall, I am still giving Bachi 5 Stars even though I have not tried any of their actual burgers.  Based on the other reviews, they're good so don't let my review discourage you from trying them. However, allow my review to encourage you to try the Bachi Fish.  Both restaurants are clean, service always great, and I have never been disappointed with a Bachi visit.Such a disappointment!!!!!!I've had Bachi burger bookmarked for the longest and even had friends who went and loved it! So, today, while choosing a place to eat, I chose Bachi over Max Brenner. Yep. Big mistake. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries and salt and pepper fries.For our burgers we ordered the ronin burger and spicy miso.We waited 30 minutes for our fries and after complaining, our waitress said she didn't know we wanted the fries to come out first. Wthh.... . She gave us the sauces free of charge which was nice of her. Even though ALL the sauces tasted weird and citrusy. I thought the pineaple ketchup would taste like the special ketchup at Umami but it didn't. As matter a fact it tasted like regular ketchup.Our fries finally came out and I was disappointed with my truffle parmesan fries. The truffle sauce were drizzled lightly and only got on the first layer of fries.Our burgers came out looking so delicious! We both ordered rare. Taking the first bite of my miso burger, I could taste a slight miso taste and then just like that, it went away. And that was it. No other taste! From that point on it tasted like i was eating tasteless meat. The meat were tender but not juicy. I didn't even bother trying boyfriend's burger because he said the same thing about his.Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!After hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.Upon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...hahaMost of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.I think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:I got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...KIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQMy BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!MIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtgWe also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.SWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUgService was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...Bottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!I figured someone should do a write up on this small, unknown local burger joint. They have been flying under the radar for  a number of years and I just wish more people knew about them.....I kid. This place is very popular for a very simple reason. It's putting out delicious food. I finally made it there last week and I was moved. I don't need to be blown away by a meal to appreciate it, but I love it when I have an experience. And Bachi Burger is serving up a unique burger experience.I'd seen a number of of the over 1,000 photos posted on Yelp, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order before we stepped in the door. FOOD:Between three of us, we ordered Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Kiki's Burger, and a Black and Green burger. All three were excellent. The high quality meat was cooked properly and was sandwiched in a a slightly greasy bun.  The star here is the flavor combinations they create with their burgers. Wow. You will pay for it (our bill came to around $65), but these were thoughtful, creative, and flavorful burgers. I see now that I should have gone for the more adventurous burgers. I can get blue cheese on a burger anywhere. Where else can I get Lup Cheong Sausage or Japanese eggplant on a burger?  Other places might have some of the same ingredients on their burgers, but I cannot imagine them doing it with as much style and creativity as the folks at BB are. I had a well crafted burger. If I'm going to pay more than $7 for a burger, I need something beyond what a Bobby flay recipe can offer me. I need an experience!They prepare their onion rings they way I like them: sliced thin with a light batter. I didn't dare ask for ranch and betray my lack of sophistication whilst eating my $14 burger. But that is the only thing that would have made the onion rings better.We also had fries, a house made soda (the Lychee was entirely too sweet), and the red velvet shake. Hubby fell in love with the creamy shake. SERVICE: Our server was a professional. This was a busy night and he (like all of the wait staff) was taking orders, serving, and busing. With all of that, he never let our drinks get too low and he checked on us a number of times during the meal. There was a gentlemen there who seemed to be a manager who was keeping an eye on the speed of service and the table turnover. I like seeing that level of care given to providing efficient service. AMBIANCE: Meh. The decor was nice, but there was a large party hanging out a the bar area and they created  tremendous amount of noise. But it's a burger joint. A little noise isn't the end of the world. OVERALL: The food was outstanding. I feel like I am ruined for other burgers. I cannot wait to return. Service: 5Food: 5REVIEW #50!WOW. Just wow. I don't remember the last time I was so impressed and happy with a burger. I opted for the Ronin burger, my friend got the Miyagi burger and we split it so I can have the best of both worlds. I would get the Miyagi burger! Burgers are similar because they both have a fried egg, onion but the Miyagi burger's crispy onion rings and furikake compliments the burger well giving it more of a Japanese flavor. Also tried their house made sodas. SO good. Omg. I have never had something like that. It was a little fizzy and tasted so fresh. I got the Apple & Lychee. Refreshing, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. There's nothing like that here in LA :'( Oxtail fries, on the other hand, didn't really win me over. Yeah they were good but you honestly can't really tell it's oxtail. Just tasted like shredded meat to me. Truffle fries are good though and the sun dried tomato aioli is really yummy. Truffle fries are half the cost of oxtail so I'd say skip the oxtail and just get the truffle fries. Truly wowed by this place. I will most definitely come back next time I come to Vegas.I can't tell you how many times Guy Frieri has let me down.  Almost every Triple D location I've been to has been less than ordinary.  However, Bachi surprised me with their delicious flavors and Asian influenced burgers!  They use high quality ingredients, but everything is entirely affordable...especially n Vegas! I went twice on the same trip.---The Food-----I tried the Ronin Burger (medium rare---$10) which had 30 day aged Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing!!! (dipping sauce regularly found in Shabu shabu), fried egg, katsu bbq, and a citrus aioli.)  The meat which is super tender, thanks to their "bachi" style of grilling and the combination of flavors are sensational.Another item you MUST get is their ox tail chili cheese fries ($12) which is in a different class all by itself.  Supreme layering of tastes that is indescribable.  I'm a lover of chili cheese fries too, and don't hand out these recommendations willy nilly.  I would not mind ordering this as my meal one of these days.Their oxtail chili cheese Bachi dog is delicious as well! But the size could be better for ($10)My burger quest to find the best has stopped at Standing Room in Redondo Beach, but this place comes a close second...which is why it gets 4 stars.Bachi has three different locations in Vegas and the next time I go to Sin City, I'll be sinful and order more of their burgers! I encourage you to do the same! Extra NotesTakes Credit CardLong Wait...expect a 20-25 minute wait every timeBeautiful oriental decorGreat ServiceClean restaurant and restroomsMany TVs Small parking lotBachi, in Japanese has two meanings:           1) its short for Hibachi which is a Japanese style of grilling.            2) Its a word which means to treat others the way you want to be treated.I FINALLY got the opportunity to check this place out!!!  As a passionate Yelper, I don't know why it took me sooo long to visit a place with over 1000 reviews with an overall rating of 4 stars.  To me, that sounds like a GREAT place.  A good friend called me to go to dinner and this place was a great choice.  I was stoked!When we arrived, I found out the wait was 35-40 minutes which didn't bother me because it told me this place was popular.  The waiting area was a little small with not a lot of seating.  I was relieved to see that the employees were really quick about cleaning off tables once diners left so we weren't waiting very long.  Our party saw an area at the bar and decided to just sit there.  Total wait time, around 15 minutes :)The place is a nice, quaint venue.  You have the exposed air ducts and lighting.  The walls were painted grey to look like concrete walls.  The overall feeling was a warehouse/loft look which ultimately made for a modern feel.  I love it!  The bar top was filled with very comfy stools, dark top with an opaque glass wall with different colors illuminating the bar:  purples, greens and blues.  When we first sat down, the bar top was not clean had a fishy egg smell to it. We ended up asking the hostess to wipe it off. BTW, the hostess, was soo sweet!  From the greeting to the dinner service, she was super attentive and really helped her servers out.  Top notch!  The bar server was also a cool guy.  I think he was definitely in a managerial role, he just had that aura about him.  I felt like he was from Hawaii.  He kept using "brah" when he talked to me, which made it feel like a family place!  Alright, onto the food!We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries for 11.50. I saw this dish featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and NEEDED to try it!  First of all, what an amazing and beautiful dish.  Start off with crispy shoe string fries, chili filled with shredded oxtail meat, topped with a garlic aioli, cilantro, sliced jalapeños and a  fried sunny-side egg. WOW, I'm in heaven.  This dish is savory, little spicy from the chili and jalapeños, packed with flavor. When you get this dish, you must first take a photo for Facebook, then break the egg yolk and mix everything together.  The yolk coats the chili and fries and brings the dish to a whole new level!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish :)For our main course, we decided to get two different burgers, cut them in half and share them, so we could asses more than just one!  The first burger was the Ronin burger for $11. This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli.  This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight.  The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there's that.  The sauces really brought the dish together.  SOOO Good!  The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11.  This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef.  What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms:  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii.  The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli.  What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!!  Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade.  This burger is packed with different textures:  crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms.  The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it!  All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy.  Soo good!So I know my review was super long.  If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I'm hoping that you're mouth is watering like a faucet.  You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food.  This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it.  So what are you waiting for??  They're open late!!Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.Unique. Fantastic! Loved it!  We had a great lunch here after trying it for the first time.  It was around 2pm when we walked in and there was about a 10 minute wait.  I thought it would be an off time coming in but they were busy!  It must be a winner!We decided to try a few different burgers and split them so we could taste a couple different things on the menu.  Our choices were the Kiki Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. ~ the Kiki Burger had a fabulous blend of sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon and garlic chili aioli.  The flavorful bacon really stood out.  The buttery soft bun complimented this so perfect. The angus beef was absolutely cooked to perfection.  This burger is an A+!~the Spicy Miso burger was also such a delectable, mouth watering treat for my taste buds!  The unique combination of pepper mayo, onion, cheese and apple vinaigrette sent my world spinning!  Not to mention that they inserted a fried egg in between all of the other yummy ingredients.  WOW!! On the side we went with the Truffle Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries.  OH YEAH! They were crispy, full of flavor and served with a delicious dipping sauce.  This was great to change it up from the usual ketchup.   The truffle sauce gave the fries a different yet fabulous flavor with a hint of garlic taste.  Score!  The Sweet potato fries were just as delicious.  They were crispy and perfect with their chosen dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what this was but I was in heaven! I can't write this review without mentioning the phenomenal service they provided!  Our waitress was attentive, so friendly and courteous! She even asked us if we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me this!  That's amazing to me!  Plus they had others walking around with water pitchers to refill our glasses even when they weren't even half gone!  All restaurants should do this! Why did I wait to long to try Bachi Burger? Now that I know how delicious their food is, I hope not to wait so long for my second visit.  If you want a different flare of a burger flavor...  this is definitely the place to go!   Can you tell I loved it?Disappointed seeing grown men argue and the mistreatment of employees!I was initially excited to watch the 3D episode talking about this spot and the same feeling followed me as I was on my way to the spot too but after I parked the car and was seated within 4 minutes flat it all came to a screeching halt! - I visited the spot with 2 others in which they also saw what I saw and felt awkward for being our first visit and after viewing the same episode on TV. together and venturing from Los Angeles.Here is the stressed out drama that we encountered.We arrived, greeted, seated, handed the menu, offered choices all going smooth with a smile from our server. Our server was "Lisa" she was very nice, very intoned with us and very affected by the experience we and many others were forced to watch while sitting in front of the kitchen/podium area, after placing our order for the same dishes that Guy Fieri featured on 3D we had our beer served up and then boom! "The Stressed Out Drama" - While sipping on our beer we encountered a tall Caucasian cook yelling at another gentlemen on the opposite side about doing their job right but what struck us as weird was watching one of them being handled to a back room because it started to get loud and some cuss words. We later found out that the people involved were the actual owners/partners of the spot, very disappointing to experience for being our first time.After the experience we all decided to leave but your waitress, Lisa talked us down and asked us to stay and apologized for the experience and in seconds brought over our order, and although she seemed bothered about what had happened with them she still gave a wonderful smile.I gave your location a two stars and these are the reasons why:Yes, you have a wonderful The "Banh-Mi" Burger, wonderful Truffle Parmesan Fries w/ Sundried Tomato Aioli & Drizzled Porcini Cream Sauce and a knock out Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Hoisin BBQ Sauce, would've been better with a Blue Moon beer but you were out that day but all in all, the food was phenomenal, hands down!I gave you the second star because of your server Lisa, she shined like a star 100% when you couldn't.NOTE: to the Owners/Managersmy tiny group and I agree that although you have problems no matter how big, never! bring them to the spot and especially never! demonstrate to your patrons how negative, ignorant and disrespectful you can be towards one another and your employees not to mention the children present. You guys have wonderful food, don't taint it by your actions.I hate doing reviews like this because I know you work hard to be top restaurant in your genre - I attempted to speak with you face to face but that went unanswered. Good Luck in your future ventures.I guess I don't get it?Everything was wholly average. Burgers, service, prices--average. I ordered Kiki's burger--average. Some bites were overly sweet, but the mushrooms added a good savory touch. I had the garlic fries--average. They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.Also, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.I'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit.We went twice in two days, so...yeah. Somehow, my mom conned me into sharing with her both nights so that she could order wimpy non-burgers and feel cute and semi-virtuous while chomping down on half of my tasty meat creations.Visit #1 Miyagi-san Burger - Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Onion Rings - I love all these things, especially egg, on my burgers. Yes, I love egg even more than bacon. Everything together was...well, it's turning my mouth on just thinking about it. So good. So very, very good.Peking Duck Buns - Ordered without cilantro - The egg was a nice touch, but  eh, give me real peking duck at a Chinese restaurant.Truffle Parmesan Fries - Love the black truffle porcini cream. I could do without the sun dried tomato aioli, though. Just give my heathen self regular ketchup.Going again the next night was actually not my idea, but I had no objections.Visit #2Kiki's Burger - Shiitake, Enoki, & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere, Garlic Chili Aioli - I love mushrooms and cheese, so I thought I might like this more than the Miyagi-san. It was fantastic, but the Miyagi-san was way better.Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Again, ordered without cilantro - Honestly, I know it's trendy, but I am just not into ordering these Chinese bun items at restaurants. I can slap this together at home in about 30 seconds. Exactly like the duck buns but with pork (duh). If you live in a place where you can't get Chinese pork belly I guess this would be exciting.Salted Caramel Shake - I had sort of wanted to have this the night before and decided the second visit was a sign for me to get it. It was very good but unsurprisingly very heavy. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered this. It was overkill.More Truffle Parmesan Fries!Because we went pretty late at night, there was no wait. Service was okay. In my crosshairs for future visits are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (several eaters needed) and Shogun Burger (Foie Gras my love!). Highly recommended.I've been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I've been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it's anti-climactic. Not today, Not here. You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. Here's the rundown:Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call "Umami" if not I have a word for it "Delicious!!" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a Béarnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that béarnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good. Usually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal. 5 Star PlusI'll definitely be back.The wait can be ridiculous but  I always get VIP treatment and not have to wait EVER. Unlimited iced matcha green tea and cherry yuzu soda, FTW! They have specials: crab dip and manga burger. Some make it to the regular menu, some don't. My faves include: shogun burger, miyagi san burger, Kiki's burger, steamed buns (pork belly or duck), sausage and truffle parmesan fries.Shogun Burger:Wagyu Beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear,  miso butter  and Yamamomo peach on the side. It's very rich and fatty but oh, so delicious! It's worth the $26! 5/5Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns/ Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Duck Breast, cilantro, scallions,  radish,  boiled egg, Hoisin BBQ sauce. The buns are fluffy and the duck skin is nice and crisp, the duck meat is tender and juicy. Pork Belly is fatty good. 5/5Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage:Sausages with a side of honey mustard. A great appetizer. 5/5Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:With garlic aioli  and fried egg on top. The chili itself is a bit sweet for my taste. Not my favorite thing on their menu but it's still good and worth a try. 4/5Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries:Sprinkled with Maui onion sea salt  and garlic chili aioli on the side. The dipping sauce is good, the fries are ok. 3/5Truffle Parmesan Fries:Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. This is one of my favorite fries in Vegas/Henderson. Very tasty! 5/5Ronin Burger:Angus beef with caramelized onions, coleslaw,  miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and  yuzu aioli. Refreshing because of the yuzu and rich beacause of the egg. 5/5Kiki's Burger:Angus Beef  with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade,  Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger:Wagyu beef with chili mayo,  fried egg,  furikake, caramelized bacon,  fried onion rings. This and the Shogun burger are the best burgers on their menu. It's a thich burger so you have to cut it in half and press it down just so it would fit in your mouth. 5/5Beware of the service here on weekends. Yes, you drove your asses all the way over here and now there's a 45-75 min wait. But you know what? The food is amazing and they know it. And they will use that to their advantage.The hostess really knows how to make your experience a shitty one. No smiles, very stern voice, and absolutely no common sense. We had to wait next to an empty table for 4 for about 30 min while she was "building a table" for a bigger party. There was no, "Sorry for the wait" or "Thanks for your patience". But once you get past her incompetence, it's smooth sailing from there.Food is great, you MUST order the oxtail chili fries. That is the only reason I will put up with the crappy hostess. I've tried most of the burgers and they have all been mouth watering. The best part is that each burger will come with their own little surprise that will have you asking, "Excuse me, what is this, and what is it for?" You'll understand when you see it.Gourmet burgers? Heck yes! Thanks Smitcha B. for this recommendation on our weekend trip to Las Vegas. First off, you will have to wait for a table. They're always packed here but for very good reasons: Asian fusion gourmet $10 burgers. Worth it when you're visiting Las Vegas or live out there. Plentiful appetizers: Oxtail chili fries (delish), roasted duck Chinese rolls (Bao), yes please. Gourmet burgers? I don't remember the name of my burger but I think I scarfed it down in a matter of minutes (it was that good). They also have good beers and service here. This location off of Windmill is about 5-10 south of the Strip (I-15S).Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.  We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g  - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the décor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?I have a confession to make....I ended up here because of Guy Fieri...I think that automatically makes me a douchebag and I ask your forgiveness.Finished off our quick 2 days in vegas with a trip to Bachi burger before driving back to my beloved city of angels.  45 minute wait on a Friday afternoon...could have been worse.  In terms of service...they must have been having a bad day...because it was gawdawful...I was mildly annoyed when I saw other diners getting ALL of their food even though we were seated before them..and we sat there with nothing...the wife was furious..staff was semi apologetic at least.  Anywho, on to the food.OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIEShttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtgQuite simply amazing.  These are 5 star chili cheese fries...ridiculously over the top oxtail chili topped with cheese, jalapenos, cilantro and chopped scallions, garlic aioli and a fried egg.  Delicious Insanity.MR. MIYAGI BURGERhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Y6ftK1iLFQuSN5gC0VF2-wIncredible burger!  Chili Mayo Fried Egg FurikakeCaramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings...I made the wife uncomfortable with the moans of pleasure emanating from my food hole.CLOSEUPhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Dnd1xg9xjuwD5C2MD6xG_Ayes.I don't care how big of a douchebag Guy Fieri is....if the food is this damn good....consider me an honorary douchebag for life.One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!It was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.Service was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,The menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.For starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!Onion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!Kids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!I had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy Not a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno.Much better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime VinaigretteBasically 3 veggie burgers in one.The breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!There was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!My husband had the The "Banh-Mi" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. Portions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.Can't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!Admittedly being a newbie to fancy schmancy fusion burger spots Bachi really blew my mind.  It was packed but we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  The service was very friendly and the place looks cool.  As far as the burgers, they were a knock out for me!  I had the Bahn Mi.  It was a straight out phó style burger with pickled carrot, veggies, jalapeno and fresh lush basil.  You dip this one in sweet phó sauce.  Very good.  4/5There was the KiKi which had mushrooms bacon and looked good.  This was lil'bro's so I didn't try it.The best one was the Miyagi burger.  With fried onions, fried egg a chimichuri/dijon sauce and a wagyu burger.  My it was a masterpiece of a burger. 5/5The Truffle Fries had a Vietnamese type of truffle peanut butter drizzle and a straight garlic truffle drizzle between.  With a special aioli. It could only be better with actual truffle specks. 4.5/5All the burgers were on a bun similar to a larger soft sticky bun.  Service and food make this worthy of 5 stars for me.Thanks mucho to Careline V. an awesome friend and amazing Yelpie for recommending I try Bachi while I'm in LV. Place was packed although my friend and I were able to be seated straight away. Nice comfortable atmosphere with one TV. Place is clean and to my eyes looks pretty new. Somewhat hidden in an unassuming strip mall. Food is anything but. The flavors in the burger I had which was the Kiki smack you right in the face. So juicy and tender. Bun is very soft and warm. Although a good size did not feel stuffed or sluggish after I was done. Ordered a side of fries. Although I wanted to try the Ox tail which Jennifer C. mentioned to me. Next time ;-) To drink I got the Burton Baton by my favorite Brewery Dogfish Head. Service was excellent! A must stop off the Vegas strip!OMG!!! When is the LA/Sawtelle location going to open!?!?!?!?! I can't just conveniently drive to Las Vegas whenever I'm craving The Miyagi every week. You guys are my top 3 for burgers. For Asian foodies or foodies that like Asian food and/or burgers, then Bachi is a must try!! The hype doesn't die down here. Everything is good, every burger is a different flavor profile, and you can even create your own burger!The Miyagi is my favorite. I love fried egg anything, furikake has amazing sweet & salty flavors, and the crunchy texture from the onion rings makes it a winner every single time! Plus the wagyu beef patty. ooooooooooomahgaaaaaaaawd!!!! drooling & FEIGNING FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Paired with truffle fries, or ox tail fries, or plain fries...perfectly crispy every time. I'm hungry.One of the BEST burger joints I've been to! Shoutout to Guy Fieri and Triple D for the recommendation! Service was really good and our waiter was really helpful. I already knew what to order coming to this restaurant after seeing their episode on the Food Network, but our waiter told us his recommendations. Ordered the bahn mi burger, truffle fries, and red velvet milkshake. It didn't take that long for the food to comeout and once it did everything looked absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was on point and very creative. The burger was super good! It had the whole bahn mi aspect to it with the flavors/ingredients and the burger was really juicy.  The truffle fries were piping hot, crispy, and the truffle sauce took the fries to another level. Lastly, the red velvet milkshake was the BOMB and it was literally a red velvet cake in a milkshake form.I highly recommend this place whenever you're in Vegas and a heads up, they have two locations out there. They're opening one in the West Los Angeles area and I certainly can't wait for that!After seeing this place featured in Food Network's Triple D, it's been something I've always wanted to try in Vegas. There's never enough time when visiting Sin City but we made sure this time Bachi Burger was on our itinerary. Hopping on over here after a show off the strip, their closing time at 1am was perfectly convenient. OXTAIL CHILI FRIES ($11.50) is a must-order. Most poutine fries I've had other than in Montreal tend to get soggy from all the gravy, but not here. I also love that it's not thick-cut resulting to a most-welcomed crunch on each bite. With beans and shreds of oxtail meat in the chili sauce, topped with garlic aioli, plus cheese and jalapenos, each component delivered its purpose. Let's not forget the cilantro which is my favorite part as it added a clean and distinct finish to the flavor profile. This was the bomb.com!  RONIN WAGYU BURGER ($16) normally comes with Angus beef patty but you can request for Wagyu meat for extra $$. I suggest you go this route because I tell you, it makes a huuuuuge difference. One bite and the unmistakable taste I got instantly was from the high grade beef. It had a nice smoky char-grilled flavor that was oozing with all its juicy splendor! WOW! The caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, and katsu bbq all fused well together into this phenomenal finished product. I really love everything about this burger including the bun! Not sure if you need the yuzu citrus aioli on the side because it's already flavorful as it is. KIKIS BURGER ($12) is Angus beef patty with sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. After having the wagyu beef patty with my Ronin burger, it was hard not to spot the difference between the two. The former was definitely more delicious however, let's not forget this burger had bacon and everyone knows anything with bacon is good. When in doubt, stick with the Ronin. CHILI FRIED CHICKEN ($7) was good but just not the flavor I was looking for. I was hoping it was more like a Korean chili chicken with a sweet glaze, instead, this was more tangy and on the citrusy side. Packed most of it home and ate it the next day. Surprisingly, it tasted better.Our server was on top of things and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I mean who doesn't like talking to people who knows what they're talking about? The rest of the staff was friendly and in a genuine way. Can't complain! So happy Bachi Burger has now opened its doors in LA. Soon OC, I hope!4 1/2 Stars. I was pressed for time since I needed to return a rental car and catch a plane. This southeast Bachi Burger location worked out conveniently and parking was easy to find since it's located at a strip center that  provided plenty of parking.Since I had a late breakfast, I wasn't real hungry and opted for just the Kiki's burger - Angus beef, shiitake & eryngii mushrooms, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese and garlic chili aioli. The burger was perfection - cooked medium but still juicy. The bacon along with the mushrooms and aioli on the side was unusual but absolutely yummy. Service from my waitress was friendy and spot on!Overall, I was impressed with my experience with Bachi Burger and I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other items on the menu!My friend from Vegas said, "If you only eat at one place in Vegas, it's got to be Bachi Burger!"Kalbi burger - nice moist meat. The flavor was reminiscent of Korean BBQ especially with the kimchi. Nice touch. Oxtail fries - yum! What a great idea.  I especially love the over easy egg on top. Truffle fries - if you don't order this, you're not missing much. It was just ok.Garlic fries - a lot better than the truffle fries, but alas, not that great.Red velvet milkshake - if you like red velvet cake, this is a must try.  Vietnamese iced coffee - umm...this was just regular iced coffee. This was not strong coffee from a French press with condensed milk. Nope. Nope. Nope!Service - ever time I've gone, the service has been friendly and they've Bon on top of soda/water refills.I've come here twice, and loved both visits! I'm so happy that we have Bachi Burger in So Cal now, although I haven't had a chance to visit the new locations yet. I really enjoy Asian fushion bar food, so I had this place on my food wish list for a long time before my first visit here. Since this place is super popular, try to come for an early lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd. You must order the oxtail chili cheese fries, this dish is perfect to share and is absolute perfection. I love oxtail, cheese, fries and fried eggs so this dish has my name written all over it! Get this, or you'll definitely regret it! For burgers, I've tried the Ronin, Miyagi-San, and Spicy Miso. My fave was the Spicy Miso. I enjoyed the others but found the Miyagi-San to be a bit too dry. I usually order my burgers well done, but I get them med well here so it won't be so dry. Don't forget to order a delicious beer to wash all this yummy goodness down, they have a nice selection. Awesome place, and I always try to come here when I'm in Vegas! Can't wait to visit the new locations in So Cal! :)Ok it's about time I update my 2 star rating I gave them years ago. Being that I've been here and to the other locations a bunch of times.Bachi Burger oh yeah I'm a fan of their burgers, not all of them, but enjoy most of them. Their kalbi burger is right now my #1 favorite at Bachi Burger. It's a little messy to eat, with sauce can go running down your arms while eating it if your not paying attention but I can never turn it down. Kalbi in a burger how awesome tasting does that sound. Well its more like a burger with kalbi sauce and kim chi but if it was kalbi short ribs it would be really awesome. Hope someone makes that somewhere soon. Always the kalbi is delicious. Sometime I eat it so fast, cause its messy, that I'm done before everyone else and I'm like do I order another one.As always they have their oxtail chilli cheese fries which are excellent to share in a group. Their various burgers, spicy miso not spicy but tasty you should ask for some hot sauce. Not a fan of their truffle fries. You can also order their ramens, was gonna try it but again can never turn down an opportunity to eat the kalbi burger. Customers service at most times are good but sometimes when their too busy it seems like their overwhelmed, you no the usual. Definitely be back I'll try not to order the kalbi or spicy miso burger cause need to try something else but no guarantees.I have now been to all 3 Bachi Burger locations.  This one is my favorite.  Seemed much more roomier they the other 2 locations.  The Summerlin location is always too busy and the wait can be atrocious so I avoid it.  What I have found during my Bachi Burger tour is that they are very consistent.  I am a big fan of the Ronin and Miyagisan Burgers and no matter which location I have had them they are always the treat I expect them to be.      I usually end up at Bachi Burger due to friends being in town and hearing about this Vegas treat form Triple D or from Yahoo's beat burgers in the US by state.  I am never upset when asked to meet up at Bachi's.  My friends quickly become jealous of the fact I can have Bachi anytime I want.     The service at this location was better then the other 2.  The Summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed.  The Burger was exceptional and unlike any other Burger I have had.  Unique and delicious.  The Ox Tail fries were a treat as always and one order was shared by 3 of us.  it was plenty and we were glad we only ordered one.     Their prices are on the high side but considering the quality and the uniqueness of their burgers it is well worth splurging on.  I am looking forward to another visit soon :)This was my first visit and will definitely not be last. Came out here for the weekend and I yelped this place at the last min. Reviews do not lie! This place is delicious and unique. The asian fusion that the burger had left a memorable taste. I ordered the Miyagi-San's Burger...was totally blown away by the flavors. I didn't really know what furikake or wagyu beef was but damn...I'm sure those were the main flavors. They gave it an asian fusion twist to it. The patty was so juicy...perfect! It was a bit pricey but I didn't mind that. I would pay that price again. I'm coming back here when I visit Vegas again to try their specialty fries!Bachi is short for Hibachi - Japanese type of grill. Bachi itself means karma.Ordered:- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11- Kalbi Burger $11- Miyagi-San's Burger $15Tina's Treasures and Tribulations- We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened and the place was pretty packed with people waiting and tables full - Only waited a good 6-7 minutes to be seated- This place is definitely an Asian fusion of foods and burgers- So of course my friend and I yelped this place before we ordered to see what was the MUST order items- The oxtail chili cheese fries were good, but a con would be that it has to be eaten right away or the fries get super soggy. It was really good and I'm not even into beans as much as a normal person would love it. Garlic aioli sauce was on point!- The Kalbi burger was taste and different with the kimchi and ko chu jang mayo that was in it. The angus beef was on point so freaking good. For the price, I would say it's worth it. - We went to Shake Shack the day before and I don't think they compare at all. This place definitely takes the lead for creativity- The Miyagi-San's wagyu burger wasn't as great as the kalbi. I think the wagyu beef seemed a little undercooked, but we did ask for it to be medium rare - it fell apart as soon as we cut it in half. It wasn't melt in your mouth good. It was flavorful and juicy & the onion rings gave it a crunch that I loved. That egg though!- Friend and I decided to order two burgers and share that. Obviously, we are like two little girls who cannot eat as much as a guy can so there were left overs. If you're hungry, I suggest get your own, but I think if you get fries and one burger - you can become full or content- We ended up putting the bread/burger buns aside and ate the meat :)- Will have to come back to try the other options!What a bummer for a burger place - I guess my taste buds weren't in a good mood or something.Came around noon on Sunday and it was about a 20 min wait. Ordered the oxtail fries and shogun burger. So..... The oxtail fries were really good when you break up the yolk and mix it all around the fries and meat. Fries were fresh and crispy, egg and meat was good, jalapeños were non pickled and spicy. Ended up finishing this big plate of yumminess.The shogun burger on the other hand... basically just sucked.. So much that I took 2 bites and pushed it aside. When I picked up my burger, my patty literally fell apart in pieces so I ended up eating a couple pieces with my fork. The ratio to my bun was really off too. I had this decently sized (but not as huge of a patty like other folks) patty and not a lot of the other ingredients. The pear was a nice touch to the burger but there was so little of it that it was gone within my 2 bites. The pickled plum on the side didn't help the burger at all so what was the point of that?Another thing that turned me off was when I asked my server what he'd recommend and his response was "well, we have to push the shogun because of the price...." Wow thanks pal! All together it was ~ $40. Disappointed to say the least.This should have been an update from a previous review that I did, like 4 years ago. I don't know where that review went, for some unknown reason, it was deleted. I think it was about the chicken wings, and that I only gave them 3 stars or something. I've been back here many times since then, and this place is steadily a very good place to munch on a burger. Or anything else that comes to mind.I recently came back here, after a couple of years, on a whim. I don't know why but for some reason, I feel like I should come back here once in a while. They say that Bachi was inspired by Umami Burger in LA. That could be true or not. But, Bachi is one of those few follow-ups which is better than the original.I've tried pretty much the entire menu here. Burger-wise, I am one of the few that believe that their Angus is better than their Wagyu. If both meats are temp'd at medium rare, I think their Angus is much more juicier and tender then the Wagyu. Call me crazy. Or call me, maybe.Still, to this day, I haven't tried their oxtail fries. Or maybe I did. If I did, then I think it tasted pretty good. If I haven't, then I couldn't tell you. Also, they are now connected to Shoku Ramen, so you can get ramen if you don't want a burger. Which is fine, I guess.I'll probably be back. For some reason, I still get a little irked when I see that I've paid $25 (including tax and tip) for a burger, fries, and Coke. But, i'll get over it. Maybe.

Clean and stylish decor, attentive and eager staff, and tasty and affordable food.  All important hallmarks in the Quick Casual category.  The orange chicken was a noticeable step up from the Panda offering with the chicken being well balanced in terms of sweet and savory.If I was an ASU student living downtown this would be a regular in my dining rotation.  Well done.Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food.I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu. From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean. Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing)It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings. My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P                 |                 |  /                 | /   . .~^(,&|/o.

The wifi password says it all. "thankyou". They mean it with all their heart. Every time I've walked in the door they are just so kind. Amazingly sweet. Coffee, smoothies await you. As do a short list of sandwiches and paninis. I'm pleased to report the wifi is lightning quick. There are copious amounts of outlets. And super comfortable couch (dare I say it? :) take a nap on. The walls are lined with that is for sale.If you need a cup of coffee at 6am - this is the place to be![Update}Reporting live from this joint. The owners clearly have thought this out. A regular cup of joe comes with a free re-fill. So you can pop-in, get your to-go cup, get your nails done and then (!) get another cup of coffee. So I moved from a mango smoothie (which you should try) to a vanilla latte. The Phoenix weather is a tad chilly for my sandal clad feet. (I was enticed by the $1 off check-in deal on Yelp.)My God. They know how to do it here. I think the biggest challenge the owners might encounter would be folks like me. I'd never leave :) Stacks of magazines, newspapers and music fill the space. It is easy to have a meeting here. Eye balling the dog treat jar labeled "Woof!" they must be dog friendly too.  Love it.*sigh*

Review Text :
Called in our order at 12:35 for pick up. They told us it'll be ready in 18 minutes. We arrived at 1:08 & paid for the food. We waited and waited and still no food. We never really had an issue with Wing Stop before. Usually when we call in our order, we arrive & everything is ready to go. At 1:24 we asked why we don't have our food yet & it's been almost an hour since it was called in. The lady went in the back and got our food order. Apparently it was sitting there the whole time. WOW. No apologies or anything. Didn't give them 1 star because the food never disappoints. Wish I could say the same for the staff today.I don't care for too many chain places however, when it comes to my niece and nephew, I'd eat fast food for them. Or in this case, Wingstop. During my annual trek to Las Vegas to be with family during the holidays last year (last month), the kids chose Wingstop for dinner. So, I place the phone order and I have to repeat myself a few times. I really don't understand why places that take phone orders don't assign someone who has better than average communication skills. This doesn't mean just speaking, but listening too. Anyway, I arrive and of course, my order is wrong but I'm told not to worry, because they'll be able to correct it right away. Well, I'm sure you know what that really meant. After a while of waiting, I'm off with the to go order back to eat. I'm actually enjoying the smell of the hot sauce in my car on the drive back to the house and for the several days afterwards. Whoever packaged the wings, did a piss poor job. I'm glad it was at least an odor I can live with however, it took a little bit of work to get the stains out of my front passenger seat. As for the food - I didn't get sick however, the wings were dry and without sauce, void of flavor. I ordered a forty piece however, the fry order was enough for maybe two people. Same for the veggies. And for the amount of wings and veggies, two little cups of dipping sauce! So, the food wasn't disgusting, just not very good. Just didn't care for the service and the lack of taste with the wings. But, at least the niece and nephew were happy.

12/21/10Came in w/ Mom and a coworker, and we sat at the counter.  We've heard that select sushi rolls were 1/2 off during happy hour (3p-7p) Mondays through Fridays, but we saw nothing on the short menu that we wanted to try.  I decided to order the BBQ bacon burger and a seaweed salad, while Mom and coworker ordered seaweed salads and a rainbow roll to share.Have you ever tried a seaweed salad before?  We have, and we've had them from many Japanese/sushi restaurants, but never have we seen them served w/ carrots and cucumbers before.  Until now.  We've also never seen them WITHOUT sesame seeds.  Let's hope that this was a fluke, or else I'd question the quality of sushi that this kitchen produces.  Needless to say, the seaweed salads weren't good- I took one bite and decided to pass on the salad and waited for my burger to arrive.  The other two removed the non-authentic items and ate the seaweed, even though they also didn't particularly care for them.  The rainbow sushi that came after looked very dry, so I didn't even sample it.  Mom and coworker both remarked that it was tasteless and dry.Thank goodness that the burger entree was delicious!  I ordered it with BBQ sauce on the side, and to be honest, I didn't miss it.  The patty was thick and juicy, and I appreciated the crispy thick-sliced applewood-smoked bacon.  I don't know which I liked better, the burger or the seasoned wedge fries.  These reminded me sour cream & onion potato chips- yum!I may go back and give happy hour sushi another try, but I wouldn't mind having more of those fries!Was at Talking Stick Casino and Resort and had some time to waste so I headed on over the Blue Coyote Café to catch some Happy Hour deals.  Was greeted right away and showed to my table, I also was asked if I would like to sit outside or inside, I preferred inside. Service was great and friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.So after checking out the H H menu I went ahead and ordered an glass of sparkling wine, edamane, spicy salmon & spicy tuna rolls.  Now I don't want to brag, but everything together was under 15 bucks! Hello!!! That's a great deal! The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were fresh and delish! The edamane perfectly steamed and salted.  It was just what I was craving and it didn't damage the pocket book. Maybe next time I'll gather some friends and HH with them.

Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.Blue moon @ happy hour is $2.50. Sold!!! Funny, that coming from a woman who drinks wine alot and is not a true beer lover, but I do love me some blue moon. When I found how cheap it was on happy hour as well as looking over the menu I was sold. Well I must credit the boyfriend as he was the one that said, I want to go there. So off we went. It is a cute little place and I must say I was a little concerned when I pulled up because there were no cars in the parking lot. Hmmm not a good sign I thought. When we walked in, there were a few tables occupied and I was like eh, who cares, we came for the food. Our fabulous and friendly waitress (who's name I cannot remember) :( came over to greet us and take our order. Again I was bouncing off the walls because of the blue moon happy hour special. I mean anywhere else and it is $5 a glass unless you find a rare place that also has it on happy hour. They came served in small mason jar and the BF was like hmmm what the? I can't hold this, its too dainty for me. I swear lol. So on to the food. I ordered the stuffed burger that was essentially two big ass patties stuffed with peppers, mushrooms and bacon. Just greedy!!! BF order the bbq platter that came with brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs and beef ribs. Good lord that was alot of food. I am still amazed that I ate my burger as you really can't take it home to eat it as leftovers and there was no way I was leaving any. BF on the other hand ate all the pulled pork and brisket but couldn't eat any more as the portion was huge so needless to say, I have ribs to eat for dinner later. Score for me. Oh and kicker to this, I happened to check in on YELP and ding, ding, ding, we ended up getting a free dessert! I truly had no room for it and yes I should have saved it but alas we got the strawberry shortcake to top off our gluttony for the night and it was delicious as well. So if you happen to be in North Phx, check out this place. It is cute and small, the waitresses are great, the portions are big. Win-win in my book.

Review Text :
First, a disclaimer.  I haven't dined at Le Beaver Club in many years.  I had heard that the grandeur and glory which was Le Beaver Club had been dismantled in the '80's, but restored in recent years.  The restaurant holds far too significant a place in my personal progression of understanding and appreciating a fine dining experience to go without a review.  Now that things are again right, I'll write my piece.Having just graduated high school, Montreal was where I most wanted to visit for a few days of get away.  The "fancy" dinner for this trip was Le Beaver Club.  An evening which began with some griping about getting dressed up for dinner, ended with my first appreciation of how a truly extraordinary meal had the power to excite my senses, to transport them to places I had never known to exist.  The elegance was apparent in everything which caught my eye, and yet remained approachable to this eighteen year old on his best behavior.  The differences between "eating" and "dining" were suddenly neither semantic nor subtle.  I can't honestly recall what I had for dinner that evening, only that it was an important cog in my first true dining experience.Le Beaver Club was revisited several years later, while on our honeymoon, with the recollection that what was great on the first visit was even better on the second.  A fresh visit will be needed to assess this gem of a restaurant among my adult dining experiences, thus a star is withheld-- for the moment.

It's my first time ordering from the China One near my house.  I ordered delivery from them last night,  Mu Shu Chicken... Not my usual dish from Chinese restaurants,  but I was feeling adventurous. Rice-good, cookie-good, Mu Shu chicken-makes my entire body cringe and convulse! Big ass bug in my meal... Made it to my mouth! I crunched down on this wing thing and it was hard! Big beastly bug!!  Disgusted!!

Review Text :
Okay, so I use to live on a reservation in Washington state. The tribe could smoke a mean salmon, but the local frybread joint left me not a big fan. However, thanks to Groupon and other Yelp reviewers, I got a taste for some. I'm glad I did because this place changed my overall opinion. Pros: For being frybread, it was not greasy at all. There is a variety of choices from vegetarian to desserts. Here is what members of our group had - BBQ beef and cheese frybread, two red chile frybread tacos, a side salad, and sweet frybread with honey and powdered sugar. YUM!Cons: The new location is in a rundown area and located next to a liquor store. Plastic utensils just don't cut it here. I ended up tearing my food apart.  Also, nobody acknowledged us when we came in and sat down. We weren't sure if someone would take our order or if we had to go to the counter because we hadn't been there before.  As long as you go in not expecting anything fancy and over the top, you won't be disappointed. It's a family owned restaurant with faithful customers (we were greeted by one when we accidentally went to their old location). All four of us left full and satisfied with our meals.Scrum diddly! 2 of us ate for $21I had the red chile w cheese-- added the lettuce, sour cream, onion and tomatoes. We split the honey/powdered sugar fry bread. Tons of food! Friendly and quick service. Hard to find, literally right off Stapley in an odd shopping plaza. Don't let that deter you!It is nothing fancy, just yummy food!!

I was headed to Taco Tuesday, after my workout this morning...the traditional Tuesday retox after the detox:)Instead...I ended up "crepe'd" :-)I sprained my ankle playing squash a week or two ago, so unfortunately, no running this morning (or for the past week or two for that matter:(But, I was able to get on the bike and grind it out today, and I was getting "peckish" by the time noon rolled around:)I head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for my rendezvous with a platter of good-'n-greasy tacos, when I remembered that Gabi had mentioned that a new sandwich shop had gone into the space once occupied by the Ice Tango yogurt shop I may have inadvertently killed...(BTW, The Beautiful Carin and I read the article in Inc. and we both agree...Gabi's not a day over 25 and not just compact and bubbly...she's frikkin' adorable:)I decided to give SWC a whirl:)I made a u-turn (which for some reason, seriously confused a covey of cotton topped and henna red-crested snowbirds following me down the street...I was walking and it shouldn't have caused much confusion, but they all scattered like frightened barn swallows when I changed course:)At any rate, SWC is open for business and has been since Saturday:)Terri and her BF have partnered to bring this little space to life and I think they might just make a go of it...not just for the sandwiches (which look good enough to be sure)...but for another feature of the place...crepes:)I was just looking for a sandwich when the crepes reached out and grabbed me and said "sit here and eat hearty"...they said it in French, so it sounded much classier, but that was what they said:)The French was appropriate, because Terri's BF is very French (and not "snooty Parisian, look down his nose" French...He's more "en province', everyone is his friend, can't do enough for you" French:)I was looking at the sandwiches and then at the salads and then at the crepe irons and I said "can you do crepes for lunch?"Terri said "Sure" and I was suddenly very happy:)I was even happier after my egg, goat cheese, basil and tomato crepes...a genuine value for $7.99 and a delightful lunch...warm, soft, savory and filling:)I'll be keeping SWC in the rotation...I may even try a sandwich now and then:-)

Review Text :
Phat Phrank's has been on my 'To Do List' for a very long time.  I had a meeting on the other side of town and had to pass by the Decatur & 215 exit on the way home around lunchtime, so I decided to finally give Phat Phrank's a try.Since I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3NgI went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvngHe chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.After a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.I went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.I'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.Return Factor - 97%Phat Phrank's has quickly become my go-to place to tasty Mexican here in Vegas. It's a family owned place where the food is made with a lot of care and I love that! "Phrank" is always around and smiling and his staff will do all that they can to ensure your satisfaction. At this point I've tried quite a few things... my favorites:*Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, but his are done the way nachos should be! Tons of delicious shredded pork... an order is definitely a meal for 2 people!*Breakfast Burrito - the best breakfast burrito I've had in Vegas, by far! It comes with eggs, yummy crispy potatoes, cheese, and your choice of meat. He mixes everything to ensure every bite is perfect. When I'm having a bad day, I call ahead and pick one up on my way to work!*Fajitas - I have FINALLY found delicious fajitas in Vegas! I had the chicken ones for lunch today and really enjoyed them. The chicken was shredded (as opposed to the creepy pre-cut strips with faux-grill marks you find at say Chili's) and had 3 colors of peppers and onions mixed in. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but this had an amazing amount of flavor. *Churros - caramel and chocolate sauce.. mmmmmmmI can also highly recommend their catering services ! "Phrank" helped us pick out a freaking feast for well under $10 a person. We had platters of enchiladas and tacos, guacamole, and ceviche. Everything was delicious and was ready right on time. We picked it up ourselves, but it was well packaged and transport -ready. Overall, don't let the strip mall exterior fool you - this is Mexican (albeit heavily Americanized) at its best ! It's affordable, fast, and delicious. It's basically like  Roberto's that isn't a chain that serves food that tastes good! The only sad thing is they aren't open on weekends...There's only one word I can think of when it comes to Phat Phrank's. AMAZING.I could leave it as that and have you all wonder or I can let you all know why it's so AMAZING.I've had their fish taco plate, other than the beans and rice sides the fish tacos were AMAZING. By far the best fish tacos I've had anywhere.  The fish were large crispy on the outside tender on the inside pieces, light and not greasy. The combination of all the fish with cabbage, green onion, cilantro, tartar sauce, and in my case lime and their hot sauce was AMAZING. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. I'll be back for you fish tacos.Their carne asada torta was...  Oops sorry for the drool.  Their Carne asada torta was very delicious too. Well I might have reached my quota for using the word amazing but don't worry the carne asada tortas are equally as amazing as the fish tacos. I've seen other tortas that are bulky, bready, and just look good because of the huge size not flavor. Size isn't gigantic and not bready, so every bite was just of everything I wanted, something very tasty. There's probably even more ingredients than bread. I'll be back for you too LOL.I didn't have this but a friend had their enchiladas because it was mentioned in the lvrj as Phat Phrank's signature dish. Now that looked like meal right there. I'm sure it has to be really good too just from what I've already had.  Plus it had a fried egg on it.  Anytime you throw a fried egg on anything it's instantly good.Location is perfect for me, I'm always in the area though honestly I never knew they were there until a UYE. I like the musical instrument on the walls and how it's clean. Seats maybe 20-30 people.Service was very good, friendly. Phrank and the lady that was there often checked on us, refilling drinks, bring food out quickly, conversing with us and making it an experience not like here is your food and now get out when your done. lol. They no longer have raspberry ice tea. Can't wait to go there tomorrow. Wait their not open on the weekends!? This has to be a typo and they close at 6 PM. MAN I can't win.  All good, fresh and delicious food need a break too. AMAZING.Late weekday takeout lunch at 2:30 brought me here after having this place bookmarked for a good 5 months.I was sooo on the fence about getting a breakfast burrito based on Blair B's terrific review and since it was my first meal of the day.  In the end, I went with the carne asada and a couple of carnita tacos.  The carne asada was pretty good but the pork carnitas blew my mind.  Maybe it was due to my hangover that day I was ready to drive back and have a couple of more.  The pork was so juicy and well seasoned that, like a good movie, I didn't want it to end.  Phrank took my order and as everyone else mentions in their reviews was very hospitable.  He was also patient as I was the only one in the restaurant at the time looking at the menu for a while.  So many other things on the menu to try!  I would definitely frequent this place more if not for their hours but that's just the nature of their location.  I will be back for sure.Oh Phrank, I've got the hots for you!My hubby tried Phat Phrank's last week with some coworkers and has been raving about the fish tacos every day since then.  I wanted in on the action, so when he had the opportunity to go out for lunch again, I met him there and had a great lunch.The restaurant itself is in a small strip mall with a couple of other food places.  It is kind of hard to see from the street, so keep that in mind when you venture over here.  Once you find Phrank's, your happy tummy time begins!  You walk in the door and can smell the lovely Tex-Mex aromas swirling around the place.  Your mouth starts watering immediately and you get excited for the food to come.  Yummmm.  Phat Phrank's is a small place though, with about 6 tables.  We got there and there was only 1 table open.  My hubby grabbed it while I waited in the really long line.  Within 2 minutes, the line was actually out of the door with people waiting.  Luckily the line moves pretty fast.  The food also comes out pretty quickly too, so there is a nice flow to the place.After looking at the menu, I was torn between the carne asada and the pork chili verde plates.  I asked the one and only Phrank, who was working the counter, and he told me to go for the chili verde.  I trusted him and went with the verde.  Boy, was I happy with my choice!  The pork chili verde was so tender and tasty.  It had so many layers of flavor that it made you eat slowly to savor each bite.  Delish!My hubby went for the fish tacos again.  He is addicted to fish tacos and gets them everywhere we go.  He says these are the best in town, hands down.  He really has tried dozens and dozens, so I trust him on fish tacos.  I was going to try a bite, but by the time I asked for one, he had already devoured them.  You snooze you lose, I guess.The hot sauce here is really great good too.  I recommend the hot hot sauce.  It is super flavorful without being completely mouth burning.  It has some great depth to it and I had to ask for a second serving because it was that good!The plates came with the main entree, as well as refried beans, Mexican rice, and homemade tortillas.  Now no one tell my Grandma, but the beans and tortillas were better than hers!  I have NEVER said that before because hers are the best of the best!  The beans from Phrank's were simply perfect and I could have eaten a whole pot of them them.  The flour tortillas tasted just like my grandma's homemade ones.    The tortillas were just AWESOME.  If you have never had a homemade tortilla, you are missing out.  Luckily you can go to Phrank's and get some right now!

Review Text :
This is Westgate, so ample security is to be expected. But when I approached the entrance on a happenin' Saturday night, this was taken to new heights. The guy was nice enough when scrutinizing my ID, but then he said "Hey...look up and to your right". It was pretty confusing, until I spied a little camera that took my mugshot before I could ask what the point was."We have to photograph anyone who's under 25", he said. Not his fault, and he wasn't being a douche, but this is some 1984 shit that made me feel unwelcome.OK, done ranting, this bar is tons of fun once you make it inside. Huge tables to chill out and get sloshed with large groups. Drinks are the usual Westgate price, but unlike a couple of other bars, they are made RIGHT. I guess they didn't just hire their bartenders for their boob jobs and bleached hair. My 'chocolate cake' shot was the most delicious $8 I've ever spent.The crowd is nice, and who could forget the mechanical bull? It's the main attraction of this bar; you can come watch all the sluts from Scottsdale show how they ride. Win.The most innovative part of this bar is what happens after last call. The blaring music stops, and the kitchen reopens, reverting back to a restaurant until 3:30. I'm wary of all Westgate food, but I have to admit it's a pretty badass idea.3.5 stars rounded down for that mugshot. I'll become a true fan if their food turns out tasty.Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review... Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKEDPro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them. If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.

My last visit I decided to stay in and eat. While I was eating my nachos, the girl starts sweeping the floors, started in the bathroom and is headed towards me. I see stuff start flying in the air, I'm thinking "she's not gonna come sweep that towards me" well she did. I see fuzz, dirt and whatever else fly in the air around my food. I glared at her, got up and threw my nachos in the trash. Thanks for crop dusting my nachos with dirt you idiot.Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a "Chicken Taco" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The "Rolled Tacos" and "Carne Asada Fries" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff! They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays.It's Roberto's. They have locations all over in different states and most people know Roberto's is the place to eat when it's late at night and you are desperate for food. Each location is hot or miss as far as consistency goes. This location is apart of a gas station but you walk up to the window from outside. The portion size here is great. A lot of the menu items can easily be shared. The Carne Asada Burrito is what I order with just meat and cheese. The tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzly. I saw a huge block of cheese just sitting out on the counter instead of being in a refrigerated space that didn't look right. I realized after this last visit that with all the other food trucks that offer great Mexican food at affordable prices, I really have no need to come to Roberto's as much.Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. 9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager.

LV Yelpers! Lookin' for a pool party?! Liquid @ Aria... is a must do if you're in the area.I came here this past weekend, both Saturday and Sunday (I stayed at Vdara, so it was easy for me to just walk over without catching a taxi).Saturday was great came around 1pm stayed till 6... weather was nice, packed with people and good music. That day, they charged $40 for guys and free for girls... with a $200 minimum per chair... which we wanted 2 chairs... but they could only offer us 1. On a good note, music was great! I danced for 5 hours straight and entertained all of liquid. Left with a lot of fans, lol. On an off note but not surprising, a couple was caught having sex in the pool and got kicked out.Sunday came around 1230pm left at 330pm... weather wasn't great... windy... clouds over sun... there was a little sunshine here and there... but due to the weather, it wasn't as crowded as Saturday. People actually remembered me from the day before... guess I stood out with all that dancin I was doin. That day, they didn't charge cover for guys... but they wanted a $50 minimum per chair and there was 4 of us, so we spent another $200. It was so windy that day that one the lounge beds flew up in the air and almost landed on me! =( Yummm! I don't drink alcohol, so I was all about the food! Good stuff!I had alot of food on their menu:- ahi- shrimp cocktail- club sandwich- coconut shrimp- virgin pina colada- virgin mango daiquiri - they even got us coffee, which wasn't on the menu.$25 for liquid shirts. I love mines!Bathroom is clean.Except to wait 20-30 mins. for your bill.Come here if you don't have a problem dropping $200 (food/drinks) for fun in the sun. Not super packed, so there's room to breath and dance!-1 star for $200 for 1 chair... and not being able to accommodate us with 2 chairs. Paying that much $, they should make it happen!I hope to return one day! Worth checkin out. Mixed crowd.Don't forget your ID!Enjoy my photos =0)Lots of X&O to LIQUID! I miss U!One of the worst experiences of my life. My wife and I were treated like second class citizens. As a guest of the Aria hotel, I expect a little civility when asking a question of a member of the staff. Four bouncers were standing around and when I tried to ask what time the pool opens, is there a charge, is there a waiting list and then I was ignored, and the people behind me were ushered in. It is very simple if someone asks a question answer it. All other experiences I have had at this hotel have been wonderful, the rooms, casino, and food service have all exceeded my expectation. The Liquid Pool Lounge is owned by the Light group who I assume pay a concession to the Aria Hotel (MGM International) in order maintain this facility. Aria, the Liquid Pool Lounge is dimming your stars.As a professor of Hospitality Management in Florida, I will be using this as an example of what not to do.NathanI would have to completely disagree with Nicole B.'s review of Liquid.  Liquid is NOT a wannabe Wet Republic.  The two have very different objectives, and its very apparent.  Wet Republic is 100 times larger than Liquid and is more of that Rowdy, Crazy Party environment.  Liquid is much more relaxed and low-key.  As for the no seating comment, Uhhhh RESERVE A CABANA OR A DAYBED OR A CHAIR, DUH! They are actually quite reasonably priced.On a Saturday, the Lounge chair at Liquid is only $100 and it includes food and drink for up to $100.  The Daybeds were $300 and could comfortably fit 3 people.  What I love about reserving this is that they have little storage containers where you can put all of your belongings, as well as a bucket to keep your champagne, or beers or whatever you drink cool.  The food they serve here is pretty good as well, for poolside.If You are looking for a REHAB, TAO BEACH, or WET REPUBLIC type of atmosphere, this is NOT the place for you!!!  LIQUID is much smaller, but still has a great DJ and relaxed vibe, but still very fun! I will most certainly return and reserve a Daybed because it is WORTH it!  The only negative is that the hours vary and sometimes they close early so make sure you check the hours before coming here.For what it is, Liquid really excels. The problem this "exclusive" pool faces is that there are so many others in Las Vegas to compare it to, and thus people wind up making poor comparisons to things which aren't really alike. If you're planning to come to Liquid because you think it might be similar to the atmosphere at TAO Beach, Encore, Wet Republic, or other similar mega pool parties, then save yourself the money and the subsequent public whining, and just go to those places. I wouldn't quite call this space intimate, because there are still a couple hundred people here on a busy day, but it's definitely smaller in scale and goes for a more luxury appeal (appropriately situated at the high class Aria resort).The main Aria pool complex is pretty huge, so it's no wonder that more people don't try to get into Liquid, but it also explains why the promo ladies are constantly out patrolling with more free passes to get people in. Despite what some of the other reviews might say about "being cute getting you nowhere" here, I saw several ladies getting in for free. We personally got in free along with quite a lot of additional stuff thanks to a friend of ours who works for the company, but I would have rated Liquid the same without all the complimentary stuff.For the particular day I visited Liquid was exactly what I needed, a smaller spot to hang out with my friends on our day bed (which has a nice storage compartment for your belongings as well as multiple ice buckets for champagne, liquor bottles, mixers, and bottled water), listen to some pretty good DJ tunes, quickly add to the lingering buzz from the night before (with extra help from the super expedient service staff), and get a lot of bonus eye candy from the podium dancers. There are several points during the day where the DJ encourages everyone to splash the hell out of the pool though, so just be warned you might get your precious hair wet.While our immediate waitress and pool boy (or whatever these guys are called) were superb in their execution, the door staff did leave most of us with a bitter memory of Liquid. They are completely unnecessarily dickish here and definitely do not offer an inviting atmosphere. At one point Vidal left to get money from the ATM and come right back to tip the employees, only to get flack from one of the bouncers who quizzed him repeatedly before finally allowing him to return. I had the same thing happen to me when I went upstairs to the room to get my sunglasses and returned without my ID (which was poolside). My arm was clearly stamped for re-entry, but he felt the need to give me the cold stare down and accompanying inquiries... sorry mate, I don't budge for anyone, let alone Pool Patrol.Being a girl in Vegas definitely has its perks, one of them being freebies galore.  We (four girls) were let into Liquid free of charge, had free unlimited champagne until 1 p.m., and we were given a daybed.  I'm surprised we got the daybed because it was Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  However, there weren't a bunch of daybed rentals.  There was great music playing, the water was refreshing, and everyone was super friendly.  Naturally we made friends with guys who also had a daybed and were buying drinks, so that amped up the fun.  I went up to the room earlier than the others, but for one girl, it was her favorite part of the whole trip.  T.I. showed up for a little while too!Tip:  If you're a girl, don't get the VIP entry/champagne to Liquid as part of your package when you book at Aria.  We changed our reservation so we got entry instead of two buffets.  Entry was free anyway, as was the champagne.  Get the buffets.One negative: my friend came to the front of the line to get me and she got reprimanded for swearing, which is ridiculous considering everyone had to be 21+ to get in.Stay away!!!They took my credit card and loosed it, they requiring to have it taken when you order more then one drink, later i found out someone actually used it, i won't be surprise if its one of their employees, just worst shady bad experience i have ever had!You got that?? they taking your credit card, it required for getting drinks to you, but they have it somewhere unsecured. When I asked to get it back they didn't find it.When I started to get upset was worst experience ever, just shady answers, made me feel like I did something wrong ***they*** loosed my credit card.they don't care about their customers at all, we asked to speak to a supervisor, when he finally showed up he was so rude we regret we even bother.The biggest problem was they didn't let us go anywhere because we had open check of over $2000, but I wasn't able to pay it because they didn't find my card!!my friends had to figure the check out.Later I found someone charged my card, I bet one of their employees, so I had to contact the credit card company and deal with all this mess after Vegas trip.They don't belong to Aria Resort, when we complained about them to the Aria we been told they are independently owned.We spent there over $2000, it was 6 of us.accept that we had good time before all that happened, but its not worth it, go somewhere who appreciate your business, somewhere who will not try to steal your money .They just don't deserves anyone's business, i will never go back!I had fun here.  I really did.  But the staff is so annoying.We got yelled at three times in a row for having our belongings by the pool.  I understand that they don't want to have liability issues, but I need my sunscreen and I'm not going to be devastated if someone steals it.  Plus, how do you expect me to pay for my drinks if I'm expected to tip the (incredibly rude) bag- guy every time I have to get my money?  He actually said to us "You know, the expected tip is $10".  Umm...no.  And he wants that every time we have to get it?Basically, everyone here needs to chill out.On the other hand, I did have a great time and it's much more laid back than the other pools, but it still has a party vibe.  The pool is a small, but decent size in comparison to some of the others and everyone gets inside to splash and just have fun.

Review Text :
found this new buffet to be average at best.sure it's pretty clean....NOW, but it's new; just give it a few years and i'm sure it'll fall right into line with it's peers.the food had way too many items designed to please the picky american 4 year old.  there was a high greasiness factor to many dishes, and despite what seemed at first glance to be a large selection, all of it was just  blah.There are so many of these boofays popping up, that instead of seeing them as all the same, the differences - both subtle and glaring - will be all the more evident.101 is nowhere near the top of the list of chinese buffet choices in the valley, or even in the immediate area (unless maybe you are within walking distance, then maybe it's the best in the IMMEDIATE area!)

DOS MAMACITASPanzon translates to "potbelly" in Spanish. Don't worry the two ladies behind the counter could care less how you look.  Prices are open range cheap.Carnitas tacos would make Pancho Villa's lay down his pistolas. As for the menudo, a reminder of a never ending slow and dreamy cattle drive. An aroma you can't forget. No doubt this taqueria is for the hombres whose wives are still asleep at home.

Review Text :
A yelp and the thinly veiled link to food porn. Look at any number of the pictures that people take of their meal. It's, for all intent and purpose, food porn. We go on and on about how we ate here and what we had like we're bragging about our latest conquest in the bed room. "Oh man, you should have seen that plate, man. It was easily a 10 and I tore it a new one!" Yes, you can pretty easily make smut novels if you replace whatever food items in a typical review with gender names and you have yourself a grocery store check-out romance novel with Fabio on the cover. So with that, let's talk Dirty.. Dirty Chips that is. These things.. Oh man, if I had a camera I would tell them nothing as they would already be making love to the camera. Any more dirty and this review would be X-rated. But let's go with trying to make the FCC blow up. Let's talk real dirty now.. I mean, how can you top this nasty-kitten! It's a huge pile of Kettle chips with bacon bits, scallions, blue cheese dressing and deep fried chicken liver pate. If your mouth isn't watering already, I would have to question your manhood. Then you can get really raw.. with their extensive raw bar, that is. Though let's be Frank (Sinatra) here. If you are in Vegas, there's a cheaper way to get Shrimp and Crab than getting it at an oyster bar. Stick to those and you should be fine.So what about the lubricant of love, the back bone of any good pub, The beer? It was what I consider a pretty extensive list of beers on tap. Any place that has Fat Tire is a place I will eat in. But they went above and beyond. Blueberry beer. Yes, the Snozberries may taste like snozberries but I do love me the taste of Blueberries. This beer.. tasted like Blueberries. The whole joint looks like it could be in some old English novel as the town tavern, but with a slightly more updated way to dimly light an establishment. The bathroom is very dark. They really nailed the whole dingy pub look there better than, say, New York New York did with its squeaky clean NY City streets. Brick stones line the walls and create a look and along with the many hand crank beer handles on the walls and the "flare" of old taverns and pubs, this place has a look that just makes me want to drink some more and enjoy the sights. I didn't even touch on the burger. Now I'm not much of a turkey fan. Just doesn't have the same food porn feel, no matter how much you stuff it, that beef does. But the turkey burger with turkey bacon wrapped around it was something out of this world. Oh man, would I like to put that in my mouth over and over again. And with that vivid and oddly perverted description of my food, I'll bid you farewell.Most times when you go to bars that serve peanuts in shells, there are at least a few nuts that are kinda...retarded.  They taste off, look a little strange and are just throwaways.  How is it possible that every peanut this bar has is perfect??  Is there a guy in the back inspecting each and every peanut? Aside from the fact that most beers start at $8 here..the food is certainly worth coming for.  We had a 1/2 lb of the pastrami and it was pure heaven.  I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the carved meats.  It would be a bit pricey to get drunk at this place...perhaps just show up drunk already??Fish and Chips awesome!  Service was really bad! Really really bad.  Oh, and the hostess was rude, bitchy and one of those girl who thinks she's really hot, but in all actuality has a butter face (you know who you are!) I know I shouldn't expect much of Vegas, and I generally don't, but say hello in the first fifteen minutes of me being here and I will be fine.  Everything took forever, and the server was a vacant retard (not trying to offend anyone, but seriously, this dude was an idiot).  I don't know what it was, maybe I was pissed off because my family was irritating, but the only thing that is worth coming for is the fish and chips, if they didn't have these I might have burnt the place down...5 stars for the fish and chips-2 stars for the hostess-2 stars for the service+1 star because I don't like having too many 1 star reviews on my Yelp..I am not a hater, I just tell it like it is!Bottom line - 2 stars!If it wasn't for Mr. P we would have never come across this nice little pub. You start off with popcorn drizzled with salt and paprika this is free for all.  Followed by homemade different pickles paired with an assortment of mustards. I love pickles! My expectations were not to high, but oh man when those lobster rolls came out I was in heaven. They were so toasty and tons of butter with huge fresh chunks of lobster. Btw... this was my first lobster roll. I have been watching the food network and seeing all these lobster rolls places but they are all in the east coast. FINALLY, I found a lobster roll right here in Las Vegas at Todd English PUB and it was delicious. To go along with these awesome little rolls I had a wheat beer named T.O.D.D. the lemon and crispy light wheat flavors went great with the lobster. The chicken pot pie was pretty tasty too. Huge chunks of chicken with a light fluffy, crispy crust. It had a "real" intense chicken flavor. Great beer selection, great true pub food even if little pricey but I thought it was worth it. Very enjoyable. :)This place rocks!Here's the short list after eight separate visits with multiple guest and trying almost the entire menu:1.  For starters - the clams or P.E.I's. Perfectly cooked with a bit of spice.2.  The pot pie and Shepard's pie are incredible.3.  Carvery is the winner.  Brisket is top choice.  Salmon is perfect choice for the fish lover.  Perfect crispy skin and moist in the middle.4.  Beer - make it the TUB.  Locally brewed in LV.  Very well balanced with the food at the PUB.All around fun and cool place to enjoy lunch.  Try the beer challenge and enjoy tossing the peanut shells on the ground at the bar while you wait for your food.Must try!OH. MY. FREAKIN. LORD. THIS. PLACE. FELT. LIKE. AN. OVEN.right when i sat down, i was dyyyiinnggg for  a cold brewski....and when i got it, it got warm within 5 minutes.the food is alrrriiggghht, a little overpriced for bar food, but its vegas. the fish and chips were pretty good, but it had too much batter. Their shoe string fries were the best thing i ate!they also have a little dispenser thingy by the bar for ping pong balls! BAD ASS. but where are the beer pong tables? not so bad ass.We came here because I heard they served a mean lobster roll... Let's put it this way. I'd never order the lobster roll again. It was more like a roll with a bit of lobster. You are served 3 of them on a thick Hawaiian type roll.The duck buns to start were great, as was the complimentary popcorn that lasted about 2 seconds. The atmosphere is open and large but overall I'd didn't love this restaurant and highly preferred Todd English Olives at Bellagio for lunch.HEFTYLike eating a mimosa brunch buffet wasn't enough. Girlfriends and I opted for something low-key and near the City Center in LV. We hauled out 4-5 boxes full of left over food outta Todd's. Todd English P.U.B is unique for a gastropub being divided up into three categories: The Carvery (meats), The Grill (house specialties), and the Raw Bar (all seafood).Do get: - Dirty Chips - A mountain of potato chip nachos, drenched in melted bleu cheese, bacon, and little balls of fried chicken liver. Tasty, but OH MY GAW.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A?select=MVU5PL5K_-K0Da1uDjUJnw- Raw Oysters - $2 each. Simple, delicious, no complaints here- Lobster Roll - Another delicious dish - luscious pieces of mayo-ed lobster piled on 3 mini hawaiian bread-type rolls Do not get:(Sadly, my dish of) the 1/2 serving of the lamb: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A?select=hZ9a-iO3R_ssTZHELPDO0wAlthough still noticeably huge, it was chewy and pretty bland. I had a choice of choosing the black truffle mayo [there wasn't enough (synthetic) truffle oil, I tasted no truffle] and apple butter sauce. Also, DO NOT take those dirty chips home. Ever bit into a soggy bleu cheese chip? Not the smartest to decision to take this to-go, but if an after-club inebriated snack still tastes bad -- it's really freakin' bad.We all synchronized the nasty-what-the-eff-did-i-eat face.Don't be greedy and share your food here.***Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants, but the food was mediocre; I will probably seek out Todd English's Olives (The Bellagio) instead on my next Vegas trip***We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).All the walking in Vegas got me pooped!!! My friends and I came in for an early dinner and to rest our feet. LoL The decor is very casual and of course has a pub like atmosphere with beer in the air and sports on the tubes. The waiter was really chill and nice. He checked up on us a few times and did not let us feel neglected at all. My friends ordered a chicken pot pie and the Amsterdam Burger. We ordered a big plate of beer battered onion rings to share. Out of all the beer battered onion rings I have ever tried, these have the most beer flavor. The only problem is the giant onion ring inside the batter does not rip apart so I'm basically pulling the whole thing out and not enjoying the outside. As for me, I ordered the lobster roll that came with not just one, not just two, but THREE lobster rolls!!! It also came with coleslaw and chips, but I substituted the chips with criss cut fries. The lobster rolls were melt in your mouth... MHMMMMMMMM SO GOOD!!! I ate TWO of them! The lobster rolls are jam packed with BIG CHUNKS OF LOBSTER MEAT. They are so warm, buttery, comforting, and oOoOoh hit the spot DELICIOUS! The coleslaw was okay and the fries were pretty good, but I would come back just for the lobster rolls over and over again! =DHappy Happy Happy Hour! From 3-6 M-F half price pints and wine by the glass you cant go wrong! With a wide rang of beer on tap here are my favorites-Anchor Stream-  A San Fran Beer with a toasted malt flavor and a hop finish, you will love itGuinness- You can never go wrong with this stout on tapPyramid Audacious Apricot Ale- I'm usually not one for fruity beers but this is an exception. Amazing Ale with a burst of Apricot and hints of lemon and wheat.Delirium Tremens, Belgium- This hoppy beer that sits at a 8.5% alcohol content is amazing. crisp yet yeasty you will love this beer. But be careful, its strong :)Now for the food...You can never go wrong with starting out with the Beer Battered Onion Rings. they come with this spicy ranch dipping sauce that truly makes the dish.Ive always wanted to try the dirty chips too. kettle chips with bacon bits scallions and chicken livers... ill def try that next time!I had the West Coast Burger for my entree. Its a turkey burger, with sunflower sprouts, bacon, slaw, avocado and dressed with honey mustard. It also came with huge fries. So yum!My friend ordered the New England Fish & Chips. They were truly authentic and amazing. We also shared a side of Mac & Cheese... don't judge us it was worth the calories hahaThe decor is beautiful as well. Surrounded by windows and natural light It was a nice escape from most pubs that are dark and dim. I also noticed they had beer pong pool and darts. How fun! The bartender told us about the drinking contest they had. Drink a pint in under 7 seconds and its free. Now i would never try this but I'm sure it would be fun to watch. All in all this place is a fun change of pace from the typical Strip Restaurant. I suggest it highly!What a totally cool and hip place with excellent food we found when we tried the Todd English PUB! We were able to secure a booth in the back of the restaurant where we could take in all of the sights and we had a great time and meal. The decor is what you might expect in a pub- complete with dart boards and rich wood furniture. The ceilings are very high so the noise level gets a bit loud, but this is not the romantic dinner spot you were looking for anyway. Yelpers-- check in and get a free beer!!! Even though I was having a martini, I couldn't help but snag this deal up. To be honest, I wasn't expecting as good a meal as we had- the duck rolls appetizer was simply out of this world (see pics attached) and the mad Russian swears that this was the single best Tuna dish she has ever had. That is saying something indeed- It was a perfectly prepared "burger" that she wishes she could have another bite of even as I write this. I had fish and chips that was good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good portion of battered fish. For a bit of fun, in the back they have available some tables for playing various drinking games- we watched several games of "flip cup" and the usual antics of those who have never played.... An overall great place to eat drink and hang loose.Pretty decent happy hour twice a day with $2 oysters and $3 sliders! I liked the decor and vibe of the place and didn't feel completely ripped off like I do at so many Las Vegas joints these days (I'm looking at you, Nobu!). It's very casual in here with a sports-pub kind of feel, but it wasn't all bro-y or too loud. A pleasant place to park it for a while with a drink and some snacks. I did indeed partake of the happy hour oysters and sliders and they were delish! When my friend and I saw their dessert specialty Stephanie's Bread Pudding we had to try it--I mean, it had to be good with that name, right? :P Well it was pretty damn good, even if it had the Cap'n Crunch cereal on top (see photo). I'm not a huge fan of that cereal but in this case I didn't mind it. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back if in the area again.Pub not.  Museum feel, open, patio dining, woodsy, with the feeling of it's the place to be.  With over 70 draft beers, and a menu as wide as it is deep = awesomeness.  A bit overpriced for the beers ($9+) and food is my guess for its overall low ratings.I got a free pint of bud light (Yelp check-in offer), and a half pound of beef brisket carvery ($19).   Super tender, and super good.  Came with choice of bread, and 2 sauces of choice (creamy horseradish and the mustard trio).Sports on the TVs, cool music, and a barrel of peanuts which I went ape for.The girls working here would be rated "normal", are wearing Daisy Duke type outfits.  At the bar, professional yet fun bartenders steal the roost.  Especially when double happy hours are promoted: 3p-6p, 10p-1a.All in all, a great outing. Thumbs up.We love the relaxed yet energetic atmosphere that Todd English's P.U.B. resonates with us. You feel like you're really in a British pub...huge selections of cold draught beers pair well with Chef Todd English's flavorful takes on some English "classics". British classics such as Bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, pot pies and expertly roasted until tender meats and poultry. Our waitress, Diane V., was friendly, effervescent, and attentive. Our water glasses were routinely filled and beer refills were offered. We're "fans" of Chef English's carvery so this time, it was no different than previous visits. Today, I ordered the 8 ounce portion of roasted beef brisket that was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. It was seasoned well and you could taste its "beefiness", in a good way. At my urging, my husband ordered the lobster rolls. Oh boy, these lobster rolls were kicked up a version from those that you'd find at Bar Harbor, Maine! First of all, the rolls are brioche-dough based and secondly, the lobster claw meat is sautéed in browned butter, mixed with seasoned mayonnaise and STUFFED into the rolls. The lobster rolls were complemented with a bag of fresh house made potato chips. As we finished our lunches, we promised ourselves that we will return, again, to this restaurant to try other menu items like the Grichebactom and more beer!This place is a joke!I will be very specific about the issues that I had during my lunch at Mr Todd English's ill attempt at a restaurant:We arrived at the restaurant around 2:00pm for lunch. There was no host at the host stand; just a busser standing up front twirling a drink tray on his finger saying "she's gunna be right back."  The hostess known as "she" didn't return to the host stand for several minutes. We were eventually sat at a table when she arrived back at her post.We were greeted quickly by our server, Samantha. She was plenty friendly. The issue that I had with her is that she was sitting at a table next to us doing nothing but showing pictures of who knows what to other servers while they neglected their tables, and she neglected hers. I had no refill on my soda.  She didn't check on us after food was received.  The manager did nothing but stand next to the heat lamps and lean the whole time that we were there.The $19 hamburger that I received had no seasoning on it and the bun was very dry and stale...huge disappointment. Theb $20 sandwich my wife had was good, but really I could have had it for $7 at togo's. In conclusion:Service: terrible.Food: mediocre at best. I know that my words will fall on deaf ears, as far as Mr English is concerned, but hopefully the management will try to improve the staff so that people don't continue to leave as pissed off as I did.  Don't spend your hard earned money here. You will regret it, as I do!4 stars for the happy hour and cool ambiance.The $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders during happy hour brought us here whilest cruising the strip.The outside seating is open and airy with modern decor and a view of the classy Aria to supplement your experience.  Indoors, the vibe is more cool and hipster, with massive (yes, much larger than normal) dart boards to entertain.  Choose your poison; they're both great!All the happy hour food was delicious and paired well with the huge selection of craft and domestic beers.  Keep the men facing away from the TV screens, as their eyes will be glued there otherwise...It is a pub, I suppose.+1 Free Bud Light with Yelp check-in!Get stuffed!  Literally.Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.Cheeers!I am always in serious need of some solid comfort food in large portions before leaving Las Vegas, this was the perfect place for me after an entire weekend of excessive drinking! Had to get a really good spicy Bloody Mary with Goose vodka first, it was more than a great pour, very spicy and salty, not to mention strong too, loved the cheese in it! Looked through the extensive menu, lots of items looked very comforting and appetizing. I had lobster roll, it came with three small lobster rolls, kettle chips and housemade slaw, OhMY, just how amazingly flavorful and delicious they were, definitely one of the best lobster rolls I have ever had! Hubby had a hot dog with skinny fries. He loved the very well seasoned oversized all-beef hot dog, I loved the fries of course. Thought we just ordered some snack food, but the portions were so big! Wish we had time for beer, the selections were huge. Think I have just found the perfect spot for comfort food and Bloody Marys!We got a complimentary Corona lite thanks to the Yelp! Check-in.  Score!! Our server was really nice and made me laugh which is always a bonus.  The food here was just ok.  The pretzel sticks were warm and buttery, but old and slightly stale on the inside. I wasn't blown away with by sliders (the buns were burnt) and the Lobster Cobb came with raw onions after we requested no onions.  Still ok, but we weren't blown away.  A good casual option at Aria since there aren't many casual options there.  My advice? Go for the beer and/or happy hour and stick with fish/chips.

Review Text :
I was set to try a burrito and all the flavored fries....uh yeah they don't make them anymore. They restructured their menu and it now includes only:Tacos: beef, chicken, pork or tofu&egg,-  1- $2.78 or 2-$4.63(not so) Fries- seasoned fries $1.16 so no more flavor optionsCrazy Dough $1.16Jumbo "Nate" Dog $2.7812 oz Drinks $1We got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. I'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some "Seoul" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, "bahn mi" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). Even if I didn't have "experience" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the "expert" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a "bowl" instead of a taco. I think it needs a "heavier" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying "I'm soo hungry" in the car after we decided to skip "lunch" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. Fries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). I think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an "event" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed. I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.Seriously now.... Has no one ever tasted korean food? This taste nothing like korean food. Please try kogi taco truck then you will understand. I'm pretty sure that's where this guy got the idea from. Worst korean tacos ever... F-Loved it!!!  I came w/ my sister & we had the beef taco,  tofu & egg taco, the nate dog, & fries. I love Korean food & love tacos so I really enjoyed eating the dishes. I'm also a texture eater & I thought the texture & taste was perfect w/ each dish I ate.  Everything tasted so good! The fries were really addicting. Not your typical french fry.  After I ate the nate dog, I had to order another one because it was so good. For dessert the crazy fried dough was sooo good!  Very good service, clean & fast. The prices were right. It's on the same parking lot as Lee's Liquour so I'm definitely coming again! The location is kind of far from where I live, but I was on that side out town so I decided to try it. Luckily I have friends & relatives in that side of town so when I come visit them, I can stop by the truck & get my grub on. I'm actually craving Hanshiktaco as I'm typing this.I was driving down Lake Mead with my Sister and Nephew and did a double take on this shiny Red Truck in front of Lee's Discount Liquor.  Well, I'm a sucker for trying new things and I was on a food truck high just having recently discovered Fuku Burger that past week....so, even though I was on my way to lunch I busted a U-ee and decided to have a taste. The operation is a one man show and the guy was nice enough.  So kudos to the humble service.  However, I can't speak too much about the food.  I was pretty disappointed.  Granted I had high hopes from the look of the truck and the overall concept of "Fusion Food," the Korean and Mexican flavors didn't quite well...fuse.   I ordered the pork taco and well it tasted under seasoned and the tortilla was just tasteless.  I was hoping for more flavor from the meat and maybe even just a warm tortilla would've have done wonders to add something to this very sad cold taco.  I really didn't even finish it.I feel bad giving such a bad review, but hey...it's my honest opinion and I wish Hanshik Taco all the best and perhaps he'll try and put some more pizzaz in his food.The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the seasoning on the fries were pretty yummy.Happened to try this place during their Challenge with "Slidin' Thru" Slider Truck this afternoon or more like yesterday afternoon. Pretty Cool Themed Truck/Trailer and Owner was delightful and Convincing as he briefly explained his inspirations for his creations of Korean Fusion Tacos and such..Here is what I got roughly an HOUR after I placed my order:Pork Taco & Beef TacoBoth the tacos had their version of korean inspired kimchee/saurkraut spiced with a twist. UUmmm.... Okay, I'm always up for new takes on food. First off, there wasn't much meat in either of the tacos and the tortilla made them look even more skimpy (especially for the price). Secondly, the beef was very bland, pretty chewy (not in a good way) and all I could really taste was spicy/heat?! Where's the flavor? Pretty much the same with the pork.. except it was a little juicier with a bit of flavor?! I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to accomplish here..El Korean "Nate" DogThis looked interesting but wasn't much different in regards to its flavor profile compared to the Tacos. The hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog and bun was no different. The only slight upside to this was the texture from the same kimchee/saurkraut thing that accompanied the tacos.  Disregarding the horrendous wait (which was the dagger), the bang for the buck, and the slight edge the hot dog had over the tacos, I cannot give this place much justice. SorryWe tried Hanshiktaco this summer. It's close to where I live and as soon as I saw it I was really excited to try it. I love trying new things and the food sounded really interesting. I've had L.A.'s famous Kogi tacos and was hoping for something similar from this truck. However, it was only okay. The flavors just weren't there. Good concept but more work is needed on the execution.Hanshiktaco has quite a few good reviews, so I may need to try it again as they may have improved. However, I'm reluctant to do so based on my first experience.Disclaimer: I used to work in LA where my lunch options were a line of lunch trucks everyday. I ate from the famous Kogi truck and the other copycats at least once a week. So this review might be a bit skewed because I already have a set expectation of what I want it to taste like. I ordered the pork taco and tofu & egg taco, along with a side of fries. I didn't see an option to order the famous garlic fries that everyone was raving about though. But, it's all good- I was there for the tacos. There were quite a few people in front of me but I didn't mind because I just made my way over to the Snow Ono truck parked next door. Plus, they had some great oldies playing- kriss kross (jump, jump) and sublime. Okay- onto the food.  2.5 stars.*The seasoning on the fries was nice, but the fries themselves didn't taste fresh.  *The pork taco had a nice flavor, as did the egg & tofu, but I was disappointed with the kimchi.  I appreciated the texture, but was hoping for more of that kimchi kick.*I am also used to a soft corn tortilla- and these were enveloped by a hard, chewy flour tortilla. Regardless, I ate the entire thing and will probably return because it is definitely tastier than any fast food joint.  It is right around the corner from where I live so if I see a short line- I will definitely give the Nate dog and Sweet dough a try, with hopes to update this review.So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!

I thought it was time for an update for Pisces. Last time I came here I understood why I loved this place so much. And since the beginning of their sushi bar, they have grown to the space next door! My place to be...the lounge.So these are the reasons why I love Pisces:1. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking of a drink you want, you can definitely leave it up to the bartender here. They can make something random and it will be awesome! 2. Awesome service. I've never had a bad experience in this department.3. Want to eat in the lounge? You sure can! 4. They have a jelly fish tank. Yeah, A jelly fish tank.5. Live music on Saturday nights in the lounge. 6. TV's are always on the sports channels. (Even when Bobcats are playing against the Heats)7. Good beers on draft.8. (But honestly in the end it always comes back to alcohol/mixed drinks.)9. And this place well, is the place to go for a mixed drinks with friends. That's probably the only reason I come out to bars is to try their creation and specialty drinks. Or else, I would be home drinking scotch.So, yes. Check this place out. Anthony Hamilton did the other night, so be like a celeb (or just have fun) and watch the jellyfish go round and around the tank and get yo drink on!After reading the discussions in Talk and seeing some recommendations for Pisces, I thought we would give it a try. Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly.

Let's talk about failure, baby.Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.This is a really good place to eat. It is right at the top for me.The last time I went I felt runshed and uneasy, not the fault of the place though.So this time I was able to truly relax and enjoy it.The endless Salad is fantastic! Just like a true Italian Salad should be, great dressing and dark lettuce.Pasta is really good, cooked just right. Along with the Eggplant, (my girlfriends favorite.)Stuffed Sea Shells are a thing of  beauty. Really authentic!You can even get complete Dinners to go. Which is really good for those days when you have worked all day and are just Burnt out.Clean restrooms and lots of parking. Nice staff, they are very attentive as well.RigaTonys why do I keep forgetting about you!!A friend that I hadn't seen in about 22 years was driving though and hit me up on FB and said Hey lets have dinner, find somewhere off the I-10 and make it Italian and RigaTony's was the perfect place to pick! We meet up around 5pm on a Wednesday night, the place was busy, but not packed, I was loving how they decorated for Christmas, made me feel like I was going to a party :) Our server was Michelle and she was very helpful answering whatever questions my friends had, and she was excellent at making sure we had everything we needed, love great serviceAfter we checked out the menu I decided I wanted the lasagna & spaghetti combo. My friend ordered the chicken with lemon & artichoke and her husband ordered the spaghetti deluxe.Then the antipasto salad & freshly baked ciabatta bread came out, OMG this salad is to die for, I love love love it!! Stop going to the Olive Garden people, this is the salad you should be having!! And the bread!! I love me some fresh baked bread, so much better than sticks! My lasagna was delish baby! It was so flavorful too, the cheese, the noodles the sauce, omg I can't believe I ate it all, I ordered it with the intention of having some for lunch the next day, nope that didn't happen!  So good!!  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect amount and great in flavor! Loved the combo! My friends, they too loved their dishes and were happy we picked RiggaTonys for dinner!! It was great seeing her and sharing a great meal too! A fun tip I did learn about RiggaTonys is once a month on Monday night they have a Wine dinner, where you dine on 5 course dinner that the Chef prepares for just that night; I will have to check that out soon!What can you say that has not been said? This place is good, it is great actually!Came in the other night to get an order to go. It was ready when I got there as promised.They even carried it to my car. Food was great, sausage, manocotti, salad, bread, all of it wonderful.I used the restroom while there and it was clean and plesant.Lots of parking and a friendly staff.If my tongue could do a happy dance, it would totally do it for the food at Rigatony's! Everything from the salad, to the bread, to the appetizers, to the main dishes, it all was fantastic! I had the zucchini for an appetizer, these were delicious, nice and crispy and the batter actually had seasoning so it was quite tasty. For my main dish I split the chicken parmesan and the chicken fettuccini alfredo with my friend. Both dishes were great! Each one cooked to perfection, with very tasty seasoned sauces and nice juicy chicken! The portions at this restaurant are huge, definitely enough to take home for later! I cant wait to go back and try a few other dishes! I had to flip a coin to decide what I wanted to eat this night because I wanted to try so many different things. The only reason this didn't get a 5 star was because the wait time. Waiting to eat here is a little ridiculous. We had a reservation for 7:15 and didn't end up getting seated until 7:45 because we had a party of 9. To me that is not a huge party, but a decent size. To have to wait an extra 30 minutes for a table to eat is no fun. Especially when you have a very active and very hungry 3 year old with you. I am hoping the next time we go without reservations, the wait time isn't as long. Other than that, the staff was very friendly, our waitress was very nice and quick, great décor and kind of a "homey" vibe, great place to try!!! Good for a date, night out with friends or a family time meal!!If you're going to eat your feelings, you're not going for Chinese... you'll just be depressed an hour later.I came here on a whim, wanting to carb load before an early Camelback hike.  Being my first time, I was surprised at the crowd waiting for a table.  When the hostess informed me of a 20 minute wait time, I spied a lonely seat at the bar and made a break for it.I asked the enthusiastic bartender for a hefe and orange, but the unfiltered wheat beer was not on the menu.  He convinced me to go with a Peroni, and it was sheer perfection, and balanced perfectly with my meal.  The $4.50 a bottle seemed steep... I must be conditioned for the dollar PBRs.Starting out with the fried ravioli appetizer, which consisted of four large puffs of ricotta in a pasta shell, swimming in a delightful marinara.  This dish was smooth and cheesy, each bite eliciting the next.  I should have stopped here, but I hadnt eaten all day, choosing instead to brood in a bed with sweat stained sheets.For round #2, I decided on the chicken parm, due to Ashlie's review.  To me, the red sauce on this dish tasted strange, unlike the savory sauce from the appetizer.  Of course, that didnt stop me from eating 72.8% of it.The entree also came with two thick slices of toasted french loaf and a chopped anti-pasto salad.This place rocked!  And the bar aint a bad place to saddle up to.  It's like the single-riders line at DCA's Radiator Springs Racers

Wow.  Going a 2nd time a few weeks after the opening.  Talk about loss of credibility fo' shizzle!  The service really sucked big time.  Waited approx 15 minutes unti we could even wave someone down to order drinks.I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews about the service. Really sub standard. Our server was actually very cocky. Really close to annoying and rude.The Food. Pierogis - OK had some caviar on it. Flatbread pizza (with Truffle Oil) - decent -thin crust -had a great crustScallops - It was borderline BAD!! Chicken wings (Thai curry) - The best dish of the night - chicken wings lollipop style covered in curry Thai sauce. Very flavorfulTuna Tartare-OK Chocolate Ravioli - Horrible Toffe cake with ice cream - Recommended to us  - i did not think it was that good. We did have a great bottle of Pinot  Noir. !!!Hookah- OK Close to three stars but the service was just not up to PAR. I doubt if I would be back..

Rubio's are a dime a dozen in California, especially in San Diego where it originated from.  Lived there most of my life and I got sick of Rubio's.  Well, now I rediscovered them here.  I was recently in the area for something quick.  It was going either be Aloha's Kitchen, Thelma's, or Rubio's.  Aloha's Kitchen wasn't open, even though it was after 10 AM.  I wasn't in the mood for Flip food at Thelma's.  So, I settled for Rubio's. I wasn't disappointed with my eats.  I ended up getting 4 Chicken Street Tacos and for good measure, an extra side of chopped chicken breast.  Let's start with the tacos, these were good.  I was a little disappointed with how small they are.  Real street tacos aren't even this small.  But at least they aren't as small as Nacho Daddy's street tacos.  Because they were small, 4 was needed.  It's cheap so I'm not complaining.  I was actually satisfied with my 4 chicken street tacos, but needed that additional protein so I got an side of extra chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry when you have nothing with it, but it's all about the macros at this point. I tend to frequent chicken grills like T-Boy, Samurai Sam's, and TMAD lately.  But discovered that Rubio's sells chopped chicken breast on it's own too.  You know what that means, I'm adding them to my list fast food healthy eats.Pro Tip:-Best fish tacos for a fast food joint-Their nachos with chicken, cheese, and sour cream is a must try-Addicting Chipotle sauce here-Their steak street tacos are my favorite-Great service at this location.

This place is exactly what Anthem needs as an alternative to endless beer-pizza-wings joints on every corner. Nice, clean, quaint place with excellent wine list, great beer selection and now top shelf liquor. Food is a basic menu but nicely done and tasty. It's not the place for a full-blown five course meal, but the fare is certainly paired well with wine and you can get a great pasta dish, gourmet flatbreads, etc to fill up on.My wife and I will hit this place on our way to a movie night or the theatre downtown. Prices are very fair - especially during happy hour. Then we sometimes hit it on the way back too. Or a great, classy place to sneak away from the rugrats for an hour without blowing fifty bucks. Management changed for the better about six months ago and the clientele is fun, hip and not snobby at all. Just an all around good neighborhood hangout place, maybe even worth a trip from outside Anthem.My boyfriend and I went here with friends on a Friday night.  We were anticipating a fun evening out and a yummy meal.  Well, three of the four entrees came out at once and the server told us the other would be here shortly.  Well, fifteen minutes later and it still wasn't here, so we flagged down the server and she said there were problems in the kitchen.  She said they had sent one of the chefs home early (???? it's Friday night at 7:00 PM).  By this time, our three entrees were cold as ice as none of us had touched them as we were waiting for my boyfriend's Ahi tuna entree.  The server told us she would comp us another round of drinks - just what we needed on an empty stomach.  :-(  So, the three of us began eating our cold food.After at least 30 minutes - it could have been longer - my boyfriend's ahi tuna  finally came out.  It was supposed to be grilled ahi, but had barely been run over a grill.  It wasn't even warm.  My boyfriend told the male server who brought it to the table (a different server than the female we'd had all night) that the ahi wasn't done.  It needed to be grilled more.  The waiter got snippy and said "This is the way we do it at Wild Vines."  I looked at him and said, "Are you really arguing with a customer?"  This guy knew my boyfriend had already been waiting at least 30 minutes PAST the time our entrees had been served.  What a jerk.  He backed off and said he wasn't arguing - he offered to take it back to the kitchen to cook it more.  My boyfriend declined since we were all done with our cold food by this time.Sometime during this time, an unkempt-looking man with a sleeveless T-shirt, discheveled hair, and a grungy-looking backpack which he slung on the bar arrived.  He didn't look clean at all and we came to understand that he was one of the "chefs."When our server learned from the male server that there were problems with the ahi, she came over and offered to comp us dessert.  We really didn't want dessert.  We just wanted to leave.Unbelievably, we had now been there for well over an hour and the only thing they comped us were one round of drinks.  All of our cold meals were full price.  She did point out that she comped the ahi salad - at which point I busted up laughing since it wasn't touched and was sent back to the kitchen immediately.Wild Vines has potential, for sure.  The cold food we ate would have probably been excellent had it been eaten hot.  What this place lacks most is experienced restaurant management.  If they're going to cater to the wine crowd, then they really need to do an overhaul in how to treat customers, how to expedite food properly, and most importantly, what to do when things turn into a cluster f*$#.  There were any number of ways they could have saved the night (and their reputation) if there had been anyone there who understood the value of the customer experience.We ended up leaving and going over to Ocho (a Mexican restaurant) where we had excellent margaritas and my boyfriend got a wonderful quesadilla - as he was starving by this time.

The bar food was good so we tolerated getting to-go items. Even then it sometimes was spotty service and it was always from the same server. Black hair, really bubbly and friendly which makes her scattered with no priorities except to chat and have fun. She's the reason why we always check sauces as it normally isn't always there. I've gotten salad without a dressing or fries without ranch sauce. If we deal with someone else, there's usually not as much issue. After last night, screw this place. Called in the order and it usually takes 10-15 minutes. The BF gets there soon after to pick it up and lets that server know he's here for a pick up. She goes to the back and says it's a few minutes. He tries to get her several times. It took forever to get the food and when the BF pays and she brings him the food, he asks for sauces that wasn't given. The girl goes off then to drop off a drink, but then goes to chat with some people, and off elsewhere, gets people their checks, etc. before going to just grab the BF some ranch, malt vinegar and tartar sauce. At this point the BF has already been waiting 30minutes plus on a order that was called in 50 minutes ago so he was quite miffed that this lady has no concept of priorities. When a customer is needing to leave, then don't hold them hostage! He sat for a few minutes too many for some sauce.58 minutes for food. When we open the food- it was cold and soggy. I didn't get tartar sauce for my fish and chips. I live two blocks from this place so it didn't get cold on a travel home. It's the reason why we pick up here- the proximity should get us hot food. The food was done probably the timeframe they said, but that lady didn't go get the food and wandered around chatting up people. One server can ruin repeat business.

Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.I didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.Anyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!The restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  The flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.Will I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.I have been eyeing Grimaldi's for a while. Feeling like pizza I was glad that Grimaldi's came to mind. Parking was bit of a chore but it usually is in this parking lot. The wait for our table was a short 5 minutes. The dining area inside is smaller then I expected so I can't even imagine trying to come here on a Friday or Saturday night and not experience a long wait. We started off with a small "Antipasto". It was $9. I really liked the fresh mozzarella and the whole thing in general. It can easily be shared between 2 people. For pizza we decided to go custom. It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all! They have a dining area outside. They offer a banquet room and catering.There isn't much to be said about this particular location except that I really liked it. I stopped by here at around 5 pm on a Sunday and ordered a cheese pizza with mushrooms, basil and anchovies (not my ideal toppings but I went along with it). The pizza turned out to be delicious; the ambience was great and it wasn't too noisy. I don't care what anyone says, Grimaldi pizza is great!I hadn't been to Grimaldi's in a couple years. I received a e-mail saying that I could get a free pizza up to $18 for free to celebrate my birthday. That's pretty generous! This locations is near Cheesecake Factory and other hot spots so the parking lot is often full but I got lucky this last time and grabbed a close spot as someone was pulling out. Walking in we were greeted and the inside was packed. We had to wait just a short couple of minutes before being seated. To get things started I ordered the Antipasto which I have have each visit and liked it just as much this time too, It's simple yet tasty. I picked a pizza with pepperoni and sausage and let me tell you this pizza was bomb! I don't like it when a pizza has too much sauce and this pizza was just right. The toppings had great flavor and it was just a good and satisfying meal. Our server was cool and he checked on us often and took great care of us. I will definitely be back in the future.

Pink Pepper has undergone an ownership change & been renamed to Tara Thai. The food remains very similar and the staff is still very friendly.I popped in for lunch the other day with fellow Yelpers Daren C. & Ryan C. and we indulged ourselves on their boofay.The first part about the $8.XX lunch buffet that made me happy was that it includes an Iced Tea. Score!The buffet offers a wide selection of options, from soup, rice, noodles, spring rolls, egg-rolls, tofu, vegetable dishes to many meat options (which my dining buddies appreciated). For me, I was happy to find a good amount of vegetarian dishes. One of the workers happily gave me a tour of the buffet area to show me what was veggie-friendly and what wasn't. Awesome service!I really enjoyed the food and I'll be back. Especially for lunch!A few other tid-bits: They will not accept Entertainment book coupons for Pink Pepper. When chatting with one of the staff members, they informed me that the owner also has a Tara Thai restaurant in Sedona & Prescott, so the empire is expanding.They tell me the large Pink Pepper sign on the exterior of the building will soon be changed.So far, the Pink Pepper 5 stars have carried over, but I'm nervous...I asked the server, "So, even though there's new ownership, you won't be changing the recipes, right?"To which she replied, "Oh, NO! No, no, no.  We won't change anything; we'll just make it more AUTHENTIC."Wes, Daren, and I glanced at each other, exchanging a telepathic,  "Uh huh.  What the hell does that mean?  Are you changing or not?!", but we all just smiled back.   We'd just enjoyed a tasty and satisfying lunch boofay with a smorgasbord of choices for under $9, after all.Tons of dishes full of exotic flavored veggies, meats, seafood, and sides -- even a few desserts.   I enjoyed Thai custard with apple slices quite a lot.  MMMMMM I want another piece.Having seen more of the team than most yelpers, I can confirm that the super friendly and attentive staff seems to remain the same so far.  I didn't see any new faces, but there were several new dishes added to the usual weekday lunch boofay.  Thai toast was weird but good, with its syrupy, cucumber and red onion dipping sauce.As long as they know enough to not change everything that already works so well, the new ownership should enjoy success, including a hefty lunch crowd, with me in it a few days a month, at least!

I most recently had an up to now rare five-star dining experience here, where everything I ate was delicious, and service was exemplary, with the bringing of extra Alfredo Sauce, snappy unbidden filling of water glasses, and even quick and professional boxing of leftovers.by our diligent server.Hot and super cheesy Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms were simply great dipped in their own melted bliss.  And the same was true of Mozzarella Marinara, with excellent plugs of Fried Cheese dipped in a warm, creamy, and slightly sweet Marinara Sauce.  A bowl of rustic Country Bean Soup with Pancetta was thick and hearty, with a spiced up broth teeming with potatoes, Cannellini Beans, carrots, tomatoes, and celery.   And an almost endless House Salad with olives, pepperoncini, artichoke hearts, and a  very tasty Italian Dressing was quite filling.  Home-baked breadsticks were good, too, but rather superfluous.Then, rounding out this fine Italian dinner spread was an entree of Veal Scallopini with lean and nicely pounded medallions of veal that were smothered with mushrooms and well covered by a sumptuous White Wine Sauce.  Magnificent golden Parmesan Roasted Potatoes offered a welcome accompaniment to close out the meal.  There was simply no room left to seriously entertain ordering a dessert!

We've been very excited to try out Big Daddy's BBQ AZ since we saw the banners go up the other week and tonight were able to do that.  My family is tired (not sure why since I am doing all the work) of me spending 10-20 hours on our smoker cooking up good BBQ meats so when a BBQ place opens around the corner from our house everyone is happy.The Mastro's group behind this concept could not have made us happier.  I expected the BBQ to be great but not the service since they just officially opened yesterday.  Everything exceed my expectations so can't wait to go back.  I started out with a Big Daddy's BBQ Honey Ale very cold beer which hit the spot perfect hanging out on the sort of outdoor patio.  Before I get into the food I have to say the layout of this place is really cool.  If you have been to Maloney's (prior bar here) it was fun to see how much the layout was changed.  There is a large indoor dining area but then along the parking lot street is a large patio indoor/outdoor area.  Hard to describe so check it out yourself before it gets too hot here in a few weeks.Anyway, back to the food since that is the reason we went right?  Big Daddy's features all the classic BBQ items such as baby back ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, and beef ribs. It would have been nice if I had a 2nd stomach to try it all so when the bartender recommended I try out the 3-to-an-order combo sliders with the option of different meats per slider I was sold.  I ordered up the sliced brisket, pulled pork, and pulled beef.  I am a huge fan of sweet potato fries so took that for my side.  With the beer all that came to about $11.If you are in the Scottsdale area or interested in trying out great smoked BBQ definitely give Big Daddy's BBQ a try.  I know you won't be disappointed (well my smoker might since it sure was easier eating there).

I went here for Cinco de Mayo, hearing a lot about it in advertisements. Bad idea!! There was a good crowd and limited seating. My group took a seat next to a couple of other groups and we struck up a conversation. We all ordered food and drinks separately. By the time the waitress brought us our one bottled beer, I had already gone up to the bar, got a drink and drank it. We also ordered all you can eat tacos since she suggested it to us. She returned 40 min. later to tell us they weren't doing it anymore, so we ordered nachos with no tomatoes. It ended up having tomatoes on it, but she couldn't be found, so we scrapped them off. It turns out that the couple next to use had a the same $10 off coupon as us. When we got our separate bills, the waitress said she couldn't use the coupons because we were at the same table. We weren't even at a table. We were on random benches and didn't even know the other group originally. The waitress took our coupons before we got our food and never said anything about not being able to use them then. She brought back her manager who could care less and was extremely RUDE and wouldn't listen. They ended up calling over security and the cops and kicked us out over a coupon that they couldn't apply?!? They then took our barely eaten food that we paid for and threw it all out without asking, when we were waiting to get a box! This place will not last. The group across from us said they were never coming back and it was the WORST service they've ever had. Poor management and rude waitstaff, especially Christina. DO NOT GO HERE!

The way I'm drawn to corndogs is magnetic. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Perhaps just a thing? I don't know, but since I think a corn dog is just a hot dog wrapped in a delicious sweater it makes me happy.Big Hurt's happens to sell corndogs very late into the evening, which is good for late night munchies. They also sell fries that are too salty, unless you really like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good. And, wait for it, cheeseburgers on donuts instead of buns. So, in case all the gambling and drinking doesn't kill you, they've got you covered.

I love dim sum, and this place just took dim sum to a whole other level for me. While I have always been nervous to go to dim sum restaurants that require you to order your food from a list, rather than a cart, I went here with my family and we managed to navigate our way through the menu and what a delicious meal we had!The portion sizes here are huge, so while the prices may appear to be higher than other dim sum places you might be used to, keep in mind that you are getting more food for the price you are paying! Because we did not realize this at the time, we ended up ordering more food than we could finish, so we ended up taking home some leftovers!Like many dim sum places around town, this place gets very busy, very quickly. If you want to be sure to get a table, make sure you get there by 11:30. During this meal, the big hits were:1. Crispy fried squid2. Rice noodle rolls with shrimp and sweet soy sauce3. Baked eggplant 4. Shrimp shumai5. Shrimp rolls6. Lotus leaf sticky rice (lo mai gai). 7. Sesame ballsService at this place is very quick and the food comes out tasting VERY fresh. I definitely suggest checking this place out.

"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."  I think that's how the saying goes... and I usually stick to this saying but since I'm a yelper, I have to be honest about my experience at Jacqueline's Cafe.I admit, I read the reviews prior, many of them not so positive, but I was still optimistic that I would like Jacqueline's.  It's in a convenient location in the Hilton Village shopping center and it looks bright, colorful, and fun from the outside.  There's also a ton of option on the menu.  So I dragged Lindsey F with me to lunch earlier this week.  We were greeted and seated in a timely manner... and our server was sweet.  We ordered ice water with lemon and a hummus appetizer to start.  The water tasted like it wasn't filtered and the hummus had a tang to it that wasn't a good tang.  (I think I've tasted hummus with a tang when it's sat too long in my refrigerator in the past).  I will say the pita that came with it was warm and tasty though.We each ordered salads, and they were huge portions.  They looked good but a few bites in and we both agreed that they looked much better than they tasted.  The egg, chicken, and avocado that came in my Cobb Salad tasted processed, and the dressing was really thick.  Needless to say, I barely made a dent in it.So there you have it, my honest review of Jacqueline's Cafe.  The two star rating says it all: "Meh. I've experienced better." Sorry Jacqueline's - I wish you luck but I will probably not be back for another mediocre meal.

I've been coming here twice a week for lunch the past few weeks. The food is awesome and affordable. It's way better than going to a fast food chain. I rotate between these:Loco Moco mini $5.50Hula Pack w/BBQ chicken $4.50Shoyu Chicken mini $4.95All the employees are nice. I call in my order so I don't have to wait. I don't even need to tell them my name anymore!Aloha North Vegas Yelpers!This is the closest place to me that offers local food.I had a late lunch here last week with my guy. We both come from Hawaii and love local food.I had the kaukau pack which is their version of a bento. I choose garlic ahi and sesame chicken. It comes with white rice and fried noodles. Great taste and reasonable price costing $8My guy loves the korean chicken plate and Portuguese sausage here.To me their version of Korean chicken is OKAY... I would suggest something else... like their garlic ahi!Why -1 star?super long wait... really long wait... did I mention there's a wait? and the menu is limited but I'm ok with quality, not quantity. I guess I wish there was more HAWAIIAN food on the menu, I say this is more of local food from Hawaii. I guess I had my share of other Hawaiian spots in the city, so I've been to places that has more variety.This place reminds me of a place you would find in Hawaii. Very friendly staff! I love Hawaii people! One lady there reminds me of my grandma back home. Gotta love the aloha spirit!Will I come back?YES!I'll probably call in my order a head of time to cut out the wait, now that I have their menu.+ military drinks free! Indoor seating. Super Casual. Lots of free parking.Mahalo 808 MP!-Miss Yelp 2011Yummy, cheap, a thousand times better than Panda Express or any other main-stream place (such as L&L). This is a very non-assuming joint in a big shopping center off of Craig in North Las Vegas, but if you find it, you have found a gem!I went here on a lunch date with a friend of mine and we arrived just around 11:40 AM on a Friday. There were open booths/tables and a small line. We both took our time checking out the menu and decided to get one of their daily specials, the "808" special. You get two choices of entrees (however it is limited to certain ones), and your choice of slaw, rice, or a mixed green salad. My friend and I like to share so we thought this would be the best way for us to try a bunch of different things, so here's what we got:Chicken KatsuShoyu ChickenGrilled SalmonGarlic AhiSpam Musubi (2)My favorites were definitely the grilled salmon and the garlic ahi. The chicken was so-so. So I would absolutely reccomened the fish dishes over anything else here. The salmon seriously had this amazing flavoring in it that made it so yummy. My friend doesn't even like salmon and she said she liked this one. The musubi was good too and it had just come out fresh when we ordered ours.I love that you can get a green salad here as a side. This one they had was great too - leafy greens, very fresh and with a nice side of dressing as well. If you live in the NLV area you should definitely make it a habit to come here. I know I'm going to be coming back.This has got to be the best Hawaiian restaurant that I've been to.  The food is very tasty and it's close to home.  It's in the same shopping complex as Poke Express.  Hawaiian goodness in one area!We got there to place a to-go order.  I'm not sure why I didn't call to place my order but oh well.  The kalbi takes 20 minutes but it was soooo worth the wait.  It was juicy, tender, a bit fatty and the flavor was great.  The Spam musubi was alright - it had a bit too much rice though.  The garlic chicken was also good, lightly breaded but it wasn't as garlicky as I would have liked.  Good thing I also got the GARLIC AHI - it was sooooo good.  The fish was fresh and the flavor was AMAZING.  It was topped with toasted garlic.  Easily, the best item on their menu!  Their portions are generous.  I wanted to finish my food but it was just too much.  I'll keep coming back for more garlic ahi though.  Yes, it's THAT good!After eating here several times I am finally getting around to this review. Why, you might ask? I dont know why either. Maybe its because I am so full and satisfied after each visit that I just got too relaxed which equals to laziness on my part. Well I feel that I need to do this now so all you peeps out there looking for a decent Hawaiian place to eat can get the info you need. First of all, they are closed on mondays.  To help you find this place easier, look for the nicely sized Big Lots sign in the same complex. Since the building itself is kind of back a ways, their sign looks dinky from the street. They are to the right of Ella Em's Soul Food which I kind of dont recommend eating at. Refer to my review on them and you will know what I mean.Since my first visit here I kept telling myself that I will try other dishes but always end up getting the same items. Mainly Kalbi Short Ribs, Garlic Chicken, and Grilled Mahi Mahi accompanied by a rotation of the Mac Salad and Green Salad.First and foremost, if you are coming here for the first time, get the Kalbi Short Ribs! It is nothing like what you have had at other places. It's literally a bone in steak because the cut they give you is like about 4 actual short ribs stacked on top of each other but cut up into strips for you enjoy it much easier than having to manually pull the meat apart or cut it. If you dont believe me, please refer to the numerous mouth watering pics and mine will be there as well! I recommend you order it medium rare for best taste and tenderness. Also give them a little more time to cook it especially if the place is packed.For you garlic lovers like me, the Garlic Chicken is what always gets me kind of like how that one really cute nephew or niece of yours that you just cant say no to when they tilt their head and give you the puppy dog eyes look. Its basically chicken katsu cut up but with a different version of breading with a garlic mayo type of sauce on it.The grilled Mahi Mahi always hits the spot for me when it comes to my fish craving. Its tender flakiness falls apart oh so easily with your fork. Only thing that may have caught my attention is that the portion was just a tad small. These three items I get are part of the their name sake combo, the 808 Mixed Plate in which you choose two items accompanied with two scoops of steamed white rice and your choice of mac salad or green salad. Im glad I dont come here alone and bring my family instead so I can sample all the goodness! The total price for all three large orders plus 2 drinks came to about 31 bucks and change. FYI, most orders you can get a mini or large depending on your appetite. The 808 mixed plates are guaranteed to be large sizes. So I would say an average meal here would be around 10 bucks a person. Not bad at all for really good food and good service.Speaking of service, they take your order at the counter, you pay, sit down,  and they bring it out to you once its done. The drinks are self serve so you dont have to wait for them to refill your drinks. Once you are done eating, try to at least clean up a bit after yourself so that they dont spend too much time cleaning after you and for Pete's sake, leave a decent tip if you havnt already when you paid up front.Next time I will try to order other stuff but no promises. Also dont forget to check out Poke Express down a few suites for some excellent Poke and yes, I have a review for that place too! So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this while driving and go straight there. Then you can send me a compliment after reading this. Lol. Enjoy!Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #105 "Da Kine!"

Review Text :
This place used to be quite the thing in the neighborhood, but completely lost it recently. I heard that the former owners sold it to accountants and went on to open Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun.I went recently, maybe mid october, and ordered the eggs benedict, as I always do, because they are amazing. Instead of the usual yumz, i was served two cold eggs drowned in a thick, cold lump of yellow sauce, along with cold potatoes and partially cooked bacon.I sent the plate back, which I never do, mentionning that it was the first time I saw something like that at Griffintown Café, and that I would happily wait a bit longer for the real thing, and hot. What came back from the kitchen was the exact same plate, provably microwaved, with even more of the thick, disgusting sauce, and what appeared to be melted butter on the salad. Puzzled, I decided not to eat anything because it was honestly disgusting. I politely complained about the quality of my meal, and was offered a groundbreaking 10% discount ("the best we can do for you sir"), for a meal I didn't even eat 10% of. Needless to say, I won't be visiting again soon. Anybody else has experienced a sharp decline in quality at GC?I hope it was an exceptionally terrible day for Griffintown Cafe, as the experience we had here was definitely exceptionally terrible. I usually get very excited for brunch, so I'm much more forgiving of mishaps. The cafe is cute enough for a brunch place with a kind of rustic, bright ambiance with an open kitchen, high ceilings and a back porch. The service was satisfactory to begin with; orders given, they ran out of some dishes.    A pregnant member of our party requested her eggs be 'well done'. Two hours later, we received our orders. 1-2 requests for water went unfulfilled. My eggs benedict was terrible. The hollandaise sauce tasted of mayonnaise. The toast was burned and the request for 'well done' eggs came back over easy. How do you mess up eggs? Griffintown knows the answer. No apologies were given for our LOTR-esque epic-length wait and moreover the service was brusque.I went to this café last week for an afternoon coffee. The atmosphere was lovely. There were few people since it was about 4:30 pm. My friend and I sat on the terrace. It was sunny, but the sun did not bother us; the seating outside was surrounded by trees serving as a natural parasol. I ordered a cappuccino with soya milk with a chocolate mousse. The two were delicious. If you are looking for a place to meet with friends in intimacy, this should definitely figure high on your list of options.

Review Text :
Bistro La Bon rates a solid four stars for service, food, presentation, and ambience... Don't let the location fool you. Just lock your car doors and hurry on in. They're not open on Mondays, so, since my twins are at camp this week, we came in on Tuesday.This place has tablecloths, cloth napkins, nice china, and relatively comfortable surroundings. They have four or five outdoor tables, and a surprisingly large indoor seating area, with a bar/lounge area near the entrance that looks pretty posh and comfy. Waiters are polished and polite, attentive without being smothering. They're also very enthusiastic, to the point of almost gushing about the food and how good it is. They're trying hard. The food IS good. Check out the menus in the photo section here. My wife and daughter and I sampled two small plates as appetizers, and devoured our three entrees. Entree portion sizes are just about right.The hummus is good, although we are hummus lovers, so we've had better (but not often). The olive, pickle, edamame sampler was yummy!They did a good job on everything else, too (see my photos). My wife thought the bok choy was a little salty, but my daughter liked it that way. I didn't try it.The dill potatoes were very tasty. The Salmon was great, according to my wife. Pan Seared Branzino (European Sea Bass) was excellent. I have no idea what's in that sauce, but it's decadent!The veggie sandwich looked great. I wish I had ordered that. My daughter could live to 100 if she keeps eating that stuff.The few suggestions I have for these folks are to put some art on the walls and to put some interesting treatments on the (rest of the) windows. The views of the industrial neighborhood and the power lines outside aren't that attractive. A bit of carpet, or sound-deadening material on the floors, ceiling, or walls, is in order, too, if possible. The place was pretty loud, and there were only six or seven other occupied tables there when we were.Those complaints are minor. All in all, this is a very nice restaurant. My daughter paid them her highest compliment: "I want my next boyfriend to bring me here." She's pretty picky, being a vegetarian AND lactose intolerant, and she found really satisfying choices here. I concluded I need an excuse to come back here and hang with friends in the bar for a while. It just looked relaxing.  Take $20 to $35 per person, depending upon hunger and thirst for alcohol. I think it's worth it.I came here for their raved about Sunday brunch. And sadly for my taste, it was a very big let down. While walking inside and enjoying their decor was very eye popping and intriguing, their food was "meh."They serve about 12 dishes (7 hot dishes) and they also have chocolate waffles and french toast. The waffles, toast, and eggs with bacon have to be ordered so the waiter brings them out. (No worries, they're part of the buffet)So why 2 stars? Here are the problems I felt uncomfortable with...1. $18 a pop?! I mean come on the variety of food isn't that extensive at the same time I felt as if none of the dishes popped out to me as absolutely amazing. I believe that 18 for brunch I paid for was presentation of food...2. The service - it was okay, I mean I did expect a little more. The cups I drank water out of was lets say, a little smelly? The waiters use rags to wipe the glass cups down, and well I think that's what makes glasses smelly.3. The food - as mentioned before, the food was okay. But the price of the brunch and the materials of the food didn't make sense. Think about it, Swedish meatballs one of their raved about dishes... Everyone compares it to Ikea, yes it's better but the price of it doesn't make sense. Probably the most expensive plate is the "smoked" salmon. To me, I didn't feel like that salmon was really smoked at the same time there was no taste in it (maybe because I didn't add the extra flavors to the salmon?)However, even these reasons are some of the reasons why this restaurant turn me off off..others can see why this restaurant is good. One thing I did notice is that all their food is really healthy. Their dishes didn't have that much oil, their most unhealthy dish is probably the brisket because of the fat. That, to me could probably make their prices a little more, but still I don't still quite believe it would be that much.Anyways, for me I rather go eat a vietnamese brunch on a Sunday spending a lot less for more variety and at the same time the healthy option is there for me to choose. Overall, I had a positive experience, but sadly this restaurant isn't quite my scene and brunch wise wasn't so great.

Review Text :
Grill it and They Will ComeAs long as chickens and mesquite trees continue sacrificing their lives for humankind, you might as well visit a place honoring both, plus your tastebuds. Pollo Correteado does one thing, mesquite grilling chicken, adding standard sides. They offer macaroni salad, mashed potatoes, and frijoles de olla - Mexican pork and beans. Pollo Correteado honors all three, giving your palate a Cinco de Mayo or Fourth of July (take your choice) explosion of delicious excellence. Chicken can easily be grilled into jerky. The day I ate here, the bird was tender and juicy.The salsa is mild, onions marinated down to tasty side elements, jalapenos warm and good, sliced lemons full of puckery, sweet condiment de Mexico. The frijols de olla that smoky traditional Mexican excellence that's not easy to find. Tear the meat from the bones and build your tacos as you wish. Supplement with a Mexican Coca-Cola over ice and it is feast time.I'm coming back. And I'll make sure some Saturday night our family tries Pollo Correteado.

Review Text :
Since the takeover of Red Stone Grill, we've been meaning to visit Straight Up Gaming and Martini Lounge.  A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.I remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.Happy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.After walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:* Potato Pancakes "Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream." ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.* Crab Cakes "Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish." ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.* Chicken Wings "Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style." (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! * Queso Cammarones "Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips." ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! Service - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! Other appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!Overall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! They also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!Mondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate KaraokeTuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 MargaritasWednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pmThursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnightFridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pmSaturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% AppetizersSundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!Update!  We returned the following week...* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus "Served with crispy tortilla chips." ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.We also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their "Spicy Garlic" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done. Oh well.

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best.    David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there.   I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

A co-worker introduced me to this nice little sandwich shop a few months ago.  I have been back several times since.  It's close to my work and the service is fast and friendly!  Every time I have been in it is the same dark haired women at the counter taking orders and it's just her.  She welcomes you with a smile and takes your order.  She has a small set up with a phone and a laptop and does triple duty.  They have a daily special usually a half sandwich and soup or salad combo with a drink and it's resonably priced.  You can get a decent lunch for under $10.  On a recent visit I had a 1/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of chicken chili.  The sandwich was fresh and the bread was soft and absorbed some of the condiments well.  I thought the flavor of the chili was nice with just a tiny bit of heat.  On another occasion I got a sandwich, chips and a drink for under $9. Nice!!  This is a small, cozy place.  There are several tables available but if you get there while they are super busy you might not get a table.  I've noticed they do a lot of to go business too.  No tables outside but if you work in that area, there are plently of grassy spots for a little picnic.  You can call in your order for pick up too.  Thanks Arizona Sandwich Company!

Review Text :
Cosmopolitan Hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We gamed a little to kill time before our dinner time at 6:00pm. Once we got there, it looked a little empty, just around the bar were full. We were seated right away, we had a nice view of the whole restaurant. We had two orders of Fois gras french toast $22., tuna tartare $18., tuna sashimi $18., half a dozen oyster $18., and a caesars salad. For dinner we had the sea bass - no good because it's not Chilean sea bass. , bone in ribeye - prepared great, seared big eye tuna - tasty, beef short rib - my friend said very tender and good. strawberry cobbler $16 - fruity flavor with cracker crusted rim dirty pearls $17 - vodka & blue cheese stuffed olives. It's different! White orchid $16. - not a sweet drink, smooth, vodka & slight gin We weren't going to have any dessert but was talked into ( in a good way) so we ordered the Warm Tres leches cake; Dulce de leche - coconut sorbet - crispy macaroon. It was so sweet.!!High energy and a good vibe with the food to match.The food at STK is very inventive, pairing ingredients that you wouldn't usually think work.  Its presented all prettied up.To start, the foie gras French toast is a must try.  It is served with the traditional green apple and sherry grastrique but with an almond brioche French toast? Sounds strange but I really works. The Beef tartare is also excellent with loads of black truffle and the delicious soy caramel.The Dover sole is very good but very traditionally prepared.  Can't mess with a classic I guess.  Its moist and works with the baked lemon and brown butter.   The seared tuna with wasabi potato, maitake mushrooms, and sweet miso is incredible.  All classic Japanese flavors fused successfully together.The steaks are good, well prepared, and tender but once again, this is not a steak lover's paradise.  You do not get to pick your cut and grade of meat.  I like my steak naked so I cannot speak to the sauces or toppings.Service is very good.Prices are in line with restaurants of this caliber (aps $15-$20, mains $30-$45).The wine list is good with prices on the high side.Sunday night we decided to have dinner with a couple friends at STK located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Let me tell you, it was probably the strangest dinner I have ever been to. I felt like I was in some type of music video or commercial. The patrons and servers were so over saturated with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yelling "action" from the top of his lungs! I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a "world-class DJ." There were girls fist-pumping, servers dancing while pouring wine, and people grinding between tables. I think I actually rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming! I grew up in Vegas, by way of the military (my dad was in the Air Force). I don't know if Las Vegas has always been like this or I can now see how semi-cheesy it is... Whatever the case, people were having fun and that was nice. More pics on my blogThis is the place to go to if you're looking for a steakhouse that isn't stuffy, conservative, or quiet. Other places around town try to pull off the same "cool kid" vibe but, unlike those spots, STK has some great food. I've heard from others how loud it can get, but we dined on a Tuesday night and, while it was busy, the music was at a decent volume -- low enough that we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. I was hoping to sit in the main dining area where they have nothing but booths, but we were seated in front of the bar in a loungey-type area with mostly 2- and 4-tops.The bleu butter bread that they start you out with was warm, fresh, and delicious. The half-dozen Kusshi oysters ($18) we had next were mild, meaty, and excellent. The pea agnolotti ($15) had an overpowering pea taste and, unfortunately, not enough of the goat cheese or pistachios that accompanied it. The final appetizer we had was their tuna tartare ($19). Sure, it's a common dish found in almost every restaurant these days, but their version is very good. Fresh chunks of tuna were sitting in a corn tuille, which added a bit of sweetness to the dish and a crunchy texture. The avocado cream under the tuille had cayenne pepper (I think?) that added a kick.My wife has been eating less and less lately, so we split the 14 oz. bone-in filet ($52). Wow! You had me at "bone-in"... drool-worthy, nom-worthy... hell, it's even sponge-worthy. One of the most tender and amazing filets I've had. We got the blue butter sauce with it, but really there was no need to put anything else on the steak.We got a side of haricot vert ($10) -- or green beans as ordinary folk like me call it -- that was tasty and firm. Not the slightest bit overcooked or soggy. The portions are large, so plan on sharing among three or four.Service was a bit spotty. Our waiter was nice enough, but he had at least six tables and was constantly running around. Meaning we didn't see him often. We sat around for almost half an hour before ordering our food. A little help for the wait staff might not be a bad idea.For all you Top Chef fans, Stephen Hopcraft (formerly of Michael Mina's Seablue) is the executive chef. But, whether you're a fan of the show or not, the bone-in filet is reason enough to stop by.4.5 StarsI took my company/party of 7 here for our holiday dinner. I had a previous experience at this restaurant where our waitor added an item to our bill which we did not know we ordered. They will confuse you about what you are actually ordering since it is ala carte. When it happened for the second time it was apparent as their common practice. Long story short, my secretary, a very young woman, asked the waitor to suggest a steak for her entre. The waitor suggested a steak to my secretary by name only and my secretary agreed. When we got the bill I found out it was a $180 special steak that was off the menu and no price had been quoted. Upon calling the manager she argued with me and was very defensive. Who wants to get ripped off at dinner?Hey Management! When someone calls in with a concern, you should not argue with them without first at least looking into the situation. We basically got scammed as if we were tourists in a foreign country. The manager who called me back was so defensive, never apologized and offered to buy me only drinks next time?? Wtf My bill was $1080.00???Never have I've been so ignored in a fine dining restaurant. I had high hopes for this place but so RUDE! Music was way too loud for a normal volume conversation. Practically had to scream to talk. As I'm reading other yelp reviews looks like STK DOES NOT HONOR RESERVATIONS, like they didn't honor mine.Food: 5/5 Skirt Steak 7oz.- Surprisingly my girls think I'm weird because I actually really skirt steak, if its cut right. Medium rare with a nice sear. Super juicy and flavorful. Yummy1/5 Bone in Rib Steak 20oz.- I didn't really care for this, It was delicious but a little tough. A lot tougher than the skirt steak which is surprising. Sides:1/5 Asparagus- not sure if this was cooked properly but It tasted a little cold. 2/5 Parmesan Truffle Fries- Very Fluffy and yummy but it had a strong over powering taste of garlic powder. Totally ruined it. Service:HORRIBLE!!! 0/5We had reservations at 11pm, I understand they close at 12am so you would think they would want to seat us right away and take our order, NO. The hostess kept us waiting telling us our table wasn't ready. Finally seated at 11:30pm, I wasn't going to rush for them but wow no server no introductions, no water or drinks offered. We had to ask our busser who our waiter was. I've never been so ignored.Nouveau riche 20 or 30 something or just wanna be a baller for a night?  STK has all the tools needed to make it happen.  An excess of foie, truffles, and caviar to golden bottles of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne; heck, there's even a live DJ to negate conversation (except for yelling or hand gestures) giving the excuse to text or checkup on one's social network fame.Oh, the food is good.Starters are upend takes on classics. The beef tartare packs a flavor punch, mixed with black truffle and served with peppery, sliced, crisp radish and a sweet and earthy soy caramel.  The flavors blend well.The foie, indulgent.  Large slice, pan seared, served with almond brioche French toast and a sweet, woodsy, sherry gastrique brightened by tart apples.Finally, one of the most decadent sliders (lil' BRGRs); American wagyu burger topped with foie and black truffles.  Pure decadence.  I'll leave the flavor to your imagination.Good selection of steaks in different sizes and cuts.  Servers claim the beef is USDA prime.  Seems correct.  Good texture, marbling, well trimmed, good sear and properly cooked to temperature.  The Bone in rib steak, bone in fillet, and porterhouse excellent.  There is a selection Wagyu cuts.  Never tried them since their country of origin unknown.  Maybe the word "Wagyu" is baller enough?Do not pass on the foie or truffle butter.  Both add a great flavor boost.  Tuck the compound butters under the steak so the heat releases the aromas trapped within.  Excellent.  Add a slab of foie and / or shaved truffles to kick up the flavors even more and increase the baller status.Steakhouse standard sides.  All meant to be shared.Very good wine list.  Passable service (it's difficult to communicate with the servers thanks to the music).Simply put, it's Vegas baby.I've found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas!  I made reservations way in advance for a friend's bachelorette party.  We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!  All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.Another reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner. The only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!I realize that STK is some hyper-cool, vowel-free play on the word "steak", but I also hoped that it might also be an acronym for something.  Perhaps "Sexy Trendy K____", but I couldn't think of an appropriate K-word.  Oh well.Linguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.I had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)I ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  ** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!Service was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect "Vanderpump Rules"-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.I was definitely impressed by STK.  The whole experience was PRFCT.This has become my favorite steak house in Las Vegas. It is a nice departure from the traditional steak house. The decor is modern. The music is a little louder and a lot more fun. There is even a DJ on weekends. This is a steak house where you can have a great meal and have some fun.Our server was excellent. She was attentive, friendly and very helpful. She did a good job holding a real conversation with us through out the evening.For our meal we started with the Pork Belly. It was great. It is a small portion that can only be shared by two or three people. The flavors were on point though. For my meal I ordered a Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese Crust and Bearnaise Sauce on the side. The steak was prepared perfectly. The flavors of the steak, crust and sauce combined for a great taste.For our sides we chose the Sweet Corn Pudding and the Mac & Cheese. The mac & cheese was creamy, rich and had good flavor. It is a solid side. The corn pudding, though, is fantastic. This was a great surprise. It sounds kind of boring and plain, but it had great flavor and textures. Definitely give it a try. You will not be disappointed.Dark, sexy and fun with awesome music! I should have mentioned the food above but in all honesty it's good but not amazing. This place should have amazing food because it's pricey and they have everything else going on. The vibe is a lot of fun, eye candy everywhere, some are even interesting which is a bonus, it's dark & sexy, the seating is perfect for groups, the music is great, the food is good but in my opinion needs some work. The issues - my steak was pricey and was very salty & had too many grisly parts. My goddess salad lacked in flavor & creativity. I also tasted my friends Caesar and it was pretty boring. As I mentioned I expect more when paying prices like these. The good - my friends seared tuna which was perfectly cooked & very flavorful. My friends skirt steak which was more tender then my sirloin and less salty. Our sides were very good, the perfectly cooked asparagus, decadent mac & cheese and the really great jalapeño cheddar grits that were super rich & creamy with just a hint of kick. Dessert was good but nothing amazing. I definitely didn't have any magical moments and I really wish I had. I also need to give a shout out to the complimentary hot buns that come out of the oven in an iron skillet with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The best part was the company with a large fun group and just having a good time together before the weekend begins! This place is great for larger parties and the service was good too.Review on the food to follow. Management addressed my issue within two seconds of voicing concern online and I appreciate that so much. Yelp really works.staying at the Cosmo so decided to try this placeI always try Kobe at steak places and there was no price on the menu.  I remember the server saying something about the steak being $60-100.  kind of forgot.  all I remember was she said minimum 4oz so I got 6oz.Chilean sea bass - was very good!  the texture was great and the mushrooms and veggies was good.  I didn't get the truffles on top so that saves about $20.lobster mashed potatoes - IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THIG I'VE EVER HAD.  it didn't even taste like potatoes.  we didn't even eat it. I should have asked to return it but my friend said it was weird.  and when I saw the bill it was $30!  ughhhh waste of money.I also looked at the bill and the Kobe was $240!!!!! OMGGGG DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT MUCH.  it was so tiny (as you can see from the pic).  good though but Mastro's has their kobe $125 for 10oz.  I think that's wayyyy more worth it than STK kobe.First, my wife is from a family of cattle ranchers so she knows beef and she loved this STK! From the oysters to the bread to the main dish, this is one fun, loud, happy place. The burrata salad was fantastic, the potatoes were great as was the wine list...I don't a single bad word to say. Ambiance=5Food=8Service=12Drinks=8It's off the charts good!Glad I went. Btw, not as pricy as people say. And worth every penny!!!I came to Las Vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like "Sex and the City!" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. Everyone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie "Oceans 11" with George Clooney..I came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.Appetizers:They give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.Salad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.Entrees:I ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.My colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. We ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:Creamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.Jalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.Mushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms sautéed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.The wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.DESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.This is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!

Restaurant name  Pepe's Tacos 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I love three things in life:  My mom, my bulldog and Mexican food...perhaps not even in that order (sorry mom!)  Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's "best of" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. Well to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare "It was much adoo about nothing."  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).  Some of the other reviews of this place seem a bit harsh as the place does it what it needs to do for being a hole in the wall Mexican taco shop.  Award worthy?  Probably not.  Lunch worthy?  Anytime...especially if my mom is paying (sorry again Mom!)

Restaurant name  Soyo Korean Barstaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
On a big stretched popular street in a big city of Korea, there are great number of neon glow of theme cafes, pubs, bars, or restaurants are located side by side. It's always lively and fun! In the past, I've been to lots of late night eatery places just like 'Soyo Barstaurant' back in my home town and the other night, I was hoping that this might be the place I can have a great time with a small group of friends on typical Friday or Saturday nights in Las Vegas. Yup! I think I found one :p Soyo is a great place to grab a bite to eat & a drink. These are the things that I like to share with you after tasting their foods and drinks:) 1. Atmosphere-comfortable booth, simple color of decoration and design, music is mixed & fun(the most recent K-pop music plus some American pop songs were playing, no signs of smoking inside of restaurant 2.Food Selections- The menu is extensively focusing on traditional favorites(Korean-style appetizers) & dinner for 2-4 cooked on the plate of steel(ex: I had a bean sprouts, pork ,squid, & vegetables with spicy sauce cooked on the table. All dinner comes with small dishes such as kimchi, radish kimchi, cucumber pickles, stir fried fish cake w/ onion, spinach , & etc.) 3.Drink- Domestic or Korea beer, Soju of choice, Soju with flavors(ex: I tried their pineapple & lychee this time,, sweet, fruity, & yogurt taste :p) I remember my friend used to joke with me~ a liquor, Soju, is a elixir of life?!  A Soju is the best cure for a Soju hangover??? LOL I Love SOJU!!! 4. Service-Attentive & very friendly :) The server was smiling all times and brought over things to my table whatever I needed. Never run out with my free roasted barley tea with ice. I wish we have more fun places for the locals in town..Soyo is a good local combined BAR & RESTAURANT spot you can hang out with your buddies until late at night! I think I will be visiting Soyo again real soon~~~A decent Korean restaurant in the southwest area without breaking the bank!We've been meaning to hit up Soyo Barstaurant for awhile, so was pretty happy when one of our friends suggested that place for her birthday dinner.We had a pretty huge group - at least twenty people.  We easily took over the two long tables in the middle, although there was still plenty of room in the booth-like tables, and in the little loft area on the right when you enter.One thing I definitely appreciate are the bottles of iced Korean tea readily available on the tables.  This makes life (for customers and employees) so much easier because then you don't have to wave the staff down for refills every few minutes.  The unusual thing (for most of us) were the gold bowls on the tables.  We could only assume they were cups for drinking, but were a bit unsure.They started off with three different kinds of banchan that evening - cabbage kim chee, string beans, and fish cake.  A bit skimpy on the banchan side of things, but was overlooked.Four of us decided to share a few items:* Kim Chee Fried Rice ($7) - This was topped with a fried egg.  It was REALLY good, surprisingly tasty and really enjoyable.  Something I don't usually order, but would definitely order again at Soyo.* Beef Short Ribs with Korean BBQ Sauce ($12) - A bit tough to eat, but had a good flavoring and the right amount of time on the grill.  We couldn't complain about the price either.* Spicy Pork Ribs ($10) - Another dish that the boys devoured and enjoyed.  The price wasn't too bad for this dish as well.* Spicy Soft Tofu with Seafood, Beef or Pork Soup ($8) - I was pretty stuffed by the time this dish arrived.  It was pretty standard for a soft tofu soup, and I chose the seafood option for it.They also have quite a few things they describe as "Korean tapas" and lots more entree options.The only real complaint was the service.  It was a bit understaffed with only two people working.  They should have had another person, especially with our large party that took over.  We had to remind them about certain items - rice, for example.Overall, everyone was surprised with how the bill turned out.  Even with alcohol, it was a lot less expensive that most people thought it was going to be.  Soyo Barstaurant is a welcome addition to the area and we hope they stick around.  They're open late too!Maybe it's because it's dipped nearly 20 degrees in the last week in Vegas, but I seriously think it's brrrrrr cold!!  When it's cold, I think of any food that's warm and cozy (ramen, chicken noodle soups, jigae, beef stews, pho, cinnamon rolls).  Soyo sure fits right into the warm and cozy because they offer all kinds of Korean comfort food.  We enjoyed...1.  starchy potato pancakes - Might I say even more enjoyable than the kimchi pancakes?2.  seafood soondubu - It's got a combination of tangy, spicy and warm your belly goodness!3.  chicken wings in special sauce - these are some mutant wings!  they are gi-normous!  delicious.4.  dolsot bi bim bap - this totally hit the spot for the windy days this past weekend.  it was hot.  not spicy hot, but HOT in a stone pot!  i love how this dish is always presented in a hot stone pot, but soyo really does it right.  The mix of rice, veggies, and beef comes out seriously sizzling, so when you go to toss it with the sauce, you have to really dig in to scrape the now crispy rice membrane at the bottom.  for those crispy rice lovers, that is certainly not a bad thing!  chewy, crispy, tasty rice!Conclusion:  Korean comfort food at it's best.p.s.  bomb panchan.I am a frequent visitor at Soyo and love this place a lot. This time, I would like to share several menu items while drinking alcohol beverages such as Soju or Macju(Beer) :P The service has been truly excellent by the friendly staffs.. They seem to always be on the move, efficient, and very polite people. **Corn Cheese-basically corn baked with a cheese sauce in a sizzling hot pan that makes it gooey, crunchy, sweet, and salty. Seems like they added some chopped onion, scallion, carrots, jalapenos(all kinds of veges), & panko bread crumbs(crunchy) for more flavors. It's a MUST-HAVE in the appetizer! **Starchy Potato Pancakes 'Kamja Jun'-It's under the special menu(written in Korean on the wall)and their Potato Pancakes were really tasty! This pancake is made out of fresh potatoes, instead of flour (it's more healthier). Because of this, the consistency and appearance of the pancake is quite unique, slightly chewy and almost translucent. The Potato Pancakes are the best served fresh off the pan so when it comes to your table, go ahead and enjoy it right away. Me and my friends really liked this dish the most out of any appetizers :) **Steamed Pork, Napa cabbage, & Oyster 'Bossam'-It's a cooked pork belly, you wrapped with nicely salted napa cabbage and tasty Bossam Kimchi. Bossam Kimchi is specially made for 'Bossam' and it's more sweeter and more vegetables(radish & fresh oysters) in there compare to regular Kimchi. For Bossam, Kimchi is not an option. It's one of main component to complete this dish. It also comes with Ssamjang sauce (bean paste with sesame oil & garlic) and Saeujeot (pickled fermented shrimp) that you can create you own style of Ssam!!! It really depends on your preference and this is how I like to eat my Bossam :) It can be really spicy so stay out of this dish if you can't handle the spiciness. **Fried Dumpling 'Kun mandu'-The server told us that they make their own version of dumplings at Soyo. The filling were clear noodles, ground beef, cabbage, scallion, onion, & firm tofu..It is best to eat immediately with vinegar-soy dipping sauce.I went to Soyo with the Yelp Elites after an Elite Event. I have driven past this place a couple hundred times and never would have thought about stopping in if it hadn't the official after Event dinner spot.Soyo isn't very large, but they were able to handle our group of around 20 without much trouble. The place is much different than the other korean places I've dined (most have been AYCE). The meal started with some cold Roasted Barley Tea, which wasn't really too great IMO (a little too smokey), but I'm always open to try something new, and the waiter later brought me water with a pitcher to refill my glass.The menu isn't the biggest in town (around 50 items), but everything I tried was really really good.I am a Korean Food rookie and stick with what I know, The Bulgogi, and I can say it was without a doubt the best bulgogi I've had in vegas. The meat was tender, the veggies were crisp, the sauce was flavorful but not overbearing, and the hot clay pot it was served in was a nice touch. I will be going back for this dish alone, however that was not the crowning jewel of the evening.One part of the Korean eating experience (and it goes double when you are with yelpers) is sharing. I got to try a bunch of items I would never had ordered on my own.Their Dumplings were amazing, I am slowly trying my best to eat vegas out of dumplings, and these were nothing short of yummy!  I also tried the Fish Cake Soup, and while it wasn't what I had in mind (how do ribbons of fish count as cake?), it was surprisingly good.But the Dish that stole the night was Budae Jjigae, I am going to be honest I have never heard of Budae Jjigae before, and without this trip and the brave souls who ordered it, I may never have. It's a stew that consists of random meats married with ramen noodles, and served boiling hot in a spicy (but not too hot) sauce. The meats in the Budae Jjigae served last night appeared to be Spam, Hot Dogs, Vienna Sausages, and possibly more. I have a feeling after my diet is completed I will be doing my best to finish an order or two of Budae Jjigae!The Ban Chan were all pretty good, the rice was your standard white rice, the raddish was really good, and the Kim Chi was nice (I prefer mine cooked rather than cold however).One thing I did learn, when they say Spicy on the menu at a Korean Resturant they mean SPICY!!! One Yelper ordered the Spicy Pork Ribs, I tried a piece of cabbage with the Spicy Sauce and think I burnt a layer of taste buds off my tounge!I really like the set up at Soyo, the service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty fun, and after a while the Kpop music grows on you.Oh and they have 2 tiny arcade consoles that looked pretty fun, but I was afraid to play as they looked like I could break them by just looking at them funny, yet alone playing them.Kudos Soyo I will be backSOYO = #1 Vegas Korean hot spot!!!My boys... supercr3w/ jabbawockeez  love coming here. I came here last month with the boys... and I was super excited since I've been wanting to try Soyo after reading their rave on yelp.I had the Kalbi and bulgogi! 2 solid choices!I can't wait to come back for more kalbi & bulgogi!!I don't do spicy/hot  nor do I drink alcohol so my korean choices are limited but the kalbi and bulgogi is more then enough to make me come back to Soyo!Love the indoor seating. cool drinking cups.Casual dining. stress free parking. no wait (when I went that night).If you're visiting Vegas or a local and looking to get your korean on... make it SOYO!I'll be back SOYO!-Miss Yelp 2011 :DHeard a lot of great things from Yelpers at past events so we finally stopped here after looking at houses around this area.  Really cool atmosphere inside and everything on the menu conveniently goes great with BEER!!Hite beer is great.  I feel like I could guzzle a gallon of this and feel good enough to operate heavy machinery or at least finish second on Jeopardy.  3 dishes is MORE than enough for 2 people.  I will definitely bring a group next time to try all the other great looking dishes we saw being served to others.  We got the kalbi, kimchi pancake and the kimchi and pork soup.  All of them were great and we left totally stuffed.Soyo now gets the five star treatment from me.  Service is always excellent and is able to cater to my party, whether it's two people or twelve people.  They have no problem pushing together several tables to accomodate large parties.  The staff here is extremely friendly and very open about their menu.  Not only will they tell you what is good, they'll also tell you what is not so good.  I think one big thing that Soyo has going for them is that the staff speaks English pretty well, which makes things a bit more convenient for us non-Koreans.I can safely say that food here has remained consistent, since my friends and I have ordered the same dishes many times over several visits.  The Budae Jjigae is still delicious, and if you ask them for more broth/soup they will bring it!  We asked for enough refills on soup last time that they even gave us more ramen noodles.  They know we enjoy their jjigae.We're now on a mission to try the whole menu, and everything we've tried has been good.  Recently I've tried the Blood Sausage and the Very Spicy Chicken.  The blood sausage was tasty, and came with some vegetables and clear noodles.  The Very Spicy Chicken is very spicy (spicy in, spicy out).  Order it mild or medium, and you have a delicious chicken dish with some spice and mozarella cheese on top.There are also special nights throughout the week now.  Tuesday nights are ladies night, where you can get drink specials if your party has 3 or more girls; no guys allowed in your party though!  I believe the drink special was 2 for 1 drinks, but I'm not positive (I'm not a lady, so it doesn't apply to me!)  On Wednesday through Sunday nights, if your party spends around $75 you get to spin their wheel.  Prizes range from nothing, to free cocktails/beer, to a $50 credit for food.  Lucky for me, the group I go with will almost always spend $75!It is safe to say that Soyo is easily one of my top Repeat Eats!  Enough so that now there's a new Yelp Las Vegas acronym: SUYE (Soyo UYE)!Soyo is a popular dinner and late night hangout spot that attracts mainly the younger Asian clienteles. Although I have seen much older patrons having a late supper here as well.  Soyo which called itself a "barstaurant" has a menu that is dominated by Korean tapas, and rounded out by some items in the soup, entrees and casseroles categories, and of course beers, ales and "cocktails", which in Soyo-speak for flavored soju.It is an establishment that is best visited with a decent size group of friends, as ordering food and sharing it family style is the best way and arguably the more cost-effective approach to enjoy Soyo's menu.  And having a Korean speaking friend is most helpful when ordering, as most items do not have English names, just descriptions or list of ingredients for each menu items. Below are menu highlights that our group have enjoyed in past visits.Marbled Beef - Thinly sliced sautéed beef with onions with a slightly sweet flavor, served with Korean salads and dipping sauces.Grilled Squid and Garlic  - Highly recommended for garlic lovers, as there are a lot of garlic in this appetizer presented in a foiled parcel.  The slightly sweet sauce is perfect with a side of rice.Smelt Roe with Seaweed over Rice - served in hot stone bowl.  It is best to let the rice gets crispy by the super hot stone bowl, before mixing everything together and diving in.Very Spicy Grilled Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese On Top - The two chilies warns you to avoid it if you can't handle the heat, because even at 'mild' it will still burn you at least once.  But it is a perfectly delicious dish for those that enjoy walks on the spicy side of life. Gop Chang Soup/Casserole - served with beef intestine, tripe, vegetables and noodles in a spicy broth.  This is best shared with 2 or more.Boo Dae Soup/Casseroles - This became famous around US Army base in Korea, as it is an American fusion spicy broth made with ingredients (hot dogs, ham, cheese) that are available to US military personnel. Adding a side order of instant ramen noodles completes the authenticness of this item.Anchovy Hot Noodle - noodle served in a mild anchovy broth, it was a surprisingly good and simple bowl hot noodle soup.Decor:  3.5/5Food:  4/5  A lot to select from, best enjoyed with a decent size group of friends.Service:  4/5  They are always friendly.Soyooooooooo was off the chain.  Come on, if you've been there already, admit you wanted to bob your head a little while you were eating.  Stop lying to yourself.  I even heard a new melodic rendition of Hit em Up.  I was sold when I walked in.   Between the elevated, tall, secret table on your right as your walk in, the tin bowls to drink tea in, and the music taking me back to the Source Awards in the early 90's, I was in a special moment.Onto the food.......We ordered the Marbled Beef which was alright.  The Buhdaejjigae was comforting and for only $2 more, you can get extra noodles.The Grilled Squid and garlic was awesome, but I wish I could have paid more for more squid or bigger pieces.   The star of the show was the Korean Beef Short Ribs with Vegetable Stew.  I wouldn't be suprised to see this on a future episode of Best Things I Ever Ate in Vegas, because like one of my friends says, it's like candy......or short rib crack.  If you haven't been to Soyoooooo, Hit em Up!Soyo is a fun neighborhood spot that has successfully created a fun bar atmosphere whilst serving great korean food.I've never been to Korea so what I'm about to say makes no sense.  Soyo makes me feel Korean the moment I walk in. I've always wanted to be Korean so it's like a dream come true. I'm partially joking... I went through high school listening to K-pop so the fact they play nothing but K-pop is enough of a reason for me to come back time and time again. Lucky for me, their food is fantastic also. They serve all the typical Korean dishes that most of  us are familiar with and some + American favorites such as french fries and chicken wings. My favorite dishes to order;Kalbi(short ribs)Soon Dubu Jjigae (tofu soup)Dduk Bokki( spicy rice cakes)both the spicy and fried chicken wings bibimnaengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles)I'm here a few times a month since it's so close to my house and open late. I have yet to have a terribly bad experience. Service is a hit or miss...Miss most of the time...This is probably because I'm not actually Korean :( But that's ok...I am not needy. Keep feeding me delicious food and continue to play the awesome tunes that you do... I will be a loyal fan.With all due respect to my local pub(in Vegas)sometimes I just needto kick it with some sojuand Korean Fried Chicken.Thank goodnessSoyo Korean Barstaurantfits that bill during those times of need.The placeis alive with the sounds of K-pop, accented with cool lighting,and houses some super old school video games(we're talking Super NES quality gaming here).Yet it's still surprisingly chillthanks to strategically placed boothsalong with super friendly patrons and staff.The foodsupplies me that comforting combination deep fried and spicewhich not only entices the palatebut also opens up the senses.But what really sets this bar / restaurantapart from other Korean spotsis their Soju.Imagine a perfectly blendedsmoothie.It is neither too sweet nor too wateryand is cool and refreshing and very relaxing.Now imagine that same drinkgetting you completely blato.Good stuff.Overall,it's a great place.My experience with Soyo was disappointing.  I ordered two items from the tapas section of the menu--chicken gizzards with garlic and onion and son doo boo.  The chicken gizzards were good, chewy but that's the nature of the meat.  The son doo boo is supposed to be in beef broth.  The water the two pieces of tofu rested in shouldn't be referred to as broth.  Broth connotes some type of meat/fish flavor.  This had none.  It was merely a watery dish with a side of hot dipping sauce.It was the wrong day to go to Soyo.  The place is very small.  The tables are such that it's not a good place for a person eating alone.  I was there a little after 5:30 and there were only a few people in the restaurant.  Within a very short time, young people getting dinner before going to EDC came in and I was taking up a table that could seat four or even six.  There was an error with my order and rather than have them bring the correct item ordered, I hurriedly finished and paid the bill so someone else could have the table.There are too many good choices out there.  Soyo won't be a do over for me.I have been dining at this restaurant for many years. Generally speaking, I think 4 stars is right on the money.First of all, this may be the best Korean dining room in Vegas. And, it would be hard to argue against that. Upon entering, one could be forgiven if they thought they were mistakenly transported to a hole in the wall joint in Seoul. The year round Christmas lights emphasizes that fact.The service here is also pretty good. The servers are very attentive as well. They will constantly refill the water and ask to refill the banchan side dishes if needed.Food wise, I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's good. They give great "bang for your buck" value. Don't be fooled by the "tapas" menu, these are entree sized portions! My favorite item to get here is the soondae bokeum (pork blood sausage that is spicy stir fried with veggies). That's a hard dish to find in this town, and they do it pretty well except that it's a bit too spicy for me, and that the veggies aren't as crisp as I would have liked.I will continue to come here. Great value, ambiance, and a great place for something that's definitely a little bit different, but very good all around!Light, fluffy pillows of tofu soup!!!...Spicy, elastic buckwheat noodles!!!...Flavorful slices of marbled beef!!!...There are so many great things to enjoy at Soyo!It took far too many years for me to include Korean food as one of the mainstays when eating out. I think it was because I was so dreadfully afraid of receiving a KOREAN KIMCHI SLAP...and if you're not familiar with that, you should google that now and rest assured that you are in no danger of such a horrible experience happening at Soyo. I know this because my Asian wife told me it's more dramatic if it happens at home.The bibimnaengmyeon is my favorite.  It is cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with some fresh root veggies for a little texture. It is a little on the spicy side, but an ancillary benefit is that it helps to clean you out the morning after. Another Soyo favorite is their Soondubu Jjigae (Spicy Tofu Soup). I don't mind tofu, but I rarely looked forward to ordering tofu until I came across this dish. Korean heat is one of my favorite styles for spicy foods.  This dish balances that heat, with rich and full flavors. A final go-to is Soyos Chaa Dol Baak E Boo Choo Moo Chim Salad. This dish is certainly light on the salad and plentiful with thin slices of marbled beef. What the salad brings is a nice bit of acid to cut the fattiness of the savory beef.Soyo is a "Barstaurant" which, best as I can tell, means it's a restaurant that can at times have a fun, slightly lively, feeling going on when the Soju is flowing freely. Still the name is a bit vexing. In general, it is just a cool Korean restaurant...so stop by and check it out if you're looking for good Korean eats!My fave Korean bar in Cali/Vegas!! Very clean, but still retains that modern "grungy" Korean Bar feel...food is very decently priced, especially since everything is so darn yummy!! Only weird thing was that we literally got checked up on by EVERY employee and manager and cleaning people...meaning we got asked if we needed anything every 5 minutes or so, and people watched our dishes like a hawk and took it away once empty, which made me feel like i had to eat faster so they could stop looking and take it away. Never really thought that would be an issue, but it was a bit awkward after a while. The food that we got were all delicious--its rare to find a place that has decent gochujang (most in Cali are watered down and way too sugary)--but this has it! The fried rice cake is yum, as was the galbijjim. To be honest, I've had better cheese corn, but I'm not complaining! The cold noodle (nangmyun) was also a favorite of ours...soondae was only so-so, but once again, good enough to make me happy so whatevs!We are DEFINITELY coming back here on our next trip to Vegas...I'll be missing it til then!I feel that I'm often the last one to try a lot of popular restaurants in Vegas, and I'm glad that I've finally checked this one off my list.Soyo is a Korean restaurant in Southwest Las Vegas. I had trouble seeing the name on the facade at first, but it's on the southern corner of a building that it shares with a few other businesses, perhaps most notably Oyshi Sushi. Not many people were utilizing the outside seating area, which is expected in the summer. I didn't actually find out where the "bar" of the "barstaurant" is, but I'm sure it has to exist.Anyway, the main indoor dining area has a pleasant ambiance. It has an interesting feel with the concrete flooring, largely pale wooden walls, bookshelves, and rather dated appliances including a television set and some arcade games. There are some rather charming booths that are elevated slightly above the ground, but our large group took up a table or two on the floor. The largely K-pop music wasn't stifling in loudness, but it's noticeable during conversation. I really liked the cushions that they provide because it never came to mind even once during the meal that I was sitting on a wooden bench.You'll definitely want to drink something here, even if it's non-alcoholic. The complimentary barley tea is my favorite rendition of this drink so far. The barley flavor is cleaner than what most places serve, but it doesn't taste watered down. I probably could have finished the entire pitcher by myself. By the way, they didn't serve it in bowls, which I'm sure would have been awkward.I also had a couple shots of the yuzu soju. It's not very alcohol-heavy, but it's sweet and clear with a wonderful yuzu flavor. If you haven't enjoyed this particular type of citrus before, this is as good a chance as any.The food was good overall. The Japchae ($10) with bulgogi (+$2) was really delicious. Really smooth noodles with egg, beef, and thinly sliced veggies. I would order it again. The soondubu ($8) with my choice of seafood is a bargain compared to most other places and tastes delicious even without the egg, which is either an add-on or was misplaced somewhere by the wait staff. Loved the broth, which came out mild per my request, as well as the silky tofu and the various seafood bits (shrimp, mussel, clams, octopus). It's my favorite soondubu in Vegas so far.The LA-style galbi ($15) was good too, but I typically prefer a sweeter marinade on the meat. There may also be some small inconsistencies with the cooking temperature due to wide variations in how they cut apart the meat, not that the texture was at all tough or that I've gotten sick or anything. I kinda wish that I'd opted for the seemingly popular garlic chicken wings now instead, but at least there's always next time.The complimentary banchan (side dishes) were a bit of a mixed bag. I really liked the kimchi and I enjoyed the broccoli, but I disliked the surprising crunch of one of the items that looked to me like sliced skin-on tofu. Also, the crunchy chunks of some juicy radish-like root vegetable seemed atypical and out of place, and nobody ever asked if we wanted seconds.I also managed to sample a few other items from around the table. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon, or however they anglicized it here) was delicious, with prominent octopus pieces in at least my chunk of the pancake. The dduk bok e (from the first page of the menu) tasted pretty good and wasn't too spicy for me, but I'm just not a fan of the rice dumplings. I'd describe their texture as a "mushy" chewy, which I'm sure is intentional but just isn't my favorite thing to have in my mouth. I also enjoyed a sample of the beef from what appeared to be a bulgogi with dressed chopped lettuce.I'd love to return to Soyo to try more of their dishes. There's not much competition in terms of Korean food in this particular part of town, but they're doing a great job regardless.Staycation, Vegas edition continues...  Wife was sick at beginning of vacation and Monkey coming down with something(hopefully just allergies) during second half, so now our great outing turned into a stay-away-from-work/visit parentals staycation...  I know Phillip say 3 dishes is more than enough for two people...  But does that include tapas?  Long, lopsided day and Soyo open til 3am on Thursday, so here we are.  Pigging out.  Monkey do:26 COLD BUCKWHEAT NOODLES w/beef- Good and icy cold35 GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS- Taste great, better than most places we've been, but bloody at the bone on 3 out of 6 wings. Skip the salmonella next time38 GRILLED SQUID- Snippets of squid legs, garlic, jalapeños wrapped in foil, then heated on grill. Weak 55 HANDMADE FLAT DUMPLINGS- Tasty ufo-shaped potstickersSame great service, friendly and not too loud atmosphere.  Monkey shall definitely return to try other dishes and hope to bump up another star for consistency.When I'm craving for spicy Korean soup, Soyo is where I want to be! Enjoy now and suffer later :) Their spicy ramen soup with different sausages reminds me of my college years eating cheap instant noodle soup to get through exam week! Who said spam is only for emergency food?!? Haha! This soup is my ultimate food for zombie apocalypse! LOL!Their amazing garlic chicken is cooked perfectly and blended with their special sauce...making this a winning entree for me rather than an appetizer. The crispiness of the chicken with the garlic seasoning surely makes this my favorite choice! Then there is the bibimbap with bulgogi served in a hot stone plate...you can never go wrong with this dish! The crispy rice on the bottom is an added treat. The protein, veggies and rice served in one is definitely one to order when in doubt. The restaurant is not that big to handle a large group. However, they do offer outside seating, but the ambience and the nice decor is not comparable. The service for me is hit or miss. Overall, this is a great place to dine in and prices are not over priced compare to other Korean restaurants around town.

Date night, my lovely wife requested that we find a place that offered French Onion Soup. Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of "compact" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.I kid you not, my wife said "That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States." So it has that going for it.George's will likely be our "go to" spot for romantic evenings.My first experience at Georges Brasserie came down to this simple mathematic equation.$25 Brunch Bar + all you can eat Oysters on the half shell +$12 bottomless Mimosas = extreme happiness and gluttony!Picture yourself, Sunday morning, seated across from you friends. Shades on, fresh coffee and hot Beignets served on a fresh, white snap tablecloth. The patio oozes European flair. Slicked back hair waiters twirl platters of Oysters and Mignonette, followed by Grilled Shrimp daydreaming on Gruyere Polenta. Carafes of high grade Mimosas magically refill themselves. Now Chilled Shrimp dance the Cancan around eggs and prime rib as they push perfectly Carmalized Crème Brulees closer and closer to tempt you. Georges Brasserie truly is brunch Fantasia! Tout est merveilleux!!!

"Just a spoonful of sugar, helps the pizza go down"I think that little ditty was the kitchen's motto when this place was Nello's, in Old Town...not any more:)I never really cared for Nello's all that much...just too sweet in the sauce department for my taste...not just the pizza, but pretty much everything they made that used red sauce of any kind.I'm happy to say that Jac bought this place last week, changed the name and threw away the bags of sugar that must have been littering the kitchen:)The result is a very much improved, pizza centric, Italian dining experience:)The Beautiful Carin and I met another couple for dinner at Jac's last evening...a double date...we're feeling social again:)None of us knew that Nello's had changed hands...we went back and forth with texts to make sure that we were in the right spot...very entertaining:)But once we were in, it was clear that things had changed...and for the better:)Carin and I each had a well made vodka martini...for $3.00 a pop...made with decent vodka, too!We had appetizers...including a very well done bowl of mussels in a vodka sauce that was "lick the bowl" good (although I didn't actually lick the bowl...much like when I was actually dating, Carin tells me that I should be on my best behavior when we are double dating...I don't know why...it's not like we're going home with them...but I was good:)The new pizza menu at Jac's offers new and interesting artisan options, including the well done "Margherita" and a "Bela Dela Meat" something or other that was wonderful!These pizza's were savory, well made, smokey from the wood oven and they were huge! :-)We had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizza:)A great value at under $80 US money for four of us, including multiple cocktails, two big pizza's and two appetizers:)Finally, while the décor hasn't changed, the atmosphere has...the cherry on top of the whipped cream was the delightful little jazz combo playing in the corner...at a level that gave us a great background music for our date, yet still let us carry on a conversation (Carin tells me that's a rule of dating...getting to know someone...so many dating rules...I thought I was done with all that...now I find that the rules are doubled for double dates:)If you still need the sweet red sauce hit, ask them to bring the sugar bowl to the table...otherwise, drop by Jac's and enjoy the marti's and the pizza...oh, and get yourself a bowl of the mussel's...you can thank me when you see me:)

Review Text :
11/25/11After checking out a movie at AMC and a bit of shopping at Northlake, the rest of the family wanted to grab a bite.  On our way to Friday's, a nephew mentioned Steak 'n Shake, which went over well w/ the adults, since it was cheaper than the original choice of Friday's, and me, since I felt like having something sweet!  The wait was moderate, but it was Black Friday, after all...Manager asked if we minded getting two tables pulled together, and we said "no problem."  We ended up sitting in two booths, across a foot path and adjacent from each other...  Two of the children ordered a steak burger and chicken fingers, both w/ fries.  Mom had a cup of chili w/ onions and cheese, and I ordered a strawberry milkshake to share.  Kids enjoyed their meals, Mom thought the chili http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=hbKt52iPDQduRiz1huRszQ was mediocre ("the chili at the Sam Adams bar in that airport was much better!"), and I thought that the milkshake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was too sweet.  We stopped halfway, and I decided I'd order my original choice of Hershey Special Dark.  This was much better-- not very sweet!  Nice that this also came w/ a few chocolate chips sprinkled on top... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=Jj17ry6dfdmjRpa3eh2OggHad to remind our server of the kids' forgotten mini-shakes.  An order of onion fries arrived that no one ordered-- very cool of the manager to offer it to us, anyway!  (That's how it should be, btw... rather than serving up soggy fries to the intended guest or throwing them away.)  Seems like everyone deemed the meal satisfactory.Maybe next time I can check out other menu items...

Restaurant name  McDonald's

Review Text :
This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal.My most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!)Overall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas.What can I say about McDonald's??? Picking up food for my mother in law and wifey, mom specifically requested a Big Mac so up I go for a 5 minute drive. I ordered nuggets, fries and a Big Mac. Guy took my order accurately. I pulled up and told him I'd be paying with Apple Pay, he put the scanner out the window and a second later my order is payed for. Apple Pay is soooo convenient. Since I ordered like 30 nuggets I asked for extra ketchup which the girl in the second window was nice enough to include. The whole process was probably less than 4 minutes. Fast food was fast. The nuggets were spicy which was weird but I like spicy so it's all good in the hood. Wifey and mom enjoyed their food, will be coming here again in the near future due to working in the area.Eff you McDonalds, eff you! You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....I cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as McDonald's. Their food is not fresh, but frozen so really the only rating, aside from food, is the cleanliness, staff etc.This place is packed and understaffed. It was about midnight and I could see 2 people working behind the counter making the food. The manager was doing her best to keep the food coming out of the kitchen, but clearly was short handed. Napkins were empty, and floors were sticky.The food even tasted worse by McDonald's standards. Just not a good experience.I come to McDonald's for emergencies only.

Restaurant name  Omelet House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Time for possibly the fastest turnaround ever on a review.Just got home from Omelet House, the Boulder and Russell location. It's just a few minutes from my house, and I was a bit apprehensive because of the mixed reviews. However, when I saw that it was doing brisk business at Sunday brunch hour (11:30), my fears were allayed.It's the Omelet House, so of course I went straight to the omelet menu. I was almost gonna order the Lobster Fest, but I figured it couldn't have that much authentic lobster if it wasn't $15+. I decided on the Bugsy Siegel (#16) instead, which they say is roast beef  in an Italian red sauce, sour cream, and jack cheese. Within a couple of minutes, our server had brought out my pumpkin bread. While the texture is moist, the flavor is good, not great. When I got to the second half of the bread, I had to use a little bit of butter to offset the growing blandness. I slightly preferred my friend's banana nut bread, which I'm definitely going to have next time I'm here.My omelet was just good. It was little overdone and a little bland, which are safe things to do at a diner, but you can't excel if you don't take risks. I might ask them to "undercook" it by half a minute or something next time and see if they'll consent. Oh, and the omelet really is as huge as they say. I might've been able to finish it had I tried harder, but I spared my belly and took about a third of it to-go. Be ready to do the same, or consider sharing the omelet with a friend.The fried potato slices (they're all a little too thick and some are not crunchy enough to be called "chips") were the real star of the show. They come with some dried parsley (?) flakes and some pepper, and they go well with a little bit of Heinz ketchup. They also add a bit of saltiness to the omelet. I also tried some of the Mexi-Chicken, which killed my sensitive taste buds with jalapeno, and the cinnamon apple stuffed french toast, which was yummy and not at all dwarfed by the syrup.This is definitely a nice breakfast joint, and for about $9, it's a very good value. Check it out when you're on this side of town!Omelet House puts together a strong Midwestern style breakfast experience.I stopped for a meal while in Vegas by direction of a colleague recently and was immediately transported to the Midwest by the feel of the menu and interior, even the friendly server made me wonder if I was in Minneapolis or Kansas City. The menu is enormous and offers just about any breakfast staple that you could imagine. It took considerable time to decide upon the Chili Verda Skillet Breakfast, something I figured I could not find at home in OC. This Southwestern number combines Chili Verda served over home fried potatoes, onions, peppers, and Ortega chilies which is then topped with two eggs and Jack cheese. All killer, no filler and with a $9.49 price of admission, I would try it again happily. The downers include a less that sterile environment in the dining area and disgusting bathrooms. Considering the locale, I am sure this isn't a deal killer locally but it drops a 4 star meal down a notch for this Yelper.So I tried this place a long time ago when they first opened and it was very ehh, cold, overcooked food but my dad was craving breakfast so we decided to give them a try since it's near my parent's house. What a complete turnover! I got the Lobster Benedict, and my dad got the Chicken Fried Steak and both were loaded with flavor. It's funny because I really don't like omelets but even though they have a bunch of omelet options they also have a lot of other choices for breakfast as well as sandwiches and hamburgers!So if you've never been here, there they don't have hashbrowns, they have spuds. Basically homemade thick potato chips. I was kind of iffy about these but our server told us we could have them soft so they're closer to the textures of potatoes in potato gratin or we could have them crispy. My dad and I went with the soft spuds and they were just as good as hashbrowns in my opinion.Now I was really surprised with my Lobster Benedict. There was probably about  5 inch thick pieces of lobster on each english muffin! (came with two) And it was really fresh tasting as well! The Hollandaise sauce was also really creamy and seasoned well. Yum! I had to steal a bite of my dad's Chicken Fried Steak and it was pretty good as well. I really liked their sausage gravy but their Fried Steak made me sad when some of the breading slid off but the flavor made up for it. As for service, our server was really friendly and made sure our waters were kept full. Their hours are really good as well open everyday from 7am-3pm. Can't wait to come again and maybe try their Pumpkin Bread I've been hearing a lot about as well as Stuffed French Toast.

Review Text :
Writing a review because some of the negative ones had me laughing my ass off. For the people so bothered by the fact that the owners are not "vegan or even vegetarian," let it go! That hardly qualifies as "unethical." It's not like the awesome sister act behind Treehouse is using the equipment in their kitchen to make their treacherous carnivorous meals or they are eating BLTs as crumbled bacon falls into the cake batter. And as for the complaints about the price, $2.50 is beyond reasonable. As someone who has visited every bakery in central Phoenix at one time or another, their prices for the quality and the presentation are absolutely fair. And if you think their cupcakes can't match up to your own wonderful vegan baking skills, then you should...I don't know...go bake yourself!! And taking your review down a notch because you didn't realize they were vegan and you don't eat vegan, well I think that's more on you than them.Now, on to what matters: the product itself. Treehouse Bakery has an awesome range of flavors and they made me fall in love with their churro cake. Two years ago, I ordered one for my birthday and they decorated it to fit my request to a tee. Angry Asian Girl cake, YES!! They bend over backwards to fulfill customers' orders and believe me, they have had some doozy of requests. They are more than qualified to run a bakery, vegan or not.Cori and Amanda are also just genuinely awesome individuals who care about the community. They have helped me out more than once when I needed cupcakes for an event. If you become even a semi-regular, they make you feel like an old friend. The Grand Avenue and Phoenix in general should feel lucky that Treehouse is there and hope that it stays around for the next gajillion years.

Disclaimer: Your first visit you will be completely overwhelmed when you walk through the door. Don't worry. They are prepared for that. Someone will hold your hand (figuratively) and baby step you through the process. If you dislike your sandwich here, you don't really have anyone to blame but yourself. Pick your bag and start crafting your masterpiece. 10 bag options. Once you agonize over that, vessel decisions. White, wheat, wrapped in lettuce or in a bowl. Hot or cold. Toppings galore. The combinations and possibilities are endless. Well not endless, but I'm not going to sit here and do that math. Numbers. Hard. Oh and a very important note... THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE HERE. You know what I'm talking about.This location is clean. The workers are ridiculously nice. They pretty much have to be to walk customers through How to Order a Sandwich 101. Parking can be a problem here. You may have to walk a mile... that is if you can even find a spot. Would you describe yourself as someone who has trouble making decisions? This may not be your best option to grab a sandwich.Wanted to search for a new restaurant in the neighborhood that I haven't tried yet and stumbled across this joint on Yelp.  Stopped by at 10:45 am and they were slow, so I could take my time figuring out what i wanted to order.This is an unusual Sandwich Shop.  Unusual because you place an order by:1 - Selecting a Sandwich Bag, which is a brown paper bag that your Sandwich gets placed into.  Each bag corresponds to a specific type of Sandwich, ie Italian, Turkey, Veggie, etc.2 - On the bag, there are several options for you to check off.....toppings, dressing, sauce, cheese, extras, etc.  You mark off the items you want with a Sharpie Pen.3 - You had the bag over to the cashier, who charges you for the meal and then hands the bag to a crew of people who make the Sandwich per your specifications.4 - After a short wait, you get your customized Sandwich.I decided to order the #7 Italian Grinder (Salami, Pepperoni, Cappicola), on a White Roll topped with Provolone, Mayo, Mustard, Fat Free Italian Dressing, Red Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepperoncini, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper, Oregano.....(see pics for full options on bag).  I got a combo meal which includes Chips & a Soda for $7.75, not a bad deal!  I grabbed a bag of Jalapeno Chips and for the drink I mixed Mello Yellow with low calorie Lemonade.....that was a mistake.  It was nasty, so I dumped it and just filled it with Mello Yellow.After a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  It was nice and hot....I didn't expect it to be heated, but I guess that's how it comes.  The Sandwich is wrapped in butcher paper and tin foil and cut in half for you.  I took one bite and instantly became a Fan!  It was soo good!  The Bread was awesome and the proportion of ingredients was just right.  The Meat was full of flavor and the combination of Spices, Dressing, and Mayo/Mustard added to the Sandwich.This is a 4 Star place for me because the Value you get for the money is ridiculously good....the Sandwich by itself would have only been $5.50!  Plus there are tons of other Sandwich options ie Veggie, Bacon & Ham, Meatloaf, Spam, Caprese, and much more.  The employees were great and very helpful.  I asked them what I had to do because of their unique ordering process and they took the time to explain it to me.Side Note - While I was there, I noticed that the Duke of the Joint checked-in.....but I didn't see him anywhere.  He's either an employee who was hiding in the back or works nearby and ghost check-ins to maintain his Dukedom.....that's the 1st time I've noticed that.Will I return?  There's no doubt about it!Ok, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:I stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.After a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14" bad boy in this 'Wich!They deserve the 1 Star bump.Will I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!I have been to Which Wich several times and I always enjoy their delicious sandwiches.  They have your normal sandwiches that you find at all of the sandwich shops, as well as some fun one like the Monte Cristo that comes with grape jelly.  Yummy! I find the quality of these sandwiches are quite high and I am always delightfully full after having lunch here.  Each sandwich is made to your specifications right when you order.  If you want fun options like flavored mayo, interesting toppings, sauces, and even onion choices (though is there really a choice when crispy onions are available) this is your spot!I also like the ordering system here.  You pick a bag that corresponds to your sandwich and you mark exactly what you want on said sandwich.  This way there is no mistakes or nastiness like a yucky olive sneaking in if you didn't ask for them.  You put your name on the bag and turn it in to the cashier.  When you get your bag back, it is filled with delightfulness!The prices are great too.  You can get a full combo meal of a regular sandwich, chips, and a drink for $8.  I am always stuffed with this size, but there are bigger ones too for larger appetites.  They have an email club as well that you can sign up for.  They will email all sorts of coupons pretty regularly to save you even more $$$.  They also have a Yelp check in freebie too, so go check them out and get a great sandwich!My first time here I was just standing there staring at the wall. Even though the guys behind the counter explained everything to me, I still had to take a couple minutes just to decide what I wanted.Finally I decided to go with the original Philly, which was the #8 bag. Apparently this was their designated product development bag in which they come up with experimental sandwiches. The other bags are other things like chicken, pork, beef, etc.So you grab a designated numbered bag, check off all your choices on that bag whether its extra or nothing of something. Lastly, don't forget to put your name before you hand it off to the guys behind the counter. Pay and then wait. They put the bags up on a clothes line while they make it. Nice concept. They read what you checked off so there is no mistake. As soon as its done, they put it in your bag and call your name.Back to my Philly. It was decent. Two things though. It was kind of small with only the one size choice (7 inches) and thought it need some kind of sauce. I asked the guys if they had anything spicy to put in my sandwich. They gave me a small cup of spicy ranch sauce which I should of had them put in my sandwich in the first place.Overall, I had a good experience. I just thought the sandwich was a bit small. I think next time I will get the "The Wicked" sandwich. Based on the pic, it does look pretty wicked with all the different meats up in there.Yelp 2014 Review Challenge #38

Restaurant name  Sweet Tomatoes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's a newer location, but smaller and less variety.  All Sweet Tomatoes (aka "Souplantation") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.  You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.  Pssst...but here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait.  Then again, this is Vegas -- the land of excess.Everything is well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat (AYCE) salad bar that's kept just like this, fresh and clean!  While this location is just more than a year or so old, it has about 2/3 the salad bar, and about 1/2 the amount of variety of soups, breads, muffins, etc., compared to most other ST's that I've been to.Q:  Is less more?A: Nahh.One extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla and the chocolate are AWESOME!

Tried to pick up a quick meal on the way from the Railway and have a picnic at the park.  Sadly the honey walnut shrimp was soggy and the shrimp meat was tough and chewy especially at the tail ends.  They served us the brown fried rice (yeck!) instead of white fried rice.  Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.  Never realized how to appreciate the Las Vegas fast food until I ordered shrimp in a small town where they probably don't like seafood in general or they just can't fathom spending another buck on it.  Still love you Boulder City but fcuk this Panda yo.I like Panda Express and believe they can be as healthy as you want your food to be. Some of their dishes have 500 to 700 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative with 150 to 210 calories. I usually substitute all or half of my rice for steamed veggies. The veggies fill you up without the calories. It's up to you how healthy or not you want to be.The service at this particular location was quick. We were greeted right away with a warm smile. I was out the door in about 5 minutes. I can say that the tables and floor were clean here. Cup lids, straws, napkins and utensils were all stocked.Panda Express is another 'fast food' organization I would like to see start moving away from GMOs and into Organic ingredients.Got my lunch here (to go), beef brocolli & chicken teriyaki my all-time fave, this time it is so tender and perfect for my sensitive teeth, satisfied with the food but not really with the cashier who was nice at first but after I said "next time" on her offer to donate on a charity they've chosen, she started frowning and didn't smile at all (not knowing I'm donating regulary every quarter for the charity directly)ofcourse I won't say that.Just paid my order and went home to eat.

Review Text :
O.k. Once again, I have to say "Support your local business."For the most part, Chinese food is about the same.  Not too much difference. The names on the menu may be different, but you can usually find what you like under some other name. So I am not going to tell you that Moon China is any different..  I get what I expect. A good meal, for a fairly good price. But this place has chosen to open a business in the "no where land" of Queen Creek/San Tan Valley. The NE corner of Ironwood and Ocotillo.  Not much else is around there. They have a very good menu, good prices and their food is good.  Take out is quick. I live 5 minutes away.  By the time I place my order, put on my shoes, and drive around the corner, the food is ready.  Tonight, same thing...  Order, put on shoes, drive around corner and pick up.  Food ready. They are always very nice. Have offered me complimentary drink while waiting if food was not ready.  My favorite--- Honey Crispy Chicken... Good flavor, nice little tang/spice.  Let's not overlook the fact that they are open on Sunday.  That is huge for this area.  Most places are closed...  So it a bonus when you look up and find it is 6 p.m. and have not figured anything for dinner.  This place is always a good fall back!!!We have so few options.  Support your local business.

Review Text :
We stopped here for a quick lunch after doing some errands and shopping. The restaurants was pretty empty with two other patrons there besides us. The restaurant was clean and well kept, and the decor was much more subdued and classier than some of the other Hawaiian restaurants in town. We ordered two different combination plates with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was thin and dry, and unfortunately the highlight of the meal. I couldn't stomach the beef as it had a very distinct, off putting, odor to it. The pork was also dry and had an off putting smell. I did not want to chance a food poisoning so I just ate the chicken and rice. The macaroni salad tasted like it had been marinaded in a cleaning solution. The price is fair for the amount of food you get, but in this case I would opt for quality over quantity. I don't plan on coming back.808 FIXAcross the street from the Galleria Mall, walking distance to The Home Depot plus within minutes of Costco, Super Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom Rack. We can safely say with confidence, we have driven by Aloha Kitchen thousands of times  This afternoon is our first drop in.Here's what we ordered: Appetizers: Lumpia Shanghai, mini egg rolls filled with ground pork, chopped onions and chopped carrots, served with sweet chili sauce.... surprisingly Ono yummySoup: Momo has to try the Saimin Soup, served with chasiu pork, eggs and green onions... slurp up noodles like no tomorrow. Dab of yellow mustard pushed the  taste over the speed limit.Specials: Kalbi Combo, Kalbi (beef shortribs), Chicken katsu and Chicken teriyaki served with rice and   macaroni salad.... fav was chicken katsu,  then Kalbi and Teri chicken. FRESH rice for a wet dunk into Saimin broth. MAC salad devoured in a flash.Great prices and portions. Mahalo !

Review Text :
We had quite a nice AYCE experience last night.  3 of us ravenously dined on all the tasty offerings.  Service was quirky but very attentive.  Much friendlier and more helpful than your average sushi place.  AYCE was $26 and included everything you would want and expect with a ton of specialty rolls, and dessert.We had miso soup, seaweed salad, baby tako, 7 or 8 rolls, sushi, gyoza, baked green mussels, soft shell crab, and so on.  The miso soup was very flavorful, the baby tako was a lovely, tender sesame flavored surprise, and the baked green mussels were extra caramelized and delicious.  The hamachi and garlic tuna was fresh and delightful.We were very pleased with most of the rolls.  Our food came out very slowly, and was well paced.  Normally, you are bombarded with everything your ordered within minutes and you can hardly discern what is what.  All the items we ordered came out individually, 5 - 10 minutes apart.  It gave us plenty of time to chat and enjoy each item.  I would definitely return and add sin city sushi to the list of my to go places for AYCE.We came here on a Saturday evening for AYCE 25.95/ea for dinner and ordered 1. Softshell crab, 2 orders*2. Hamachi nigiri, 2 orders3. Salmon nigiri, 2 orders4. Salmon skin hand roll, 2 orders5. Oyster shooters, 2 orders**6. Moon roll7. Salmon kama, 2 orders*8. Tuna poke, 1 order*9. Green Mussels, 3 orders10. Sin City roll11. Lychee ice cream, 1 order*12. Fried banana with vanilla ice cream, 1 order*for $66 (*limit one per person, **limit 2 per person)- Sat in right away. Bar was open around 7pm. no one there at bar. Booths full. Chef of our own!  - Great soft-shell crab. less tempura, better and more soft-shell. - Ordinary nigiri. - Excellent Salmon skin. Crispy. Best AYCE by far in Vegas. Lots of avocado. - Nice presentation for oyster shooter. Tangy. -  Their special rolls collectively have a bit too much sauce for my liking, but overall, good. Sin City roll is a definite must-try. It's the name of their restaurant for tarnation! haha. - Green mussels taste like it's from a Chinese buffet. - Must get Salmon Kama! - Poor Ice cream selection. Fried banana fail. Don't get it. Lychee ice cream had some lychee jelly pieces inside that were very satisfying. - Great price!  Friendly service.I was thoroughly surprised at the quality of sushi here. My sister and I were in the area and on a whim decided to take a gamble and try Sin City sushi. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who was also our server. She quickly seated us and took our drink order. The inside was spacious and clean. We opted for the a la carte menu (lately I have been steering away from the AYCE, even at places that do offer it). We had an order of baked green mussels which were spectacular and rank among my favorite out of all of the other sushi joints. We also shared two rolls which were both delicious and packed with fresh fish, minimal rice and were rolled tight. I believe they were the Vampire roll and Something Wrong roll. Our lunch was very reasonably priced for the quality of the fish and rolls themselves. The server was friendly and we chatted for a but as it was not terribly busy. I would recommend this as one of the sushi spots if you are on the south side of town.

Allrighty then...It's time to poke the pig I like to call "Controversy"!I know it's going to sound like heresy, but I'm just going to come out with it...I like Italian Beef Sandwiches better than Philly Cheesesteaks!I'll give you a minute to clean up the spit on your screen...there you go...there's still a little to your right...no, right...good, all bright and shiny again!It's true, I really do!Not that I don't like cheesesteaks, I just like the full dip Italian Beef (made the right way...the Chicago, stand up at the counter and lean over to keep from getting the drippings on your shoes way), better!And Al's delivers on the better Italian Beef!Huge sandwiches, made in every conceivable manner (maybe too many options on the menu, but I suppose someone likes some the of the more esoteric choices), but really, there is only one way to make this sandwich for me...Full Dip, Provolone and hot Giardiniera...chock full of beefy, cheesy, spicy, peppery goodness!The kind of goodness that mere napkins can't remove...oh sure, they can soak up some of the greasy drips...smear things around on your hands and face a little bit, that sort of thing...but you're going to need a shower after lunch at Al's Beef.And that's how it should be!My buddy and I met for lunch last week and we tried the new Al's franchise for the first time. For first time franchisers (from Chicago, BTW, so they know how these things are supposed to look and taste), they do a nice job...And I should note how nice everyone is at Al's...so...noted!The service was reasonably good, and while they did forget to put Giardiniera on my sandwich, they were quick to give me a couple of cups of their house blend to fork over onto my sandwich...you just aren't getting the entire experience without the pickled peppers!My buddy and I sat and talked and the sandwiches quickly disappeared, along with a pretty decently made, tasty side of fries...I know, I know...I can't eat that way every day (or really, every week) if I want to live to a ripe old age of 149...but I'm not sure that I want to live that long if I can't get my Italian Beef sandwich from time to time!So my new strategy is to extend my life by forgoing  the cheesesteaks and replacing them with Italian Beef, now that we have a couple of decent places in town (sorry DeFalco's...you know I love you, but, for the love of Jebus, dip my sandwich...don't just give me a little plastic "sample cup" of au jus).Of course, that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak!There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit. Like Al's Beef. Those words together conjure up fantastical images of hunky blue collared workers. You know the ones; they work hard and play harder, each one starving, looking to get his fill of Al's thick juicy Italian Beef sandwiches.In 1938, Al's Beef opened as a food stand in Chicago's Little Italy. The idea for the Italian Beef sandwich came during the Depression when meat was scarce. So, in order to help stretch the meat to feed more people, the roasted beef was shaved extremely thin, then made into sandwiches.Over the years, Al's flourished, earning accolades such as Best Sandwich in America from Esquire, Playboy and others. They were even featured earlier this year on one of my favorite TV shows, Man vs. Food, in an episode titled "Da Italian Stance."In Chicago, there's an art to eating an Al's Italian Beef sandwich. In the "Italian Stance," the diner's knees are slightly bent, posterior slightly up and out and elbows on the counter. This technique helps to avoid getting Al's gravy on your shoes. It's not the traditional gravy you might think of putting on mashed potatoes, but more like the pan drippings from the roasted beef they dunk the entire sandwich in, bread and all.Unfortunately, all of this amazing history and media attention doesn't seem to matter to the new franchised location in North Scottsdale. The concept here is fast casual, order from the counter, then getting your number called a few minutes later to pick up your food.The interior was spotlessly clean, the staff relatively friendly and the concept easy, what's not to like? Unfortunately, the food.I started with the Big Al ($7.45), the 8-inch version of their Italian Beef sandwiches. I want to eat it like Chicagoans do, so I ordered the sandwich dipped, then covered with hot giardiniera, a relish of pickled peppers and vegetables. Taking my position, with my butt in the air and my elbows on the counter top, I took the first bite. First I was amazed just how juicy the sandwich was. Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless.I was so disappointed that after a few bites I decided to try a Chicago Dog ($3.10). But the hot dog was so small and shriveled I wasn't sure you could call it a hot dog; more like a hot mess.There were a few highlights, including the delicious Bleu Cheese Fries ($4.50), perfectly cooked French fries covered with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing. Another treat was the Tamale Boat ($5.80), two Chicago-style tamales covered with chili, cheddar cheese and onions.When one of the employees decided that it was time for Headbangers Ball, playing thrash metal over the restaurant's loudspeakers, I took it as my cue to leave.Maybe this place should be renamed Al's French Fried Tamale Mosh Pit? Rock on man, rock on.

Bonjour Mes Amis Dit mon la verite'! 5 stars?!? Ca c'est bon Lafitte's seems to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area, and still quite affordable, considering what you get for your money. (and this from a bonifide cheapskate) It was also nearly empty for Sunday dinner, but I'm sure that is something that varies greatly seasonally. Lafitte's is hidden inside of the Embassy Fountain Suites Hotel s.e. corner of I-17 and Greenway Rd, and is a little cajun/creole restaurant that really is a Lagniappe! The menu was quite large and much more varied than I thought it would be. (not all seafood) Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. Gumbo, Jambalaya, soup, Po'Boy and a bunch of other sandwiches, salads, pizza, entrees from pasta and veggies to fillet, ribs, prime rib, and more scrimps than you, Capt. Dan (and Bubba, en spirit) could ever get from a night out on the Jenny in the bayou. The baby back ribs had both a dry rub and a sauce glazed on while grilling ~sweet, spicy (could've been a tad hotter), tender and meaty and moist. The prime rib came in a slab worthy of Fred Flintstones dinner plate. The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room. The beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness. Let us return to that jambalaya. WHEW BOYEE, it was a delicious dark gravy stew over rice that easily could be a satisfying meal on its own! C'est magnifique, I gau-RUN-tee! There were two different scrimps dishes at the table as well, which both must have been really good, because neither the saucy one or the pasta-ey one got shared with anyone! There is a tasty although probably over-hyped ice cream dish on the desert menu that seems like some sort of cake but is really just a big slab of Neapolitan ice cream with a tiny bit of meringue on the outside. Service was superb! Our server was lively, attentive, funny, and really nice. She was knowledgeable about the dishes, offered recommendations when asked (even a bit of a Miracle on 34th Street-ish: "I'd get one of the other sides, not because the sweet potato fries are bad, they're just average, and so many of the other sides you'd be missing are so good"), and was also familiar with the details (and made sure we were, too) of the restaurant.com coupon. The restaurant.com coupon was what really made this a smokin' deal, and I heard from a coworker that they have a BOGO in the Entertainment book ,too. Even without the deals, the menu is really not very expensive considering the quality and portion size that you get at Lafitte's. 4 out of 5 dinner entrees were all $16, with many choices on either side of that average. Lunch sammies complete with side of fries or ? are around $8-9. The ice cream conglomeration fed all 5 of us for $8. Not bad 'tall, mon cheri. Laisser les bons temps rouler !How to make an impression: When picking up your date for the evening (2nd date) and she asks where you are going, tell her you decided to check out a local hotel...... with her daughter and her family in the room.  I got some strange looks and her  SIL made a point of stating we most likely would not be back in time to watch a movie.Lafitte's is most definitely a hotel restaurant.  In place are the omelet station and self serve stations for breakfast/brunch.Although we thought we had arrived early for dinner (6PM) the place was slammed with two large dining parties and a large gathering in the lounge area and the banquet room full too.  The dining room/lounge area appeared to have only one waitress and she was frazzled but holding up pretty well.  She mentioned this was A) abnormal and B) the second night in a row like this.  When my dining partner was in the restroom another diner mentioned her and her husband had come for a quiet dinner as this place was always deserted.  When she did get to us to take our drink order she advised us to order everything before 2 large parties got their dinner order in or it would be a while.  Turned out it was a while anyway, our total dinner stay was right at 2 hours.I had printed out a menu and on the way over we discussed what we might get and it turns out the actual menu is just enough different we changed our minds.  We ended up with an appetizer of 2 crab cakes and she got a shrimp Po'boy which came with fries and I got the chicken Florentine which came with a salad, garlic mashed potatoes and some sauteed vegetables.  We both decided the crab cakes had a nice ratio of crab to filler but we were not used to the seasonings.  Why a salad of mixed greens needs to have some bitter stuff in itI don't know but this was another one I have come across that did.  The blue cheese dressing was heavy on vinegar.  Neither of us had had a shrimp Po'boy before and we both decided we liked it.  We also both liked the chicken and I liked the mashed potatoes and vegetables although there was nothing spectacular about them.  The house Merlot I had made Franzia look like a $40 a bottle wine.Of note, although I think it was because they were slammed.  My salad came out before the appetizer and the crab cakes, although we made it well known we were sharing, did not come with a plate to share with.As we were getting up to leave the manager caught up with us and apologized for the less than stellar service.  That was nice of her but we really didn't  notice it that much because we were in a mood to sit and chat anyway. At no time did we feel rushed.   We both decided it would be a place worth returning to.It's probably more a 3.5 but the evening was a pleasant one so I don't mind rounding up.Ryan C told me they make a real burger here. Well I had to se for myself. The burger is a hand Pattied Sirloin burger cooked to order over a flame...yep a flame...chared beef, like a burger is supposed to be. It was perfect, the price was right, the building is great, I loved it. I cannot wait to try more food. FYI.. it is a chain ohhhhh.

Review Text :
24 hours of all you can eat meals for $50?   GREAT!  So so so not.Even the most high end hotels participating in this deal serve essentially the same foods with a few differences. (I went to Imperial Palace, Harrahs, and Paris)This is also an example of where quality suffers due to quantity.  I felt forced to eat meal after meal of cafeteria food. After the new-ness of crab legs, dessert bars, and infinite selection wore off, eating at buffet of buffets seemed more like an obligation than a pleasure.By the end I was really really sad I had to eat at one of these buffets...again... But if you are looking for volume of sustenance at a low cost, this is the deal for you!  As someone who would rather have less, more high quality food, this made me sorta sad...Yes, we hit all 7 buffets within a 24-hour period!  We can't say we ate full meals at each, and we can't say we really enjoyed the last few buffets.  But we did it, and we brag about it on a regular basis.First, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.#1 - Caesar'sWe started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.#2 - Harrah'sWe were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.#3 - Imperial PalaceIt's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.#4 - FlamingoI did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.#5 - ParisWe had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.#6 - RioWe didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....# 7 - Planet HollywoodIn retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.A final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.200th review!  And the Buffet of Buffets (all 7 buffets!) was a once in a lifetime experience worth the honor of being number 200.  Meaning I won't do it again but it was a lot of fun!Here is a list the buffets in order of my preference with links to my separate reviews:Flamingo - Paradise Garden Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:URS8MJEkdC8KsB_jVsjo3gHarrah's - Flavors Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:_OUWBMRElcOZecknmMLJngRio - Carnival World Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:KDdi-yKhtMJCZ3g4H5yS6APlanet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:breS3dflMWORJXruiwyi5wParis - Le Village Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:KGu5BCvuu9jrx7O0ciO68QCaesars Palace - Lago Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:BeCacBAleUgaGAtZLcxD1gImperial Palace - Emperor's Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t4rFdqWGvZqSxbb6ciwgKw If you are thinking about taking on this feat, you may need alcohol.  Do it on the weekend and check to see which buffets include champagne and bloody marys with brunch.  Lago is your best bet early in the morning and some of the other buffets after 10:30am.  I think each buffet (except for IP) sells line passes at the VIP lines.  If the lines get long, buy the passes so you don't go crazy.  See the pics or the event link for Ken M.'s great schedule.http://www.yelp.com/events/las-vegas-uye-buffet-of-vegas-buffets-bobIt's a good time with a bunch of friends and definitely an experience.When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:Breakfast9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0wLunch12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_wDinner5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4AI had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.Return Factor - 80%Once upon a time there were 3 bunnies... very hungry bunnies. Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uAI write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   * SATURDAY *Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crème brûlée, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! * SUNDAY *Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  *****Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us    $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) + $48 (1 extra BofB pass)----------   $261  Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!Mom visits me from Korea every year and as usual, we went to Vegas.  I don't know why we decided to do this but we did.  I kept questioning our decision...really? Buffet for the next 24 hours?  Holy moly!  Yes, you heard me right; unlimited buffet for 24 hours for $44.99 for Total Rewards members (just go sign up at the total rewards booth) and $49.99 for non-members.   Ugh.Given my reservations, this was not a bad idea.  It's definitely worth the money given that one buffet meal would have cost us about $18-$30.  So how many times could we squeeze in buffet trips in the given time without wanting to puke?  I'd say about 4 times MAX.-Meal 1: Spice Market Buffet @PH.  This was where we started.  We had dinner here.  Overall, this was my favorite buffet of the trip.  They have different themed sections marked clearly with bold white lettering...ie. Mexican, Seafood, Mid-Easter, dessert, etc.  I gorged myself on pre-halved crab legs and pre-peeled shrimp cocktail.  My husband loved the cotton candy and the crème brulee was yummy too.  4 stars-Meal 2 : Spice Market Buffet.  Since we were staying at PH we decided to come here for a quick breakfast before we set out for the day.  Breakfast was simple and standard.  The eggs were good and the OJ refreshing...and the coffee saved my life.-Meal 3 : Le Village Buffet @ Paris.  The line was short here but for some reason we had to wait for 45 minutes!  The food was French-ish and quite mediocre.  I must say that I do like the ambiance.  It succeeds in taking me away to some sort of quaint rustic town.  3 stars-Meal 4 : Lago Buffet @ Caesars Palace.  Once again, the line was ridiculously slow.  We had tickets to the Cirque Du Soleil LOVE show and we almost had to skip dinner after waiting in line for an hour!  Fortunately, we spoke to one of the managers and she let us slide up front.  Thank you! Thank you!  Lago had the smallest selection of them all.  It was teeny tiny with minimum seating!  The saving factor of this place is the quality of the food.  It was the best of the three I visited, however limited.  The prime rib was restaurant quality and delicious.  I would come back just for that.  3 starsI enjoyed my Buffet of Buffets experience.  I don't think I'll do it again but it was definitely worth its while.  Besides, we had a good time hopping from buffet to buffet as if we were on a little mission.   But please factor in the lines when you're visiting these buffets.  They are no joke.When Sarah A told me about this $44.99 for as much of 7 buffets as you want within a 24 hour period, I was all in!The AYCE plan includes:Lago Buffet at Caesar's PalaceParadise Garden Buffet at FlamingoFlavors Buffet at Harrah'sVillage Seafood Buffet at RioLe Village Buffet at ParisEmperor's Buffet at Imperial PalaceSpice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodCarnival World Buffet at RioBetween me, David G, Sarah A and Minh D, we went through a LOT of food on this pass!We started at the Rio hotel, at the Carnival World Buffet (where we bought our passes) and even though we only made it to one more - the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood - I still felt like it was a good deal.My only beef about this plan is that the buffets all close at 10pm, which is kinda early for the hours that most people keep when they're in the town that never sleeps.Still, that likely won't stop me from doing this the next time I come back!When i found out Lucy Y, David G, Minh D and i were all going to Vegas, i just knew we had to do that Buffet Of Buffets challange!! With some quick research i found out that you can save a little bit of money. All you have to do is sign up for a Total Rewards card available at any Harrah's casino. Without the card your paying $ 49.99 with the Total Rewards card its $44.99 so your saving $5.00 which can come in handy later on for a drink or something!! Another tip since it is within a 24 hour period, i suggest starting as late as possible because it Vegas and no one is up at the crack of dawn, heck we were lucky to stumple into the second buffet at around 2:45pm!! Come hungry is all i can say, other wise this isnt the place for you to be if a one time trip fills you up!! The buffets are not open 24hours most of them close between 9:00pm and 10:00pm.Buffet of Buffets, I OWN YOU! 7 buffets in 24 hours, seriously...is that all you've got? Please. You are going to have to up your game BoB, because you have been PWND by this glutton!Here is the damage: Day one: Purchased BoB pass at 4:35pm.Buffet 1 - Spice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodBuffet 2 - Le Village Buffet at ParisBuffet 3 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoDay two: Began at 9amBuffet 4 - Flavors Buffet at Harrah'sBuffet 5 - Emperor's Buffet at Imperial PalaceBuffet 6 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoBuffet 7 - Lago Buffet at Caesar's PalaceBuffet 8 - Flavors Buffet at Harrah'sBuffet 9 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoBuffet 10 - Arrived at the Carnival World Buffet at Rio at 4:15pm.Final count: 10 buffets in 24 hoursComments:Favorite buffet - Flavors buffet at Harrah's, followed closely by Spice Market at PH and Carnival at Rio.Least favorite buffet - Emperor's buffet at IP, and Lago at Caesars.Best service - Flavors at Harrah's followed closely by Paradise Garden buffet at FlamingoWorst service - Le Village Buffet at ParisBest prime rib - Carnival at RioBest crab legs - Spice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodHey BoB, it was fun...but let me know when you come up with something a little more challenging.OK real talk. This is the best deal on the muthaf#%n strip!!! at only 50 bucks? ain't nothin wrong with that!! The deal already pays for itself after 2 visits! U just gotta eat at any of the participating buffets before your 24 hours is up! Lago Buffet (Caesars)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmLe Village Buffet (Paris)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmSpice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmFlavors Buffet (Harrah's)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmParadise Garden Buffet (Flamingo)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmCarnival World Buffet (The Rio)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmVillage Seafood Buffet (The Rio) ** 4:00pm - 10:00pmEmperor's Buffet (Imperial Place) - This buffet sucked!!.... just my opinion.. :p7 great buffets, one stylish wrist band equals one hell of a food coma!! choose wisely... **- "Seafood Village buffet" an additional charge $15 to eat there.. just saying..What a deal!  24 hours of buffets for only $45 (with Total Rewards membership, which is free).How it works: - Sign up for Total Rewards online- Go to any of the Total Rewards casinos (we went to Planet Hollywood) to their Total Rewards desk, and pick up your member card- Go to your first buffet when you're ready to start your 24 hours and pay at the cashier.  (NOTE: you cannot buy this buffet pass online!  only at the cashier at your first buffet!  This is when your 24 hours officially start!)- Use your total rewards card as your admission ticket to the buffets for the remainder of your 24 hours.It's such a good deal, you already get your money's worth after 2 buffets.  In order to maximize the deal, try to do 2 dinners, a breakfast, and a lunch.  That's what my fiance and I did.  Meal 1: Started out with a late dinner at Spice Market at PH.  The food is okay... not as great as it used to be back when PH was The Aladdin.  Food here is better than the dessert.  Meal 2: Early breakfast at 7:30am at Paris.  I've always heard this is the best breakfast buffet so there was no question about where we wanted to have breakfast.  Meal 3: Late lunch at Harrah's.  We got to enjoy both their lunch food and dinner food cuz we came so late (we were still super full from breakfast and had to eat lunch at 3pm).  This was my first time at Harrah's buffet and it was actually our favorite of all the buffets we ate at on this buffet pass!Meal 4: Dinner at Caesar's Palace.  We weren't hungry, but just went for the sake of going to a 4th buffet.  Plus we heard Caesar's had the best dessert... and that they did!  Their desserts are much more upscale in terms of presentation.  And they come in little cute serving sizes so you can definitely sample more desserts in one sitting!  Food was okay, but we didn't grab a lot of food since we were already full.Some extra tips: your 24 hours starts and ends when you officially swipe your card at the cashier.  So take into account of waiting lines!  If you have a line pass or VIP member status, then kudos to you.  But if you have to wait in line like everyone else, then plan accordingly.HOLY CRAP!This is such an amazing deal. It pays for itself in 1 and 1/2 visits!Once you got the pass, you have 24 hours to eat the Hotels in the chain, which include: Rio, Harrah's, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and Caesars Palace, and maybe others I can't recall. If you sign up for the free Total Rewards players card you can get the pass. This is also great bc you put your card in every time you play the slots and get points. Also, every time you book with these hotels you accumulate points..Total for each buffet is about $30 including tips and all the other fees. The BoB pass is $45 - I think it's a pretty sweet deal! The best time to get the pass is about noon. Since you have 24 hrs to go where you please, you'll be able to eat lunch, dinner, breakfast the next day and lunch!Also, you can change buffets... for example, if you go to Flamingo for lunch and don't like it, you have time to go to any other buffets during the lunch hours to find what you like. We did that for dinner once, we liked different things at different buffets so we went buffet hopping!I recommend the Rio World Buffet... it's amazing! Anything you can think of ... is there!Also, the crab legs at Imperial Palace is pretty good since it's a slower buffet, the wait for fresh crab legs is shorter.Harrah's is also very decent for brunch!Flamingo has a chocolate fountain!!I also hear that Caesar's Palace is amazing, but I personally had never eaten there.Enjoy!$50 for 24 access to 7 buffets (use your Total Rewards Card to save $5 which you can get from any of the participating Hotels AND it comes with $5 in slot play!)1. Spice Market at Planet HollywoodMy favorite because of the location, setting, food and convenience. Super cute dessert selection like cotton candy on a stick! Solid prime-rib and surprisingly nommy middle-eastern food. We ate here twice. 2. Carnival World Buffet at RioThe food here is probably the best of the seven buffets in terms of selection and quality (especially the Asian station) but gosh! So annoying to get to Rio on foot from the strip, even with the free shuttle from Harrah's to Rio. 3. Le Village Buffet at ParisI don't know why this buffet is rated so high, but it was my least favorite by far. The prime rib was tasteless and chewy, the grilled asparagus were like burnt splintery chopsticks, and the marinated mushrooms were SO SALTY that my tongue just about withered up after the first bite.  Everything else was average.  But I do have to say that the décor is the most charming, from the little street lamps and candlelit windows right down to the costumed waitresses. Good for dessert and breakfast but not for anything substantial. We didn't bother with the other four, because our stomachs are mortal, and we heard that they weren't that good anyways.Tips for surviving the onslaught of buffets.-yes dear, that skinny belt looks great with your fitted top and secondskin jeans but change into the moo-moo tucked in the back of your closet. You're welcome.-if you are secretly weight-conscious, drink lots of water and start with veggies and soup. You will think that you can just pop in and pick up a light snack but you will always end up eating a large meal and will complain about how much you ate for the next many many hours. Just accept it.-if you are with the above person, bring headphones.-if you want to eat as much as you humanly can at every buffet, ease up on the protein; you will be lugging a 20-pound frankenmeat in your tummy for the next 2 days and will be severely constipated -if you wanna hit all 7 buffets, prepare to make it an all-day event and get a bus pass to haul you from hotel to hotel.Happy eating!All throughout college, I have frequented The Strip countless times, and every time I have been tempted by the Buffet of Buffets (B.o.B.) billboard ads. Problem is, when you're with a huge group, everyone's sole mission is to hit up as many bars and club, and get as schwastey as f***... there's simply no time to spare on buffets.So, it was Chris K.'s 21st last March, and we unintentionally made our Vegas trip a romantic getaway (surprisingly, Vegas is very suitable for couples... who would have thought?) with very few plans. We're both fatties, so the B.o.B. seemed like the obvious choice to spend our weekend. Plus, you save a lot of money, because for $55 / person (I am not a Total Rewards member, and this amount includes tax) you can pack in 4 meals and "snack" buffet trips.(1) The start of our B.o.B. adventure was at the Carnival World Buffet in Rio for dinner. The only one off the strip, and this particular buffet is loaded with childhood memories (and a huge food selection)... this was the one buffet we always had to hit on our fambam Vegas trips. As a child, I didn't know any better,  but the food tastes pretty crappy now.(2) The next day, we dined on The Strip. Since we stayed at Vdara, it only made sense to have breakfast across the street at The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood... aptly named, because all the dishes were very well seasoned. (3) Immediately after, we hauled our filled tummies to le Village Buffet at Paris for lunch. Luckily, I didn't realize Champagne Brunch was being served, so the hour-long line gave us time to finish digesting our breakfast. The Champagne Brunch (which normally costs $27) alone justified the price of the pass... 2 brunches and we've eaten our money's worth! and you can't skip out on the Crepe bar... that was Chris K.'s favorite part of B.o.B. I know I drank a good amount of champagne, but my flute stayed full the entire course of our meal. Lesson learned at le Village: DON'T CHUG THE CHAMPAGNE!! It is a choking hazard and is a mistake not to be repeated! (4) Our final buffet was Cafe Lago at Caesar's Palace. Although it was impossible to find (there were no signs directing us to the entrance) and the line to get in didn't move (we missed our 24 hour mark by 10 minutes... thankfully we were still allowed in), the food here tasted the best. All the other buffets offered prime rib, but Cafe Lago additionally gave us the option of herb-crusted flank steak (super savory!!). I went back 3 rounds for the flank steak, and even had it as my dessert. Compared to the other participating buffets, this cafe has classier-looking, artistic food displays and seemed more clean, but the selection of food items is less extensive.I am so glad to finally check off B.o.B. on my Vegas To-Do list. Worth every penny! I would do it again in a heartbeat, but need time to mentally prepare my tummy for another 24 hour food marathon...and next time, I'm hitting all 6 buffets :)How many more reviews do you need to believe that this deal is SO WORTH IT?? At first it sounded a little too good to be true but wow, superb deal considering most Vegas buffets are already $20+. I got to squeeze in 4.5 meals...two lunches, one brunch, and two dinners. I didn't stuff myself either which I tend to do regularly to make it worth it, but with this pass I'm able to eat comfortably knowing I can always come back to eat more haha.$50 (that's with taxes) and unlimited access to 7 different buffets.-Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood-Le Village Buffet @ Paris-Paradise Garden Buffet @ Flamingo-Carnival World Buffet @ Rio-Flavors @ Harrah's-Village Seafood Buffet @ Rio (additional $15)-Emperor's Buffet @ Imperial PalaceSmall downside is you still have to get in line with all the regular buffet purchasers. Wish there was a separate line for the 24hr buffeters but that's just asking too much haha :pThis is definitely worth it folks! Even if you just eat 2 meals, it's still the cheapest (quality) ticket in Vegas. Especially if you do what all the hard core people do (I researched the buffets...ahem...)  and start your 24 hours later in the dinner hour on the first day so that you can get TWO dinners during the 24 hours...not to mention a possible breakfast and lunch!I was working a big corporate convention and STILL mentioned to get my 2 dinners in. So it was totally worth it. Most (if not all) of the buffets are open til 11pm, so that helps. I had to be at work before the 7am opening for breakfast (I KNOW!)---so I missed out on that. But my good friend who had also bought the buffet ticket with me was a champ and brought a piece of the buffet (a bear claw) to me! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  #lifeofcrimeWe went to dinner the firs night at Spice Market in Planet Hollywood.  It was solid. Decent selection, and at 830pm on a Monday night we didn't have to wait long. I ate mostly stuff from the Middle Eastern station. Lamb kabobs, chicken curry and rice with lentils. YUM!Tried a bite of the Key Lime cupcake before we left but it wasn't worth finishing. The cupcakes were plain with a bit of flavored stuff in the middle, with cheapy sugared whipped cream icing.  Also too dense, texture wise. Not in a 'thick, I'm filled with butter' kinda way, but in a 'I was overcooked in the oven or don't have enough baking soda/powder' kinda way. But then, you MUST remember, my sister is a baker and I am a cupcake snob. So, yeah.Since we were staying at Bally's, we stopped to get the made to order dessert crepes at the Le Village buffet in Paris on the way home. 2 buffets in the same night. That's what you do with a 24 hour buffet pass people. Come on!The crepes were AMAZING. Totally great life choice. And then tonight, we went to Paris for the dinner buffet, since it's swankier than the Spice Market buffet (which we discovered the night before when we got the dessert crepes) . I got the banana one with carmel sauce instead of chocolate. YUM!For dinner I had the prime rib with the mushroom sauce (YES!), the mac n cheese with truffle sauce and mushrooms or something (not to be confused with the very bland shells with brie and bacon - don't waste your time here), scalloped potatoes and french green beans with almonds. Delicious!Didn't even bother with the other buffets cause they were farther away and the reviews weren't as good. But with the Spice Market and Le Village being right next to each other, you really don't NEED any other options. Be happy. Eat good food in Vegas that doesn't make you poor.TOTAL DIET KILLER!But hey, you're in VEGAS!My Buffet of Buffet List of...... Best to Worst:1. Bacchanal Buffet - Caesar's Palace2. Spice Market Buffet - Planet Hollywood (Formally Aladdin)3. Le Village Buffet - Paris4. World Buffet - Rio4. Flavors Buffet - Harrah's5. Emperors Buffet - Imperial PalaceBest food deal in Vegas, HANDS DOWN. $12 for a footlong at Subway? COME ON. Be smart.Buffet of Buffet Pass (good for 6 all-you-can-eat-buffets for 24 hours: some of which include all-you-can-drink champagne, mimosas, etc.) - $45 (with Total Rewards card which is completely free)Additional Charge for Upscale Buffets - $15 each per visit ($15 once does not mean that you can come back later for a second meal and not pay again)=~$60 for great food of all varieties and enough alcohol to get a nice buzz (if you have good service) for the cost of a tip... (UM, have you seen the cost of alcohol in Vegas???). AKA unlimited food and drinks for ~$15 each meal? YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!Get your pass at a dinner buffet (between 7pm-9pm) so you can have dinner, breakfast, lunch, and another dinner.Yes, the lines will be long. Yes, they are unavoidable since your stomach will need some time to digest between stuffings and you WILL end up having to eat during some meal rush. No, it is not worth paying extra money to "skip" the line... a Total Rewards woman even admitted to that. But YES, you will find at least one thing you want seconds of at most buffets and you WILL have the option of eating as much or as little as you desire with free reign for 24 hours.YES, you should go to Bacchanal (best quality) and Le Village (best flavor).NO, you should not go to Spice Market unless you have drunken taste buds. Even then... it's hard to black out biting into a rock from the couscous or miss the fact that there's no cheese in your cheese quesadilla.Use Yelp, make good choices, don't hesitate to repeat buffets. What's good is good and this deal is GREAT.I have done this deal twice and I'd like to say that it's worth it. For $50 you get to eat as many meals as you can fit in within 24 hours. Most people would probably be able to get 2-3 meals within those 24 hours. Without it, a buffet would cost anywhere from $30-$60. I know that some of the other yelp reviewers say that you have to eat fast and time it right but I think that as long as you get two meals in, you've received your money's worth.In a way, it's a lot like getting a season pass at an amusement park. Even if you go three times in that whole year, you've spent less than you would if you had bought three individual tickets so it's well worth it.I've only had a chance to go to the Rio and Paris buffets and I am absolutely satisfied. The Rio one is perhaps the bigger of the two and it has a variety of foods including pho and wonton soup for my asian food craves.I have to say I was a little disappointed by the Paris buffet. It had a lot less food than I had expected but if you really love crepes and dessert, this is where to go. Also, the service is great and the people are friendly.As for tips,I recommend getting the wristband as late as you can before closing so that you can have a more flexible schedule for dinner the next day. Also, it is never too late. Your wristband lasts until the minute it reaches 24 hours. I remember the last time that I went, my wristband was supposed to expire at 7 pm. My boyfriend and I rushed to the Paris buffet only to find a super long line. It was 6:59 but I refused to give up so I went to the customs desk to the left of the line and told the friendly lady at the desk that my wristband is about to expire but I'd like to squeeze in one last meal. She smiled and gave me a receipt for two at the buffet and told me to show the cashier at the line my receipt and proceed to the line to be seated.I didn't want to wait in the same line for the cashier where people were waiting to pay for their meal so I skipped to the front and told the girl showing people to seats that I already had my receipt and asked if she could seat me. She asked if everyone in my party already paid and I said yes so she took my boyfriend and me right in.So we basically saved 45 minutes of standing in line and managed to squeeze in a meal with one minute to spare.Also, if you happen to walk past a buffet while you're going about your day on the strip, and the buffet has no line going in, feel free to stop by and grab a gelato or a cheesecake. Because you can. So there.I have yet to try the other buffets on the list but I heard that the Planet Hollywood one is superb. Either way, the great thing about buffets is that there will most likely be food that you like. Remember, a buffet is not for eating as much as you can; it's to give you a variety of foods to choose from. Don't like the food you chose? pick another! wish you had more? go get some more!Oh, and the wristbands are waterproof in case you were wondering so don't go showering with your arm hanging outside your tub in the hotel.In 24 hours...You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)Did I get enough to eat?  YesDid I get my money's worth?  You bet I didWas the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it wasWould I do this again?  Hell no!We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.Cost savings analysis!Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96-------------------------------------------------------------------------------SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 OR$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)I finally manned up and attempted the Buffet of Buffets.  Well, not entirely though.  I had a little bit of misunderstanding on how the pricing worked with the higher end buffets that are offered as an upgrade (Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and Village Seafood Buffet at Rio).So here's how it goes for Total Rewards members like me:  for $47.99 you get 24 hour access to The Carnival World Buffet at Rio, Le Village Buffet at Paris, Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo, Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, and The Emperor's Buffet at The Quad Resort (formerly Imperial Palace).  Here's the part that I misunderstood, you also get access to Bacchanal Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet for an upgrade of $15 PER VISIT.  The PER VISIT part is the where I got things mixed up as I thought it was a one time upgrade fee only.  With that in mind, and the fact that I had only intended to use the BoB strictly for Bacchanal since it was new and I wanted to try it for 24 hours, I ended up spending more than I expected out of this.  But that's completely my fault for not reading the fine print. I'll get into details with how my sessions at Bacchanal went in a separate review.  However after going though two buffet meals, I remembered why I stopped doing buffets as I realized that I can't stuff myself silly like I did during my college years.  So even though I still had time for breakfast the next morning, I didn't have the appetite for it and just omitted it.  I was in major food exhaustion.  LOLFor what it's worth, I still think the Buffet of Buffets is a great deal if you know how to plan ahead:  knowing breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, knowing locations of buffets, and also going with the idea that since you've got 24 hour access there is no need to stuff yourself silly.  Good planning of all those factors can help you get the most out of your 24 hour pass.Oh the ridiculousness that is the Buffet of Buffets! 24 hours of unlimited access to worship at numerous temples of gluttony! Some of the Buffets are just okay, some are down right gross. We figured that by doing this deal, that it would save us money. We could could try numerous restaurants, eat massive quantities of food and come and go as we please.What I will say is you WILL get tired of buffet food after 24 hours. By the forth meal I couldn't look at another prime rib carving station without crying on the inside. But it did save us a bit of money on the strip (thus allowing us to deposit it back on the craps tables). But it's definitely fun in a ridiculous sort of way.  Here's my breakdown of buffets, in my humble opinion. The buffet at Harrah's is gross, skip it. The Paris buffet is delicious (we ate here twice), B line it to the crepes line when you get there! The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood is middle of the road.In order to save some funds we got the wristband which allows you to eat to your hearts content as much as your stomach can hold within 24 hours at the participating buffets. Our group stuffed in three buffets and could have done a fourth but we were away from the Strip on the first evening and no one wanted to drive back, so we waited until our first am to sign up. I fully recommend staying at one of the properties that offers the buffet as it will be difficult to get up and make it on time to breakfast or before your time runs out, as my friends found out last time they were in Vegas. You most definitely need to watch out for additional charges with the premium buffets as we found out unfortunately with Bacchanal. However used to it's fullest this little wristband can save you quite a bit of change which you can piss down a hole on the casino floor. Don't forget to sign up for the member rewards card as it can knock off $10, or so we were told, from your total bill.With Total Reward card. $5 off. So it is $49.99 per person...1. Started from Bacchanal Buffet Dinner: $25 extra upgrade per lunch. per dinner. Will be $15/person/breakfast per breakfast.Cold and hot Crab legs are great. Mochi and gelato are really good. Oyster shooter is good. Sushi and Chinese are not that great. Very average.The liquid sweet butter nearby the cold crab legs areas is sooooo delicious. Beautiful restaurant and fancy.We went there at 8:35 PM and waited about 15 to buy the ticket, and 5 more min to get to the seat.2. Paris: BreakfastAbove average. Many eggs choices, including egg white. Pastries such as danish and croissant are available. Crepe has 7 choices3. Spice Market: Late lunchLess crowd at 3 PM. Cup cakes is their strong item. Sooooo many choice and colorful. They are having the summer seafood festival that finally brought back the quality of Spice Market. There are crab legs, shrimps, shrimp cocktails, etc.. 4. Rio Seafood: $10 extra to upgrade.Went there around 8 PM. Short line. For real seafood lovers, here is the place. Crab legs, lobsters, shrimps, prawns, oysters, sashimi, etc.. Fresh and real. Yes, they do have beef and chicken for people who don't eat that much seafood. Several choices with gelato. The waitress and waiters are very nice and help us to clean up the tables.If you have no interest in dining at a regular restaurant, you're crazy hungry, and you don't mind eating dinner earlier the second day, this is really the biggest no-brainer in Vegas.Buy the buffet pass fairly late for your first night's dinner. Gorge yourself on the wonderful options. Have another buffet at breakfast. Have another at lunch. And eat a second dinner all on the same pass (as long you you do it before your 24 hours is up).You have to pay extra to do Caesar's Bacchanal, but it's still worth the upcharge. My recommendation would be Le Village at Paris as your breakfast option. It excels in the morning and is nothing special at other times. If you love seafood, the Rio's seafood buffet is a good choice for your other dinner. The lunch options are all pretty much the same. Bacchanal is not worth the upcharge for lunch when you consider that it will be your 3rd of 4 meals in a 24 hour period. You're just not going to get your money's worth there. So do a boring lunch one like Spice Market at PH.All in all, there are few better options to eat 14,000 calories in 24 hours.Best deal in Vegas if you love to eat! Nearly $60 with no rewards card but if you do it's $5 off. There are lots to choose from and 2 require you to pay an extra fee for those.I tried out the buffet in Paris, Harrahs, The Quad, Planet Hollywood and Flamingo. Paris is perfect for breakfast. Get there before 9 or else it's packed!Planet Hollywoods was very good as well. Lots of choices from Middle Eastern to Asian to Mexican.Harrahs was pretty good too. They seemed to have the best desserts in myopinion. Flamingo was so-so. Food was nothing special with the exception of the chocolate fountain. I didn't even try the food at The Quad.I didn't think it was open at the time since there were barely any people in it! Food just looks bad!!Yes! Yes! Yes!Definitely a great deal as far as food goes in Las Vegas.  This deal is offered by the Caesars Entertainment properties, which includes: Caesar's Palace, Flamingo, Quad, Paris, Harrahs, Rio (both buffets), and Planet Hollywood.We ended up doing this more or less by accident, but I would HIGHLY recommend this approach:Get the "weekday" price by buying the deal on Friday just before the price goes up on Friday at 11:00am.  The week day price is $49.95 per person.  On Friday at 11:00am, it goes up to $64.95 per person.  We purchased ours at 10:35am on Friday.We ended up having breakfast at Quad - big big big mistake.  That was GROSSLunch at Paris Le Village Buffet - loved it.  Food was delicious, very flavorful, setting is cute.Late dinner at Harrahs - mehBrunch with bottomless Mimosas at Paris again on Saturday after 10:00am - fantastic!!The brunch at Paris starts at 10:00am on Saturday, so with our weekday-priced buffet, we still got the Saturday morning brunch - which by itself would have been $25/person.  We happened to time it so we got there just after 10:00am, but before our buffet deal expired at 10:35am :)Unfortunately, we did not make it to the Rio buffet, which I've heard good things about.The Caesar's buffet, Bacchanal, would have been $20 extra per person and the line was long, so we decided against it.I would definitely do this again...but skip The Quad and Harrahs.Gluttony at it's best!!This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!3.5 stars rounded down!When they first introduced this program a couple years ago, it was a GREAT deal. $49 all you can eat for 24 hours right on the Strip is a STEAL.  For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.However, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.Besides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.The reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.I don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.However, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  So it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!#GLUTTONY!If you're in LV, and you feel like a fat ass, and you want to save some cash, and you don't mind buffets, and you have no dining plans, then the buffet of buffets is for you. The price went up to $49.99 so now you really have to pig out (it used to be $45) and it includes 24 hours of:Caesars Palace: Lago BuffetHarrah's: Flavors BuffetImperial Palace: Emperor's BuffetParis Las Vegas: Le Village BuffetPlanet Hollywood: Spice Market BuffetFlamingo: Paradise Garden BuffetRio: Carnival World BuffetRio: Village Seafood Buffet - available for $15 more per personThe trick is to squeeze in as many meals as possible. Note: Waiting time during weekends and peak dining periods are HELL. ANDDDD it's apparently more expensive. Try this combo: Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.Or, if you're a night owl, try: 11am Brunch, Early Dinner (linner), Late Dinner, Breakfast (you just need to get in before the pass expires).If you squeeze in 2-3 meals, you get your money back unless you add all the surcharge for Rio's Village Seafood buffet or Bachannal.GREATEST DEAL IN VEGAS!Try this winning combination for the ultimate gluttonous experience:10am: Breakfast at Flamingo2pm: Lunch at Paris (the off time will help you avoid their notoriously long line) 6pm: Dinner 1 at Rio10pm: Dinner 2 at Planet Hollywood (open late until 11pm on Fri and Sat, if Sun-Thurs, make it a 9:15pm dinner)9:30am: 2nd Day Breakfast at Harrah'sBack in April 2014, we did this and I told myself next trip I'd do it again! Just got back recently from my trip. Buffet of Buffets includes multiple buffets located in multiple hotels. I didn't get to go to all of them considering that it's just too difficult to do so in 24 hrs and I'd probably have to schedule my whole day around visiting each buffet. I did manage to visit my favorite ones so that was okay with me, the carnival buffet in rio,village seafood buffet also located in rio, and the spice market buffet in planet Hollywood. It was definelty worth the price considering we came to visit a total of 5x within all the buffets. We did get out money's worth. Next time I got to vegas, going to the other buffets will be on my check list. A little tip: try to purchase your pass afternoon or late afternoon. That was you sneak in a lunch meal for the next day, I only  say that because we purchased our around 10am, so we were able to eat breakfast the following day at 8am, but couldn't squeeze in lunch.Recommended - it's a neat way to try buffets in 7 locations for up to 24 hours.  They're not the best buffets on the strip, but then the pass is really meant to give you lots of food and selection for a low price.Some things to watch for: - Get the Total Rewards membership (it's free). - The $49 price applies during the weekdays only for Total Rewards members.  ($59 if not a member) - The $49 deal is weekday oriented, with the price being $65+ on weekends - While it's valid for 24 hours, the buffets are really only open from 7am-11pm. - Two of the buffets (at Caesar's and Rio) have an extra upcharge on top of the pass.I have been buying the Buffet of Buffet pass my every Las Vegas visit (2-3 times a year) for past couple of years, so guess I have developed some experience to share here. During my first couple of visits, I have been taking it as "ROOM & BUFFET PACKAGES" which included 2 buffet passes if you stayed at one of TR hotels in Vegas. This experience was disappointing for one reason: the Total Rewards staff in different properties (and sometimes even within one property) do not have the same information about their businesses and services. So if one person tells you one thing in one place, another person in a different place can tell you directly the opposite. Let me give you an example. When I booked my room for the first time with this package I called to my hotel (Bally's) to verify that I'm getting exactly 2 Buffet of buffet passes during my 3 days stay. The lady on the phone confirmed it. I went to Vegas, and at the Check-in another lady told me that I have only one buffet pass. I said that on the web-site it clearly says that "Stay two nights or more with us and receive two complimentary Buffet of Buffets passes". She confirmed it, and said that I'm getting two passes but I must use them at once (so I was suppose to be with a friend to use them both). It was disappointing... when I went to one of the buffets, I talked to a lady at the desk, and she said, that I can use both passes at different time and I should just ignore what the other lady at the Check-in said. So during that stay I ended up using both passes for myself and everything was fine. The next time I visited Las Vegas with a friend, and she was staying at the Harrah's and I was at Bally's again. We both had the 2 complementary passes. In my case at Bally's I already knew how to act and they didn't charge me anything for using both passes at different time, but in case of my friend at Harrah's, they'd charged her extra $50 for using both two passes. So at her check-out, I had to go to her hotel and talk with their staff to convince them that she could use her passes at different time. After about 30 minutes of arguing and calling the managers, and checking the TR's web-site they got convinced that what it says on the web-site is true, and we could use both of our passes. Although each time the situation got resolved in my favor, I still was very disappointed in Total Rewards. I just don't get how can their information be so inconsistent . So, buy the pass separately!The above information and my disappointment in TR are the reasons I'm deducting 2 points out of my rating, otherwise I would give the Buffet of Buffets straight 5 stars for being the best Buffet pass in Las Vegas. Now let me give you some information about the pass itself. First of all, it's totally worth it! Withing that 24 hour period that pass works, you can have 4+ meals at any buffet, which makes each meal worth less than $13.So this 24 hour pass gives you access to 7 buffets. Two of theme will charge you some extra money (from $10 to $25) per visit. Those are Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace and the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio.The Bacchanal Buffet is a high-end Buffet, with very good food. It's not very large but there are some dishes there, that you won't see in other Buffets (eg. lamb chops). It's worth a visit. The other buffet that charges you extra is the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I walked  trough it, and I can't really say that they had anything that seafood sections in other buffets didn't have. So probably it doesn't worth a visit, unless you're really into a seafood.The other 5 buffets are totally free if you have the pass.The best food quality you will find at Le Village Buffet at Paris and Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. They both are about the same size, and have about the same food quality with the Le Village Buffet, probably being little ahead. I recommend visiting the Le Village Buffet in the morning, because they have fantastic crepe station there, and the entire atmosphere of that buffet will give you an excellent morning mood. Also in the evening they have complementary wine. So probably these two buffets are going to be your main targets if you have the pass. The next best food quality would be probably the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. They have very good service in here and the largest food diversity. As a matter of fact, this is the largest buffet in the World! Too bad it's pretty far from the strip.Then comes the Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo. The food quality is a bit lower than in all other buffets, and in general it looks and feels bit cheaper. But when you will get tired from the lines and crowd at Le Village Buffet and Spice Market Buffet, you will come here and relax. I never visited the Flavors buffet at Harah's, but assuming it's the same level or may be even lower than Paradise Garden Buffet. Take into consideration that the better is the buffet, the longer are the lines: up to 2 hours, sometimes.I have done the buffet of buffets every time I have gone to Vegas. It really is a good deal. For those who are more on a tight schedule, I really wouldn't recommend doing this. You really have to devote one full day of doing this to get your money's worth. The price with a totalrewards card puts your total to 49.99 without tax. Make sure you print your cards out before you get to the counter, or they will send you back to get it or charge you 54.99 and make you wear a tacky wristband. START your buffet of buffets around 4-5. This gives you time to eat a late lunch, and maybe another dinner around 9. Most of the buffets close at 10. That's already two meals. Then tomorrow morning, eat breakfast, lunch, and you can also score another dinner. That's five meals for only $50! That's really a steal. With the high prices out here, you will definitely get your money's worth. Recommendations: breakfast at Paris Hotel, dinner at spice market buffet in PH, lunch at harrahs. The Banchanal buffet and rio charge an extra fee because their buffets are really well known.Got the pass at Planet Hollywood in the evening, that way wifey and I could squeeze in two dinners which ends up paying for itself... but thanks to the nice lady at the TotalRewards desk/players club, we were given the passes for free just for signing up for a TR cc with the option of cancelling it at any time and which also gives you a platinum players club upgrade for 'fast track' in the lines restaurants may have.  ymmv.wooHoO for crablegs!You feel like such a fatty buying this 24-hour pass but it's so worth! Especially when you're 20, stuck in Vegas, and with nothing else to do...The price right now is about $55 WITH the Total Rewards card. Since we weren't of age to gamble yet, we weren't allowed to get the card BUT for the same reason, we were still able to get the discounted price. Awesome!Bought the pass at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet at 3:40 PM (that way we could squeeze in two dinners, since all their dinners start at 3 PM) 3:40 PM Spice Market (PH) - was our first buffet and we were excited so we ate PLENTY and everything tastes promising. Tons of snow crab legs, and their prime rib + Yukon mashed potatoes were really good!! Everything else was ok.8:30 PM Carnival World (Rio) - they had a bit of a line but it didn't take too long to get in. They had a huuuuge selection of different foods. Highlights: *Asian selection-made to order soup bowls (ie pho and udon), dim sum (their shu mai was pretty on point), bbq foods (crispy pork, roast duck, bbq duck)*hot crab legs, ask for a little crab slicer from waiter*snow crab legs agaaain *their Mexican station had guacamole!!! Weow*GELATO.....I love gelato. I went back twice (sorry not sorry) I wouldn't get prime rib at rio..theirs was way too salty. 8:00 AM Le Village (Paris) - where do I start..this is breakfast HEAVEN! And their decor is so awesome. Wait was long, about 45 minutes to get in. (NTS-they start at 7 AM). Highlights: **made to order CREPE station**endless variety of egg dishes (fav were the EGGS BENEDICT-so good, and the lox scrambled egg)**Lyonnaise potatoes, potato triangles, fingerling potatoes?? So many potatoes..**endless variety of sausages as well. **sliced ham and slab of bacon, chef is available to cut for you**lots of French pastries but some tasted oldI saw them making creme brûlée but they don't serve it until 11 AM :( we left at 10 AM. Would definitely come back to this one, it was amaazing.2:00 PM Flavors (Harrah's) - you could definitely forget about this one. We ditched after two plates and left for Rio hahahaBut I did get raspberry gelato..and it was bomb. OVERALL-we went to 5 buffets for the price of $55 each person. $11 a buffet. Worth it especially since we couldn't enjoy Vegas to its fullest potential! Buy it during a time where you could make a 4th meal out of it. (Ie 4:00 PM) Also-drinks like soda, tea, coffee are included. And all the hotels offer free self parking, if you didn't know :)This is totally worth it if you like to eat A LOT!!! We bought our pass on a Sunday night around 9pm at the RIO. Since we were Total Rewards members, we paid $55 each. Beware: you pay upfront for the pass and they will ask you to TIP on the total. I think it's best to write: CASH, and just tip your server personally at each buffet.1st stop @9pm, Rio Carnival buffet. Waited about 20 minutes in line. HUGE dining room, tons of options! I liked the fried and steamed shrimp as well as the gelato! The crab legs and prime rib were really popular. And the Asian noodle/soup bar was really cool! The Mexican food and pasta was not touched by anyone.....2nd stop: 9am Harrah's breakfast buffet. Got seated right away! Typical breakfast options: eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, fruit, salad bar, pastries. They did have a free mimosa/bloody mary bar as well as an omelet and crepe station. I didn't try an omelet, but opted for a crepe. The line wasn't too long, but it wasn't worth the wait. The crepe itself was good, but the filling was just plain cherry pie filling from can-- gross! I did like their assortment of pastries and soft-serve ice cream (around the corner, so don't miss it). They also had a lot of sugar-free dessert options! I really liked the seating next to the live flamingos!3rd stop: 2pm lunch at Planet Hollywood. There was no wait, so we got seated right away! I thought that this was the cleanest, newest, and nicest dining area. I loved the desserts (crème brulee, cotton candy, soft-serve ice cream, etc); some of them were fancy and not just the typical pre-made, store bought desserts. The prime rib and pre-made salads were delish! I loved the Caesar salad! The sliders (both chicken and beef) were disgusting! 4th stop: 8pm dinner at Le Village at The Paris. We waited in line about 30 minutes. Everyone raves about this buffet, but it was my least favorite! I'm not sure if it was because this was our last buffet and we were sort of buffet-ed out, or because it was a Monday night. The French onion soup was the saving grace! Although I was bummed to have to search for the croutons and cheese to add to it-- should have been right next to the soup! Again, crab legs were popular with other tables, as were the crepes. We waited in line for dinner crepes-- I had a chicken, cheese, and spinach, and my husband had the mushroom. BOTH were TERRIBLE! All of the fillings were cold, and they were not cooked long enough to have the cheese melt. We were both really disappointed. The desserts were also very disappointing-- nothing was good! This pass was worth the price since we squeezed 4 buffets in, but next time we are in Vegas, I plan on trying the Spice Buffet, Bellagio, or Wynn, and skipping the pass! I only need one buffet in my life!hella worth it!..."open entry to 5 buffets for 24hrs @$54.99+"...w/ diff upgrade options to incl the other 2 premium buffets...see below...if you're gonna eat anywaz while in vegas, y not get a sampling?...i personally heart buffets!... think about it, 24hrs = at least 4 meals... your best bet is din, b'fast, lunch, & din again...y 2 dins?...best value cuz more $$... but anything more that 2 any meals period, u'd get your money's worth...this was esp what my chinese fam called a "good deal"...24hr AYCE pass to 5-7 locays!... whereas, reg. prices range frm:$19-30 for b'fast/lunch/brunch$25-46 for din...BEST VALUE: New Paradise Garden Seafood @Flamingo fri & sat luau din w/ no upgrade charge!

Sign up with their gold rewards and U pay one price of $54.99 and u get to eat buffets for 24 hrs. Buffets include harrah's, paris, planet hollywood, rio (for an upcharge EACH time) and ceasar's palace (higher upcharge each time).Upcharge for ceasar palace but worth it! Really good options and decent food.Paris on the other hand, food were over-seasoned. We upgraded to platinum rewards and had priority line and it came with many perks. Check it out!

Review Text :
"So.... Is Frank really hot???"Of course this was my mature reaction the first time I had heard about this place!  At first glance, you just don't expect this place to be that exciting.  But it's straight up good food at reasonable prices.  There is your expected burgers and dogs, but there is also some Greek food!  Plus a tiny bar area!  Cool!This is one of the cheaper options in the Strip.  My go to is the 1/2 pound Cheeseburger.  It's about $6 for a fresh off of the grill burger.  Special?  No.  But a little bit of happiness in every bite?  You bet!The hot dogs always look good, and the gyros are delicious as well!  The help here is so friendly.  If you are eating in and don't carry cash, tip on your credit card when you pay initially!  They bring your food out to you, check on you, and clear your dishes.Hot Franks is a not in the hustling part of the Strip, but I like that!  You don't have to wait forever to get a seat, and there is plenty of parking on the street.  So no reason not to check it out!

Restaurant name  Republic Ramen + Noodles

Review Text :
I'm not a fair judge of Republic Ramen. I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have "tonkotsu ramen" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.I ordered the "tonkotsu ramen" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona. I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore. And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine.Who knew Ramen could be so much fun? I came here for the first time last night with John C, and I absolutely loved it!  Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!  I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!Secretly I have been wanting to try Republic Ramen for many months, but the fact that I am not a soup person keep me from it, but after a little adventure with Ramen not too long ago, it left me craving for some more! So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delishI used to live in So Cal & Vegas, so all Asian food gets compared to those areas.  As much as I wanted to love this place, it only gets 3 Stars. The portions here are pretty big and the flavors are unique.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzw#ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6Tw#qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6TwTheir idea of "spicy" is really mild though....so for spice lovers, you'll have to supplement it with Sriracha.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQ#hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQIt's not like a legit, Ramen place you'll find in other cities....but it will suffice until I travel somewhere I can get the real thing.Return Factor - 65%

Review Text :
I love it how you order 8 biscuits and and you ask for extra honey....so we get 3 total honey packets. Seriously?We decided to go here pretty late because we had family over and forgot to eat and this location was one of the few places open that we haven't eaten in awhile.  So we go through drive thru and get the 16 piece chicken meal with 8 biscuits.  I specifically asked for more honey because I know how these fast food restaurants skimp on the condiments.  So the cashier asked us to pull foward and she'd bring the meal to us.  My Spidey senses began to tingle a little bit  but it wasn't too alarming.  I'm always skeptical when they ask you to pull foward when there are no cars behind you.  Im like ok Ill pull foward because of the potential customers that are not coming so you can keep a clear lane.  Honeslty I should have checked but the cashier had a reassuring answer for us like she was gonna load us up on honey like it was a bank robbery.  Not the case!  Get home and we got all this delicious chicken and all these biscuits and basically no honey.  Bee's work overtime to provide the masses with their honey.  I tried to eat a biscuit after the honey was gone and the dry biscuit sucked all the moisture out of my mouth.  Immediate cotton mouth was the diagnosis.  Trust your tingles and check your order before you leave is the moral of the review.

Review Text :
Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes, Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that you'd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   "tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust  " super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all. The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne, Switzerland... , there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland ,which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already. There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.   Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!This place is getting me to let go somewhat of my perception that Bell Road in Glendale is gastronomically uninspiring. When I think of Bell Road, especially the Glendale stretch, I think of nothing but chain restaurants and steakhouses. I don't know if Le Chalet is an emerging chain, but it's already unique in that they specialize in crepes. Hard to find of great quality in greater Phoenix.My friends and I went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded. Decor wise, there is a lot of charm. The chefs wear beret-style hats. The dining area, and even the restrooms, have a cobblestone motif. Reminds me a little bit of an old toy store inside Fantasyland at Disneyland though less cheesy (pardon the pun). All the napkins are even bound in cute little cow theme napkin rings. The servers all sport the suspenders one would see on traditional Swiss outfits. The menu is a cheese-lover's dream. Instead of ordering off the appetizers section, we had a regular Swiss cheese fondue for an appetizer. Cheese was just the right degree of sharpness. They bring the little fondue and long forks to the table. You can adjust the heat. Wish I had warmed it up a little more after some time had passed. Every table gets a little sliced tartine (crispy cheese bread) to start as well. After all that cheese, we each had a crepe for an entree. The crepes were folded into perfect squares with crisp edges and the filling and sauce visible in the middle. Also comes with 1/4 cup of salad with a garlic-mustard vinegrette. I had a smoked salmon crepe with lemon and dill cream sauce. I really loved the crispy outside of it. I wish I had tried one of the more exotic crepes. Some you might not be able to finish in one meal because they are filled with ingredients like potatoes and bacon. We split a salted butter caramel crepe for dessert. Heavenly. It's one big, almost paper thin triangle on top of caramel with more caramel drizzled all over. The caramel was a luscious diversion for the palate. It had some almonds that were over-toasted but not a big issue. The staff was pleasant. Next time, I want to try La Potence--what they call "The Hanging Man." A chef wheels out a cart with pieces of filet mignon hanging on a cylinder with little hooks and flambes it tableside over rice pilaf. A chef was demonstrating it to someone as we were getting ready to leave. He was thoughtful in explaining to us as well what he was doing. Can't believe I actually want to go back to that part of Bell Road but it's worth the trip. A great place for groups with its reasonable prices. There were people with their kids. But none of the kids were running around wild. Not surprising if the parents are  willing to do something like  fondue for dinner out with the children. Despite the name fondue, no pretension in the ambience. At the same time, it feels a little classier than say an Applebee's.Le Chalet has become a breath of fresh air for the Glendale/Arrowhead area, maybe even for the entire valley itself.  Such a different concept that seems to be working very well so far.   Beautifully decorated on the inside with no corners cut and great attention to detail.  Feels as if you are entering into a little French village as the doors close behind you.  There are many different crepes to choose from.  I suggest asking the server what some of the best sellers are and go from there.  Service has been exceptional each time I have visited and they even wear appropriate attire with suppenders to keep with the authenticity.While dining you'll see behind the bar two tv's that are fixated on the area where the crepes are made.  Kind of fun to see if they are making what you have ordered and exciting to see how they are prepared.  Never seen anything like this before.Before you leave you must try either the chocolate or caramel fondue for dessert.  Quite a treat that is served with apples, strawberries, brownie chunks, and cream puffs.  It is so good that it may just make you yodel on your way out from this restaurant.RACLETTE!!!!!  OHHHHHHHH sweet sweet raclette, how I love thee.This place has raclette, and it serves it in the old-school way.  Big wheel o' cheese, stuck on some stakes and melting all over meats, potatoes, and cornichons.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!I tried their savory crepes, I tried the dessert crepes, and I can't wait to come back for some chocolate fondue and more raclette.  And maybe some tartiflette.  Holy crap am I happy I discovered this place.***They also have the calories listed next to about a dozen entrees, pretty cool!I would totally recommend this place but not on a meal-eating holiday such as mothers' day. Our reservation was for 1 p.m. and we were not seated until after 1:30. They were polite and apologetic - however, offering some sort of a complimentary snack to tide us over might have helped to take the edge off! (The rose for mom was appreciated.) When we were seated, we were in the bar area which featured a guitar-playing vocalist who played covers from the Eagles to the Beatles. He had a great voice! They have hoegaarden on tap and which we promptly ordered directly from the bartender while we waited for our server to acknowledge our arrival. Immediately upon being greeted we placed an order for an appetizer (roquerfort flammenkuche - more like a pizza than tart with sour cream, pears and blue cheese) and a tartin which was an open faced grilled brie and caramelized onion sandwich, to share as an appetizer. Both were good; although, I think canned pears were used on the flammenkuche. I would return for the tartin alone! So, Le Chalet is a fondue or crepe place. We went with crepe. Mine was creamed mushrooms, rosemary ham and swiss with a sunnyside up egg on it. Acceptable but not memorable. As if that wasn't enough food -- we are a family of eating champions -- we got chocolate fondue for dessert. The fondue was a disappointment. While the brownies were moist and cake-like and the cream puffs were a popular dipping option, the chocolate was not hot. At all. It was served in a carafe and it was melted (liquid) but it was not hot. While I might be convinced to give them four stars if I lived closer and was able to dine there for a non-freakishly-crowded meal, I'm gonna go with three because I would definitely go back if I was in the area but may not make the drive for cold fondue.Crepes to DIE for.  YUM YUM YUM!  We only stopped by for desert.  OMG!  The choclate ganache and carmel fondue was ooouber good.  No words to describe it.  It was so good and we had a fun time talking.   Love the atompshere too!  The rocks on the walls, the decor, the feel of the place.  Loved it.  Need to try dinner here next time!When Le Chalet first opened, I did have something akin to high hopes for the place.  It had a nice, somewhat eclectic, look.  The concept was novel, especially for what I'd seen of Glendale.  I thought it might be a hit.Well, after a handful of visits there, I can say that my hopes are thoroughly dashed.  The worst part is that it's not even the food that's the major flaw.  Crepes are hard to make.  The fact that they are competent at it here (while also being on camera), points to a skilled kitchen staff.The problem is that the front of the house staff is so wildly incompetent that the thought of going here makes me cringe.  The majority of the servers have been sullen and wholly uninterested in dealing with customers.  The lone light in this grumpy morass was a charming server who was on her very first day there.  I hope they don't abuse the friendliness out of her.The coupe-de-grace for me was the last visit there when it took them at least ten minutes to run my bill.  Without a word of apology or recompense for the annoyance at having to wait long after the rest of my group had left.  It seemed like the manager who was trying to resolve this was wholly untrained in not only how to use the register system, but customer service as well.Nope, won't be returning here any time soon.Wowser's! Finally a fantastic place to eat in Glendale at La Chalet! We had an amazing dinning experience here Sunday.  After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I bookmarked this place as a "must try" and I'm so glad I did!We walked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was decorated.   There are two sections on the restaurant, a dining room area for families and the other a "bar and lounge" area that has a warm ambiance.  Since this trip was a family adventure we were seated right next to the Ice Cave, where my son could watch the TV's in the bar area, making the crepes, which was very was very cool.  They have very entertaining "French" signs and posters on the walls.  They also offer entertainment some nights and have special entertainers scheduled for reservations. Appetizer: Traditional Flammenkuchen ~ "Oven roasted tart with sour cream, swiss cheese, bacon and onion".  It looked like a pizza at first, but don't be fooled! The flavor and texture get you quickly. The crispy "tart" and unique flavor of the dough itself is enough to party with the sour cream love affair your mouth is having.  Meal: Berg ere crepe (ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top), Roquefort crepe (melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts), and a Roasted Chicken Salad (roasted chicken on a bed of mixed greens, cheeses and a delightful vinaigrette dressing).  They have a decent wine list, great selection of Swiss imported ails to try and a full bar. Desert:  Chocolate Fondue ~ it was fun and entertaining with the kiddo!  It wasn't too hot and they provide a lot of strawberries, apples, pastry puffs and chocolate brownie wedges for you to dip into the chocolaty goodness!  Service:  Was FANTASTIC!  Our server was able to give us just enough suggestions based on our like/dislikes.  We had the Groupon deal so it made our meal was very inexpensive.  Everything was fresh and fantastic and most of their crepes are gluten free.  We can't wait to go back and try something different.Ok, if you judge a Vietnamese restaurant based on the number of people from that culture who patronize the establishment, why not apply the same principle to other places?Strangely enough, you CAN judge Le Chalet by the same standards. No joke, last night there were people sitting at the bar conversing in French, and an entire large family came in chatting happily away, again in French. I definitely take those things as a good sign. In fact, the chef himself was French. Clearly, something good is going on there.Can I just say, yum? I've never been to a French restaurant, so this was a completely new experience for me. Their menu offers an assortment of crepes, wraps, salads, and fondue. I ordered the Mont St. Michel wrap, which was smoked salmon, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and this great dill spread. It came with a small salad dressed in a lovely honey mustard vinaigrette. It was fantastic! Fresh and complex tasting. I enjoyed every bite. I also ordered the ratatouille and shared with my friend. It was delicious as well.For dessert, I ordered the salted caramel crepe. AH-MAY-ZING! It had toasted almonds and fresh whipped cream. If it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the plate clean. So good!Our waiter was Scotty, blissfully unpretentious, refusing to affect a French pronunciation of anything, and overall affable. He did a great job. A great experience! I know where my birthday dinner's going to be...I had a great time at their monthly Clean Comedy night!Every first Sunday of the month at 7pm, Le Chalet hosts a PG rated clean comedy night safe enough to bring the kiddos along. No cover at the door, but a $5 per person minimum on food or beverage is required. As we arrived, we were greeted by a delightful gentleman, complete with authentic french accent. This guy must have been practicing it his whole life. The waiter was an energetic, pony tail sporting, ball of electricity and was delighted to call my wife out on her bland choice of pizza crepe and insisted she ordered the mushroom chicken; excelent choice sir! We had a great time listening to the comics come up to the "bat cave" like stage in their back room to quote one of the comics, and with 50% of them hitting home a humorous set it was like "batting 500, and that's a win" to quote another.We both loved the food, I had one of their delicious sandwiches and the wife couldnt stop eating her savory crepe. I normally keep my dining and entertainment limited to downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale, but this food was good enough to come back for. Here's to you clean comedy, stay funny Phoenix and happy Yelping! ;-)I came to Le Chalet for my birthday based on word of mouth and the reviews on yelp.I was disappointed, my wife was disappointed and we won't be returning unfortunately.  The good...The salted caramel dessert crepe was superb!   The flat iron Angus steak my son ordered was delicious! The ratatouille stole the show in my opinion!The bad... Appetizer - I ordered 2 orders of garlic bread.  What a complete joke!  Take a piece of sourdough bread from you local grocery store put some garlic and cheese on a SINGLE slice with tiny bit of tomato relish and voila!  At 5$ a slice...RIPOFF!!Entree - I ordered the "La Potence" the signature dish.  What a joke!  This dish is being described on the menu as being "Flambeed table side by the chef and comes with a skillet of wild rice"  THIS WAS FLAT OUT FALSE!!It was attempted by our freaking waitress (who was nice and courteous) who could not even get the portable burner working.  It was completely botched!  The signature dish, the most expensive dish on the menu and the god damn waitress flambeed the thing???  Shame on you chef and owner!  Also, "wild rice"  FALSE AGAIN...I counted and I mean I freaking counted about 20 grains of "wild rice" in a pan of white rice.  Shame on you again.  My wife had the "Swiss Cheese Fondue" and I also ate some of it...it was mediocre at best.  The bread was stale and lacked flavor.  Also the cheese was flavorless...come on guys, seriously?  For the record I ate all my meat, it was a filet mignon thank god, so in spite of the botched flambeau it was edible.  ( i skipped lunch though...not sure if this played into it)When I walked in and saw 5 out of the 30 or so table occupied at 630pm I should of known something was wrong.  This is Bell Rd at prime time dinner rush....ouch!I doubt this place will be around much longer unless the chef and owner get serious again about the food.  Carrabas next door was packed FYI, should of gone there!!Note:  You may disagree with my review, I understand but lets make this perfectly clear.  3 restaurants share the same parking lot as Le Chalet.  The Tuesday night I went with my family the parking lot was near capacity.  The restaurant (Indian Bistro) right adjacent was filled with people plus folks waiting for seats!  The "chain" restaurant was filled up with people and folks waiting outside!  Le Chalet had 8 people inside eating...my family made it 12 total.    When those "trove of mediocre chain" restaurants have 500% more business than your 5 star (Yelp) restaurant something is seriously wrong....and it sure isn't the customer...Damn, look at how many stars this place has out of 140 reviews. Nearly a 5 star rating. That's fucking phenomenal. And rightly so, as this place is truly a treasure among a trove of mediocre chain restaurants. Why on earth would you go to Carrabba's when this place is next door? First of all, cheese. Second of all, moar cheese. No seriously, if you like cheese, this is the place for you. And I. Love. Cheese. In case I was unclear earlier. If you don't like cheese, gtfo. You're dead to me. Not really, but this place is definitely all about some cheesy goodness. I ordered a savory crepe called "Roquefort". It's melted blue cheese, swiss cheese, sour cream, crushed walnuts and caramelized apples. DEAR GOD. I inhaled it. My friends both got some amazing-looking grilled cheese thing. There was cheese ON TOP of the bread. Wow! The food truly was unique, authentic and appropriately priced. I clearly enjoyed it to an extreme degree.As for the service - great! Very friendly and inviting. The owner, Alain, was a complete sweetheart as well. He came over to our table and chatted us up. We asked him a ton of questions about his heritage and the restaurant itself. He was so genuine and kind-hearted, I could not wait to write my review about Le Chalet. And I certainly will be telling people to go there. He deserves the business, as I'd never expect such a gem of a restaurant to be located 56th Ave and Bell.HollaFor March's International Supper Club UYE #ISCUYE, Le Chalet was the place that was picked, and I was pretty excited to go. I love me some crepes! For me, this wasn't my 1st time here, but I was just as thrilled, after looking over the menu I went with Savoyarde, it was sautéed potatoes & onions, bacon with melted raclette cheese and black pepper in a buckwheat crepe, let me tell you, the potatoes, cheese, onions and bacon are a marvelous combo, this crepe was delish!For desert I again ordered a Nutella & Banana crepe, Nutella is crack, I just can't get enough of it, and put it with banana inside a crepe so so good.Service was good, just a little slow, but I understand we were a group of 12 to14, but they were very friendly and helpful, so really I didn't mind too much, gave me time to socialize with the group.I really like Le Chalet, wish it was closer and look forward to coming back!For March 2014, the International Supper Club UYE dined at this establishment.  I was happy to try out the place because I had heard some nice things about it.   I ordered the Fresh Cold Cuts and Cheese plate to share with the group.  This was a fine appetizer that was good for sharing and passing among the Yelpers seated at the table.  For dinner I ordered the Mount St. Michel.   Unfortunately, this wrap was equally unappealing to my eyes as it was to my taste buds.  I ate about a third of it and tossed the rest.  I took photos of it, but I think it would be unfair to the restaurant to post them.  I might change my mind later.  Tom S talked about the pictures so bad, I felt horrible for taking it.  I did not order a desert.  I was happy, but not impressed, with the group experience.  We were seated in the second dining room with the stage.  I believe on certain nights, the restaurant has live performances, so check their website if you are interested.  There were about 16 of us that night with one server to take all of our orders.  That seemed to prolong the ordering process and the service was a little slow.  I suppose we were served in a fairly timely manner, nevertheless.  With the size of our groups, I tend to be a little more tolerant of slow service.  BUT, 1 server?My return factor for Le Chalet is about 10%.

Restaurant name  Verde
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The owners of Verde have converted an old building into something modern and vibrant, a south-of-the-border neighbor for the restaurant row along First Street between Pierce and Garfield in downtown Phoenix.The food here is made from scratch, including mouth-watering flour tortillas made by hand. You can taste the love. The only item on the menu that isn't made in-house is the tortilla chips, and those come from the legendary La Canasta.It's fresh Mexican food with one surprise -- not one burrito is on the regular menu. How can this be? Simple, it's all about down-home plates filled with roasted chicken, red chile or their amazingly killer green chile.Verde is a fast casual restaurant, so you order at the counter, then take a seat while the food is prepared.First to arrive were the Chips and Salsa ($2.50), a large bag with perfectly crunchy chips accompanied by red and green salsas. The tang from the green salsa was bright and made my mouth water for more. While the red was good, I would have enjoyed a little more heat.Weekends at Verde mean a handful of breakfast options, including a few coveted burritos. I couldn't stop eating the Green Chile with Beans and Eggs ($5). The spicy simmered pork was so tender and delightful that it was like green chile butter as I slathered the meat onto a piping hot flour tortilla. If you order only one thing from here, make it the green chile.After the first bite of Red Chile Beef ($7) I was puzzled trying to figure out the exotic flavors. It's not your typical red chile; its flavors of clove reminded me of a cross between curry and mole, if that's even possible. Beans came along side and, with smoky notes from the addition of chorizo, are worthy of eating alone.If chile isn't your thing, the roasted Oregano Lime Chicken ($8) is a great alternative. The meat was practically falling off the bone and right into the awaiting flour tortilla.Beef Tacos ($7) were featured as a special on my last visit. Two corn tortillas are filled with tender stewed beef, then topped with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato. They are simple and satisfying, with the addition of a pinch of salt to bring out the sweetness of the beef.With outstanding green chile, this place is called Verde for a reason. They've got some of the best green chile I've had in a long time, and don't forget the tortillas.

Restaurant name  Badger Cafe

Review Text :
This is embarrassing.I decided to go on a Burger Binge to find the best burger at 3 places that are within blocks of each other on East Tropicana.The Badger Cafe.The Dispensary.Sammy's LA Pastrami.I know, I know....a little excessive. But someone had to do it, and it was very revealing.The Badger Cafe has the best burger of the three, without question.It's grilled not fried and the meat is fresh and flavorful. And it's cheap: $3.99 for a half-pound burger, or another dollar if you get it to take-out.The Dispensary's burger is a close second....same price for a half-pounder, but $2 extra for take-out. This was the only burger of the three that came with fries, but unfortunately they were boring and limp.The big disappointment was Sammy's. I like the place, and I especially like the guy who runs it. But this burger was really uninteresting and the only one I didn't finish. And it's twice the price of the other two.The problem is the meat. It tastes like those pre-packaged patties you get at Costco...kinda thin and not flavorful at all. It's obvious these are not freshly-made patties and that makes the burger very ordinary.However, Sammy's does have the best fries of the three of them: the Garlic Romano Fries are phenomenal, but cost extra.This place is kind of hidden in a plaza full of other cafes. As part of the Rum Runner Lounge, it is a 24 hour sit down style restaurant. From all of my visits so far there are more pros then cons.ProsSince its 24 hours you can come here any time. The lounge itself is sealed off from the cafe because they put a door to the entrance instead of being an open space. Menus are on all the tables so when you sit at whatever table is available you can already start looking at your options and everything is on the menu is available at any time. Every table has all the condiments you will ever need for any of your entrees. ConsLIke I mentioned above, since its 24 hours, if you come between the hours of 12 am and 5 am, you just might run into some colorful characters. The bathrooms are located in the casino so if you have kids, they need to be escorted at all times.As for the food, I have discovered so far that most everything I have tried is good. The things that you cant go wrong with are the burgers, hot wings, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and any breakfast item. For the burgers which are half pound not frozen angus beef patties, (starting at $4.99) you have a checklist of what you want on there so you can mark off what you want with the pencils provided. Items like pickles, lettuce, mayo, and onions are free while some others like tomatoes, cheese, bacon, etc are extra. Same goes for the hot wings. You select your quantity and what flavor.The one downer for food I got one time was the new york steak. It was bland. I had to douse it with a combination of A1 and Heinz 57 sauce just to give it some kind of flavor.Service for the most part was stellar. Understandably if the place is busy then service will be slow sometimes especially when patrons from the lounge order things as well. Yes, you can hang out in the lounge and order food to be brought out to you. So overall, Badger Cafe is a nice spot to hit up if you are in the area no matter what time it is for good grub at decent prices. Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #150

Restaurant name  Nourish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
While randomly searching the internet for 'Vegan restaurant Scottsdale', I stumbled upon Nourish. Nourish is a new restaurant that has only been open a couple weeks. What I love about their menu is that they denote vegan menu items.Nourish Menu http://nourish123.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/menu-nourish-updated1.pdf10 of their 12 starters, sides and snacks are vegan (11 are vegetarian)5 of their 7 soups and salads are vegan (6 are vegetarian)All beverages are vegan1 of their 6 sandwiches are vegan (3 are vegetarian)All 3 Non-beef burgers are vegan1 of their 7 entrees is vegan (4 are vegetarian)They rotate their desserts, including vegan selectionsToday we decided to get take-out to eat by the pool, since it is such a lovely day. We both ordered the sweet teriyaki burgers.The burger is an amazing combination of chickpea, sweet potato and black beans with a slightly spicy seasoning. It is served with air-fried (without oil) crispy sweet potato waffle fries. The fries are seriously crave-worthy. They are seasoned with cinnamon, which I thought was a surprisingly good flavor combo. The burger is normally served on a bed of greens, but we got ours on multi-grain buns (lucky for us). I can't imagine this burger without the bun; the bun was the perfect compliment to the burger. We got the teriyaki sauce on the side, along with a garlic dressing that I didn't see mentioned on the menu and they were both awesome. The burger came with cucumber, tomato, onion and lettuce.We decided to try the Ogave sodas and they were awesome. We had the cola and mandarin key lime flavors.We asked about vegan desserts and sprung for some vegan chocolate chai ice cream. OMFG. The ice cream, which is made with coconut milk, was probably the most amazing flavor of ice cream I have ever had. The take-home container had 4 baby scoops...I could have eaten like 2000 scoops of it. It was so good that I want to go buy an ice cream maker just to try to recreate the flavor at home.This new restaurant will be seeing a lot of me....I already want to go back for 2nds. ;)Nourish is one of those places I recently found that I'm hesitant to share on Yelp because I selfishly don't want them to get so crowded that I'll have to wait for a table when I go... A friend of mine who lives in the Optima told me about "this new healthy restaurant that opened up" recently, and I couldn't wait to try it. Jared and I went in for dinner last Friday night and were both extremely pleased... we both loved the casual environment, friendly service, and of course the incredibly fresh and healthy food.  We worked up an appetite by taking a bike ride prior to our visit and we were both starving when we arrived.  We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu.  OK... that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but we did have the following:1 x chunky sweet potato and avocado salad - (one of my favorite things that we tried)1 x quinoa salad 1 x confetti veggies of the day 2 x seared sashimi-grade ahi tuna 1 x salmon burger with peppered air-fried, no oil, sweet potato fries1 x steamed teriyaki wild rice bowl with chicken2 x flavored water of the day (it happened to be blackberry that night)And as if that wasn't enough food for our first visit, we ended up purchasing two orders of quiche so we would have breakfast the next morning... and guess what? We finished everything we ordered and enjoyed it all!To top off the experience, we got a chance to meet Kirstin, the owner, and she was extremely sweet.  She told us about how she came up with the idea for the restaurant and all of the planning and hard work that went into it.  Judging by our experience that night and the reviews so far, Kirstin's work is paying off... Jared actually went back for lunch today and I was jealous!  But I am excited to go back to "nourish" myself very soon.  A few additional notes:*There is a bar with plenty of outlets set up so bring your computer and have a working lunch... they've got WiFi too!*There is a long list of wine, beer, and cocktails.*Parking is kind of annoying... park underground and walk up.*There is a dog friendly patio!*They are closed on Mondays.*They offer personalized healthy meal plans.*Catering is also available.I have a new favorite restaurant!I had heard about this place because my sister had interviewed for a hostess position early this spring before the place had opened. She ended up taking another job, but she told me how beautiful the place was going to be and how health conscious and vegetarian/vegan friendly it was. I was excited to hear of a place like that finally opening in the East Valley. I love me some Green- but most of that place is vegan junk food and not so healthy (albeit delicious).I had the Teriyaki burger, which was yummy and very flavorful. I spared myself the carbs and had it on the field greens, but I sort of wish I would have went with the bun after reading some reviews.I even went with a very NON vegetarian, and he ended up really happy with his burger. Seems like this place has something for everyone.I just had water, but the oogave sodas and all the drinks looked tasty. Maybe next time. Also on the agenda for next time is the deserts!I'll be back for sure- it was great leaving from dinner and not feeling disgusting or suffering from gut-rot.Eating healthy and eating out very rarely mesh well together. If presented with the choice of something like a 'Prime Rib Sandwich with Garlic Shoestring Fries' or a 'Roasted Chicken Salad'...there are very few people who would pick the salad over the sandwich under their own free will (excluding people who are under the influence of the newest greatest dieting trend). My girl and I try to eat healthy...we'll avoid anything that's too over the top; and we strive to find places that focus on being fresh and not overly greasy. That being said, there are limited choices when looking for establishments that cook up low fat food that doesn't taste like old cardboard. Nourish is definitely going for that niche...the health conscious foodie. In addition they offer pretty extensive options for people on Gluten free diets and Vegans. Don't get scared away though, there's still plenty of options for the rest of us. We tried a few things here; the burger and the tenderloin grilled cheese sandwich. Both don't sound healthy, so I know I'm going against everything I just said about the place; but both meals were very fresh tasting and had zero grease or fat; the food tasted healthy...there's an obvious difference in the type of lean meat used and in the cooking process if you were to compare it to a normal burger at a place like Chilis. It's like night and day. Also their sweet potato fries were quite tasty and were cooked in some way I don't completely understand (air popped?). All this being said...the food didn't knock our socks off, but it was good for what it was...and for being on the healthier side, I can forgive it a bit. It was a perfectly good meal, and we felt great afterwards...that's more than I can say about a lot of other places we've left bloated and greased out from.One quick downside to mention is the parking. It's pretty confusing. If you can find the entrance to the underground parking you have to pretty much sprial around this maze of parking spots looking for a 'guest spot', and once you find one you'll have to navigate through the Optima Condo area looking for Nourish...I'm still not quite sure how to find it...we just kind of stumbled into it; so good luck on that. P.S. Flavored water...some people have mentioned it...the menu talks about it; I don't think ours was flavored at all...not sure if they were out of it or if the flavoring was so mild we just didn't notice...hmm.3.75/5.The Beautiful Carin and I have never been confused with health food enthusiasts.Nevertheless, in effort to broaden our horizons, we decided to give Nourish a spin at lunch a few weeks ago, and see if it might "change our point of view".I was a little disappointed, frankly.But then again, I freely admit that I might be an outlier to their target demographic!Located in the ruins of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon...I mean the Optima Camelview...the place is definitely going for a hip feel...but it just doesn't quite succeed.Nourish is just so aggressively healthy...from the colors of the décor to the too eager menu to the very strict tables and chairs and the meager portions...all of them as warm and inviting as a rap on the knuckles from the teacher in the one room schoolhouse where I spent my first few years in the educational system.The patio, while nice enough, overlooks the desperately deserted inner atrium of the OC on one side, and the street on the other.We gamely settled into the rock hard and posture correcting chairs (subtly telling us to "sit up straight and eat our veggies...act healthy dammit!") and perused the menu.We looked and looked and looked, but I couldn't find the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes (which I consider health food) and Carin looked in vain for some of her favorites (or at least some salad dressing that wasn't essentially flavored water).We start with a shared bowl of "chili"...all I have to say about that "chili", is that it wasn't.I ordered a "Salmon Burger"...which I (silly me) assumed would constitute salmon and a bun...but when the menu says "served on a bed of greens" they mean "you just get some lettuce under this thingy...no buns".I suppose that wouldn't have been so bad if they had given me an actual slab of salmon, like I can get at AJ's grill for $3.00 less...but this was a "salmon pattie"...ground up salmon and fillers (bread crumbs, green onion, chopped pepper, and assorted other crap).Why did they do that to a perfectly good piece of salmon?Unless of course it wasn't a perfectly good piece of salmon, but a perfectly good can of salmon!I don't know...it was just fishy...and not in a good way.At least it was gluten free!Carin's "Kitchen Sink" salad was also a disappointment...unless by "Kitchen Sink" you mean a small salad consisting almost entirely of sliced peppers, shredded carrot and cucumber, onions and a little bit of romaine, in a small soup bowl...maybe they have a very tiny kitchen and the sink is quite small...I just don't know and I didn't bother to investigate.The service was perfunctory, but fine (we didn't get a lot of interaction with our server...he was working pretty hard for the attention of the young lady behind the bar, as well as chatting with a couple of his friends who happened to drop by).The good news for us is that place was essentially empty from the time we showed up (at 12:30 on a pleasant Saturday afternoon) until we left, so we had a waiter all to ourselves (even if his attention was split between us and his potential hook-up).All-in-all, this little repast cost us about $40...and we walked out of Nourish feeling not so much "nourished" or "nurtured" or "healthy" as we felt "corrected", "admonished" and "hungry".Oh well, I tried to be healthy...it's just not in my DNA!I love this restaurant.I eat an incredibly strict paleo-ish diet which means I don't eat the following:canola oil, soy oil, sugar, flour, farmed salmon (served by virtually every other restaurant in town including True Food Kitchen), grain fed beef, and a host of other food.  It sounds awful, but believe it or not there is no limit to the number of incredibly delicious meals that can be made despite these limitations.  Unfortunately, these meals *almost* always have to be home cooked.  Restaurants simply have not gotten to delivering a pure, healthy meal.Well, that changed when I discovered Nourish.  Their menu consists of a variety of items that I can eat.  As a bonus, their food actually tastes great.There isn't much more for me to say: a restaurant that cooks healthy food that I can enjoy.  Given my incredibly strict definition of the word healthy (and I admit that this is a relatively subject label as the scientific research stands in the year 2012), Nourish is one of the few restaurants I can enjoy.  And so I love them.Other notes: the service was hit or miss when they opened but these days it has gotten a *lot* better, to the point where I rarely have a problem.

Review Text :
Excellent service and great pizza.  The owner came by several times and  suggested we try the Regina Margherita as first timers;  a simple cheese and tomato thin crust pizza.  We tried it and were not disappointed.Several days earlier the owner, server and chef came to visit Scottsdale Community College for an Italia event sponsored by the SCC Language Department.  I listened to how they use only ingredients (at least the primary ones) directly from Italy and the 900 degree oven that can cook a pizza in 60 seconds.  The trick in Italy is quickly cook the crust but not overcook the tomato and cheese.  They served very generous samples of lasagna and a traditional thick cheese pizza at SCC.  Both were very good but had to go to their restaurant to experience the "real" thin crust Italian pizza with the Italian DOP rating expected soon. Not exactly sure what the letters DOP stand for but it is a good thing. Will be back again to try to try some of the other thin crust pizzas!!It is with 100% confidence that I write a completely different review for Pomo, a review that is 180 degrees different than the original. As my previous entry mentioned we went to Pomo a few weeks ago and our experience was less than stellar.  It was going to take nothing less than a very sincere apology to get me back.  And I got that and a whole lot more.  This past week I received a personal email from owner Stefano Fabbri that not only apologized for the oversight but also explained that he would like to win back my patronage.  So I decided to take a work associate over and give Pomo a second chance.From the moment we entered, the experience was different.  We received polite and attentive service from the start.  Stefano himself came by and not only explained to us how he had used my complaint to restructure how his servers operated but also went into great detail describing what goes into making an authentic Neapolitan pizza.    And than the pizza came.  It was light and full of simple flavor, a symphony of perfection.  You could absolutely taste the quality and the care that went into its preparation.  There are no short cuts here, just pure craftsmanship and passion.    And finally, the education came.  He walked us through all of the steps, ingredients, and preparation that go into making this treasured dish.  We tasted the mozzarella di bufala, we  inspected the handcrafted Italian wood burning stove, we learned about the delicate flavor of the tomato that is so often lost by pizzas that are overcooked.  We laughed, we almost cried, we talked about the old country.  I am convinced that once the public is able to understand and distinguish an Italian pizza from those raised in the U.S. that Pomo will become a prized fixture in the Phoenix dining scene.  This place offers an experience that is exceptionally authentic....and authenticity, as most of us know, is in very short supply in Scottsdale.Stefano Fabbri, owner of Pomo Pizzeria, is not only passionate about his food, but he has a contagious enthusiasm that's informative and downright convincing.The Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana at the Borgota in Scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space. The dining room has soaring ceilings, dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of Italy. It appears to be another trendy, albeit sexy, pizzeria, but it's actually more than that.Pomo recently earned a certification from the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, meaning that everything from the flour, olive oil, kneading and baking meets exacting standards. This is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification. But the staff doesn't let the honor go to their heads; service is friendly and attentive.Pizza is the name of the game here, and seeing it prepared is a blast. In the open part of the kitchen you'll see a classic red Berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats. This is one serious meat slicer that I can only dream of having in my own kitchen. To see it in action I ordered the Affettati Misti ($14.95), a plate filled with the chef's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola, prosciutto, salami, olives and cheese.At lunchtime, Pomo serves a handful of Paninis, but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches. They quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred, yet light and crispy bread. Then they stuff it full of Italian goodness, like the Salami Panini ($9.95), which was filled with spicy salami, arugula and mozzarella cheese. Served with a simple side salad, the panini was excellent and satisfying.Like the panini, pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees. This means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook. By Naples standards, the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust isn't ultra crispy as one might expect. Instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew.Fabbri recommended starting with the basics, and since he'd know best, ordering the Regina Margherita ($11.95) was on point. The tomato sauce was bright and sweet, then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil.Another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the Calzone Napoletano ($14.95), which is not your run of the mill calzone. It was filled with spicy salami, tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. Each creamy bite deserved another, as I wickedly ate the whole thing.What better way to end than to order dessert? While they do have standards like Tiramisu ($7.95) and Panno Cotta ($7.95), the light and airy Semifreddo Di Mandorle ($7.95) was a standout. Each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust. More please.With a passion for tradition, this might be as close to an authentic Italian pizza as you'll get without going to Italy.On a hot and humid Friday night wanted a tasty pizza done right Heard about a place called Pomo that would be good for some homos (sapien that is) Stepped inside to discover a little waiter like no other A friendly man with an Italian tongue who made our night a ton of fun Got a few pizzas from the menu to try Margherita, Diavola and the Fritta, oh my! A fried pizza we had never had before but after one bite, we were sure to come back for more! Perfect crust and flavorful sauce made our Pomo pizza 'the boss' You're sure to become a fan if you give it a whirl just don't eat too much or you'll have a little hurl! 4.25/5Went back last night for dinner.  We went a little later (7pm) and there was a 20 minute wait and I was kicking myself for forgetting to make a reservation, especially because there were four of us this time around, and it is a very small place. It gets loud in there when it's busy. Joint was packed and it was a little toasty hot from #1) all the windows #2) the door opening and closing blasting hot 114 degree air inside #3) 950 Pizza oven #4) It's frigging HOT OUTSIDE!!!! The poor hostesses and staff.  I bet they can't wait 'til the fall.We ordered the mango salad again, (as fabulous as the last time) our friends had the caesar, which they said was very good as well.  We got a custom pizza with sausage and arugula.  They got the Pomo pizza that has all the fixins on it, kind of like a 'supreme' pizza.  Both were delicious! We both had our pizzas cooked a little extra time and they came out perfectly this way! I highly recommend it, especially if you get one with a lot of toppings on it.  Next time adding parmesan to our plain sausage pizza would have put it over the top.  We finished off again with the Tiramisu and the pineapple and sorbet dessert.  We didn't try their pineapple because we were so full, but it looked very fresh and light. Love this place! We will be back for an earlier dinner, or make reservations next time.  FYIBe prepared to walk a little ways, there is no valet, and the parking lot is narrow and long.  It gets filled up quickly because it also shares parking with the hotel in front as well as Dolce at the end.Rounding down from 4.49 to 4 because that's how we do it. I wish half stars were available.Look, I'm not going to say this is the best pizza ever in history. Or even the best in the Valley because a straight-up review shouldn't be about comparing local pizza to Bianco. So...When my wife and I could finally afford the time-off and the cost of a real honeymoon, we rented a car and drove Europe with almost no agenda for awhile. One of our stops that we happened upon was Santa Margherita, Italy. This cool little village is on the Portofino Peninsula. But unlike Portofino itself it wasn't loaded with Loveboat tourists. It seemed to be mostly young Italians looking to get laid (after eating fantastic food of course!). Kind of like what the douchebags from Jersey Shore wish they were. But, they aren't. Because real Italians don't say stupid shit like "pro-jute" and "mootzarell" or "GTL".At the end of the strip of venues catering to partiers, on the walk back up to our hotel, was/is? a little place called Santa Lucia. It was the essence of simplicity and taste. We found ourselves eating there at least twice a day. A couple times we'd have dinner there, go out, and come back and take a pizza back to our little terrace and eat naked on the balcony after the love. My wife's lack of clothing very likely made more people happy than my ass.Pomo Pizzeria evoked strong memories of that perfect pizza at Santa Lucia. And that means a lot. It's great that they have this special certification of 'Verace Pizza Napoletana' - but that's not what matters to me. It's how distinctly wonderful it tastes and how many memories it brings back.STUFF I LOVE1) simple, simple, simple. with the right ingredients and the right approach, you don't need designer pizza pretension or bullshit.2) friendly from the first phone call to the greeting at the door to every step after. that sticks with you. service was thoughtful, personal and well-timed without being patronizing.3) welcoming to families. we know how challenging this can be and we're pretty conscious of the impact a teething baby can have on our neighbors. but a family-friendly place tends to attract family-friendly customers and our daughter enjoyed flirting with anyone around us. and when the teeth struck, it was easy enough to take her on a calming walk through the beautiful grounds.4) Borgata is that weird place that should be doing so much better than it is. It's got location, it's got charm. It's built like brick shithouse. and it's got a genuine Old World feel (dare I say, Tuscan), but it's not faux like everything else these days. this place is really made of stone and it wastes tons of square footage with unused vertical space and wandering outdoor areas. and that right there is probably why it's hard to monetize this place, especially when in a shit economy, and being owned by Macerich. so I love that Pomo adds some vibrance to a place that I pray never gets bulldozed in favor of stucco palace full of "concepts".STUFF I DON'T LOVE[i got nothing]The fact that this is minutes from where we live is a huge bonus. It's not going to cut into our Bianco time, because nothing other than our feisty daughter could do that. It will more likely cut into our lunch and cooking at home time. So be it.After exploring the menu more, I could see 5.After the Cupcake Love In I needed real food.  Salad, ya, that's it, a good salad.  So I pulled out my cell phone and opened my trusty Yelp app to see what was close by.  Pomp Pizzeria sounded like a place I could get a good salad so off we went.  We were greated warmly and seated.  The young man who was our server was nice and even listened to my daughter as she told him about all the cupcakes she had just consumed.  He brought drinks promptly and let us leisurely look at the menu.  They had those sticky stick things for the kids so my daughter was happily making shapes and animals while we waited for our food.  My daughter had pasta with butter which she loved. And I had salad and pizza.  The salad was great!  Just what I needed.  The pizza was very good but I though the crust should have been a bit crisper on the bottom.  I took most of it home anyway and thought it might be better heated up the next day.  I heated it in the over the next day and it still seemed soggy.  Next time I'll try it in a frying pan on the stove.  I would come back here on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a relaxing early dinner.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff was friendly and accomadating.  And I loved the italian scene on the wall.....so cool!After all the hype on Yelp, I had to get myself over to Pomo. It's a great little place with a lot of atmosphere. I can envision myself on a warmer night out on their patio sipping my wine and chowing down on pizza. The staff was attentive and friendly and offered helpful recommendations. We started with bruschetta and the Romana salad. The bruschetta was very good- delicious crispy bread with a generous heap of flavorful tomatos on top. The Romana salad was perfectly simple... romaine, croutons, parmesan and I thought I tasted a some basil.  It was perfectly dressed too - not too light or heavy handed on the dressing. After a lot of contemplation, we decided on the Pomo pizza (sausage, roasted bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms). My first bite was okay, but after I doctored it a little with some parmesan, pepper flakes and a little drizzle of pepper-infused olive oil, it was delicious. The crust is definitely a winner. I will most definitely be back!Holy F%#K!!! This place is mind blowing.Pizza was AMAZING!  Did the Fradiavolo pizza.  This place is so unique. It has an olive oil and red pepper mix that you can pour on your pizza and dip your crust in.  So unique, and I just could not stay away from it. Olive Oil and Red Pepper.. These are a few of my favorite things!This pizza is fantastic. I usually like a thin and crunchy crust and the way they cook it the pizza is very fluffy... but oh my. It tastes fantastic and is really unlike other pie I have had.  This place got 5 stars because as the icing, I had an itailian desert which was a chocolate pastry with chocolate cream on the inside. It had a fancy name so I don't know what to call it... but it was fantastic.I can't wait to go back.Pomo, how have I missed your existence for so long?  I hadn't noticed a single review until my friend, Kerry M, suggested we go visit you for my birthday dinner.  We made a reservation, which proved to be unnecessary for our early-bird arrival at 5:30.  Definitely should call ahead if you like to eat later, though.  It was really packed when we left.The layout isn't my favorite.  Too many tables, too close together, and it got really noisy in there!  While I really do enjoy eavesdropping on conversations, this was a little much for me.  Luckily, the service was so fantastic, that I quickly got over my issues with the floorplan.  Our waiter had amazing Italian charm and seemed to read my mind the entire night - lemon for my water?  Why, yes, thank you!  Spicy, red-pepper olive oil?  I was JUST going to ask for that!  I love when waitstaffs are so good at anticipating needs.On to the food:  I have never had traditional Neapolitan pizza before, but had done my requisite yelp research before our night out, so I knew to be prepared for a thin, and perhaps soft-in-the-center crust.  I think it was perfect.  I love the super-quick cooking time (5 minutes from ordering to delivery at our table!).  My choice, the Principe, was delish - simple, perfect tomato sauce topped with prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula and shaved parmesan.  Drizzled with the incredible olive oil, it was one of the better pizzas that I've ever enjoyed.  SO good in fact, that I finished the entire thing - and I may or may not have stopped at Zinburger for a milkshake on the way home.  I'll be avoiding my scale for a few days...Looking forward to a return visit!I am in love with 'Pomo Pizzeria! They had me at "Ciao!"...I love this place, cause for a moment in time-- I get transported back to Italy. Everything is authentically Italian. Certified Italian -- the only restaurant in the entire state of AZ that has been through the rigorous requirements to be certified Napoletana. As others have mentioned, the 6,000lb pizza oven is even from Italy. The quality ingredients in their plates -- all imported. Even chitter chatter in the restaurant -- in Italian - l'amo. For Valentine's Day, I surprised my hubby with a dinner date here. I knew that he would fall smitten in love with their autentico Napolitano blistered-crust pizza. Fortunately, I found this place the week earler - as a referral from an esthetician. When I dined here the first time solo, I had wonderful and friendly service dining in the bar area. I loved hearing the cooks & service staff speaking in Italian. I enjoyed the small, cozy atmosphere of the tables. I loved the wall mural of the Italian street scene complete with Vespa (minus the real toxic exhaust fumes). Yes, I fell in love with this restaurant my first visit. Enter Valentine's Day -- the restaurant was filled, and our reserved table was waiting for us. Again, love the atmosphere here. All servers were friendly and very hospitable. We kicked off the night with a bottle of Soave - -  Tedeschi, I believe. Very good... light, white wine with some flavor. For starters we had the Caprese - - lovely buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and also some sliced bread drizzled with EVOO. Delish! I requested extra of the OO with the red peppers... very tasty to dip with. Then on to the pizza - - we tried the Don Alfonso this time. It was very good -- however, I think the pizza I had the first time was even better. (I can't remember the name.... uggh! ... but it had prosciutto, salami creminilli (which was off the hook!), and a bunch of other meats for $16.95.  Next time we go back, I'm getting that kind again. Dolce... of course! Due espresso, another sweet wine for me (forgot the name - - but it was good.) Not too overly sweet....  But the Tiramisu! Si, the Tiramisu -- was as delicious and divine as I was hoping it would be. My husband is not a big Tiramisu fan, but he said that it was probably the best he's had. Dusting of cocoa powder on top, moussy layer after layer -- love their Tiramisu!It was a great evening -- great food -- great service! No brainer that we'll be back. Va bene!I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.After a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizzaAfter a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=Me5jFmm9lrWCfKaRI4OtFQAfter dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhAOverall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.Return Factor - 99%This is for Lydia & MacRae - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOG3rD5CrQBeing the ancient age of 30, I have just now realized that I can categorize pizza into 2 categories: fancy pizza, and hood pizza. Hood pizza is the kind of pizza you buy in your hood. This includes the chain restaurants and those local joints that may not have a wood-fired oven, or they may have a wood-fired oven, it just depends on how the place feels. Some hood places mask themselves as fancy pizza, and hood pizza can sometimes be mistaken for fancy pizza. It is totally subject to the whim of the individual. A hood place can never receive more than 4 yelp stars, but 4 stars is good. A fancy pizza place can never be compared to a hood pizza place. They are two completely different worlds. This place is fancy. If you are normal, and not a douchebag, just ignore all the douchebag clientele in this place although it might be hard because we are all packed like sardines. Remember, you are focused on the pizza. You. Pizza. Focus.I'm sorry I can't remember the server's name, but she was AWESOME and attentive. Her behavior almost made me stop thinking the douchebag at the table next to me was a pedophile. The hostess was also really nice - we came in on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we had to wait about 45 minutes which was fine except for the douchebag clientele complaining about how they have to wait for so long. Effers. The hostess handled the situation with grace.We started with that salad that has the mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. I can't remember it and I'm not pausing to look it up. All you need to know was that it was fantastic. I've had many of these salads, and I get really angry because tomatoes don't taste like tomatoes anymore, they taste like nothing. A watery nothing. The tomatoes in this salad were pretty good. Not the tomatoes I remember as a kid, but still tasty.The kitchen lost our pizza ticket, and the server, again, a really nice person, admitted it and said she would have it right away. This was fine because I knew it would be quick and I could continue eavesdropping on the douchebag on the other side of me, talking in a fake east coast italian accent about how his italian grandmother beat him to discipline him. I think he was lying, because if he was disciplined by someone as a child, he wouldn't talk like such a douchebag.Anyway, the pizza WAS AWESOME. I AM NOW TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD. We had a margherita pizza. I don't know if i spelled that right, and I don't care. The sauce was simple but really effing good. The crust melts in your mouth and is perfectly chewy with a little bit of crunch from the charred bubbles. I will make the trek to Douchebagville, AZ for another pizza soon, but not on a Saturday night.OMG! I'm hooked on the fried pizza. Don't judge. It's DELICIOUS! When we were in southern Italy a few summers ago, we enjoyed panzerotti -- blurring cultures for the sake of description: they taste like a fry bread empanada filled with tomato sauce, basil and loads of cheese. I found recipes once I returned but, truth be told, I suck at frying. Imagine my delight when I saw the fritta ($12.95) on the menu at Pomo! Quadruple that delight when a "panzerotti" no less than FOUR TIMES the size of what I had in Puglia was delivered to my table! With each bite, the rich flavor of the fried crust melts into the sweetest tomato sauce in the Valley, complimented by a burst of basil and stretchy, milky cheese!I've been lucky enough to visit Italy and try authentic Italian pizza. While I have tried the Napolean pizza, I will say that it was in Rome and not Naples, but that didn't seem to make a difference in taste to me. Needless to say, the pizza I had in Rome was the pizza I use to weigh against any other slice of pizza. Pomo Pizzeria has come pretty darn close to authentic pizza in my book. I'm late in the Pomo Pizzeria game and just visited recently. This is hard to admit especially since the restaurant is in close vicinity to my home. Since the weather is so nice, I was looking for a place with a patio where we could sit and enjoy the last remaining days of cool weather. The patio at Pomo is relatively small so they had about a thirty minute wait which was well worth it for us since we were in no hurry. So we set up shop at the bar for a glass of wine while we waited. The wine was quite tasty! We ordered a house cab and for $6.75, it was a pretty decent glass of wine. About thirty minutes later, we got seated on the patio and the meal began! Be warned that the patio is intimate and if you need to have a private conversation without a third party peeking in, I'd choose another location in the restaurant. It's authentic to European dining in that sense and we were in very close vicinity to our neighbors. We started with the bruschetta and Cesar salad (Romana) to share. The salad is huge and you could probably share it with two to three other people. It was zesty, creamy and delicious. The order of bruschetta gave us two pieces of bread heaping with tomatoes. If you are with a party of more than two, I'd suggest ordering two orders of bruschetta or you can cut each slice in half. So the meal was off to a great start as we enjoyed the great weather, tasty food and thirsty quenching wine. About 45 minutes into the meal, we had just finished up our appetizers and were waiting for our pizza. The waiter then came out and asked us if we had already ordered a pizza or no? We said yes. So he then turned to the table next to us and asked them if they ordered the pizza. He was confused when they answered yes as well because the kitchen only had two orders in and there were three total pizzas (one for us, two for our neighbors). So he went back in and comes out with our neighbors pizza but alas, not ours. It turns out that they accidentally dropped our pizza ticket on the ground so our order never made it through. This made our dinner longer, but not too much longer and they definitely made up for and got our pizza out quickly. Now let's move on to the pizza, for this is what Pomo Pizzeria is known for is it not? Oh friends, the pizza is exactly what you hope for it. It tastes like it's straight from the streets in Italy. We got the Quattro Stagioni which has tomato, San Marzano DOP, mozzarella, fior di latte, sauteed mushrooms, Italian Sausage, etc. The bread was thin crust but soft and melted in my mouth. The crust was fluffy and soft. The pizza is definitely large enough to split and the combo of salad, bruschetta and pizza worked out perfectly. The reviews are right in saying that this pizza is absolutely excellent and comparable to the other great pizza places in the Valley.3/16/11Came in to see what Pomo had to offer on their happy hour menu-- certain cocktail drinks are half-off (I had the lemon drop, or something akin to that, with lemon vodka and fresh lemon juice).  The two pizzas I've tried here were just OK.  The Quattro Formaggi (mozzarella, provolone, gorgonzola, and parmigiano) was very salty, but good, crispy crust that didn't stay crispy for very long (not even ten minutes!), and the Quattro Stagioni (minus 'shrooms) was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again, as the crust was very soggy due to the tomato sauce.  Such a shame...  Order the bruschetta!  I had it for happy hour-- sadly, HH menu only offers discounts on cocktails, not food.  Boo!  So, I ordered the bruschetta to try while waiting for the pizza... I should've just ordered two of the bruschetta!  Loved the crunch of the bread, and the toppings tasted so fresh!  The panna cotta I had for dessert was good- you wouldn't have to twist my arm to order it again.  :)  (But of course, I'd like to try other desserts on the menu first.  That is, if they aren't off-limits...)  Mom liked the millefoglie w/ chantilly cream and strawberries offered to her as a token of appreciation when we had dinner there on Pomo's first-year anniversary.  I really enjoyed the slice of "anniversary cake" I was given, since I couldn't have the millefoglie special (due to powdered sugar and cornstarch in this pastry).Service was very relaxed and probably modeled after the service you'd find in Italy-- it brought us to recall the same nonchalant attitude we encountered when we visited Rome many years ago... (Most, if not all, of Pomo's servers and bussers are Italians from the "old world," complete w/ accents!).  Mom and I noted that most of the dinner customers here seemed to be Italians, w/ many of them carrying an air of being visitors, or tourists, not locals.  Two visits and the only things I can vouch for are the lemon cocktail, the bruschetta, and the anniversary cake (which wasn't even on the regular menu!).  One more try, perhaps...Three visits and three delicious meals.  Visit #1 - Two weeks prior to restaurant opening.  No silverware, no plates - just pizza straight from the oven.  Mind you, a 950 degree wood burning oven that bakes pizza perfectly in less than two minutes per pie.Visit #2 - One year later.  Three girls. three glasses of wine. one caprese salad, one affettati misti (assorted Italian meat and cheese appetizer), one specialty pizza, and three desserts.  Visit #3 - Two days after visit #2.  This time with my husband.  We shared one caprese salad, one sausage and mushroom pizza, and one capriccossa pizza, and one dark Italian beer.Aside from consistent, authentic food, the atmosphere is casual and welcoming, and so is the owner, Stefano.  He's quite the character and his accent is reason alone to go to 'Pomo.  Make sure to meet him when you go!Not sure why I took a year hiatus between my first two visits, but I'm glad to see that 'Pomo is going strong, and I'll certainly be back again real soon... if you want true Neapolitan pizza, this is the place to go... and make sure to order enough to have leftovers; they are just as good the next day!'Pomo is the real deal. The VPN certification is proudly displayed, and the pies adhere strictly to its requirements. Passing through the dining room, I stopped to take a picture of the gorgeous red-tiled wood-fired oven. The master pizzaiolo in charge that night, Fabio, invited me over to get a closer look, and preached to this choir about the virtues and perfection of Neapolitan pizzas. The DOP margherita was sublime, and the pizza bianco was absolutely wonderful, with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, enhanced by the nuttiness of shaved parmigiano reggiano on top.  Fabio sent over a sample of a wonderful dip of fresh and roasted garlic with a mild heat from red-pepper infused olive oil. This was beyond excellent, a great topping & super way to finish off the pizza crust. Our service was swift and knowledgable, and kids are not only welcome, but easily accommodated. We dined al fresco in February - a rare treat for a Buffalonian. Dessert consisted of a deliciously decadent Nutella cake, and Fabio sent over a lemoncello nightcap that had a creamy consistency not unlike an Orange Julius - a flavor and consistency that I now feel compelled to seek out.Absolutely fantastic. I could close my eyes and I was back in Rome enjoying a Margherita. It surely helped that I could actually hear Italian being spoken when I closed my eyes. In addition to the Margherita we had the Pomo, the Crocchette Pugliesi and the Mista salad. The crocchette was just like I've had at a street fair but I was a little jealous that they were out of the Arancini, which are my favorite treat. Too bad, but I will be back and next time I will save room for dessert.There is a reason why this authentic pizzeria was lauded "Best New Restaurant" back in 2010 when it first opened.At Pomo, you are getting a truly authentic experience, with simple ingredients and a method of pizza making that has been in use for hundreds of years.From start to finish - from the photographs and murals of Italy on the walls, to the strong Italian accent of owner Stefano, to the Italian pop music piping through the speakers, to the open kitchen where you can see the home-made dough being levitated through the air, to the moment that pizza reaches your taste buds - all of your senses are engaged.What makes this pizza restaurant unique is the method in which the pizzas are prepared and fired.  Being fired at 950 degrees and cooked in a manner of minutes locks in the flavors and aromas of the ingredients.  The crust is soft, this being the nature of a true Napoletana Pizza. I feasted on the special that day, a white tartufo (truffle) pizza with fresh Parmesan and arugula.  The thin and gooey center, with the blistered soft crust made it an easy pizza to eat - the flavors from the simple ingredients were extraordinary.Upon reading further about the art of Napoletana pizzas, I discovered that there is an entire organization, the APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napole- tani) that certifies restaurants for this type of pizza making.   According to their guidelines, the simple ingredients of flour, cheese, tomatoes and olive oil must come from Italy, and the pizza must be fired at precisely the right temperature.  Pomo is proud to announce that they are the only restaurant in town that has been certified.The average cost of a pizza is $15, and it is worth every dollar.   The menu boasts 16 different pizzas, ranging from the most basic Reghina Margherita (tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, and olive oil to the Capricciosa (mozzarella, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and prosciutto).  Finish your meal with a sweet bite from the dessert menu to complete the experience.  I highly recommend the "Torta Nutella", a flourless chocolate hazelnut cake filled with Nutella.Overall, a truly wonderful and unique journey to Napoli.  Molto molto bene!My previous review says it all when it comes to the meal and atmosphere, but it lacked an opinion on the dessert. Well, now I can add my opinion. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of tiramisu! It's moist, flavorful and amazing. They also serve Nutella deserts, cream puffs and more. I've decided that dessert is a must here.

I just got into town, it's time for lunch and my friend suggests we go to JB's.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#2EgVWhCOv-7DeELNh0ZvWA   SERVICE: We walked in, are greeted with a smile and were seated quickly.  The servers are all very friendly and when I asked to get a small sample of one of the soups to taste it, they happily said "of course!"FOOD: I look over the menu and everything looks really good, but I decided on the Cuban Melt.   It's roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle chips on grilled marbled rye bread ($8.29). It comes with french fries and a dill pickle spear, but I opted for onion rings. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#t_Pp5iY7t8SiamWBuNvBEgA close up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#x7NE7o3JicBDwCbVeb3o8QThe roasted pork was tender and had a great flavor and everything else worked in unison to create delicious sandwich!  I opted for onion rings instead of fries.  They tasted pretty good but we're kinda greasy and when I bit into them the breading fell right off.My friend had a bowl of clam chowder and said it was O-K.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#Ecs--5eNPD9QSXdLyo6Q4QOne other note, while I didn't opt for the salad bar, I was impressed by the variety of items available!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#0B-AG7KYniJehO-k0CdMcwOVERALL: A really delicious lunch at a nice place with very friendly service.

Martinis, martinis, martinis.Sure, they take awhile to get to the table, but that's because they are masterfully crafted behind the bar. Without the three m's (muddling, measuring and mixing), the lip licking liquid bevis that made their way from the bottle to our mouths wouldn't have had us all playing musical martinis. So many fresh flavors and chilled deliciousness.Love the pictures on the wall..very poetic and romantic.The food was wonderful, but the martinis were the highlight of the evening. Slurp!Attended SpaFitFinder.com's launch/AZ's Finest Honoree benefitting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation tonight.  The event itself seemed successful (the bar was packed, the service was s-l-o-w, but understandable); however, no one from SpaFitFinder came around to introduce himself/herself and to elaborate on the site's services.  Indeed, the server who handled V's and my drinks all night (a $10 per person netted donatee drink coupons for a mojito- d'lish!- and a beer/wine, and a sweet goody bag*) wore a SpaFitFinder shirt, but did not offer up any info on its services, neither.  While I wouldn't ever go back to the bar (TOO NOISY- I NEVER like to SHOUT at the person sitting next to me to be heard), or order the $11 turkey club again [this was a basic deli sandwich made w/ turkey, cranberry chutney mayo, smoked bacon (mmm... bacon!), avocado slices, and alfalfa sprouts on toasted Hawaiian bread, but it's nothing to write home about); had V and I gone to FEZ w/ the $11, we would've been in heaven munching on a delicious burger and some perfect sweet potato fries!), but I may give Urban 7 Martini Kitchen a second chance to redeem itself on the food a foodie coworker of mine RAVED about.  I can say the martinis I had were good.  Loved the mojito and the Inhibition -something (vodka, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice, minus the cranberry juice, and instead, club soda and sour).  Didn't care for the house pinot grigio.  I will say that the jalapeno and olive tapenade bruschetta and the grilled marinated skirt steak skewer were tasty... (FYI, the noise level was a lot lower at the resto, but the band, while they played pleasing music, did get loud at the end.  Also, the service was quicker.  Appreciated the fact that our server was honest in telling me that he hadn't tried the dessert I'd asked him about.  Other less-conscientious servers would've gushed about how it was their fave item off the menu to make the sale.  Kudos to Anthony!)*Among the goody bag offerings were an 8 oz. Philosophy foaming bath and shower cream (easily $8 retail), trial-size facial products, a wine stopper/pourer, a 20% off food/drink at Urban 7, and a $20 off coupon for Yelper John H.'s massage services!  Nice :)

Review Text :
LVRW2012: Day one of Fall Las Vegas Restaurant Week (LVRW) and I've already hit gold. I don't have to eat around the other menus to figure that Bacio's prix fixed menu is the best value dinner of the whole shabang. Not only are there a myriad of excellent options to customize your three-course meal, the selection of dishes available to you is outstanding. At $30.12, Chef Carla's menu measures about $20 less than the average LVRW dinner. And she offers more than just a salmon and a steak. I kicked off my meal with the Fritto Misto di Mare ($14.50). Atop a bed of zucchini, majority of the bowl of deep fried sea life was calamari joined by a couple healthy chunks of tilapia and a single shrimp. Although outnumbered, this prawn was meaty, sweet and easily the stand-out piece in this starter. Between the rémoulade and the tomato sauce, the latter seemed to better compliment the taste and texture of the dish. The balance of flavors was a little off in the rémoulade. Either my palate was falling flat this evening or the herb and caper flavors were overpowered by the mayo-base. This isn't a dish to take your time with; the fried zucchini wilts quickly.Anyone whose met me knows I'm one of those "banana-asians." You know. Yellow on the outside, white on the inside? I may not act F.O.B. but I certainly eat like one. On a rare occasion, I'll crave Italian. And on an even more rare occasion, I'll actually enjoy it. Linguini alle Vongole Veraci ($21.00), or linguini with clams in a white wine sauce, is one of those simple dishes that quite often comes out wrong. There aren't many ingredients, so it's all about finding just the right measurement of each item to really make it sing. The al dente linguini was heavy on the garlic with the olive oil, wine, and brine all in perfect harmony. It all came together with just a touch of cracked pepper and a light sprinkle of parmesan. There's a dessert option for every palate. But I couldn't leave The Trop without a bite of Chef Carla's famous Tiramisu ($8.50). At this point, the first two courses had filled most of my stomach so I could really only manage a bite before packing the equally massive dessert course to-go. The creamy, sweet sabayon was the perfect finish to such a rich and excellent meal. Combine that with the coffee-soaked lady fingers and a dusting of cocoa powder, you have another thousand calories of decadence in front of you.I've eaten many LVRW meals since its inception in 2007. And after a couple fail whales last season, I was happy to find that Bacio by Carla Pellegrino did not disappoint.I'm not a fan of Italian, but a friend took me here, and who am I to turn down a free dinner? It was solidly OK. I felt like having some kinda baked cheesy comfort-foody goodness, but shockingly there is nothing like that on the menu. Not even lasagna! So I settled for the shrimp risotto, which was pretty good. We shared fried risotto balls for an appetizer, and they were pretty good too. The bread basket was uninspired -- just regular lightly toasted sourdough slices with oil & vinegar. My friend had the pounded veal cutlets, which he found a tad dry, but they brought him some marinara on the side and then he liked it ok. The custom cocktail list is fun, and the drinks are really good. I had the ginger mojito, which was fanTAStic -- served with a sugarcane garnish -- and my friend had some fruity vodka thing. Both our drinks were chock-a-block with fruity minty greeny goodness -- they do not skimp on garnishes here!For dessert, we shared the profiteroles, which were also good. The main problem as far as I can see is the atmosphere. It's BORING. The place is located on a walkway in the back of the casino, very claustrophobic and dim, with not much of a view -- just hotel patrons walking back to their rooms. Although I did see a bride, in full wedding attire, carrying a bag of Hooters-to-Go...so I guess the people-watching is OK. Overall, if you're staying at the Trop then yeah, try this place. Otherwise, it doesn't stand out. I probably won't be back.If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

Review Text :
Now that I've done "take-out" a few times and eaten-in once, I can officially say that I'm a huge fan of this place.In my handful of experiences with Lao Thai, I've had the following dishes:-fresh rolls -house salad with peanut dressing-stir-fry eggplant-ultimate asparagus-garden delight-pad cee-ew-drunken noodles-pad woon-senI've enjoyed them all, but the eggplant may be my favorite.  It's actually better than the eggplant at Tottie's and I'm a huge Tottie's fan!  The portions are really big, and I've found everything to have a ton of flavor.  I especially like that when you get take out, you get side containers of hot sauce to spice everything up as much as your little heart desires.Ann, the owner, is extremely sweet - I spoke to her for awhile during my last visit when I did take-out.  She told me they've got a website coming soon, and I noticed that on the menu she gave me, it says "we deliver" on it... I'll have to try that sometime.  Another bonus? They are open on Sundays!I think I may have been Thai in a past life... I love Thai food and could eat it every day if given the chance.  While the restaurant itself lacks character, it's clean, and I found the service to be attentive.  If you cannot tell from this review, I'm super excited to have another quality Thai restaurant close to home.Not bad.  We moved to AZ from Bangkok and my wife is Thai and a superb cook to boot, so we're kind of a tough crowd as far as Thai food goes.  Most of the Thai food we've had in Arizona has been absolutely dreadful.  This wasn't that bad, but it's not all that special either.  When we saw the Yelp! reviews of this new restaurant we were anxious to check it out.  Lao food is also the food of Issan, as northeastern Thailand is called (where the people are mostly ethnically Lao or Khmer). Anyway, Lao/Issan food is kind of like the soul food of Thailand - down home, earthy, super spicy and very delicious.  Also very hard to find anywhere in the States outside of L.A. or Vegas.  We scanned the menu for a long time searching for the Lao/Issan component but that did not appear to exist.  We asked the waitress - who couldn't speak Thai by the way - where the Lao food was and she said it was "all mixed in."  Uhmmm... okie dokie.  Basically, it's all 100% Thai food.  (As was every single other thing in the restaurant). Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we were kind of geared up for some nice spicy Lao food.  That wasn't going to happen.The menu is a pretty standard Thai-American menu. Sadly, there wasn't even one of the classic Lao/Issan dishes.  Just the usual stuff.We opted for the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and Yam Woon Sen, both traditional Thai dishes.   Both were okay, by American standards, not particularly spicy, even though we had ordered them that way.  Neither dish had fresh chilis.  The Yam Woon Sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodles but it was alright.  The Drunken noodles were okay.  Again, not nearly as spicy as they should be.  That little four-jar condiment tray isn't some Lao-Thai innovation, that's a "kreung prung," a standard Thai noodle shop item that's found on every table in Thailand.  It's supposed to supplement the fresh chilis in a dish, not supplant them.  The dishes need to have fresh chilis cooked in them as well, not just crushed dried chilis added on top.The real problem is that honest-to-goodness Thai food just isn't acceptable to Americans - too salty, too sour, too fishy, too spicy - so it can only survive in communities like LA or Vegas where there is enough of a Thai population to support it with exclusively Thai patrons.Anyway, big portions, although a tad expensive with virtually everything on the menu over $10.  If you're hungry and in the neighborhood it's okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip.If you really want to have traditional Thai food, your best bet is to get invited to one of the Thai temples on a festival day, when all the older Thai women bring home-cooked food.

Review Text :
Bummer. That's all I can say - I wish I could like this place, but it's too ostentatious. Basically, this is a Mexican restaurant going through a identity crisis. You walk in and it's really clean, but there's no smell - I mean, where's the spice, the flavor, the umph? There was none. Moving on...the people behind the counter - very friendly, no problems there. I get my food and hortacha, and this burrito is the size of a burrito from Taco Bell...except at TB I pay $.99 and here I paid $2.50 - the beans were runny and I was a bit disappointed in the taste/texture of the tortilla. The hortacha was tasty but the same as a Fili-b's, and a few cents more.Here's the thing...we have Baja Fresh for the over priced, Rubios for the beachy/hip feel. We have all the -bertos and Taco Bells for the authentic and cheap...and all of these provide overall better tasting food - why would I go back to Tia?What I really need from Tia, is some proof that they really care that I come back. I need them to show me they are ready to compete...because right now they're not cuttin' it and I know I've experienced better.

Review Text :
With my newly purchased Groupon in hand we decided to check out Match last Friday night. It's located at the corner of Maryland Pkwy and Silverado Ranch in a strip mall. From the outside it didn't look too inviting with their "Open" sign not lit up and no patio furniture. But the inside is a different story. It looks like they spent a pretty penny on the interior design of the place (or maybe the previous tenants did?). Either way, it's got a cool, modern feel. And the top of the bar is eyecatching because it's made to look like a ship's hull.The owner, Gregory, was incredibly nice. Apparently, he's worked on the strip for over a decade operating restaurants like Morels at the Palazzo. Their concept of "cosmopolitan tapas" seemed a little weird to me at first -- not knowing how it would taste to pair flavors from different continents together. I'm also skeptical of restaurants that have large menus, thinking that with so many dishes it's more difficult for chefs to master all of them. But, based on the  seven dishes we had I was impressed. All but one of the dishes ranged from good to great.- Spicy sour fish ($5.00) - Red snapper, ponzu, jalapeño. Not as spicy as I expected.- Seared tuna ($6.00) - lightly seared with a garlic sauce. So fresh, so good.- Olepe: mussels ($4.00) - my least favorite dish. The flavors were decent but the mussels were too tough- Dragon balls ($3.50) - my favorite dish of the night. A ball of spicey tuna, chopped onions, and peppers deep fried.- Garlic sausage ($3.00) - slices of a mild sausage topped with chips of garlic. A very simple dish but it tasted great.- Croquetas ($3.00) - 2 huge croquetas. They're about 3 times the size of the croquetas at Firefly. Absolutely delicious.- Frozen orange ($5.50) - orange sorbet presented inside a hollowed out orange fruit. It's pre-made and frozen. Although the sorbet was so frozen that I had to chip away at it, the flavor was nice and refreshing.Their prices are amazing! Most tapas range from 3-6 bucks, cheese plates are $12.00, entrees from $9-17, Korean BBQ is $18, paella $25 pp. Beer prices are around $4-7. Their wine list is filled with some gems that are all reasonably priced. Service was excellent, as well. Our server gave us some great recommendations and did a great job checking in on us throughout our meal. The waitresses all wear schoolgirl outfits that they alter to fit their personalities -- some are punk/rocker schoolgirls, others look like your typical sexy schoolgirl. I don't really get how the outfits fit in with the global tapas concept, but I'm not complaining.Their concept contains so many different dishes but the interesting thing about it is that you can try the same main ingredient in different cuisines. Want a meal with different styles of pork? They have a Chinese style dish and a Korean one. But it would be cool if they had more dishes with the same protein so you could create a whole meal around that one ingredient -- a southern style pork dish, Latin-American pork dish, European pork dish. You get the picture.Overall, Match is an amazing value. The subtotal with four drinks and tax was $54.59. Minus the Groupon it was $19.59. So, with tip it was just over $31. C'mon, that's unbelievable considering the quality of the food. I really hope these guys succeed. There needs to be more of these type of restaurants in suburban Las Vegas instead of more chain places. Despite it being a bit of a drive from my place I intend to be back often.

Review Text :
I had to update this review because my feelings have changed, I had originally given this place 5 stars because I love the sandwiches and te everything bagels here, but today I came in and prior to ordering I went to wash my hands in their restroom and there was not a drop of soap. My first thought was, obviously the employees aren't washing their hands after using the restrooms and returning back to work. Ugh my stomach turned. So I told the girl behind the counter there wasn't any soap in te bathroom, she shrugged her shoulders and then told another employee, in Spanish, "no soap in the bathrooms" neither of them seemed bothered. I left, and will never return. Good thing I have my hepatitis A vaccine. Like another yelper said, it's hard to find good bagels on the West coast but you have to make do with what you have and this and Brooklyn bagels are my favorite in town. My favorite bagel is an everything bagel and my pet peeve is when bagel places don't put the "everything" on both sides of the bagel and they do here! My favorite sandwich here is the uptown turkey, fresh sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, alfalfa sprout and scallion cream cheese spread, if you're watching carbs it tastes great on wheat bread but if not, of course an everything bagel then. Service here is, well not the greatest. I seem I get the same scowl faced girl who hates her job, but I'm not there to make friends.My only complaint, I wish they would open one in southern highlands! We need a bagel shop!!!Eleven miles southwest of New York-New York there is a New York style bagel shop named Empire Bagels at the southwest corner of Fort Apache and Patrick. I was unaware of Empire Bagels up to the time that my Yelp friend Lea checked-in here. I was under the impression that I tried all of Vegas's independent bagel shops. Lea's check-in developed into a mental bookmark that I was going to erase the next time I was in the southwest part of the Valley.   Yesterday morning, I erased this mental bookmark at the time that I stopped here on the way to a Summerlin park adventure. The first thing that I noticed from the parking lot is that it is next to Starbuck's. What a clever concept having a bagel shop next to Starbuck's. Customers can pick up a bagel sandwich to bring into Starbuck's and others could bring in a Starbuck's coffee or Frapucino to compliment a bagel.   When I walked in, the woman working behind the counter greeted me. She let me take my time ordering off the menu displayed on the wall. I ordered a Nova lox with cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, and numerous toppings for $8.99. At 11 a.m., they were out of a handful of bagels. I was satisfied with a sesame bagel. The sandwich was good (3 stars) at the same time it fell short of the New York bagels (5 stars) that I vividly remember. The sandwich included a can of a Coke Beverage and bag of chips, which reminds me more of a Jason's Deli that authentic New York Bagel shop. New York bagel shops generally follow the practice of including either potato salad or macaroni salad plus a pickle with the sandwich. In my taste, fresh potato salad or macaroni salad tastes better than a bag of chips. In Las Vegas, the Bagel Cafe follows this practice.    Noticeably missing in Empire Bagels was the scent of fresh baked bagels. The smell of fresh baked bagels is one of the most delicious smells. It is evidence that the bagels are being made fresh and on the premises. In New York, bagel shops are also called bagel bakeries. To be fair, the scent of fresh baked bagels is missing in all of the bagel shops that I have visited then consequently reviewed in Las Vegas. The upshot was that this bagel was missing the softness and warmness of many bagels I have enjoyed up in the Empire State. If a five star New York Bagel shop was at this location, I assume it would be so popular that the Clark County Highway Department would expedite installing a traffic light at Fort Apache and Patrick.    I am happy that there is a New York style bagel shop eleven miles southwest of New York-New York. In my heart, I know there are better bagel shops 3,000 miles northeast of New York - New York. In conclusion, I  rate Empire Bagels at a 3 stars equals good.

Review Text :
i wish this thing had an option to vote 0 stars because this place was a piece of shit.  The chef looks like a ghetto wrestler who should be fighting on UFC and his dishes are so unrefined, he probably NEVER went to culinary school, or else he used to be a sous chef at olive garden.  On the menu, he writes,..."This is how i cook, dont break my balls" he has got to be the most ignorant uneducated fool who got a chance to cook.  The service was mediocre, food is WAYYY overpriced. NEVER GO HERE.  The food? IT WAS TERRIBLE.  I like my pasta "al dente" but he didnt even cook his pasta.  The sauce was OK, a little salty, but i couldnt get over the pasta.  It was like biting into a straw.  This chef needs to learn how to cook pasta.  Thats foundation stuff.  He SUCKS!!!!  FOOD SUCKS, the restaurant vibe SUCKS, and i give it a big FAT ZERO.  He needs to go back to wherever the hell he came from, and maybe try cooking again after taking some high school level foods classes.ugh::UPDATE::this is what the chef of this place has to say after reading a bad review of his place.  Instead of apologizing and inviting me back to redeem himself, he writes..."From   user photoSteven M.Sent  3 days ago   You obviously have no idea what flavor is.. I'm sure you are accustomed to Olive Garden type food since you seem to be a pro .. However, Cafe Martorano uses only the best quality products... Come in and show your face we will definitely give you a tour and show you products I'm sure you have never seen and with your non existing culinary background I'm sure you cant pronounce "Based on the reviews, it seems you either love or hate this place.  That's what originally drew me to it, i had just checked into my hotel some firends and family to celebrate my 21st, and in amongst some downtime and getting unpacked, i immediately started thinking about where to go prior to the nights out that were soon due to come.  So i opened "THE BOOK" in The Hotel and while flipping through the pages i noticed an add for an Italian Cafe that had the picture of a big guy (Vin Diesel Looking) and a 2 paragraph dissertation on how his cafe became.  The long and the short of the ad, is that he loved to cook since he was young, so he calls himself a cook not a chef, and does things his way.  Basically the story said; A customer came in once and was insisiting that he turned down the music, and he politely said "Sir, this is the image that my restaurant upholds and what we are, so i'm sorry i cannot do that." The customer became extremely mad and began to demand and yell at the owner, and the owner told the man to get up and GTFO!  As soon as i was done reading that, i was sold, "This was a place i must check out", mainly becasue it's rare that people and restaurants now a days still have a backbone, and don't let people walk all over them.The theme of the restaurant is his way or the highway, where from 5-7pm music like sinatra is played, then from 7-8pm it's 80's music, and then from 9-close is club style hip hop since the restaurant turns into a 1/2 club at night.  And throughout any of this, the music will pause, the lights will dim and all of the many plasmas on the walls will show one of his favorite scenes from one of his favorite moives (casino,the godfather, knockaround guys.....) and then quickly before anything gets too gory the music resumes and the lights come back up. The food, is the best hands down italian food i have ever had and 1/2 of my family is from a little family owned city in northern italy called consa.We ordered the chef's choice which is an (5 course) assortment of food both on and off the menu, and whatever the owner/cook feels like making.  It was a bit pricey ($125 pp for chefs choice) but i know there are other things for sub $30 and $40 on the menu, plus it's vegas, what isn't pricey if it's not good, i mean really good.  You get what you pay for and you're not in vegas all the time, so indulge a bit.  We also had a personal wine concierge that helped us select wine throughout the meal, and our waiter who's name was meatball was extremely helpful in preparing us for what we were about to experience (the most food in one meal i have ever seen).  One of my personal favorites was the crab and lobster stuffed shellfish (that was not on the menu).  Holy mother that was good!  They also have a more than capable bar, and you can take a photo with "the cook"All in all, it was hands down my favorite place to eat in vegas, and i will definately be returning when i go back there.  If you want some killer italian food, and a memorable atmosphere, you must make a stop here.ughhhhhh.....Let's negate the price here because the meal was free and I'll still say, quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had. My chicken parmigiana tasted like something I microwaved from a Michelinas frozen dinner. On top of that, the waiter was a condescending eegit with a superiority complex. Listen to me and listen to me now, DON'T COME HERE! There are so many good Italian places in Las Vegas, that there is no need to stop at this self-righteous restaurant in The Rio. Do yourself a favor and go to Valentino in the Venetian or Rao's in Caesar's Palace. Cheers!LOL, this place is a joke, although It's worth a visit just to see how off the wall it is and to bring home a good story of the awkwardness. I'm a foodie and know for a fact I could cook proteins better than the head "cook". I know for a fact there are better tasting pastas from Sysco. I also know when I can taste a marinara that has a base of canned tomatoes yet it's called "homemade".. I know for a fact that Lipton style instant Iced Tea out of a plastic bottle doesn't cut it as a drink in a restaurant of this price range. I've traveled Italy, ate at some of the best Italy has to offer and I have a moderate respect for the cuisine, but even if I do over look the under cooked pasta and a horribly dried out meatball and bring it all down to flavor, this place still just doesn't cut it and dont even get me started on the service.. We tried this place on a whim before the Penn and Teller show as it looked to be the closest thing to fine dinning at the Rio, but we should have known better when there are TVs playing the God Father all over the place.. The Rio really needs to up their dinning game. If you're a foodie, my suggestion is go for a overpriced poorly mixed drink at the bar to experience the train wreck that is Martorano's and take home a story of a "restaurant" you will never forget..Oh yeah, what the hell was that thing that Martorano's calls bread? Wow, who ever came up with that one needs to be taught the basics of baking bread again..Family StyleThis was our convention group dinner. They closed the restaurant to accommodate over 200 of us. The restaurant is on the second floor of the masquerade tower at the Rio Hotel. It over looks the swimming pool. It has a nice long bar They had 3 TV in the main dining area, two of which was playing Godfather II, Sweet. Music playing and disco lights on. A really nice place to have dinner. Here's the rundown:The Best Meatball & Salad "Signature Martorano Meatball" I have to say, the meatballs are really good. It  was serve with ricotta which made it taste better. The salad it came with was just okay. Fried Calamari w/ Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce   This dish was my favorite of the night. Nice size calamari. Perfectly fried. That sweet & spicy chili sauce was dynamite. So good. Thinly sliced Serrano chili rounded this dish nicelyFried Mozzarella Stack "Tomatoes, Prosciutto di Parma, Aged Balsamic Vinegar & Extra Virgin Olive Oil" This was another winner. A thick piece fried nicely and tasted great with the prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Yum!!Rigatoni Pollo "Diced Chicken Cutlet, Hot & Sweet Peopers, San Marzano Tomatoes & Reggiano Parmesan Cheese" the rigorous was a bit too Al dente for me. The taste was good, just not pasta part for me. Chilean Seabass Scampi Style w/ White Wine, Garlic Butter, Peas & Cherry Tomatoes. The Seabass was just so buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. The white wine sauce complimented this dish Chicken Downtown "Chicken Cutlet, Ricotta Cheese, Spinach, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella" a nice well rounded dish. Crunch from the chicken cutlet and a very flavorful sauce.Red Velvet Cake. The cake was very moist with a cream cheese frosting. A nice way to finish our meal. The service was excellent. Sparkling mineral water was refilled constantly. Plates cleared efficiently. Dishes explained as they are served. What an Italian feast!!Family Style!!

If I could give a big fat ZERO I would. This place is a joke. The bitch that is a co-owner likes to sit at the bar and demand all the attention from who ever is bar tending. I have named her blond possum faced bitch, seeing as how she looks like one. She likes to give dirty looks to groups of younger women who come in. One night a group of us went in and the bar tender "RADD" I am assuming its initials for ridiculous, ass, dingle,douche. He acted like it was a chore for him to refill our drinks and at one point was sitting with blond possum face bitch drinking shots w/ her. When we left my man didn't tip him and wrote on the receipt "be nicer" . Blond possum face bitch followed us out into the parking lot and asked us if we wrote this on her bar tenders receipt. We said yes b/c it is gratitude & that we don't have to TIP and your bar tender Radd was very rude.She then told us that we were 86th from the bar and I then had a bit of an argument w/ her about how Torrey Pines Pub was way better bar anyway. My sister came out into parking lot at this point to try and defuse the situation and mega bitch got into her face and 86th her as well. So my sister said fine I'm going to get my stuff so, blond possum face bitch continued yelling at her and in her face as she is trying to walk in and get her purse. Blond possum face bitch then grabbed my sister by her throat and tried to choke her. However mega bitch isn't too strong being as she only hydrates her body with copious amount of vodka and whatever dick is working behind the bar. My sister was able to knock the blond possum face bitch out with one swift hit and went in to get her purse. We are proudly 86th from the establishment. If anyone wants to go to a real bar were the bartenders know your name and have your drink poured for you before you sit down go to TORREY PINES PUB its located on the corner of Lakemead & Torrey Pines.6374 W. lakemead 89108

Who goes to a restaurant with "Burger" in the name and orders a chicken sandwich?  Me, that's who.  But I had a couple bites of 2 burgers while I was there as well as trying 2 of their fries.The chicken sandwich was quite good.  The fries were also good but not as plentiful as I was led to believe from the cashier.The burgers I tried were also pretty good.  I would go back but the bottom line for me?  Pricey for a pretty good burger.  I can get as good or better for less at other spots around town such as Lobby's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobbys-beef-burgers-dogs-tempeSure Smashburger is a "chain burger place" but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant...  They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries.We tried their Arizona Smashburger with fried pickles. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning and temperature!  It came with fresh guac, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, other veggies with Habanero cheese served on a chiptole bun.  It was fantastic! The fried pickles were also a nice change to fries. Crispy with lite batter and some ranch dressing for dipping.  You've got to try these!We also had the Classic Smashburger with their Smashfries. Again the burger was cooked exceptionally well with just the right balance of seasoning and temp.  Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic and rosemary. The seasoning was spot on! We've ate fries that are very similar at Diablo Burger in Flag, but the fries at Smashburger are better balanced with rosemary/garlic and salt.Recommendation: order a create your own 1/3 lb Smashburger with which ever bun, but ask for them to toast it ~ they will! Then add an extra 1/3 lb patty and request them to cook it the temp you want it ~ they will. Choose the cheese of your choice with either smashsauce or chipotle mayo and then get all the veggies including jalapenos. Your total will be $6.99 for a 2/3 lb burger of deliciousness that will leave you planning your next trip to Smashburger!  Don't forget to try their fried pickles and down everything with a cold bottle of beer.12/22/10Yelp offered Yelp members a chance to eat here for free, and hooray, I was one of the lucky few!  (Was a bit confused at first as this "event" was not organized like other meet-and-eat Yelp events; I was just supposed to mention to the cashiers that I was on the Yelp list- no big deal.)  Had the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger and "sweet potato smashfries."  Had to wait a bit on the fries, as the deal only included their regular "smashfries" (rosemary, garlic, and olive oil).  [FYI, other side fries' options were Haystack Onions and Veggie frites (flash-fried asparagus, carrots, and green beans- all sound great to me, except I'm allergic to carrots.  And maybe green beans.  LOL.)]  After finally trying the soggy sweet potato fries, I'd wished I'd stuck w/ the regular smashfries, which were actually tasty and nicely-crisped!)  The burger is definitely "smashed," and it was definitely greasy, but, oh was it delicious!  Really loved the added crispy onions strings, too.  I had them put the BBQ sauce on the side (didn't know what ingredients were used to make it), so I can't review that.  Honestly, though, w/ the cheese, shoestring onions, crispy thick-cut bacon, and, of course, the grease, there's no need for the BBQ!  The meal also included a free fountain drink and a sample of two choices of mixed-in ice creams (something akin to TCBY shivers, DQ's blizzards, and Ted Drewes' concretes).  I chose the butterfinger (yes, I know these cornflaked candies are off-limits to me, and perhaps the Haagen-Daaz ice creams, too-- some varieties have corn syrup and cornstarch in them), but I like Butterfinger, and so I dove in!  The 4 oz. sample was very, very good!  Great, even!  Too bad I couldn't eat the whole thing (the less allergens consumed, the better!), but I sooooooo wanted to, though!Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly, too!  And the women's restroom was clean and fresh, and the dining area, while a little crowded, was also clean.  There's not a lot of fast-food places I'll go eat at willingly, but I definitely would not turn up my nose at Smashburger!Breaking News: The Hulk decided to open his very own burger joint and called it Smashburger.  Whaaaa? you asked.  That's right.  The Hulk's signature move is now being incorporated into how his burgers are made.Splat.  Splat.  Okay, okay.  I was joking of course.  For all we know, he really did come up with this.  ;-pThe funny thing though is, I never really order the beef burgers here.  I LOVE, LOVE their crispy chicken burgers with swiss mushrooms! Sooo effing goood! The patty is so crispy while the breast meat is tender and juicy! TRUST ME.  YOU NEED TO TRY.The buns hun! fantastic! I think within the last year or so, they've revamped their decor and added an "Ice Tea Bar."  Its kind of cool, cuz the Tea Dispenser is in a tubular, modern shape and colorful too making it "pop."  I usually get their mango passion or something like that.  Its awesome!I'm hungry just typing this out.Greasy is an understatement.  I know they smash their angus beef on the "griddle" to seal in the flavor, but I've had much better!  Had the Sin City burger with haystack onions, fried egg, and applewood bacon.  Nice concept, presentation, and yes....very filling!  But the freshness and seasoning of the large patty was blindsided by the greasiness.SmashFries were better!It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

Review Text :
So the address on here shows 83rd and Glendale, but the actual location in on 83rd and Indian School.  They also do a mobile stand, so maybe the address on here is the owner's home address, because it looks like a residential address.This place is great.  My boss is from Tucson and kept telling me I have to try Sonoran dogs.  I work in the southwest valley and many people at my accounts tell me about their family members that sell delicious Sonoran dogs from their mobile carts at night.  Well I work during the day, so those wouldn't work for me until one of my accounts told me one of the about the best Sonoran dog cart that also has a store on 83rd and Indian School.  I paid them a visit and discovered the most delicious hot dog ever.  A Sonoran dog is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, fried and placed in a bollilo roll and then covered in goodness.  There's ketchup, mustard, beans, tomatoes, onions, and probably more delicious goodness I can't remember.  It sounds overwhelming, but they are sooooo tasty.  $3 for one or they were having a special $5 for two.  I just got one and a bottle of coke and I was full.  They restaurant is small and not fancy.  You order at the counter and there are a few tables inside and a few tables outside to eat at.  The woman who took my order was friendly and bilingual.  They take cash and cards.  If you are looking for authentic Sonoran dogs, this would be the place."Hot dogs and Red Vines and potato chips and french fries are my favorite foods." ― Betty WhiteIf hot dogs are good enough for Betty, they're good enough for me.  She's the classiest!  Review is for the Sonoran dog, the only thing I ate.I'm a sucker for a good Sonoran.  What's not to love?  At La Pasadita's, they do things a little different.  The Sonoran features house-made bread, bacon [of course bacon!], beans, grilled onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, mustard, and guacamole.  I can't say I've ever had a Sonoran with ketchup and I don't think their dog really needs it but it was still all very tasty.  It's a bit on the small side and I think I should have ordered two to be happy.Not the best Sonoran in the valley but definitely delicious!  I would like to try their other dogs like the Chihuahua or the Sinaloa.  All the more reason to be back.  I wish I saw the pictures beforehand too.  Seems like there's a dog topped with Ruffles and cheese.  It's a small cozy place and the staff is friendly even to the awkward looking Asian girls.  ;)  There's a fee to use the credit card machine so cash is definitely preferred and recommended.  Parking can be sketch.  Look for Pizza Patron or you'll miss this place.  Enjoy!Once you've had a Sonoran Dog from El Guero Canelo in Tucson, you'll do anything to recreate the experience.  I've been looking for a good Sonoran Dog since I moved back to Phoenix 10 years ago and I came to La Pasadita in my quest.  Their Sonoran Dog was just okay, the wiener was small and overcooked.  The star of the show is definitely the creamy corn cocktail.  The service is outstanding, they make you feel their gratitude for your business.This is salty junk food heaven. I'm still not a big fan of hot dogs in general, but anyone should try dogs like the Sonoran, with the guacamole and crushed potato chips (queso flavored!) There are also small orders of fries, ranging from carne asada to one that I swear was smothered in like 3 different kinds of peppered mayonnaise (jalapeno, chipotle, etc.) This is overkill. This is too much, even for me. It's only like $3-4 per item.  You might as well go, if you've got the calories to spare.

Restaurant name  Chronic Tacos
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, "I want that."  Very stoner.I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.I'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu.

Review Text :
I needed a quick dinner with some leftovers.  I had been to this Sammy's for a Yelp event several years ago and decided to give it a go.  I phoned my order for an Italian sausage and a NY Style pizza.  The person on the phone told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I immediately left and got there just as they were about to be removed from the oven.During the payment time, Beto, the man at the counter, asked how In was going to enjoy the pizza at home--with a beer?  When I said no, I would be having iced tea, he went to the counter and got me a take out container of their passion fruit iced tea to try compliments of Sammy's.  Nice touch.The pizzas were good.  There's nothing special about them as far as gourmet topping but I wasn't looking for that.  This is OK standard, chain pizza, and it was a nice change from what I normally get.  And the leftovers make wonderful breakfast when you eat the slices cold out of the refrigerator with plenty of red pepper sprinkled on top!

Considering that I'm a power yelper and this was a yelp event, you'd think they'd cut me a bit of slack for being 3 minutes late and serve some kind of food to me.  Not even an offer for a drink, a glass of water, a spare cracker! I guess I can't kill this place with a one star rating because it is partly my fault for being late, and I haven't even tried their food. But good service is a crucial key to any successful establishment and this place dropped the ball.What really shocked me was that I shook the hand of the manager/part-owner there and she still turned me away. "Sorry, the event ends at 8. You can come by when we open this Friday." She said with a smirk.Oh well, at least I had good company. So what did my fellow Yelpers think of the Mac? "Meh" was the general consensus. Actually you won't see me here this Friday.Actually I think it's not a bad place :) Free lunch + great service ( My, their lunch time service is much better than dinner time )... and of course great food ( I upload couple pix, check it out... )But I don't like their tomato soup that much and their backgroup music.. and their price are not cheap even at lunch!Do i love this place! Such a great concept. a quick order restaurant with everything pasta has to offer. I always get the build your own with angel hair, vodka sauce, spinach, basil, sun dried tomatoes, shrimp/or chicken. It is absolutely delish! My brother got the Mac & Cheese with cut up hot dogs and ruffles potato chips in it. Sounds odd but its surprisingly amazing. They have an awesome selection of different pastas such as bow tie, rigatoni, and fettuccine. Also an array of toppings. Oh yea and you cant forget their side salad, it has a great house dressing.Mac Shack also has the cutest decor and an amazing staff. Very friendly. Only bad experience Ive ever had is with a heavy accented manager. He was very rude and unaccommodating when the wrong order showed up via delivery. And if you decide to pop  in they have a row of Tootsie pops as you leave. very nice touch!Oh. My. Macgasm. (that's a mac and cheese orgasm)This place is something different. I'm a huge fan of mac and cheese, I guess I never really grew up, but this place just makes it fun and unlike anything I've had before. Myself and a guest decided to check this place out since it's down the street from my place. Located on Warm Springs and Durango, this little shack has a lot around it. We walked in and were promptly greeted by the cashier. We were in the mood for fettuccine and wanted to try something popular. We considered getting a BYOB (build yo own bowl). This however included too many options for me. I mean bowties, penne, fettuccine, or elbows?!?! How could we decided!! Lucky we had an amazing cashier who let us try some the sauces just to give us a better idea of what we were getting. One of the sauces I tried was the pesto, which they had cold... So i was to imagine it warm.. I'm just gonna come back and try it. We decided to get the chicken alfredo and the cheddar mac sammich. Also while paying I realized I hadn't checked in yet. So, I checked in and received free bread sticks!! YUMM. We were gonna order a side anyways so it's nice that it was free. They gave us our numbers and we grab drinks and sat down. I was excited they have blue powerade. Most places just have the standar coke sprite and stuff. They have tables and chairs or booths. I wanted the booth side and made my friend take the chair side. HAHA, cushion for my butt!! After waiting maybe 10 minutes or so all of our food was out. I got right to it with a fork full of alfredo and chicken. The alfredo sauce was delicious, however I'm wasn't the hugest fan of the chicken slices. They were a little bland. I added some crushed peppers to spice it up, and we were back in action. We then move to the cheddar mac and cheese sammich. It was great. Nice toasted bread with cheddar mac.. Oh, ill be back for another round and hopefully soon. Cool part is when you clean your own plate you can grab a tootie pop at the door, mine are still sitting the in the car but it was a nice gesture. :)

Beso is a Mexican-style restaurant with happy servers! I just love the aura and feel to the place- it is just so gorgeous! My friends and I went on a random night before we were to head to a local club, because we were offered a complementary dinner, so we did not get to choose what to eat.  In this complementary dinner though, it included guacamole dip and chips (the best guacamole dip I have ever tried!), ribeye steak covered in horseradish, and caesar salad. The rest of the entree was not necessarily the best of all time, but it was worth the stay and eat! I hopefully will go in and try something on the menu that I choose, so until then, stay in tuned!Beso: The Spanish word for "kiss"This hidden restaurant within CityCenter,  was inspired by Eva Longoria Parker :DHours of operation:Dining Room/PatioSun-Thurs 5:30pm-11pmFri & Sat 5:30pm-Midnight LoungeSun-Thurs 5:30pm-11pmWed-Sat 5:30pm-2amTo get this started, I first would like to brag about this "comp" dinner my lady friends & I had ;)We had reservations at 9:30pm & they wouldn't allow us to sit until the whole group arrived.When we finally got to the table, we all could not help but adore the well-designed restaurant, especially, the gorgeous custom-designed crystal chandelier.On the other hand, our server was ready to greet us, and prepared us with a brief description of our comp dinner...Appetizer: Eva's Avocado Guacamole w/ crispy tortilla chips (best I've ever tried!!!! Yum yum Yum)Entree:  Their version of strip steak w/ horseradish creamy sauce & roast potatoes (not really a full order on the menu, since this was a comp dinner) but was very tasty, yet small portions where given. Salad: Cesar salad (simply what it would normally be) great with the steak we had.As you can see, these three selections above, looks a bit too minimal, and to tell you the truth, I wanted more! But in the end, I had a full tummy  & smile for the free food I just had eaten. "free food tastes even better"My overall experienced was well-appreciated, somewhat disappointing with portion, but satisfying with keeping our money in our wallets ;)Maybe next time, I could actually order from the menu & get the real deal ;)

Review Text :
Living on the East side of Las Vegas, we are limited on good places to eat. Thai Cuisine is a place I've been going to for years. Thai food is probably one of my favorite type of foods to eat, so I've tried many places in the valley. This place rates right in the middle. The food is good enough to crave but not great enough to be my number one choice. Of course if I don't want to drive far and I have a craving, I don't really have much of a choice. The Thai Beef salad here is delicious. Just the perfect amount of lettuce and spices. I always cry about how Thai places do not like to put a lot of veggies in their Thai Beef Salad. They think a lot of beef is what people want. But not everyone. I love my veggies! Last visit we had ordered Spicy Seafood Soup. One of my favorites dishes to order. It comes out in a bowl on fire. Soup is sour with a great kick to it. Large variety of seafood inside, We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, first time ordering it here. It was ok. Noodles were cooked well but there was a lack of flavor. It was more on the sweeter side.Service is great. they bring out complimentary egg rolls which is appreciated. They don't accept debit/credit cards for some reason. But, they do have a ATM inside the restaurant. So be prepared to have cash if you decide to dine here.

Yep, I would like to eat here every week. I would say everyday but, that would be exaggerating it a bit. *not really*I always find anyone/anyway possible to eat here lolAfter hiking at Red Rock, the topic of lunch came up and my suggestion was this place....and despite the half hour distance, I won =)Got the garlic chicken bento with a side of onion tempura. You can choose ur veggies for the tempura which got me all flustered because I wanted alllllll the veggies tempura'd.....was hoping for one of everything tempura'd but, since they were out of brocolli, I had to go with onion tempura (onion rings/not really/almost). Swear, I love their garlic chicken but, I shoulda went with my friends order.He got the mochiko bento with a side of curry. And in looking at his meal, I think that's the best bet of a meal. You get the mochiko (delish!), chicken katsu (my fave katsu in Vegas), and the curry (ur own chicken katsu curry). Altho my complaint with the curry was it was sooooo little...it wasn't enough to feed the curry craving.I have yet to try the tempura fried rice. I'll be here next week. And by next week, I mean, tomorrow!

Review Text :
Considering that they were shut down in August by the health department, and just got a C a couple of days ago at the next inspection is enough for me to write them off. It lets me know they really don't care about the health and safety of their customer. Last Thursday I got their tom yum soup with shrimp which came out to $12.36 because they don't take card payments for orders under $15. So you're already raping me with your overpriced MSG filled soup, but now add extra .50 cent penalty because my order is under $15. Anyway, I had the soup and shortly after got a headache and upset stomach. I know my body and the reactions it has to certain foods, and I can say with 100% certainty that soup was an MSG filled mess. I am happily writing this place off.I am so unimpressed with you, Siri. I met my homegirl Jaime W. for dinner after a long and stressful day. There was only one table with customers when we arrived, so I was looking forward to a good meal in a relaxed setting. What I got was a bland, boring meal served up by some of the worst waitresses I have ever had to deal with. Thankfully, I had good dining company!Jaime was already seated when I arrived, and the waitress came over fairly quickly to take my drink order. It was all downhill from there.  Two men arrived shortly after I got my water and sat at the booth next to us. We were both surprised to see one of the waitresses taking their food order before taking ours... Perhaps I had left my menu open too long and they thought we were not ready to order, but a good waitress would have checked to see if we had any questions. This isn't a huge deal, I was there to catch up with a friend and waiting a little longer than normal to order just gave us more time to chat.We ordered our food and went back to our conversation. Our meals came out relatively quickly and correctly (I had requested no onion in my dish). I just wasn't impressed with my Ginger Beef dish at all. There was an abundance of shredded ginger on the plate but the sauce itself was very bland. The steamed rice was mushy as well. By this time I was out of water. Also, the table that was seated when we arrived was done and ready to pay. I watched our waitress go to them with their check and take away their plates. She went back to get their credit card, took it to the cash register and back to their table. The other waitress was seated at the register during this time. At one point she stood up, looked over the register at the booth where the men were seated to see if they needed anything and then sat back down. Not even a glance in our direction, if she had I would have waved at her to get her attention...  Finally, Jaime got fed up and walked to the register to request refills. This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. Thanks to the piss-poor service coupled with the sub-par seasoning of my dish, I was over my meal. While the waitress was intelligent enough to see that I had left a lot of my meal on my plate (she asked if I needed a to-go box) she was not intelligent enough to ask if everything was ok with the food. Whatever. I won't be back.EDITED TO ADD: Siri Thai was closed by the Health Department of Southern Nevada in August of 2013 for RECYCLING RICE. That is disgusting and has ensured I will never step foot in this place again.

Restaurant name  The Beat Coffeehouse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I heard about The Beat on NPR and was so excited to try it. I really, really, really wanted to like it...but sadly it fell short of my expectations. Expectations meaning a good cup of coffee. Honestly, when I go to a cofeehouse this self-admitted coffee snob is really just looking for a good coffee beverage. Sure, good service, a good vibe, good food, live music, free Wi-Fi, these things are all a plus. But if you call yourself a "coffeehouse" at the very least you should be able to produce a good cup of coffee and good coffee beverages. That being said, here is my experience at The Beat.We arrived at around 3 pm. We walked in and it looked like they were trying really hard to capture a 1960's No. Cal. beatnik vibe. Nothing wrong with that but it just felt like they were trying a bit too hard. We walked up to the counter and waited while the barista finished making a drink. It took a really long time...that should have been a clue. She eventually finished, handed off the drink and approached us.Me: Hi!Barista: (just to point out there was no "hi" in return...not even a smile) Just to let you know we don't serve alcohol until after 7pm.Me: That's OK we are here for coffee.Barista: Oh and the kitchen is closed because they are having a meeting.Me: No problem. May I have a non-fat cappuccino for here?She rang it up and we had a seat. It took a really long time...btw, it was the only drink she was making. She finally called out my drink and what I ended up with was a mediocre (at best) cap. The foam was big, soapy bubbles which dissipated quickly leaving about 4 gulps of slightly milky espresso in my cup. The espresso was fine but the overall drink was disappointing. In fact the entire experience was a big disappointment.I always walked pass this place and wondered what is going on inside. Last night I finally got to try it out as I was there for the Yelp Holiday Bazaar event. Here I won't review the event but the special turkey sandwich that I ordered. This sandwich was their sandwich of the day or something like that and it was amazing. Sliced turkey breast on top of a brotchen with lettuce, and cheese and some other things that made this one of my favorites. The first thing that came into my mind when I bit into the sandwitch was: where the heck did they find brotchen in Las Vegas????? That is one of the things I miss about Germany and I hope they share their secret brotchen location with me. Anyways, I will be going back there to try more on their menu.Im so obsessed with this place! They have great coffee and also do little events at night such as a free style story telling. that was so fun to watch. If your ever downtown def check this place out.I popped in to The Beat Coffeehouse after a walking tour of Fremont Street.  It was a nice spot to sit and relax and cool off in the AC after being outside for a couple of hours.  It really reminded me of the coffeehouses I used to hang out in when I was in college.  The whole place seems to be a mishmash of furniture, neighborhoods, and stuff collected at flea markets.  I only had a cold soda, which was bottled, so I can't really comment on the food or drink served in the place, but the menu looked good.  This really isn't a place I would search out, but if I was in the neighborhood and wanted a tea, I would stop in for sure.On the Fremont Street East Entertainment District the Beat goes on. The Beat Coffeehouse is a coffee house experience that hits the right chord.  The Beat Coffee House is the antithesis of the standard corporate coffee shop chain (still a major Starbuck's fan). It is a symbol of the preservation and revitalization movement occurring in downtown Las Vegas. Standing at the southeast corner of Fremont at 6th Streets, across from the El Cortez, the Beat Coffeehouse lives in a building dating back decades before the records displayed in their bins and walls were recorded. Decades before I was born, the Beat Coffeehouse was a J.C. Penney. The handicap entrance to the current Emergency Arts Building that The Beat shares space with used to be the J.C. Penney catalog showroom. Considering that I am into current history, I am fascinated by this. Anyway, Boulevard Mall opened which took away the J.C. Penny and major retailers from Fremont Street. The Fremont Medical District took over the J.C. Penney. Recently it closed. The innovative spirit happening in downtown turned this into a multi-use building that includes art studios and the Beat Coffee Shop.   The Beat Coffeehouse is an awesome coffeehouse scene. It reminds me so much of an independent coffee shop in downtown New Orleans or San Francisco. When I walk in the doors I see the counter with stools to the left and a chalk board menu beyond. When I order there is a turntable playing the album heard throughout the cafe. If I keep going straight, maybe to use the rest room; I walk through a hall that is now the Emergency Arts. To the right is an art studio separated by pane glass. When I turn around and head toward Fremont Street where I entered the Beat, the record bins will be on my left. A few more feet are the seats. There is an eclectic arrangement of seating from couches to tables and counter stools. If I walk out the door, the Commonwealth (with the Laundry Room), the Griffin, and Don't Tell Mama are across Fremont Street.  The Beat is versatile. Their menu includes coffee, espresso, soup, sandwiches, sweets, and yes wine and beer. I have kind words to say about the strawberry Italian soda and drip coffee with strawberry syrup. Those kind words are "4 stars."  When it comes to a place to hang out, The Beat Rocks. Management has good taste in music. Pink Floyd and coffee really go good together. An activity I enjoyed was when they played a record that I enjoyed but had zero clue who the artist was. Like a little kid chasing an ice cream truck, I'd dash over to the turntable to find out the artist. The windows overlooking the street activity happening on Fremont Street is entertaining. The activity ranges from a character yelling "shut up" to a nighttime sightseeing bus. There are also poetry events.   The Beat Coffeehouse is a unique coffeehouse scene in downtown Las Vegas. And when it comes to the coffee house scene, you can say I march to the beat of a different drum.The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 95.One of Downtown's first day time places to hang out and around the corner from Vegas' new Godfather, Tony Hsieh's Ogden...this hip little coffee house drips with history. This building was once a JC Penny's, then a medical building. Painted concrete floors and old vinyls characterize this historic hipster hangout.They offer an extensive lunch menu and the delicious garlic aroma made our mouths water during our downtown project tour. For a coffee house, they need to have real coffee machines as they look silly pumping coffee orders out of a large thermos. Expect an extra long wait for food orders. Even having what looks like a full staff, the pace is slow. We waited 45 minutes (after we were told it would be 15 minutes) for a tuna sandwich and baked mac & cheese that still came out cold in the middle. Food was ok, but definitely not worth the wait time. Parking downtown also not the easiest. Hopefully with the revitalization, there will be more competition nearby to make The Beat come up to par.I passed this place at least 50 times walking along Fremont Street to the El Cortez over the past several years. Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.It has a good vibe, and friendly service.  It attracts business clientele in the morning, not hipsters like I expected.Rock posters, cut out articles, and flyers of every kind are posted to the wall.  Everything from a moving notice from Skin City to a call for homeless activists.Free wifi.  70's funk, whiteman-overbite tunes.  I like it.It's eclectic.  Sells both pastrami sandwiches and used records.  The chairs and tables are a little beat up, but that adds to funkiness.The coffee came from canisters, already made, not fresh as I love -- but it was a tasty brew.Very cool and very chill.Yes! I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is. First off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package. More on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool. The staff? Friendly. I'm super, duper glad I decamped from my situation at chain-coffee ground-zero and sought out some realness. For any visitors or locals looking to avoid the 'bux or the chaos just a few miles down Las Vegas Blvd, this is your spot. Grab coffee, post up, get things done, and feel good about the whole thing.Coffeehouse check list time...- Weird random stuff hanging on the wall? CHECK!- Assortment of seating arrangements. Varying in size and comfort? CHECK!- Funky names for food items? CHECK!  "Slap N' Tickle", PB & J w/ Bacon, "Tina Turner Wrap" Turkey Wrap Sammie- Interesting yet good music playing. CHECK! - Varying assortment of customers... Businessmen, Indie Folks, Zappos employees  changing their scenery yet still working, fast on their feet. CHECK!Honestly, this place covers all the bases of a great coffee shop. First and foremost their coffee is very good. Super smooth and with no burnt taste, which is was what most people are used to from that large coffee chain on every suburban street corner. No, burnt doesn't equal strong. You've been Yelpucated!I came here after a meeting and was in the mood for a caffeine boost and some coffeehouse treats in my belly. I ordered an Iced Coffee and the "Tina Turner Turkey Wrap". Like I said before, the coffee is great and surprisingly the food is on the same level. The Turkey Wrap was made perfect; fresh veggies, flavorful turkey, and a soft tortilla, but its just not wraps and bagels. They offer many food options as the menu here is quite large, so if Turkey Wraps or PB & J sammies aren't your cup of tea (or coffee), I'm sure you'll find something to snack on. Free WiFi, vinyl for sale, various art shows, plus fun trivia nights. The Beat really does a great job at being awesome. It's really in your best interest to just come down here, sit down, enjoy a cup of happiness, and bob your head to The Beat.The Beat Coffeehouse proudly plays rock music in the background while serving different types of drinks and offering a decent selection of things to munch on. It's a short walk from the Downtown Container Park and across from Commonwealth. The interior was pretty cool. Different things such as newspaper articles, ads, and posters were all tacked up on their walls. The music was pretty good; a lot of rock classics played and then other songs I've never even heard of before came on. They had vinyl records for sale in the little crates on the counters.I ordered a mango/banana smoothie, but I'm pretty sure I was handed just a plain banana smoothie... Okay, maybe the nice young woman taking my order didn't hear me. It's alright, though, because I honestly needed something cold and refreshing to cool me off before I venture off into the crowd for First Friday. When the guy behind the counter called me up to grab my drink, he handed it to me in a way that made the drink ooze out through the lid and fly everywhere! There weren't any apologies, no offering up napkins, nothing. Well, whatever. At least I got my drink. (Although I did have to clean it up for the photo). The smoothie had the ripe banana taste and wasn't really that sweet.I sat on the couch, and it made me sink in it a little. It's super comfortable and it got to the point where I felt like I wanted to take a nap. In the same building (towards the back), there's the Emergency Arts art gallery which you should check out if you've got the spare time... I don't think this coffee shop is a good place for groups of 4+ people, but it's perfect for bringing a friend or two to chill (or go solo and work on some stuff).

Review Text :
9/26/10I am overjoyed w/ my decision to have dinner here on the last night of Restaurant Week despite three days' of failed attempts to get out of work early enough to enjoy the sunset views!  The terrific value on such a delicious meal coupled w/ a great perlustration of the eternity pool/fountain in the patio deck made up for the missed survey of the desert mountain landscape (don't forget the beautiful Talking Stick golf course, resort pools, and water fixtures!).  Besides the two restaurant lounge areas, private dining booths, two Chef's tables ($2000 minimum ticket), and a large, yet intimate, main dining area, there are many "pockets" brimming w/ positive energy in the patio where one can enjoy a cocktail (or not!), catch up w/ friends, or just linger and take in the beauty of the space.  Before or after dinner, you can also enjoy a bit of live music (tonight featured a pianist)-- loved the aeronautic-themed chairs!  Enough on the atmosphere, let's get onto the food!For Restaurant Week, Orange Sky's $39 menu featured:APPETIZER:Lobster bisque; Half-dozen of iced oysters; OS dinner salad.MAIN COURSE:Filet of beef; Grilled half-chicken; Herb-crusted Pacific yellowtail tuna.DESSERT:Chocolate dome; Lemon semolina cake; Choice of gelato or  sorbet.If I didn't have food allergies to worry about, I would've chosen the oysters to start; the tuna for the main, and the lemon cake to finish.  Instead, I ordered the salad, the filet, and the crowd-pleaser chocolate dome, and what a wonderful meal they made!!  The salad was comprised of greens and spicy candied walnuts dressed in a roquefort-sherry vinaigrette, and sprinkled w/ a few dashes of toasted shallot ribbons.  The sherry vinaigrette gave the salad a lovely, smooth, and mild flavor.  That is, until I'd bite into a roquefort crumble, which lent a welcomed burst of tang and pungency!  The combination of candied walnuts, roquefort, sherry, and shallots might not be for everybody, but I loved it- a great way to stir up my appetite!The twin tournedos of beef filet were truly remarkable!  Cooked to medium, the filet was lovely to behold, and even more delightful to eat- the sauce choron, a bearnaise variation, that supplemented the dish made for a perfect pairing!  The steaks also came w/ two roasted sweet peppers, a few asparagus spears (a few I found were slightly overdone, but still very good), and silky mashed potatoes.  (I personally like a bit of texture in mashed potatoes, so I was very happy to find that this specimen wasn't TOO silky.  Alone, it was a tasty side, but after tasting the meat, the potatoes could've used a bit more seasoning.  However, I feel it's better to have to add more seasoning after than to have too much and not be able to enjoy a dish at all!)  I really appreciated that the steaks were presented twin-style instead of one whole-- I was able to enjoy a small serving and still have some room for dessert!And oh, what a great dessert I had!  Drum roll please... The chocolate dome, made in-house, presented w/ two blackberries and a glaze of white chocolate and bitter orange.  The dome itself was a "hard shell"  of chocolate ganache (it really wasn't hard at all, and I personally would've appreciated the "break" of a chocolate bar here), sprinkled w/ almond brittle, and inside lay exquisite mantles of chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which sat on top of a chocolate cookie!  While the dessert looked very rich and decadent, it was surprisingly light (I had three glorious bites before putting it aside to move onto the gelato).  I definitely wanted to take some of this cake to enjoy later at home ;)  The gelato, while not made in-house (or so the server believed), was equally satisfying- the coffee flavor was quite delicate-- this was a scoop to be savored ever-so-slowly, like a favorite spirit to be sipped over time, and not chased down.  I also had a cup of Peet's coffee to go along w/ dessert.I waited a very long time to experience Orange Sky, and what a remarkable evening I had!  I will be back very, very soon!p.s.  Small details, such as pretty dinnerware and embedded crystals in silverware (although I noted fingerprint smudges all over- tsk, tsk!), friendly and courteous service, and the lovely upgrades to the fixtures and decor really added to my overall satisfaction w/ my OS experience.  I would suggest everyone try Orange Sky at least once, but make sure you arrange yours w/ a sunset reservation!  (Unless, of course, you quite enjoy looking at the tops of brightly lit parking lots!)p.p.s  Recall those private dining booths I mentioned?  They're certainly worth checking out if you value some privacy-- the tables all face panoramic views and certainly keep prying eyes from seeing who are seated.  [The only giveaway to the tables' occupancy was the pockets of barely discernible conversation my ears picked up as I walked by.  Visual inspection of the tables would have you believe that the booths were empty.Had a few drinks at the bar....what an amazing view of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  The night I was there, a piano player was playing jazz standards and some cover songs.....excellent Wine selection and the house Zinfandel was superb!The bartenders here are very friendly and accommodating.  I can't wait to come back here with my Better Half to give dinner a try.Return Factor - 95%I'm giving Orange Sky a solid four stars for a great experience. It's not my favorite restaurant in town, but it definitely one that impressed me beyond belief! I visited Orange Sky months back when Talking Stick first opened and explored the restaurant sans guests, so I knew what I was walking into. However, I must say that it was even better the second time I went! Time was running out to participate in Restaurant Week so we looked at the list of restaurants and decided that this was the perfect chance to try Orange Sky. Luckily we made reservations because when we arrived, they said that it was full until 9 PM (this was at 7). Upon arrival at the hostess stand at the bottom floor, I noticed that they have a really strict dress code: no t-shirts, cut-offs, flip flops, shorts, and some others that I can't remember. Once they checked our reservation, we got into the elevator and I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the walls is glass, allowing us to look out on the desert as we zipped up. We arrived on the 15th floor and walked out into a lively lounge equipped with patios, plenty of seating and even a pianist singing classic tunes. The restaurant itself is intimate and very much like a restaurant you would find in a large city. Glass windows line the restaurant and they have plenty of private seating. They have rooms to the right that seat roughly 15-20 people, including a wine rack room. To the left, they have private niches that seat between 4-6 people with windows looking out on the skyline. The main section of the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables as well as other tables along the windows. Then the rooftop patio has couch seating as well as regular tables. They even offer light-up menus since it's dark. The patio would be a wonderful place to sit and grab drinks and food and they even have a staircase that goes directly down into the club on the 14th floor. Moving on to the food, it was pretty good. I started with the Artichoke bisque, followed by the game hen and ended the meal with a chocolate tarte. Everything was tasty. A couple things I noticed that stood out was when I asked our waitress what appetizer she suggested off of the prix fix menu, she said she didn't like one and hadn't tried the other and really did a pretty poor job of selling any of the items. I opted for the bisque without high expectations and it was a lot better then she sold it to be! Then for the wine, another waiter came by and asked us if we wanted refills on our cocktails. My bf opted for another beer and said so but I still had a half of glass of wine so didn't order another one. The second beer shows up and the next thing I know the waiter is pouring wine into my glass. I stopped him and said I didn't order a glass of wine and he said he thought he heard me say I did. I said I hadn't and at this point it was too late because the wine was already poured in. However, the waiter was very nice and since I hadn't asked for the wine, they didn't end up charging us for it. In summary, I like Orange Sky and this is definitely a great option for date night, if you have visitors in town, or if you are staying at the casino. It's worth it to go for the ambiance alone.This restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the casino. There is a dress code warning including no flip flops, t-shirts, shorts or cut offs which helps to keep the casino riff raff out. There are glass widows lining the restaurant  with tables and booths placed all around them. The mountain and desert views are spectacular and the overall ambiance is classy and captivating. The food was excellent although a bit overpriced. I had the tenderloin flatbread , the steak was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. The Tuscan kale salad and the fried green tomatoes were also delicious choices prepared with care. I agree with another reviewer who said the wine list pricing was all over the place, luckily the selection made up for the scattered pricing. The bartender we had was personable and friendly and made our visit quite enjoyable.Overall I don't think I would make dinner reservations here, but it is a nice place to grab an app and a glass of wine and take in the stunning views of our beautiful desert city.The service is impeccable here. I still love coming here for special occasions because the night is so relaxing and I know the food will be executed flawlessly. That's why I was excited to start the new year's day 2013 with my family. I stepped out of my routine of ordering a Malbec or temperanillo with my meal, and ventured to ordering an Old Fashioned. They do it well here! I'm almost thinking about making the picture I took of it my phone wallpaper because I always want to remember it! My family ordered oysters to start as always. One of the oysters I chomped into contained a special surprise... A pearl! Don't worry, I didn't break a tooth or anything, but it definitely surprised me when I was chewing and thought, "Wow, this is a huge piece of grit in my oyster," and was shocked to find a small pearl! I guess that doesn't always happen, but I will look for another when I eat oysters so I can make earrings or something!My twin beef tournedos (mini twin filets) was just as amazing as always paired with the Bernaise sauce. I actually split it this time with my friend so we could try their special for the night... A chilean sea bass sitting on lobster cakes topped with an Asian glaze type sauce. Usually I love sushi, so cooked fish seldom impresses me, but this sea bass was incredible, especialyl mixed with lobster cakes. Who wants crab cakes, when you can have awesome lobster cakes, right??

Ripoff Report - Proceed with caution!A group of us came here for happy hour last night to celebrate a coworker's departure. Our office is located in Kierland, so we chose Bar North as it's within walking distance, they have a nice patio, and have provided great service in the past. The service was friendly and very accommodating to our large group, but we left feeling bamboozled! Four of us in the group ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We were about 3/4ths of the way through the first pitcher, when another pitcher had been served to our table. None of us had wanted another pitcher, but started to drink it anyway as we all thought that someone else at the table had ordered a second one. There were about 12 people at our table so, it was hard to know who ordered what. We all asked each other "who ordered the second pitcher?" The answer was no one ordered the second pitcher, the server just served us a second one without asking, and added it to our tab. We felt that we couldn't dispute the check since we started to drink out of the second pitcher, even though we barely touched it as we all had to drive ourselves home that night.To make matters worse, one of the woman in our group had ordered a glass of Chardonnay not knowing that there were several options on the menu. Instead of asking her which one she would like, they served her the most expensive one at $14 for one glass. If you have several different kinds of Chardonnay, why wouldn't they ask the patron which one they wanted? Instead they just took this as an opportunity to up-sell.There are several options in Kierland for Happy Hour without shady service, that is where we'll be going next time as Bar North left us all with a feeling of being taken advantage of.

Came to Rising Sun sushi restaurant on E. Flamingo Rd (across from Tuscany casino) for a recent UYE.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, plays a fantastic playlist of music, and is really clean.One of the main selling points of this sushi spot is their Happy Hour (in addition to their regular menu, they offer a limited HH menu of food and drinks). They actually have two of them (5pm-8pm and 10pm-midnight, excluding holidays).  Another for out of town visitors staying at nearby casinos and resorts is its proximity to the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.Personal highlights of the food I tried are:Miso Yummy Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber inside and topped with salmon and miso dressing) being one of my favorite.  Cherry Popper Roll is good too.  If you like California Roll and tuna plus a little spicy orange sauce, then you will like this.Their Japanese Chicken Meatball served yakitori style is a nice salty appetizer, and I think everyone at the table enjoyed it.  Hangover Roll is an interesting one. It has hot link sausage, avocado and cream cheese wrapped in bacon then tempura fried, with sprinkles of parmesan cheese, scallions and drizzles wasabi mayo.  I am glad I tried it, but will probably save room for something else in future visits.Wild Salmon Sashimi was good. It is not the traditional sashimi (just slices of fresh fish) served in Japan, but new style sashimi made popular by Nobu.If I was rating the restaurant solely based on food, creativity and taste of the rolls, service and ambiance it will get 4 stars.  But factoring in the overall price/value, I would have to only rate it 3 stars.  The main reason being that nigiri is not part of the HH menu, and at regular price is more than most off-Strip non-AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.3 stars (A-OK).

Review Text :
stopped in here today after picking up an order from the wonderful retro bakery. this place is right next door and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for a snack. we walk in to this cozy little place to one woman working. she was nice and helpful and after minutes on debating on what to get we decided on the 4 piece chicken tender with a side of sweet potato french fries. total was a little over 8 dollars. she said it would be about an 8 minute wait so we sat on some chairs up against the wall. now be forewarned there are no tables in this little eatery so make sure you know the food is to go. while waiting Dan and I were deciding where to eat this made to order little snack. We opted for a picnic in his car. (hey...we had to make it work!) After a few minutes of waiting and examining the menu some more for next time we got our little goodie bag. we took it to the car and opened the box of wings to a hot and spicy with a pinch of sweetness smell. we just looked at each other and couldn't wait to dig in. (oh btw we got the mom's special spicy sweet sauce.) we took some bites of the sweet potato fries. they were really good. the chicken was very fresh, juicy, and pure white on the inside. biting into these tenders was a little bite of heaven. ok maybe a little dieters sin, but so worth it. the sauce had so much flavor to it and it felt like these littler sinners were melting in my mouth. the little hint of spice lingered in my mouth for a few good moments. i wish we ordered more! Next time I go back I already decided to get an order of the jalapeno mac and cheese.I am only deducting a star for not having table and chairs for people to eat. My boyfriend and I decided next time we come back up here we will order this food and have a picnic over at floyd lamb state park. If you don't live in the area that would be a good (and cutesy!) option rather than driving it half an hour back to henderson. You could also do like we did and just picnic in the car. just be prepared for messy, sticky fingers and have lots of napkins handy!I gave Mom's Good Eats my first try the other day when me and my girlfriend were next door picking up an order at Retro. It's a small hole in the wall joint with no seating but something was calling our name. Good thing we went in and checked it out because it was a good find. Though I must admit we were both very skeptical at first going into a place with no seating and being that we've never eaten there we had no clue what to expect. We ended up ordering Chicken Tenders smothered in moms Sweet & Spicy Sauce with Sweet potato fries. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and the Kitchen was in plain view so you know your food is made to order. We received our food and proceeded to my car for a "Picnic" lol. As soon as we opened the box my sinuses immediately clear up and I couldn't wait to dig in. Chicken Fingers are one of those foods that are hard to mess up but you can really tell when a place does it well. Crispy enough on the outside with hot & moist white meat on the inside. Mom's special sauce was awesome! not too sweet not too spicy : )As for the sweet potato's; they were absolutely to die for! I still have some places to try in town before I can say they're the best I've had but they're up there for sure! They also had some interesting stuff on there menu that I would like to try next time they stop in like Jalapeno Mac & Cheese, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, Etc. If I didn't live all the way across town this would be the perfect place for when you're on your way home and just want something tasty because you don't feel like cooking kind of nights ; ) I'm giving Mom's Good Eats 4 stars on strength of flavor and reasonable prices. Definitely worth a try!

Sadly this place was a real disappointment. Bought a GrouponNOW! lunch special, went over had a decent tuna melt, and then went to pay with my Groupon and they said the decided not to honor it because to many people had bought them. So they expected me to pay for my lunch even while the deal was still up on Groupon and they were selling more of the deals. Sleazy Business, with run of the mill bar food. Not worth the effort ... Typical Las Vegas scammers...The only reason for the one star is because there is not an option for zero stars.  I have been here 3 times; the first time we ate breakfast on the restaurant side.   The food was decent, as was the service and price.  The second visit here and I thought I was in the twilight zone.  The bartender was incredibly rude and informed us that our conversation should not be able to be heard over the music that was playing.  I initially thought she was joking.  She wasn't.  We left and I chalked it up to perhaps she was having a bad day.  The next time I go in, she is there and walks past me at least 4 times before asking for my order.  I should add I was there around lunch time and there were only two other people in the bar so her service wasn't slow due to being busy; she was again very rude and quite frankly should not be in a customer service position.  I speak with the manager and he is no better. Evidently his father or grandfather owns the bar and he does not take customer complaints well. He became defensive and essentially told me I was wrong.So, I leave and through casual conversations with friends after the fact, find out that the same thing has happened to them or someone they know.  Needless to say I will not return to this establishment.

Mother India's was my first experience of non-British Indian food. You know what I mean. Indian is indian, but us Brits have a way of doing it that makes it distinctly British-Indian. Creamy kormas, and don't forget the vindaloo. Don't get me wrong, this sort of Indian is nice, but it's all a little repetitive.Mother India's Cafe serve up far more authentic Indian food, in tapas style portions, which means you can order 2 or 3 different dishes to share in all the flavours and textures. And this can only be a good thing.The curries are absolutely delicious, and a million miles away from the standard "chicken tikka masala". My personal favourites are the aubergine and potato curry, channa dahl, ginger and chilli chicken, lamb pasanda...in fact it's all pretty damned good.They also do a takeaway service (although no delivery) and it's something I make use of frequently. Rather handily with the takeaway you can order a 'large' portion which is bigger than the tapas portions you get with sitin.I've only done takeaway from here so far, and everytime the food has been hot, hot, hot (both tasty hot, spicy hot, and sexy hot. Yep you heard me.)My only recommendation? Try it.

The Good: sandwiches are mostly very quality and are made quickly. Not crazy about the Tuna salad - too rich. Same goes for the Chicken salad sandwich. The beef sandwiches are really good. Not so good: they seem to have a high turnover rate for employees. The man who seems to be managing is more often than not engaged in loud conversations with vendors and other people. He is often arguing with people related to the Esplanade management. It does not create a pleasant ambience. I am fed up with this guy and will not be back.

So...I don't eat pork, but I do chow down on chicken and beef and that's what I was in the mood for. Hit up Famous D for some saucy chicken and beef. Ordered the Two Meat Combo with Chicken Tenders and the Smoked Sirloin Tri Tip as well as the Dave's Sassy BBQ salad. The salad was actually soild. It came with honey bbq sauce which I asked for on the side. Glad I did because it tasted boo-boo. I'm glad I asked for the ranch because it made the salad so much better. As for the Two Meat Combo, they got the order wrong. They brought out a bunch of pork and chicken tenders. They eventually brought out the tri-tip but there was a scant amount of sauce that came with it. The sauce was actually super good, but it seemed like they were in a rush to get the order out and it came out lacking. The chicken tenders were soft and crispy and the best part of the meal. Service was pretty good and they had flat screens everywhere so you can watch playoff basketball. And last but not least, if you want to watch Gilbert's finest - this is a 5 star place to people watch.

Oh my this is such a great little hidden gem of a place!! We came here today to enjoy their happy hour, we are always looking for good little happy hour spots to renew ourselves after not so joyous days, Woo-hoo!! :) Boy it WAS definitely Feliz (Happy) hour for us!!! :)        The mojitos were oh so Delicious and just $7/each. While the Cali and spicy tuna rolls were just $3.95/each!!!  Talk about YAY and WOW!!! But wait there is more, they also offer scrumptious shrimp tempura rolls for just $5.95, What a steal right??      WHY ask for more!! Well, okay we did too, so we had the Pad Thai, which was great with a load of yummy flavorful noodles and chicken along with a small portion of veggies, we also ordered their Chicken Yellow Curry, that was rich and creamy and ever so satisfying!!      This place is soooo AWESOME that they even have a scale of hotness for their plates 1-5, 5 being the hottest, PLUS for those whom prefer their food super hot and spicy they also have the Thai 7, which is their absolute hottest. I myself settled for a 4, and that surprisingly was hot enough, yet edible and just right for me!!  Even after consuming all of our food that we knew and felt was colossal, we experienced a HAPPY FULL and not a GREASY FATTY FULL. Finally, we had a great time and the service was FANTASTIC as well as the food!! We truly enjoyed ourselves here, the vibe was just right and the people there were ever so nice. You deserve a High-five!!                    - Narai, you will be seeing our hungry faces more often!!                                                 Thank you new friends!!! :)yummy! i had the yellow chicken curry lunch special, level 3 heat. not spicy at all so next time i'll try it at 4. it came with egg drop soup which was mediocre after adding soy sauce(so i guess it was only good after adding something to make it taste like something else therefore skip the soup), a salad, plus the entree and choice of rice. it was pretty inexpensive, like just under $9. good deal. it was tasty, fast, and clean. i'll be back!

Review Text :
The worst experience I have ever had... My boyfriend took me here a while back when we came to Vegas from Los Angeles to visit his parents (They live in Southern Highlands)... He kept saying how wonderful this place was so I was forced to try. We show up and immediately I felt tension in the air. Everything I asked about on the menu apparently wasn't available because: "The stove is turned off"... "We ran out of that bread"... "There isn't anymore meat"... I mean, I kid you not, he literally left us with nothing left to order except maybe 3 or 4 items which weren't at all appealing to either of us. Mind you, as we were asking them questions, both the manager and some kid kept smiling at each other like this was some joke. I told my boyfriend lets just go somewhere else, this isn't looking good anymore, he agreed. As we walked out, the manager called out to us "FAG**TS" and started laughing with his employee. This was by far the most disgusting place I have ever been. The employees were extremely inappropriate homophobes and the establishment itself was appalling. I pray someone shuts this place down.
L & L Hawaiian Barbecue=First of all, I am a huge fan of Hawaiian Food, and have enjoyed L& L many years. However, after expanding my taste buds to Hawaii, California and some great Hawaiian food here in the Vegas Valley, I have to say, hmmmmm not bad L& La. Location - This one is near the Walmart / Sams Club on Serene just west of Eastern.  Easy location and parking.b.  Service - Is, not great, but not mediocre. It is just okay. They do not attempt to make a difference or to make it a great experience.c.  Food - Great overall selection.  We ordered the Katsu and the Beef plate.  The Katsu was quite good and they give you a ton of food. The Mac Salad was just right.  Where they get seriously dinged on the stars is the beef.  Can you remove the fatty tendons that is all over the beef?  You cannot eat this properly because so much sinewy fat is in this beef. It is tough, rough and downright a pain in the but to cut away with a plastic fork and plastic knife in a styrofoam plate.  This is evident to the quality of beef they are using and I would say that all their salty flavorings are covering up the poor meet taste.  However, the texture totally reeks of poor quality.d.  The bathroom - Why do lock it?  What a pain where your hands are totally greasy from trying to pick apart the fat from the meat. Then we cannot just push our way into the restroom, we have to pick up a key on a long stick, work the lock and get in.  I just want to wash my hands and now I have to wash first to pick up the keys..... Yucky.Overall, the taste of the flavoring is good, the katsu good, but the beef and the inconvenience of this place overall causes me to give this a 3 star at best.GK says, gas is still cheap. Keep driving to somewhere else...I went here today for dinner because I was across the street at Costco. I totally forgot this place opened up (and so very glad it did) because the only other one I know of is near UNLV---across town for me.The bento box was really goood. It came with four different kinds of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. All the meats were delicious, even the fried stuff wasn't very greasy. I did not try the macaroni salad --- I dislike items that taste like mayonnaise (IMHO). Thankfully, they kept the mac salad in a separate container so that it would not touch any of the food that I actually wanted to eat. This will def be my go-to here.The seafood platter, which included scallops, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, rice, and mac salad, was alright. It didn't come with as much food as the bento combo, but it was the same price. You always have to pay more for seafood though. The scallops tasted soft with a nice, crispy breading. I liked the mahi-mahi too--very fresh tasting. I did not taste the shrimp.PROS:-Refillable drinks-Plenty of seats (for a small place), some booths too-Food was served quickly-Good service overall-Food comes in to-go boxes (but not biodegradable ones)The one aspect of the visit that I disliked was that that they did not close the door even though it was windy outside. I was sitting by the door and got chills every so often. I got over it as the wind died down though.I'll be back... I need to try their spam musubi and saimin.Man! I love their food.... let me introduce something good ( personal opinion) :37. Spam for sure!!!!!29. Kalua & Lau Lau combo in one regular size15. Loco Moco in mini size ( for lunch )21. Chicken Katsu in regular size 46. Aloha SaiminMini size means one scope of rice andRegular size means two scopes of rice :)um... it's 2:13 in the morning and I'm hungry now while thinking of their food. SPAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I personally think L & L has better Spam than Island Flavor even tho IF is more popular :)Back to L & L, they also provide catering in Seafood, Beef, Pork, Chicken and side orders, from 10-13 servings as Small Pan, 20-25 servings as Half Pan and 45-50 servings as Full Pan. More info.:$32.99 for small family 4-6 people$49.99 for dinner family 6-8 peopleboth of them have choice of BBQ combination and Seafood combination. Accept Visa and MasterCardOpen Daily 10am - 10pmI've never been a huge fan of L&L, but they get you by in a pinch when you're craving Hawaiian food. On a recent visit for lunch my fella and I found ourselves at L&L and decided to share two plates. We went with the garlic chicken and the kalbi. Service was decent and our meals were brought out to us quickly despite being pretty busy during the lunch rush. The garlic chicken was intensely garlicky. Dare I say too garlicky and the kalbi was overcooked and dry. I didn't love anything I ate here. The shop is pretty small but there are a decent amount of tables inside. I'm not in any hurry to come back, but like I said, it's convenient when the mood strikes.
North End Pizza=This is a new spot to hit Centennial so of course I want to try it out.We ordered some take out pizza and it was LEGIT New York Pizza. Super thin and light crispy yet chewy crust with a good bread to cheese to sauce ratio. Definitely was surprising as I've been to a few places that claim they are NY style but wasn't quite there. We just went simple with some pepperoni so I can observe the crust better without overdoing the toppings. I enjoyed our pizza thoroughly and it is what I've had in NY.I wonder if they ship their dough in from NY. Most NY style west coast places that are legit do. Why does the dough have to come from there you ask? Well, the saying goes that the NY pizza made with the NY dough is unique by the NY water they put into it. I dunno the science behind it on what the unique regional water compounds do to the dough, but whatever- it's good so I EAT! We had a special Val Pak coupon for a pizza and wings. Wings were decent but love to get it with some more zing to the sauce.Short and sweet this time. I will be back since its right down the street from the house! YAY! I will be dining in since that is always a different experience than take away food.To be continued....but I think I found a pizza place to have a love affair with.So after a disastrous lunch @ Los Antojos, I had to redeem myself.  I read a few reviews about this place and it's near my end of town, so I decided to check it out on the way home from the office.When I arrived there, I was shocked to see that the entire strip mall that this place is in was empty!  It was kind of Twilight Zonish creepy....I took pics, check it out....just weird.Anyway, I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was spacious....I was expecting a small joint with a couple of tables.  I think the owners are from Boston....lots of Boston sports memorabilia on the walls.....and since it was dead, 3 of the workers were changing the channel to put on the Dodgers vs Red Sox game.  Cool!I ordered the 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza special with a Bottle of Water.  Total damage was $5.15....what a deal!The guy who took my order brought out the Pizza on paper plates.  The Pizza is thin sliced NY style Pizza.  The Pizza was pretty good.  Of course I folded it per standard MO for thin sliced Pizza.Overall, it was a good experience.  I'll have to come back to try their pepperoni and veggie pizzas.Will I return?  Of course!I've been eating here consistently pretty much once a month for the past year and I haven't been disappointed once.  I've tried the chicken tenders, garlic chips, Italian wedding soup and their house salad when I'm trying to "balance" the meal, but mostly, I go there when I'm craving their fantastic thin crust pizza.  I don't get anything fancy.... just a couple slices of cheese pizza.Picture the bite:  Perfectly chewy, crusty with just the right amount of char on the bottom + tangy sweet tomato sauce + ooey gooey cheese + grease.Tip:  I stress again that this is NOT for the greasy food haters.  Just don't step into there.  Just don't.Conclusion:  What are you waiting for?!  Go get some pizza!Wow after reading Daniel S. review of NEP well I just had to have some. So I got a large extra cheese on my half and the husband has some mess on his half like bacon peperoni and something else. Call me selfish & spoiled if you will. But this pizza is so good that I was mad at my husband for wanting his half. YOU READ CORRECT: It was so pretty and cheesy I simply didn't want him touching my pizza or breathing my air for that matter. I don't know maybe I had some girl moment or something but my husband had been at work all day and somehow I wished he could just go back to his office at city hall and leave me alone with the pizza. So I could watch cartoons and eat pizza ALONE with out him at all. He was just all in my space looking hungry and eating his half of the pizza. Pfff he don't even like pizza but yet here he is all in my box getting slice after slice munching talking bout...this is some good pizza. I'm glad your on yelp and you found this pizza. See you guys don't get to feel pity for him either because truth is he don't like yelp he says yelp takes my attention from him and that I check in all the time and give tips. Anyway did I say I wanted to slap him silly for opening my box of pizza? Next time he will get his own pizza. I'm not sharing my North End Pizza its to hot & good. No. He cant ever have any at all. ..........PfffffI have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout. Mon thru Sat: 11 am - 9 pmSun: 12 pm - 9 pmI was finally able to cross North End Pizza off my bookmark list when my husband and I came here for dinner recently. Located off the 215 and Durango, North Pizza is nestled inside a small shopping center that houses Braddah's and a local Gyro shop. 12" VEGGIE CALZONE ($12.99): Large enough to feed two and piping hot. Very bland in flavor though. The calzone crust was the biggest disappointment. It was thin and appeared to not have been dressed with any type of seasonings, to include olive oil. It was just plain ol' dough. I have to say, I expected better from a pizza joint and have had better calzones at standard local's bars. 2/5 CHICKEN WINGS x10 ($7.99): Served with only 1 choice of sauce but very satisfying for a hungry hunter like my husband. Husband said they were good, but still below BWW's. 4/5FRIES ($2.59): We paid and extra $0.50 to have garlic added. A-OK. 3/5VIBE: Is it just me, or do all these hole in the wall pizza places look exactly the same? Newspaper clippings, black and white photos of celebrities, and East Coast regalia line the walls. 3/5SERVICE: Staff are dressed super causal but are friendly enough. 3/5 Food came out within 15 minutes for everything, although it came out in succession. The manager okay'd this with us first. 3/5Worth a Return Visit?We paid $29 and some change for our meal, which I thought was pretty expensive for what we got. There are plenty of pizza spots closer to home, and the food quality really doesn't justify a second trip back. I'll keep looking for that perfect calzone!YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #241
The Groves Bar & Grill=My parents told me about this place and I really wanted to love it because they do, they met the owners and had a fabulous time there.  I wish I could say the same.I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked the bartender not to put Tabasco sauce in it but she didn't really acknowledge me.  So when my drink came and it was too hot to drink, I reminded her that I had asked for it without the Tabasco.  She informed me that its not made with Tabasco, it a special blend of habenaros and other spices.  Okay, it's my fault for not specifying that I don't like my Bloodys spicy.  Whatever.  I ask her to take it back and another woman, presumably the manager, tells her to tone it down with orange juice.  So she gives me the bloody back, with OJ and asks me if I like it, I said yes because I'm a push over and I didn't want to send the drink back again.  Seriously though, it tasted like something my friends and I concocted in 5th grade from everything in my parents liquor cabinet - the worst beverage, something you'd drink as a dare.  The food wasn't much better.  The potatoes were cold, not just room temperature but literally cold.I really want this place to make it, it has a lot of potential and I love supporting local businesses.  I hope they get their act together.I would never, ever write a review about a place I have not been until now.  My parents went to The Groves today and were so upset about their experience (and they do not use yelp) that I had to share the lack of customer service and terrible experience they had.  When my mother got her roast beef sandwich, it had a greenish tint to it.  After research the USDA website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Color_of_Meat_&_Poultry/index.asp#10 I found this can happen with that type of meat.  My mother was not aware of this but was completely disgusted. She told the server took her plate away. When she returned, she said the chef would not and had not touched it because she should be grateful that his knives are so clean and sharp that it actually oxidized the meat.  After reading the USDA website, this does not seem to be the case.  My mother was so grossed out she said she had lost her appetite.  The server did not even apologize and gave her some attitude.  When the bill came, they even charged them for it. My  parents did not raise a stink, they just left their money and will never be back. I worked in the industry for almost 4 years, anyone with half an ounce of customer service skills would have taken the food away, offered something different, and/or taken it off the bill or at least discounted the bill.  Instead of trying to do guest recovery they chose the "I know better than the customer" road and have a bad yelp review, two people  who influence a lot of diners in the area who will speak poorly about the place, and a frequent AZ visitor who will never go to this place.  All for what?  A few $$ and some swallowing of price. Oh well, plenty of other great places to eat in AZ.
Papaya Thai=well hello addiction. this deliciousness has become a regular in my belly. i have a thing for their yellow curry chicken. it is so flipping good. I used to eat at Chars Thai in Tempe but since they closed I haven't found a place I liked as well. But I can say I like papaya thai a bit more.  the chicken pieces are so moist and everything is cooked in the open kitchen to order so it is insanely fresh. i have tried the regular yellow curry and the mango yellow curry. i like the regular the best, but the mango is good too if you like fruit in your curry. the veggies are colorful and fresh and cooked just the way i like. not soggy but not too crispy. perf. they have a star scale on spicy, i go with a 4. and 4 basically means my nose will run a bit but i won't die. im willing to try the level 5, thats my next visit. keep in mind, i have a high tolerance for spice bc i love spicy food. if you're a wimp go with a 2. The space is clean and very comfortable, but very tacky in the usual asian restaurant way. it never seems to be too busy in there but i really hope business picks up because i want them to stay around. however, my addiction could probably support them. i have to note the sweet sticky rice dessert. i love it. i get the sticky rice with mango- it is bananas good. if you're in this part of town, it's definitely worth visiting. i would actually suggest it before most of the other places near here. munch up my curry friends.
Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro=Upon entering Forte on my initial visit, my first thought was that it was very European. This wasn't just because it was dead at lunch, as most restaurants in Europe are, but also because of the eccentric decor, dark lounge-like feel, off-the-beaten-path location, and genuine hospitality. That, and the fully stocked bar featuring very cheap glasses of delicious European wines (this I would find out later).I've over-ordered Forte at twice now, and though I can't say everything on the small plates menu is a winner, I can say I will keep coming back due to the aforementioned charming qualities and a few unique, inexpensive food highlights.The menu is broken down by European country (mostly Eastern) and their corresponding regional specialties. Under Russia, you won't find any caviar or borscht, but you will find adjarkski kachapurri, which goes down the hatch more easily than it rolls off the tongue ($6.99). This consists of a freshly baked bread loaf akin to a short, fat French baquette, that is hollowed in the center and stuffed with cheese, butter, and a raw egg. If I lost you at 'raw egg' then let me elaborate. The egg is mixed in table-side and is cooked by the heat of the bread, turning the dish into a protein-filled vegetarian friendly dish that will change your mind about Russian food. The flavor of the crusty bread combined with the egg and cheese reminded me of a quiche, yet this was unlike anything I've ever had. Extra (yet unnecessary) points for that!The section from Spain features a variety of chorizo sausages, amongst other items. We had the chistora and bilbao (each $2.50) which were fantastically charred and of fantastic value. These rivaled the Polish links at Costco as far as sausage bargains go, and were much better in my opinion.One note selections included the chicken skewers ($3.25 each), sauteed shrimp ($6.50), and the Bulgarian shopski served in an adorable clay pot ($6.99). Though there are a few minor flops, the thing I love most about this place is that you can try a lot of different foods you've probably never heard of, and, if you don't like them, you haven't spent enough to regret having given them a whirl.Coming back to the wine, I ordered a glass of Spanish Cosechero Blanco, which I was told cannot be found anywhere else in Vegas. Guess how much? $4.50!! The owner of the restaurant, who was our waitress on my second visit, and a gem in and of herself, offered to sell me a bottle at wholesale cost when I mentioned I liked it. So, I got a bottle for later that cost me just $8.20. That pretty much sealed the deal for me!This is a place you have to be experimental and open-minded to go to, but if you appreciate other cultures and want to join me on my mission to support the mom and pops in Vegas, then you'll have no trouble mustering the strength to go to Forte.Forte has an incredibly extensive menu that ranges from Spanish tapas to Russian and Bulgarian specialties, but I'll get to the food later because the MOST UNIQUE part of this restaurant are the numerous house Infused Vodkas: The "Garden Vodka" when used as a substitute for every ingredient in your Dirty Martini excluding dry vermouth, creates an Exceptionally tasty yet one of a kind Cocktail. And I'm not afraid to admit that I am definitely a cocktail snob ;DThere is raspberry infused vodka, potato infused vodka, various Grappas... The list goes on- you need to check this place out if only to discover the rest. In addition they have Banana Sambuca, and while it isn't infused in house it's definitely going to be a pleaser for adventurous types. The bar is very well stocked from recongnizable alchohol to imported beers and wine, and especially imported vodkas; So don't be afraid to get obscure, like small village in the Ukraine obscure.Service- One thing I couldn't understand are the bad reviews preceding mine! You cannot come here expecting your service to be like The Olive Garden or some other heinous food chain. Forte is definitely an intimate atmosphere if you go early or on a weeknight. Thursday night is quietest. Because like most Eastern European bars/ casual restaurants they like to get a little rowdy with music! It's apart of the culture. They are having Jazz on Mondays though FYI. Service is personable and casual, and perfect for what it is.The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. The egg boat had a name I won't even try to pronounce (see pictures), and is a dish I've never come across before. So happy I did! My favorites were the almond stuffed dates (Rich and Delightful) and the Feta Burek with its flaky delicate crust and creamy center- Mmmm. For dessert we had the biscuit cake which reminded us of Tiramisu at first glance, but had this incredibly soft texture and taste that did not resemble Tiramisu, and it was a sumptuous finish to a quite filling dinner. They have flavored cappuccinos as well! If I had to sum up this place in a sentence it would be:Don't miss out!!Forte is called "Forte" because that's exactly what their food is filled with - strength. They're a strong restaurant. To hold their fort down, outside of the restaurant are heavy-duty patio furnishings and a green metal gate with two different entrances. Just hop right in whichever side, left or right, and open the darkly tinted door. A server, Robert, greeted us and told us to choose a seat anywhere. There were candles to light the dining room. There was one other group that we saw and they were chatting in Russian. Apparently, the dining room is split in half and there are other dining tables further back and to the left side of the restaurant because the server went back there several times with food and drink.I highly recommend trying the Selyodka, Adjarski Khachapurri, Thracian Cheese Clay Pot, and their Pelmeni Dumplings.Selyodka: definitely fish and potatoes done right with some olive oil, dill and great pairing of flavors that really wow youAdjarski Khachapurri: Refer to Frank W.'s review for a description. It's a great description. This one was delicious and the bread just sensationalThracian Cheese Clay Pot: brimming with seasoning, but not overwhelming. So deliciousPelmeni Dumplings: European jiaozi... mmm...Very European vibe... food was excellent. I will definitely be back again!Incredible meal and experience!   Bookmarked forever, I finally made it happen with a group because I wanted to try several dishes and needed lots of people.  My best friend from middle and high school came in from Boston for a short weekend visit.  Last year when she visited we went to Komol with Carmin H. and Cole R., and they wanted to join in on our Forte dinner with me and Eric R.  I made reservations for 7:00 and we were seated in the back corner of this artistic and funky restaurant and bar.I ordered prosecco, Carmin H. and Nithya V. ordered angry ginger lemonade cocktails, Cole R. had a giant dark beer of some sort, and Eric R. got sangria.  We then ordered in waves and the food came out quickly and staggered perfectly.  Our server (Christina or Kristina) was fantastic.  She offered us a bread basket that was replenished upon request, served with olive oil and Bulgarian spices.The plates were so intricate and pretty, all the way from Bulgaria.  Our first bite was the Shopska salad, with cucumber, tomato, and lots of Bulgarian feta.  Next was the squid stuffed with baby squids cooked in its own ink served on hot rice.  I loved the rice that came with it, a squeeze of lemon...delicious.  The squid itself was more room temperature but definitely tasty and unique.  On our server's recommendation, we ordered potato dumplings with fried onions.  I was shocked to discover that NIthya V. like my husband did not like potatoes!  Two crazy people exist!  Nevertheless, I went with the rec and all 5 of us ate one.  Both potato haters enjoyed these dumplings!!!!  They were scrumptious.Eric R. ordered one of his fave things, hot meat stuffed grape leaves, also recommended by our grape leaves expert friend Mamie P.  They were very good.  Finally the dreamy bread (kachapuri) came, shaped like a boat filled with cheese, topped with egg, swirled at the table.  I cut this haphazardly into 5 pieces for the table and it was so hot, no wonder the egg cooked on it!  Sooooo good.After watching Triple D, Nithya V. wanted to try the Thoracian clay pot.  We ordered 2 for the table, one with meat and one without.  I ate the no meat one and it was amazing.  The serrano pepper was legit with it, and I liked the combo of the cooked egg, tomato, peppers, and feta.  This is a must order.  Lastly, one of Eric R.'s favorite dishes came out, beef stroganoff.  We have only had this on egg noodles, so the dumpling/ravioli style made this dish unique.  I could taste liquor in the sauce, which can only be a good thing.Overall, every bite of food I put in my mouth was tasty, fresh, and unique.  I would absolutely return with a group of friends to try more.  The vibe is funky, the service great, and the food special - you won't find this anywhere else in Vegas.The gf and I finally hit Forte - it's relatively close to our house ( about 2 miles ) but just now made it to the top of the "new try" list.Went on a Tuesday night and the place had a decent crowd.  Quirky looking place and kinda strange lay-out of the tables but ok by us.  Servers were pleasant and attentive.  The gf was really focused on one of the servers hair style, " Should I get my hair like that?"  - must have asked me 4 times, hey !  I'm here to eat, not look at hair !We avoided liquor since it was a weekday.  They provided a mini-loave of bread with olive oil and they recommended you add a special Bulgarian seasoning mix to the oil - the gf loved it - I also liked it though I felt she added to much of the herb mixture to the oil.We ordered:Beef Stroganoff Ragu ( $8 ) - Holy cow, the ragu was perfect !  the pasta shells were like little cups to hold the ragu - also very good but we wish they gave us more !Chebureki ( $3.50 ) -two beef filled fried dumplings - basically a turnover.  perfectly fried, nice flaky crust, a little light on filling but what do you want for $3.50 ??Bulgarian Mixed grill ( $10 ) - pork grilled three ways - two are sausage, one a patty.  Different seasoning and texture on all three .  came with a side of white beans and a salad similar to cole slaw but better - overall, an excellent plate of food !Stuffed grape leaves( $5) - each one had a sausage in it.  I enjoyed but the gf prefers the middle eastern version that includes rice.I wanted to avoid the sweets but I was being hounded so we ordered the rice pudding( I believe $4 ) and the biscuit cake ( $5).  The biscuit cake was very good - reminded us of tiramisu but the liquor flavor is lighter.  I'm not a rice pudding fan but I liked the generous amount of cinnamon on top of the pudding that gave it a nice kick.a few pics attachedwe'll definitely returnWhy the heck did it take me so long to come here?  Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the "Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.Our favorite dish was the "Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :PThe "Thracian Clay Pot" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in "Game of Thrones" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the "Bulgarian Mixed Grill" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!The best little hole in the wall in Vegas!Came here with a group of girlfriends from work, one being from Russia. We had made a reservation ahead of time, for which I was glad. At 7 pm, the place was pretty packed, but began clearing out a bit around 8 pm. Here's what was on our table:Adjarski Khachapurri - giant boat bread with soft cheese and a cracked egg. This was amazing. The flavor wasn't overdone and it was fresh out of the oven!Beef Strogannoff Ragu - we all know what this is and it was awesomeVereniki and Pelmeni - two different types of dumplings with sour cream. They were not overly greasy and paired with the sour cream...amazing!.We ordered some of their signature house drinks and a bottle of wine. I have to give the food 5 stars. It was so nice to go to a place where the tapas wasn't pre-made and sitting under heat lamps getting greasy and dried out (*cough* Firefly *cough*). The food was not overly seasoned to cover up the lack of quality...like a lot of places do. The vegetables and fresh seasonings (scallions, parsley, etc.) served with each dish really complimented the home cooking and quality ingredients. The service was slow, but due to everything being fresh out of the oven, it was more than acceptable. Plus, in Euro culture, you take your time to eat and talk. Why is everyone in such a hurry?! We stayed here for over 4 hours listening to the live music and chatting away. It was a really nice atmosphere, and we all left happy.After many visits here I am thrilled to discover many delicious dishes from several regions around the world, along with a darn tasty spice blend, great atmosphere, and excellent service.Everyone starts with house-made bread, the Bulgarian spice mix and olive oil.  The spice blend (15 herbs and spices) is for sale in cute jars for $6 each.  This is a great gift for friends or for yourself!  I have even used these spices to coat raw cashews (using coconut oil) which make for a great snack!I have successfully shared the joy of Forte with friends, family, and other visitors alike, from vegetarian to carnivore.  Last night I learned that Forte could make Eric R. a fan of octopus, which he never enjoyed before.  My friends have really enjoyed the sausages made in house, but since I don't eat pork I am not able to tell you how they taste.Dishes I have tried:Shopska Salad: basic salad covered in shredded Bulgarian feta.  Tasty but simple.Fetamelon Salad: special in spring 2014. Huge portion of watermelon squares, Bulgarian feta, mint, and chopped red onion.  Very refreshing but needs people for sharing!Calamares Rellenos en su Tinto: Stuffed squid marinated in its own ink on Spanish herb rice. Room temperate squid, tasty and different.Octopus in Olive Oil: super tender octopous on top of warm rice with green onions, served with lemon.  Truly outstanding though simple, converted a non-octopus eater.Beef and Lamb Confit: beef and lamb that melts in the mouth cooked in its own juices and fat on top of the Uzbeki Plov rice - I ordered the rice dish separately once with a veg friend but just get it here.  The meat juices coat the rice, which has dried cranberry and cornichons.  Love this dish!Adjarski Khachapurri: bread boat with cheese topped with raw egg at table that cooks on the bread because it is so hot.  This is very delicious but hard to split, so at most 2 people should share one or it loses the fun.  Sooooo delicious.Thracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!Stuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.  Dip the homemade bread in the sauce after the dolmas are gone!Beef stroganoff ragu: wild mushroom dumplings topped with a beef strogranoff ragu is one of Eric R.'s faves (he loves stroganoff in general).  Very rich sauce.Vareniki: my favorite simple housemade dumplings stuffed with potato, topped with fried diced onions.  So good it converted 2 non-potato eaters!Biscuit cake: dessert for David S.'s birthday.  Honey biscuits, mascarpone, walnuts, chocolate - tasty!  I would rather eat more savory food than sweets though if I had the option! :)There is more for me to try but I never leave without flavors dancing in my palate.5 of us met again to try a new restaurant and try different food.  I have had Forte bookmarked for about 2 years but I never seemed to think of this place.  We were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.We were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.Our things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish "nacho" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.We were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.  We also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.We had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.Next came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.We closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a "traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.Then dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as "decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.I thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.  I might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.As always, good company made lunch a much better time!I arrived at Forte with high expectations after reading all the rave reviews from Yelpers I admire. The seating we chose wasn't the best, since the chairs weren't comfortable and the table too high. What we won't sacrifice for good lighting for our food pictures. With a semi-large group of diners, we were able to sample a good number of menu items. We started with the house pita bread, which I didn't love. A little on the doughy side for my taste. We decided on a good sampling from the options on the menu and waited with anticipation. As others have noted, the timing of our food didn't come out as spaced out as we would have liked and refills came only after a few reminders, I still enjoyed quite a bit about our meal here. My favorites from lunch were the Calamares rellenos en su tinta, Thracian clay pot, sofiiska baniza, Chebureki and Adjarski khachapurri. I would return for any of these menu items in a heartbeat. My least favorite parts of the meal were the sugary sweet and drippy baklava, the overcooked and overly sweet almond stuffed dates and uninventive and incrediby generic-tasting Spanish chorizo chips. The Bulgarian lamb was just ok, I can't see myself ordering this again and the biscuit cake, although a favorite at our table was a little too dense and sweet-tasting for my particular palate. I was on the fence on how many stars to give Forte, debating between 3 and 4 stars. Based on the number of items we ordered, I notice that the ones I didn't like outnumbered those that I did enjoy, but I would return to enjoy those few items I loved alone.This place is excellent. We're always looking for something next to try, and I'm glad we tried this place out. It's so different and unique in comparison to other restaurants in town. As soon as we walked in, most of the crowd was speaking several different languages. Perfect sign for me - I knew it was going to be good. We had some of the Russian beer - served with beautiful clay mugs. Dat bread - the bread is delicious. It's so fluffy, yet filling. We were starving when we walked in, so I was very grateful for this. The clay pot -  very different. It wasn't my favorite, but the sausage in it was very tasty. The shrimp saute -  very very good. It had a very good white wine sauce and fresh lemon. Dip your bread in it. And my favorite - the beef stroganoff. So so so so good!!! Probably the best I've ever had in my life. Served with delicious mushroom filled dumplings. It was very busy, so expect a wait. The service was good, they just seemed under staffed. Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go back!!It been while since wrote a five star review. Forte is a place that exceeded my expectations not only the food but overall experience was very unique. Lot of things that stood out for me. The fact that small family run business, off the strip not in mega hotel, very reasonable price, interior design screaming personality, and am NOT fan of Tapas style of eating but Forte made me FAN. I came to Forte with my cousins from the 808 visiting also avid yelpers and enjoy food like myself. The few times get together over the years here or back home about trying something new. I was excited too get bookmark off my list and just enjoy time around Ohana.I knew the interior design has personality from watching the episode on DDD. What you see on television can never prepare you for the real thing. I loved every bit of it! Really small restaurant maybe holds 50 people, the bar area is also small just one row of bar stools, and the dining room is divided into two sections. Each one having its own personality. Lot of bright colors, all kinds of different tables, booths, and even the chairs few different ones so really nothing uniform or the same look around from any angle. The artwork (assume someone did) lot of Day of the Dead influence not that came as surprising since european melting pot of food. One artwork that thankfully my cousins pointed out they did Guy Fieri head with the show logo and his signature on the wall. Hell of cool! It literally feels like walking into another world once open the front door.The food thankfully hanging out with the right peeps or Ohana this night. I got too try lot of the menu. We ordered decent amount of food for three of us. Six items in all. To go back to my earlier point reasonable price our bill was $60 before tip and we were stuffed. Two of us had drink so the bill would have been cheaper if not in the drinking mood. The HH price for drinks on all of them. Steal of deal. I stuck with beer but my cousin had one of the vodka drinks. I pass on trying but she told me was very tasty. Home-made chicken soup was pleasantly surprised! We all thought ok on cold night get some soup. It might be bland your basic soup. Instead this little bowl packed bowl full of goodness. The broth was really tasty had depth, ample amount of shredded chicken in it, nice portion of vegetables, and really tasted like fresh Home-made soup. On chilly day could get super size bowl be soup Happy!Stuffed Grape Leaves was really good. I really enjoyed the filling. The ground pork or assume pork had great seasoning and flavor. The sauce brought everything together along with the grape leaves. Beef Stroganoff Ragu was another winnah. Again one of those dishes just give me super size plate be happy with one dish. The pasta dumplings was on point between the filling and the rich, thick, creamy, hearty stroganoff meat sauce. It heavy pasta dish but so good.Spanish Rice (not sure forgot called) but talk about bowl of rice. It look more like paella without all the seafood or the saffron. It was popping with flavor. Not protein in it. Talk about flavors. It was really good rice.The star of the show the one dish excited about Bulgarian Mixed Grill. Two dishes that was featured on the show. This was the one most looking forward too and past on the clay pot dish. Awesome. Not only the three different meats. I enjoy the three different sides. The beans and the red pepper something perfect compliment. If one dish NEED too order if first time, many times, or only time this is the one. The only dish that not fan of was the Octopus in Olive Oil. Yay it has really nice depth of Olive Oil had the Octopus. Saying sometimes can have too much of good thing. Olive Oil was the killer for me. The rice that served with was bland not very good dish overall.Outside of the one dish everything was awesome. All the food felt like had great depth of flavor. LOVE LOVE the atmosphere very much different then most restaurants in Vegas. Great spot to hang out with family or friends over drinks, some food, and weekend they even have live music. The service was fabulous. Looking forward too my next visit!!!I enjoyed quite the delicious dinner at this quaint little place. Offering a variety of cuisine from the European continent, but I settled for the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, not served over noodles, but pelmeni stuffed with mushrooms for $9.Before the stroganoff arrived, the meal started with some moist house Russian bread with a side of extra virgin olive oil and some red spices, mostly made of paprika. The Russina wheat bread was great and eaten with the dressed up olive oil was bliss. The Stroganoff was quite the treat. First of all, the ragu was very well made. It was thick and rich with a great flavor: a deep rich flavor that took time to develop, and some skill to make. Somebody had a great recipe hidden back there.  The pelmeni's mushrooms inside were tender, very well seasoned, and had a great natural flavor. Also, the pelmeni's itself, the shell, had a great chewiness in a very good way. No doubt they were cooked well. I'm telling you, I could of eaten a mountain of these. I also tried tasters from a Bulgarian Mixed Grill which was quite good. Nataliya, the server was absolutely amazing. She not only was very well verse in Forte's cuisine and its individual preparations, but she reserved extreme patience. She was very prompt and always had a great smile on her face.If you are looking for something different and great, check this place out.I was so disappointed in this place! Went to Vegas with Bear and we went to this location because we wanted Tapas and it was fairly close to the strip. The place is dark and cozy and the service is pretty nice. But the food was terrible. Absolutely godawful. We ordered the stroganoff on fries. The fries were great but the stroganoff was with ground beef and had a really thin broth like sauce which they had been very stingy with. Stroganoff usually comes with a creamy sauce and I thought they fries were gonna be covered with them but nah. Still this was the least terrible, can I say that? I don't want to say the best. We ordered some sort of dumpling that came looking like a Pirozhki. The crust was nearly burnt, super crunchy and inside was just a very firm and rubbery meetball, no sauce, no seasoning, nothing. We ordered the Lamb chop lollipop and we got two really big lamb chops, barely seasoned, the texture was all wrong. We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce. We got 5 pieces of hard rubbery shrimp, swimming in a sour lemon sauce. Even though the dishes were very very small, we didn't finish a single one. We didn't finish the shrimp, the second dumpling was left untouched, the lamb chops we're left, the only thing we ate we're the fries. Never again!!I was down here in Vegas for business just for a day and needed a good place to take my clients out. I'm always on the look out for European restaurants. You can always find your Italian and many French and you might find a German place, but that's about it in the USA. So, I was so surprised to find this Forte' restaurant specializing in Eastern European cuisine with some Spanish thrown in. Quite an odd combination but if it works, why not? As it turns out, this was one of my  fave restaurant of all the places I've tried in Las Vegas. I was trying to stay away from the Strip area. Forte' is located in a pretty nondescript strip mall near the intersection of Rainbow and Flamingo. Apparently, Forte' was featured on the TV show Diners and Dives and gained some publicity from that.Upon entering, we are greeted by a nice server. Inside, you sure can't tell you're in Vegas, that's for sure. The interior reminds me more of a place in Berkeley CA, with an odd mish mash of art work hung on walls painted with Picasso like murals. The whole interior is exactly opposite of what you might see in a color coordinated and professionally designed chain restaurant. Slick and chic, this is not .... Which makes it all the more interesting. We are seated at a smallish round table, more like a cocktail table than a dinner table. I guess the menu does say tapas! That being the Spanish part.Looking over the menu I see Russian soups, fresh baked flatbreads, one served with foie gras even! Then there is a selection of Spanish Tapas, including Spanish cheeses and sausages like chorizo. The rest of the menu offers food from Bulgaria, Russia, Hungary, Serbia and Georgia. I was more interested in the Eastern European selections.Fresh baked bread was brought to our table right away and drink orders taken. I was so interested in looking over the unusual menu, I just had water to start. The chilled water was served in Vodka bottles! It made me think I was in Russia downing a whole bottle of Vodka with my meal! That was amusing! Along with the bread you get a plate with olive oil and instead of the usual Italian style with Balsamic Vinegar in the oil, we were treated to a heavenly mixture of house mixed spices from a cute little carved wooden container on the table spooned into the oil. Holy Moly! Was that good! I had to stop myself from eating too much bread or I'd be too full to eat the rest of the food!So, for appetizers we started with the Georgian boat shaped bread filled with cheeses and an egg. This was one dish featured on TV. ($10.00). It was good , but a little on the doughy side and very chewy. We also had the Borsht, Russian beet soup. ($6.50) That was wonderful and filled with lots of beets and goodies, plus a broth where you could tell the person making this really knew what they were doing. Get this one! I had the Beef Stroganoff ($9.50) and my second client had the Hungarian Goulash ($9.00). Both were so well executed and in perfect balance with spices. My other client had the Serbian Mixed Grill ($16.00), which was a mix of 5 different house ground and stuffed sausages. All were quite tasty! My third client at the table, he had the Bulgarian Easter Lamb, ($14.00) and that was so tender, no knife needed and the lamb au jus reduction was heavenly! I could just drink a cup of that! For drinks we tried some of the house flavor infused vodkas. Great interesting flavors of fruits and at 80 proof!The service was very attentive and couldn't ask for more. The servers will explain all the dishes and drinks, cause unless you're Bulgarian, you might not have had these menu items before. The prices here are reasonable .... Unless you get carried away with drinks like we did .... Sort of.I'll will return here every time I'm down here in Vegas, this was quite the interesting find! I see they even serve European breakfasts here, that might be interesting! Next time for sure, I'll be back.
Wet Willie's=08/11/13Sisters, BIL, and I arrived an hour before the concert next door at Uptown Amphitheatre, so we stopped at Wet Willie's for drinks and a bite to eat.  After IDs were checked, we sat ourselves.  (No one greeted us save security, and everyone else were seating themselves...)  The colorful murals that adorned the bar wall with all the daiquiri flavor machines made up for the initial disappointment caused by the wafts of stale beer that greeted me at the door.  With so many machines already churning out varieties of daiquiris, I knew that I wouldn't be able to try them due to corn allergy (corn syrup), so I asked our server MJ if they had mojitos (no- discontinued daiquiri flavor; I was looking for the actual drink, anyway), or wine (no).  Just bottled beer (standard domestics- Coors, Michelob, Bud, and YuengLing lager).  "Mixed drinks" consisted of vodka or Jack Daniels.  Sisters ordered Bahama Mama and Pina Colada, BIL had a Yuengling, and I ended up with a Michelob Ultra- not bad, a little too bland, but no bitterness or aftertaste, and it went well with the pepperjack cheeseburger, with bacon I ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wet-willies-charlotte?select=cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA#cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA  The bun top had a dusting of cornmeal, so I set it aside, but the rest of the burger was delicious!  Cooked medium, had a nice kick from the pepperjack cheese (older sis found it too spicy), and had nice flavors and textures (good bread!)  Bacon was a bit too greasy, but I didn't pat them down with a napkin to absorb some of the oil like I normally do, so it was partly my fault.  Baby sis claimed them eventually, after everyone else devoured the chips and salsa app they had ordered.  BIL had asked for a Philly cheesesteak (made with grilled onions and mushrooms and topped with a homemade cheese sauce), but MJ must've forgotten it when I asked him about the beverage selections.  No worries, since the rush order didn't take long (two to three minutes?), was hot (not cold at all, considering it arrived so soon after the discrepancy was mentioned, and it was complimentary (due to the order being forgotten).  The fries here were TERRIFIC!  We all raved about them, and for a non-gourmet restaurant, the fries here were some of the best I've ever bitten into (delicious flavor and perfectly-crisped)!  The plastic daiquiri beverage glasses had Wet Willie cartoon-comic graphics on them, so I asked MJ if we could take them home with us, and he said yes.  My sisters didn't want to keep them, so I now have souvenirs for this Charlotte trip!  :)Could've been 3.5 stars if the beverage selections were larger, and please work on eradicating the stale beer smell!  Women's restroom was clean and stylish though, considering WW could be considered a dive bar...  Perhaps the restroom is part of The Comedy Zone, which WW shares the floor with?  p.s.  There is an overlook/patio where people can dine and listen in to the concerts next door.  You won't be able to see the stage, but you'll get to people-watch!  (I wonder how we all looked awashed with the lights from the stage?)  People smoke around the concession stands and restrooms below, though, just so you know...
Bar+Bistro @ The Arts Factory=I haven't been to Bar + Bistro since I accidently sat down thinking the restaurant was still Paymon's and was too embarrassed to leave.  It was all Italian food back then, and not particularly good.  But I heard the menu changed for the better so I decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did.I tried the grilled cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries and tomato soup ($7) and the B+B slider ($5).  The grilled cheese portion was good for the price.  Five bucks is a little steep for one slider, but you can tell they are high quality.  The food was delectable.  I really liked that the ketchup for the fries was mixed with a little bit of sriracha, making it spicy.  The sliders were super cute and the B+B slider was good with Wagyu beef, Manchego cheese, and pickled shallots.  Service was excellent.  They kept the same décor as Tinoco's, which Paymon's kept as well.  Basically, tables shaped like painting palettes with splashes of paint and holes in them that used to store the ketchup, salt, etc.  I guess it makes sense, being that this is the Arts District and all.  But they should use the holes in the tables to store something.  It's just weird seeing them empty.They seem to have a decent happy hour M-F from 5-7pm.  $1 PBR is the focus but they seem to have specials on their inventive drinks.  I rarely come downtown for drinks but I may have to check it out.You know how it is when you live in Vegas -- everyone comes to visit, and expects you to take them someplace "cool." Pressure!Yesterday I had two different friends in town, who both wanted a piece of me. One is a 7-months-pregnant Conservative Christian from Arkansas, and the other is a traveling art-nude model with a wild '70s bush and a predilection for men 40+ years her senior. Where to take them that would appeal to both??I wanted someplace fun, unpretentious and off-Strip (both of my friends have the good sense to despise the overpriced pretentiousness of places with all-caps names like MIX, STACK, FIX, DOUCHE...oh wait, the Health Dept. shut that one down). Anyhoo, I asked around and finally lit on Bar + Bistro...which turned out to be AWESOME! This was in the middle of the humid monsoon season (8.1.11), but we sat on their fabulous patio anyway -- and it was GREAT! They have a huge patio all strung up with Christmas lights, facing out onto Charleston Blvd...but it's not loud at all, and very pleasant. I always go for atmo over food quality...but it wasn't just the atmo that was kickass here -- every single thing we ordered was FANTASTIC! I had the chopped Latin salad (delish and filling), my girlfriends had paella (bomb) and pizza mergherita (ditto), plus we split an order of mahi mahi tacos (fabulous) and the lavash/hummus they brought us was also incredible. I really can't speak highly enough of the food here...and the prices were totally reasonable.The waitstaff was super badass, too. One of the waiters, a super cool guy named Arash, even came and had a beer with us. We had a total blast, and this was on a Monday night when the place was totally dead! I can only imagine how much fun it is during First Friday or their Saturday night poetry jam. I will DEFINITELY be coming back here!P.S. They also have a fairly extensive tapas menu...and I recommend this place a thousand times over Firefly. MUCH better atmo.I've had Bar + Bistro bookmarked for about a year. Finally went two weeks ago and have been there three times since.I highly suggest ordering a latte with breakfast. A fabulous surprise was the crispy pancakes. There are about five items on the breakfast menu. The omelet was okay. I probably wouldn't revisit it.The steak salad at lunch is wonderful. For $12 you get a filling assortment of pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, eggs, avocado, tomatoes, and grilled steak. For dinner I tried their version of sorullitos. Holy cow. This is the reason I returned twice. These things are the distant, beautiful cousins to the ones you get in Puerto Rico. The cousin everyone wants, but no one can have, because, well, it's family and that'd be wrong. But here, it's okay. Eat the corny fried thing with the secret spicy sauce. Guess the thing that puts Bar + Bistro above the rest is the atmosphere. It's real. Authentic. It has hurricane furniture, the kind that doesn't move when a storm hits because it's the real deal, welded together by an artist. My dad welds. Service can be spotty but I don't mind because I've got stars in my eyes.Bar + Bistro is what community tastes like, looks like.Add B+B to the current vegan explosion going on in Vegas! Their chef recently revealed a new and extensive vegan menu.  I was super excited to check it out, and I was not disappointed.First, there are at least 3 or 4 FULL PAGES of vegan menu, including tapas, salads, sandwiches, entrees and yes, even desserts.  No afterthought of inclusion here -- this was a carefully thought-out and well-designed nod to vegan and v-friendly diners.  I went with my foodie vegan pal, and we tried lots of tapas: Daiya cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers (yum!), pomegranate-sauced plantains (yum!), fried artichokes (yum!), paella (yum!), and grilled veggie tacos (OMFG double yum!).  The paella was more of a risotto, but still tasty, and a HUGE serving considering it was a "tapa."  The star of the evening was the plate grilled tacos, which came with jicama slaw, pico de gallo and some mango salsa, too, I believe.  Each component was delish and combined, the flavors all really worked together.  Sadly there were only 3 little tortillas (so there was lots of leftover filling, which we ate anyway).  I cold have eaten 10 of these! Another nice surprise was the VERY reasonably-priced wine list! We had a nice bottle of garnacha to accompany our dinner, and it was only $28.  Several other choices under $30 as well! We decided on the chocolate cake (served with a glass of rice milk) for dessert.  Way too full to each get our own!  It took quite awhile to arrive (I actually think our waiter forgot to put in the order), but we were enjoying our wine and a lovely evening on the patio, so no big.  The cake was also delish.  Molten on the inside, and the cool rice milk was a nice foil to the warm chocolate.  The texture of the cake was a little spongy and dry, but I would definitely order it again.I can't wait to go back and try more stuff! I put up my pictures from the night, but they are pretty poor quality due to the low lighting.  Better pix next time!Our server was very nice, but a bit slow and absent minded. That was the only real negative.  Otherwise, everything was excellent; and our dinner with 5 tapas, dessert, a bottle of wine, sparkling water, and tip was just over $100.  Good deal!You would think that finding a place to eat dinner on Christmas Even in Las Vegas is not difficult, right? Well, if you're not looking for a buffet or some overpriced casino restaurant, it's actually a lot harder than you think. Sure, Vegas is a 24-hour city for tourists, but apparently locals prefer to eat important holiday meals at home. Who knew?Luckily, Bar + Bistro's kitchen was open December 24 and we were able to dine in on some small plates while catching up with friends over drinks. I've been here before for a cocktail and this is a cool local bar. It's never too terribly crowded inside and there's a very inviting patio out front. Although they had a fire going, it was a little too chilly to sit out there. Inside was toasty warm and a glass of wine was calling my name. For dinner we ordered plantains, carnitas tacos and potatoes bravas. In retrospect, I should have gotten the sangria to go with this Spanish cuisine, but as I mentioned before, it was cold outside and I wanted a non-icy drink to warm up. The sangria here is especially good, so definitely order it if you're at the bar. Portions were just right - we had a heavy lunch just a few hours earlier and just wanted something small. Carnitas tacos were so good! Would eat three more plates of them! Plantains and potatoes were good, very standard tapas fare. Thank you, Bar + Bistro for being open Christmas Eve and serving food, too! Hit the spot!I was hoping to have a knock-your-socks-off experience here.  I did not. I love downtown Vegas, and I am a fan of any business that is going to help the area grow.  So kudos for that. However, when you have alcapurrias, bacalaitos, mofongo, and paella on the menu, I'm going to judge you harshly if you can't deliver.  Let me preface by saying that I knew going into this place that everything on the menu was going to be the 'fancy-pants' version of traditional Spanish and Caribbean foods, so there's some leeway for artistic interpretation.  I said leeway, not 'screw tradition, I do what I want'.  I've had alcapurrias, bacalaitos, and mofongo on the beaches of Puerto Rico, so ordering this was a way to have a culinary nostalgia trip for me.  Nope, no such luck.  The alcapurrias were bland, the bacalaitos were soggy, and the mofongo was oily.  For those of you not familiar with these foods, they are *not* supposed to be that way.  Now, the paella, I'm thinking will redeem the menu.  It's a seafood paella, with mussels, shrimp, clams, bits of whitefish (I believe cod but don't quote me), and veggies and rice.  Traditional paella takes at least a good half hour to bake, and it should only be made when it's ordered.  Otherwise, if it sits too long it can get gummy and chewy.  So I'm thinking ok, let the tapas settle and have some chit-chat with my friend while the paella is ready.  Sidebar:  The chef was out in the dining room nearly the entire time I was there and he was having a loud conversation with a patron about sources, marketing, mixology, and all sorts of other stuff which I'm sure would be interesting if you were part of the conversation, but honestly, I don't want to listen to all that while I'm trying to have a pleasant dinner with a friend.  Get back into your kitchen and make sure your chefs are on point with their food and your servers are on point with their service.Surprisingly, the paella comes out in about ten minutes from the time of ordering.  Uhm, what, ok.  So it looks to have a fair amount of seafood in the rice and veggies and I'm thinking it looks promising.  I taste it.  It's salty.  And not just salty because it's seafood and there's salt in seafood anyway.  No, I mean, salty to the point that I'm drinking water to wash out the salt.  The actual consistency of the paella was ok (no mushiness so good job there) but I couldn't get past the salt to appreciate the seasoning.  I want to be a fan.  I really do.  But I'm not.I'd like to preface by saying that I plan on placing a call to the manager to report the experience I had here. While some people take joy in obliterating the reputations of businesses with one-star ratings on Yelp, I don't like giving only one star, especially for a locally-owned, non-franchisee establishment with good food. We just don't have enough of those here and they should be cherished. However, the experience I had at Bar+Bistro, combined with lackluster visits since writing my last review really leaves me no choice but a one-star review. The food is as great as everyone says. It's creative and delicious and consistently so-I've only had one dish here that I didn't care for. The drinks are great and they have decent happy hour specials. As far as food and drink goes, they have it right.The service ranges on a scale from apathetic to unwarranted hostility, the latter of which was received on my latest visit. I've sat at the bar most times when I've come here and have found the bartenders to be more interested in talking to friends and more regular customers than taking a simple drink order from me. Most times I felt like a burden sitting at the bar, taking up valuable time from the bartender that they could be using to discuss who Biffy is boffing with their friends at the other end of the bar. I'm so sorry it's asking so much for you to place a cup under the faucet of the sangria jug and take the three seconds to pour me a beverage. Perhaps I should've hopped over the bar and done it myself as it would've been less of an inconvenience.My latest and very last visit (4/22/12) involved Sunday brunch with three other friends. Our waiter was nice enough-friendly and personable, a little forgetful, but seeing as he was the only one in the dining area for a bit I was ready to let that slide. Thus began theme one of the day: retardedly long lapses of time. Two parties were seated next to us maybe 15 minutes after we sat down and before we even received refills on our coffee, their food came out. So we waited. And waited. No food. No sign of our waiter. Just four very hangry girls in various stages of hangover waiting on food that was possibly being sourced in another state. We stopped the waitress serving the table next to us, to ask for refills and find out about our food since our waiter was nowhere to be found and with great insincerity she put her hands together, smiled and said "Let me get your waiter!" Thus began the coexisting theme: unnecessarily hostile service. Why did she have to say it like that? Even though it wasn't her fault she should have apologized and non-passive aggressively offered to get our waiter for us. Our waiter arrives back after another long lapse of time to tell us that our ticket was lost and our food was being made right now. The food starts to arrive about 20 minutes later in ridiculous intervals of 5-10 minutes between dishes and there we are, nearly an hour in and only 3/4 of our party has food, which is now getting cold as we wait for the last dish. What happened to the party of 8 that had arrived after us you ask? Oh, they had FINISHED THEIR MEAL AND LEFT. I finally asked for the manager and after a small, fragile woman who could not process my complaint was sent over to our table, the waitress who had made it clear that we were an annoyance to her, was sent over to share in the snarkiest of tones what a busy day it was for them, how they were so disabled with only one chef on staff and how poppin' the patio was.  Yes, the busyness of the patio was preventing the food I ordered over an hour ago from getting to the table. Her attitude was completely hostile and she treated us like we were making a big deal out of nothing. The apology she gave after the list of excuses was insincere and anything but apologetic.  Then she continued to insult me by offering to take my  $2 coffee off the tab. How kind of her to offer such a generous discount! After my strong suggestion that she remove my entree from the tab, she did. The delay in food to table I could let go. The inattentiveness of our friendly waiter, I could also let go. The lack of consistent refills, forgiven. The utter lack of concern and boorish behavior of the waitress/manager/restaurant muscle was unacceptable. She treated us like we were being unreasonable and like it was US who had made the mistake when in fact the only mistake we'd made was ordering food and expecting it to arrive before Memorial Day. Her disgusting approach to the situation was unprofessional and an embarrassment to the restaurant industry. I am really sad to have had such a terrible experience at a restaurant that really sets a local standard as far as food goes.  I will not be back. I will not make any more referrals. This place is dead to me and I can only hope to erase the horrible experience I had here with a substantially better experience at another restaurant more deserving of my business.Reflective of visit May 2012.Do not go, do not go, do not go, do not go. I can't say that enough. If I could give a negative rating I would.Decor: I've got too much to talk about to waste characters here.  But to note:  I am handicapped, and there is no elevator. I understand it is an old building, so actually not their fault, but it was the first omen of a bad night and should be noted for any handicapped patrons who may be reading this review. Even to get to the inside dining room, there is no ramp, only stairs, albeit 2 steps, but still.Service: Ha! Negative 5 stars. We were there as guests of a sizable private party, and seated outside and served buffet style. Many of us, including my husband, approached the outdoor bar instead of going back inside to the main. There were two bartenders, a female and male. He tried to order from the male. "Do you have Malibu rum?" Reply: "No." "Okay, what about a 7&7?" Reply: "Nope." "Fine then, just a plain Coke." Reply: "We don't have Coke." "Okay... what do you have?" The bartender starts to lift up bottles to show my husband. One of which is rum, not Malibu, fine, but then the correct response at the beginning should have been, "Sorry sir, I don't have Malibu, but I do have 'insert brand here.' Would you like that?" Anyway, as he sees the bottle of rum in front of his eyes, he also sees a cocktail waitress next to him ordering from the female bartender-- 2 rum and cokes, so my husband asks for that, as he sees her pouring said rum and popping open cans of coke for the waitress' drinks. He tells male bartender "I'll take one of those--a rum and coke." Reply is an exacerbated "We don't have Coke!" My husband is in disbelief. Finally the female says, "Yes, we do," and hands the man a can. The male says to my husband, "Oh, I guess we do," mixes the cocktail, and there is no apology or even sheepish or embarrassed expression.Next, the buffet line of tapas chosen by the host: at sundown on the patio with little light (as well as the fact most items were fried past recognition) many of us couldn't see or figure out what was being served. My husband, ever the optimist, even after his bar escapade, asked the staff member working the buffet line if he could tell us (aka me, him, and his elderly uncle) what that the items were. Staff member's response: He scoffed, and said "EVERYTHING?!?!?!" (Oh, I'm sorry for putting you out by asking you to assist me, which is your job!) My husband quietly, being made to feel like the rude one in the situation, if not an idiot, both of which were untrue and uncalled for, said, "Well, yes." So the horrendously rude server quickly pointed and offered no explanation other than, "Pork sandwiches, lamb, chicken, and all the same repeated at the other end." First of all, even I could tell via sight that every serving tray held something different, there was no "repeating at the other end," but whatever...Anyway, based on that amazingly helpful [please read sarcasm] explanation, we chose a few items and went to our seats. Mr. Helpful server wasn't even right. His closest "guess" was the "pork sandwiches which turned out to be mini Cubans. Other than that there were fried artichokes and calamari. (Glad I guessed that from its look on the serving table myself, as I hate the stuff and would have "urped" if I mistakenly took a bite.)Lastly on the service end, I asked a passing waiter if there was a manager I could speak with in order to report the previous server's disrespectful attitude. This waiter refused to get a manager, saying, "Whatever it is, I can help." Fine, I was in no mood to argue. But when I told him, he simply laughed and said, "I'll get you a menu." I was taken aback and replied, "I don't need a menu, it's done. It's just his attitude I have a problem with." He laughed again and offered to bring a menu.  When I insisted again that a menu had nothing to do with it, he laughed more and walked away.  I would bet the bank these employees have either been trained to not get a manager because the manager doesn't want to hear about it, or that they don't want to get a manager because they don't want to show any sign to their superiors that there is, yet another, complaint.Food: Zero stars.  Most tasteless beyond fried grease, the rest bland.Trust the undercover Food Network specials--this place is deplorable. I can't believe in an economy where establishments are boarded up daily it seems, that this one has enough customers to stay open, and that it doesn't seem to care if or how it will retain them.I went to this place and they told us that the kitchen was backed up and I couldn't place my order for at least 30 min! Terrible experienceI very rarely find myself downtown but I was seeing a matinee at the Smith's Center, and me and my people needed to eat so Bar + Bistro was what we chose. There were 3 ways to walk into the restaurant, there were no obvious signs to entrance and I picked all the wrong doors. Finally we found our way to the host desk and he sat us at our table ... with no menus. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to ask for a menu. He said that they didn't have enough to go around, so he grabbed us small paper to-go menus. Good enough, I suppose. Our server greeted us, she was friendly and attentive, and helped me make my decision. My eyes are perpetually larger than my stomach so I usually need some assistance. The food took forever, but was delicious when it finally arrived. I had the Cangrejo Benedict Mofongo - tasty, my mom had the Paella Mixto Crepe - delicious, and the highlight - my G-ma's flan french toast. It was an okay visit, so ... why the two stars? After the show I returned with a friend for a glass of wine and maybe tapas. We sat at the bar ... the bartender that was there when we arrived was an asshole with no concept of good customer service, and was joined shortly after we sat down by a pompous asshole who also had no concept of good customer service. We sat down in a mostly empty place, again I had to ask for a menu, again they were out. The conversation I had with the dude went something like this ... "May I have a menu?" "Uh ... we're out, let me see what I can find" several moments later he returns with a food/wine menu and i ask "do you have a cocktail menu?" "no" "are there any specialty cocktails?" "no ... we just took pictures last week" "oh, are you redoing it?" "no" "how long have you been open?" "about a year, we took pictures last week" "are there any cocktails that you personally can make?" "no ... maybe in a couple weeks" . My bad for assuming that there should be a cocktail menu, but the hundreds of specialty liquor and liqueur bottles, fresh herbs in the well, and all the jiggers, muddlers and other such accoutrements that all mixologists carry around would lead me to believe that they had a specialty cocktail menu. Apparently not, they just took pictures last week. Full disclosure ... I got a little snappy with the guy, because he was the opposite of helpful. Enter the next bartender ... no hello, no eye contact just a louder than a whisper conversation with the other bartender about if the people at the bar are cool.  I have high expectations for the level of service in Vegas. Any dickhead can put on a smedium sized vest and bow tie and make a cocktail. A++ customer service is a skill and these dudes these ... definitely not up to par.A couple ladies sit down next to us, they ask for menus, ask the same cocktail related questions. Same responses. They asked to place a food order and were then informed that there was a 20 minute hold on ordering any food. So the food would be 20 minutes + the amount of time it actually took to prepare the food after it was ordered. Not okay, and not okay with them, so they left. Anytime I'm downtown, I get excited about it's future. The Smith Center, all the cleanup, locally owned restaurants popping up everywhere, cool bars, culture! How would this place handle an actual crowd? On both occasions the restaurant/bar was only 25% full. Why aren't there enough menus? Why the belated specialty cocktail menu? Why the egotistical bartenders? I don't see this place going the distance unless some serious kinks are worked out and I hope that they do because that flan french toast was something else.The two stars are for the sweet potato fries, which are delicious.Everything else is horrendous here. The food isn't bad, per se, but it is nothing special and is ridiculously overpriced. The service...WOW. This place may have the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waiters are slow and don't check up on you. When they do check up on you, beware! I had a waiter take my plate (with half my food still on it!) while I had turned to talk to my friend. I turned back to an empty table and a still-empty stomach because quite literally half of my sandwich was taken away without anyone asking me if I was done. This would be bad enough on its own, but I've had several friends tell me they have had the same exact thing happen to them here!Add to that their complete lack of willingness to work with you or make you happy. The pastrami here is traditionally served on rye bread. I dislike rye bread, so I asked my server if I could get it on white bread. The answer? "No, it comes on rye." WHAT??? The kitchen is incapable of slapping pastrami and mustard on a different kind of bread? I ended up ordering the club sandwich, which came on white bread.Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. It will probably be cheaper and have better customer service.No doubt the hottest mess in downtown. One of the first times I visited, the bar was airing a live episode of the Food Network show Restaurant Stakeout (all about deeply troubled restaurants), and I got to watch the service staff laughing at their horrible depictions on TV. That was about two years ago. Cut to this weekend, a beautiful Sunday morning. What sounds better than brunch while sitting outside? The lady suggests B&B. Although I've been a number of times for dinner, still haven't tried brunch, plus its super close, plus the weather--yes, let's do B&B! We arrive about 11:15, order by 11:45. I need to to leave by 1pm to meet some folks, but we figure there's plenty of time. You know where this is going. We order a Spanish omelet and the B&B Bake and are told something about how the bake takes an extra 5-10 minutes. Fine, no immediate rush. Around minute thirty is when things start to get a little weird, so I mention how "excited" we are for our dishes. Profuse apologies; kitchen's backed up, the usual. Another fifteen minutes later, as the five or six tables that sat down after us are well into their meals, I tell the server we need to get going so either the food has to arrive immediately or we'll have to split. Quick run to the kitchen; profuse apologies; our orders are "the very next ones" at the window. Watch three more orders land at tables around us, and finally around minute sixty we stand up and begin to take our leave. It is almost ten to 1. Naturally, the server is carrying our plates right as we're passing her. She implores us to sit and eat, says the meal will be taken care of. We're starving, so we sit down and eat. Not much point going into great detail about the food. It was bad. The Spanish omelet was overcooked eggs with a few red peppers and a slice of supposedly manchego cheese on top. Slapped on a plate, no accompaniment, no flavor or texture, just a quickly thrown together mess that I am certain took no more than four minutes to execute. The "bake" had more flavor (chorizo, obvi) but was also dry and accompanied by some curiously soggy "salad" involving finely diced tomatoes, lettuce, avocados, beans, and olives. It was weird, disproportionate, heavy, mushy, and made no sense. In other words, it was a lousy experience. The weather was lovely, the bluegrass band, although too loud for talking, was a fun touch, and the packed seating area bustled with merriment. I guess you can get away with a lot on a Sunday morning when the weather's nice and the mimosa and bloody mary taps are wide open. Folks seemed happy. I'd have been one of the happy ones too if I were getting rocked on bottomless booze and time was no issue. Sadly, we were there for the meal in addition to the sun, and the meal was a dumpster fire. I have it on good authority that the reason B&B offers such chronically horrible service is because the kitchen is simply too small to accommodate the amount of diners that the house can accommodate. If that's the case, it's an unfortunate error in the original design, but it can't continue to hobble the entire operation. A restaurant can't thrive if it's constantly apologizing for pissing off its customers. That's a model for failure. They need to radically simplify the menu, or streamline the preparation, or get rid of tables, or hire faster cooks, or knock out some walls and expand the kitchen, or.... I won't come back, at least not for the food. I've eaten here several times and recall a few quite memorable bites. The mac n cheese blew me away the first time I tried it. A few other things have been surprisingly good. But the menu is much like the service--all over the place and wildly inconsistent. B&B is more than the food, though, which is probably why it continues to survive. The location is premiere, right in the heart of the Arts District. The bar offers a brilliant selection of brown spirits and usually friendly service. It's more than a restaurant, it's a hub, and good thing because it wouldn't survive on the food alone.For those of us who live near and/or support the Arts District, B&B is a place to embrace and rally around. It's exactly the kind of thing to want to thrive. But it shouldn't get a free pass on being a restaurant just for being a cool spot in a cool location. Two years ago B&B was laughing at its own bumbling self on TV, and it doesn't seem like much has improved since. Pity.Great and unique place for brunch on a late-Sunday morning! Came here as a suggestion from my friend who wanted the brunch atmosphere with the bluegrass music spin. Parking was a bit rough in the area and we ended up parking in a loading zone, but other people were parked there and it was a Sunday. Luckily our car was still there later :DI had the french toast - it was served with the syrup already poured on and not too sweet. I liked how the bread pieces weren't too thick and it was the perfect balance of fluffy and crispy. We also ordered the house fries that come with tasty takes on mayo and ketchup (slightly spicy). The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the quiche which he claims to be the best quiche he's ever had (topping Bouchon's even - but not sure if I'd personally go that far). The rest of our party really enjoyed their entree choices and a few of us got the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12. They even let one of our friends change between both drinks. They are very generous with their mimosa pours and even when I told them I was good after 2 cups, one of our servers encouraged me to just have a little more! They did run out of champagne and switched to bottomless white wine sangria, which I unfortunately didn't have room for. One of the proprietors came to talk to us and was super sweet and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. I'll definitely be back for the sangria and all the entrees that got me hooked!Great spot downtown for outdoor dining and cocktails. Met two of my girlfriends from my 'Showbiz' days on a beautiful Saturday night. I did think it would be crowded, but it was perfect, plenty of outdoor seating and no waiting at all. The waitress was super nice and very attentive. Prices not too expensive, I ordered the Pomegranate Champagne Sangria, and OH MY GOODNESS, how delicious and fresh it was!Yes, I will be back. Its 2 blocks from my building!
Yard House Red Rock Resort=Mom and I stopped by for lunch the other day.  She ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack Appetizer ($11.65), I had the Chicken Nachos ($10.35).....the waitress convinced me to have a Stone Ruination IPA ($6.25)....kidding, I didn't need any convincing.The food came out fast.  Mom enjoyed the Poke Stack, it's one of her favorite dishes here.  The Chicken Nachos had a lot of potential....half of the Chips tasted stale...you know, when it has the texture of Licorice....anyway, the part of my Nachos with the stale Chips were awful, the part of my Nachos with fresh Chips was awesome.  Seriously, it was night and day.  Dammit Yard House.The Stone Ruination IPA made it all better though....yummy!Overall, it was an OK lunch.  Could have been better.Will I return?  I'm sure I will.I never have any issue with service or food at this location. My latest visit, our waiter Benjamin S. was one of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. He had the most personality and checked up on us while making jokes each time. I could not stop laughing.My favorites at yard house are:Lobster crab artichoke dip, chicken tortilla soup, chicken enchilada stack, & they have really good fish too. Benjamin brought out a dipping sauce for our sweet potato fries which were to die for. It was a bacon maple cream sauce. Omg I want some right now thinking about it. Beers are great. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do appreciate their fruity beer selection. The prices are pretty reasonable as well.
Checkers=Awww Checkers, I'm so glad I found you again after so many years!  I grew up with you but then moved to Vegas and thought we would never see each other again.  Oh happy day because you have now opened a place in town, so our romance can continue!So, it has been about 20 years since I had Checkers/Rally's.  I remember them being the best burgers and fries in the world.  I was so excited to grab some food here and relive my childhood with my family.  The Baconzilla Burger was tasty, the fried  chicken sandwich was like every other fried chicken sandwich at fast food places, and the fish sandwich was in the same boat as the chicken.  The fries are still pretty tasty being covered in all sorts of seasoning and fried to be on the crispy side.  The food wasn't as fantastic as I remember it, but it was still pretty tasty.  The milk shakes are quite yummy here too.  They even have banana milk shakes, which you don't see often.  The only negative here are the serving sizes on the fries.  The small order of fries looked like it should belong in the kid's meal not the adult meal.  So if you are hungry, go for a bigger size otherwise you will still be hungry afterwards.   The drinks and the sandwiches all seem on par with other comparable places.The prices all seem a tad on the high side for what you get.  They aren't outrageous, but more than what you will spend at McDs or BK or the like, on a similar meal deal.This particular location is on a really busy corner, so you have to be careful getting in and out of the place, since everyone drives like maniacs in this area.  It can also take a bit to get out of the parking lot onto the main street again due to the high volume of traffic.  This is not a good place if you are crunched for time.  As for the seating, it is outdoor only, so keep that in mind if you plan on going in the middle of July.  Also with it being on a busy street corner, it is loud sitting outside due to the traffic sounds.So yes, Checkers is a yummy fast food joint for good burgers.  The fries are tasty, but order a bigger size than normal for yourself.  And lastly, give yourself some extra time since everything is on the slow side.I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.Rally's... Checker's... It's all the same. And it's good. I had a all beef chili cheese dog with onions and it was good. I ate a Cheese Champ that was a single burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and ketchup and it was damn good especially for the price. I have been before this last time and had mozzarella sticks that are good as hell for a fast food place. I have also had a burger that had jalapenos and they weren't shy with them so I liked it a lot. They have a walk up window and a double drive thru. The drive thru speaker on the left has window service on the passenger side and the speaker on the right has window service at the drivers window.This Checkers is located on the corner of Deseret inn and Boulder Highway.  It has that old school feel of an old diner except you cannot go inside to eat. I've been here several times of the years and it's just ok to me.  It's not the first place I'll go to when I want to grab a burger and fries.  One thing I don't like about the location is the drive thru.  It's not suitable for longer vehicles and I always rub my tires against the curb when I'm trying to exit the joint.  Besides that I always get coupons in the mail for checkers but I still prefer the more established  burger places because I know what Im getting.  Checkers just doesn't leave too much of an impression with me.
Zinburger=Monday night was a big one for me.  First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one. So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry. Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime. We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite. Really though, the food was phenomenal.We had some time to kill after a schedule change left us stranded at the Greyhound Station in Phoenix. We ditched the bus station and asked a cab driver to take us somewhere - anywhere - interesting. We ended up at Biltmore Fashion Center and were dropped off near Zinburger. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=bHZobMw7BzUv5Thd211_QQWe saw many diners enjoying burgers, shakes, and fries, and asked Ichabod if he'd like something to eat. He seemed excited about the restaurant and chose barstools for us near the pleasant outdoor patio dining area. We ordered:* Roasted chicken salad with organic greens, pomegranate, marcona almonds, and goat cheese dressing  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=5lTby7rzAD3Japndi95ykg* Burger of the day - angus and brie with truffled aioli. The flavor of the cheese overpowered the meat, but it was still tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=d0aoEc0hSLAppfbY3MNhtg* Fries - limp, greasy, disappointing. How does a burger place mess up fries? They looked better than they tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=mGD30C-GrVFNzmaCRU-9jA* Black cow float - root beer float with a tall glass packed with vanilla ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could justify charging $6 for it, but the price made more sense when I saw the amount of high quality ice cream and the premium root beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=kSz0KDrt4SPLOaPr26CFSwMr. L and I shared the salad and burger, which they split for us, and brought in succession. That made dining easy and enjoyable. Our server was borderline unpleasant and impatient, and gave me the impression she wanted us to order quickly and be done with us. When she gave us our check, she made one attempt at friendliness, the last-ditch "don't stiff me my tip endzone play," which we witnessed her do with another customer at the bar. Strange. In contrast, the other Zinburger servers were consistently pleasant and very helpful. The bovine theme here is pervasive, from the cow decorations on the walls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=ljBTfOt7fXWa15uq55A_lQ to the trough sink in the ladies room. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=_-qDTkIuzpxOMk1RgJ5z4wFrom the burgerlicious food to the fun atmosphere, I can see why Zinburger is a popular eatery.Regrettably I was here a few months back for a friend's birthday, and while the vehemence of my disdain has been allowed to cool with the ensuing time since my visit, I now know with a particular level of certainty why you shouldn't waste any of your hard earned benjamin's here.-crowds: granted it is in the Biltmore, so your bound to be surrounded with yuppies, however if you truly analyze the setting of this restaurant it's essentially an option in a food court of a pretentious mall masquerading as something else. lets be fair though, most places in Az are in some form of strip mall setting, but in all honesty isnt the Biltmore just another shopping mall?-rude servers: now there is any number of reasons why a server has the right to be a little curt, I'm not saying that a server needs to be a ball of sunshine to satisfy me, but open hostility, resentment, and referring to one of my friends with a pretty strong homophobic slur is in my eyes unacceptable.-inflated prices: $10 for a burger? to quote Wayne's World "SHUHHH" NO WAY!? WAAAY." There'd be no complaints to that price tag if the burger was actually worth it, what your paying for is what my Peruvian friend's realtor mom likes to call "Locacion, Locacion, Locacion"-mediocre burgers: along the lines with the last comment, the burgers here are surely "meh, i've had better" 2 stars at best. For a pricier burger that you'll be glad to shell out a hamilton and a few washingtons for go to Phoenix City Grille, now they know how to make a burger and treat customersSimply put Zinburger has no Zen, and it leaves you with the same taste in your mouth that a haiku written by George Carlin might.Big, juicy, burgers...Sam Fox Style. The burgers here are juicy and delicious. The fries are just as good and very salty (in a good way). I especially enjoy the multiple dipping sauces they offer to accompany the fries and I always try to save room for a milkshake to wash it down! This is a good spot for lunch because the service is relatively quick!***Zinburger is a small Phoenix burger chain from a restaurant group (Fox Restaurant Concepts) that has several restaurants--mostly in Phoenix though I think some of their restaurants are coming to Los Angeles; the food here is okay but definitely not as good as some of Los Angeles' great burger spots like Father's Office and Short Order***Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which is an upscale outdoor mall just outside of Downtown Phoenix.  Biltmore Fashion Park has a few upscale shops like J. Crew, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn, but it seems to have even more dining options--a lot of chains from upscale ones like The Capital Grille to moderately priced ones like California Pizza Kitchen.  Zinburger seems to be one of the more local or at least regional places here.Zinburger has a clean and simple indoor dining room.  The dining room is very minimalist and no frills, but it is modern and comfortable.  An outdoor dining patio is also available, but it would probably be quite uncomfortable dining outside during Phoenix's hot summers.Because Zinburger is a burger spot, prices are not too high for dinner.  Zinburger is a gourmet burger spot though so burgers run $10 here.  You can upgrade to an American Kobe beef patty for an extra $5.  All sides are a la carte and are large sides that are suited for two or three people.Salads are also available as well as an assortment of shakes and not just traditional flavors.  Shakes are very dessert-focused here--shakes based on popular and longstanding desserts like crème brulee, strawberry cheesecake and bananas foster.Zinburger's menu setup is also a tad similar to The Counter.  Like The Counter, Zinburger has a build-your-own-burger option where you can choose between quite a few toppings, cheeses and sauces.  The Counter showcases special burgers (and I believe shakes) for the month and so does Zinburger.I had Zinburger's El Diablo burger.  The burger came with fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo.  I also upgraded the patty to American Kobe beef.  The burger itself was pretty good.  It had a good flavor and was juicy enough.  It did not have the juiciness of a very great burger, but it was definitely not dry.  I am not sure how much the American Kobe added.  I have never been a big fan of American Kobe beef; it lacks the richness of Japanese Kobe.  The burger patty was good though their regular patty might be good as well.The toppings were okay.  The burger was not too spicy.  It could have used a little more heat though occasionally the burger had nice heat.  I wish the burger had greens though to add freshness and balance.  It seems like a lot of their signature burgers lack greens and lettuce, which I think is a big miss.Their hand cut fries were just okay.  They were thin fries and they could have been crispier.  The zucchini fries could have been crispier too.  The flavor of the zucchini fries were good though and they came with a decent Parmesan ranch dipping sauce.I had their Bars of Zin shake, which was chocolate ice cream, melted chocolate and praline flakes.  The shake had a good consistency.  It was smooth and thick but still very drinkable.  The flavor was good.  It had a good chocolate flavor without being too rich.  The praline flakes were just okay.  It did not add the crispiness I would have preferred.Service was good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.As already mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Overall, you can get out of here with a filling dinner for not that much money.  That being said, the burgers and shakes here are expensive for casual food given their gourmet label and significant portion sizes.Zinburger is an okay burger spot.  In terms of flavor, I would definitely put it above a spot like The Counter.  I would say though that Father's Office and Short Order are significantly better than Zinburger and I would even prefer spots like 25 Degrees over Zinburger too.As mentioned earlier, Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which offers both pay self and valet parking.  Zinburger does validate parking (I believe they validate up to 2 hours).There's nothing like a good burger! I've heard so many good things about this place and FINALLY got to check it out this weekend, boy was everyone right about it! It was amazing! I saw the Breakfast burger and just had to get it. It comes with all of my favorites.. avocado, bacon, mayo and topped with a fried egg! Anything with a fried egg on it is good to me. lol. The burger was amazing and beyond delicious. I also ordered the Creme Brulee Milkshake which was soooooo good! You have to try it! We also ordered the Double Truffle Fries. It was good but it came with this weird Mayo dip which I was not too fond of. Everything was really amazing, HOWEVER the service... my oh my... Let's just say it was very disappointing... We ordered ranch and ketchup for our fries which never came. We had to flag down another waitress to get it for us. Also, our water cups were pretty much always empty. I almost felt the need to go to the bar just to get more water. =/ The waitress probably checked on us maybe once the entire time we were there. This place really does have amazingggg burgers! I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service. I also wish there was one on my side of town as well but you can't win em all! =0Last year, when faced with a week of no solid foods before AND after renal surgery, Dude asked me what/where I wanted to eat the Saturday before.  One place came to mind. Zinburger! When you've got a week of chicken broth, water, Jell-O and Morphine to look forward to: Who in their right mind would turn up their nose to gourmet burgers, decadent and creative milkshakes and craveable sides?!Over the last year and a half, we've gone 4-5 times. Friendly customer service every visit, and worth the wait time.We've tried the Double Truffle Fries with Garlic Aioli, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato and Zucchini fries ... All delicious; however, the Double Truffle Fries are the winner here.You can replace any patty with Kobe Beef or Turkey; they will also lettuce wrap them for all you Paleonerds and Low Carb Kids. My favorites have been: 1) Turkey Burger: These guys do it right. Not your typical Jenni-O boring patties. 2) The Samburger: Cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Thousand Island with the obligatory lettuce, tomato and onion. I'd drive 30 minutes out here JUST for that Creme Brulee Shake. Wish the Butterfinger one was a permanent menu option, not just another "Shake of the Month"! Highly recommend sharing them. They are huge. Hit up Zinburger to indulge any burger / "sin food" craving. And wear your fat pants. I know I'll be back ... Again and again!A bit closer to 2.5 stars but my server was super friendly so that is why it's a 3.I was craving a burger and had seen this place mentioned a few times being named as one of the "Best Burgers in Phoenix".   I decided to come down and check it out.  Pay parking which you can get validated.  They use plastic tokens...reminded me of a small poker chip.  Anyways..........walked inside and was seated against the wall.  My server came over and asked me if it was my first time here etc.  She went over the whole drill.  I decided to order the Zinburger (minus mayo), an order of fresh cut fries and a Diet Pepsi to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.................Zinburger-  ($10.50)  This is a ground beef patty (I'm assuming 1/3 lb...it was a good sized patty) topped with manchengo cheese, zinfandel braised onions, and lettuce.  I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect.  It was presented nicely but it was lacking greatness.  I took a bite of the meat itself and it tasted really great...like steak!  The cheese was melted on top of the burger and the onions were layered nicely on top of the cheese.  It came on a soft "fancy" bun.  Each item itself was great...when combined though, it left something to be desired.  All I could really taste was bread and onions.  The meat/burger was not the star of the show.  The lettuce addition was a little weird too.  It probably would have been better without.  It was a decent enough burger but for a "fancy" higher end burger joint, I expected more.  It ain't cheap either!  Hand Cut Fries-  ($5.00)  These things were actually really good.  They give you a nice sized mound of them.  They were hot and crispy and delicious.  They needed just a bit more salt, but other than that, they were really good.  Better/more memorable than the burger.Diet Pepsi- Is what it is.Why only 2.5/3 stars?  For a burger, fries and drink, it was $19.98...that is before tip!  I will never ever ever ever ever ever pay $25.00 to come back here for simple comfort food.  It's just way too expensive for what you get!   The staff was all pretty friendly, the layout is cool (kind of a hipster vibe), and they validate parking for up to 2 hours.  I am glad I came to check it out, but sadly I will not be returning...the value is just not there.  Once I hit that lotto and move to Scottsdale, then we can come here often lol.Came here last night for the very first time with a couple of our good friends. We had the kale Caesar, the Kobe Burger, hand Fries and the IPA Beer and Berry Mojito. Everything was delicious! The fools was phenomenal, the drinks were tasty and the service was over all great!we had an outdoor table and the atmosphere was very hip and easy going. Great Job Sam Fox! I look fwd to visiting all your restaurants now!
Cannon Coffee=Why five stars? Anyone who can start a coffeehouse with a world full of Starbucks and Caribou's gets a pat on the back from me. The only strike against Cannon is that they close early but it's not that big a deal with me to take a star away. I ordered an iced coffee for 2 bucks, it was every bit as good as Starbucks' iced brew and the best part, the "plastic" cup my beverage came in was made from plant products. So it will  rot in the ground. I love supporting locally own businesses, it's good for the community and the economy. It's got a Beehive feel without the freaks. You can borrow a book from the bookshelf, listen to good music when they have open mic night or just go in with an iPhone like I did and chill. I got to talking to the owner and his partner, he has some great ideas, I wish him luck and hope it comes to fruition. Locals go behind the counter and help themselves and leave the money on the counter. There is a deck behind the counter for smokers or if you just want to sit outside. I like this place and can see myself becoming a regular. Hey Nate good luck and save me a comfy chair!People looking to open up a coffee shop in Pittsburgh have it made!  Want a homey feel?  Buy a house and convert it into a business!  Want a beautiful molded ceiling?  Already there!  Want character? It's built in.Get the point?  This place has history and I love it!  Lots of books line the walls, but little trinkets decorate the walls and ample seating, including comfy chairs, make it a prime spot for work or a casual meet up.  They also have a killer outdoor patio that actually offers power for your laptop too, which is a total plus if you want to hang in the pretty space.They have all the normal coffee, tea and soda offerings (yay for Italian soda!). I went with an iced vanilla latte and it was perfect.  The dude who seemed to be the owner was incredible friendly and even had his fluffy friendly dog with him.  If you're looking for a furry friend to break up the work day, this doggie is looking for attention!  The food they were making for breakfast and lunch smelled awesome, so I'm looking forward to stopping back for some bites.
La Katra Hot Dog Cart=So there I was... on week three of my semi-vegan, all whole foods, mostly organic, low-sodium and low-sugar diet and I was pissed. Angry and frustrated with the way things have been happening lately. Two major fights in two days... doesn't make for a good pageant week, but whatev' it happened. Not wanting to relive everything, but KNOWING I was about to... only one thing came to mind... I want an effing HOT DOG!Now, I live within walking distance of Ted's Hot Dogs, but it was closed, I tried to think of somewhere that was open... a spot came to mind: perched on the south west corner of Priest and Baseline, across the street from AZ Mills Mall and a lil down from Carls Jr. sat the gleaming cart of happiness... La Katra Hot Dogs. With its Sonoran Dogs, bottled mexican sodas, plastic tables n chairs, and small tv showing nothing but Telenovelas, La Katra was the perfect setting for my culinary Wooo Saaaw. The first time I heard of Sonoran Hot Dogs, the sound of it made me sick. Nothing but unkosher, heavily processed food?! Uhh... no thanks! But I'm so happy I gave it a go because I have been missing OUT! We quickly got our boiled bacon wrapped dog topped with refried beans, MAYO and tomatoes on a steamed sesame seed bun. There is an ice chest filled with other toppings. Things such as: sliced mushrooms, shredded cheese, sweet relish, whole green chilies, creamy guac sauce, salsa verde and parmesan cheese (u know... the stuff in the green can).I was elated and a little overwhelmed. I asked my friend Beckita which I should use, she suggested the guac and salsa. I obeyed and added relish, parmesan and hot green chili sauce for good measure! I took my first bite and it was... DUH-VINE!Creamy, spicy and kind of salty. It was soft, yummy and could use some crunch, maybe some crushed tortilla chips on top? Extremely savory and filling. You only need ONE $3 Sonoran Dog. Their Bottles are $1.50 and cans of soda are a $1. They are open daily starting at 6pm and close 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. If you have $5 and need some late night food, then this is the place for you! Be sure to top yours with the salsa verde! It's the best!!
Rambo's Kitchen=Was it my love of dogs that brought me to Rambo's Kitchen?  (There is a picture of the owner's dog "Rambo" on the sign)  I stopped in last night for dinner, and knew the moment I walked in that this place had a shot at being great.  The restaurant is decked out with tie-dye, vintage concert posters, and other 60's and 70's era memorabilia.  A few menu items and specials are written on the wall, and the music plays at an appropriate level.  Last night "Bernadette" by the Temptations was on as we entered, a personal favorite.  The menu has a lot of variety; its a good idea to ask your server what's delicious?  Most items come with a side, and even though there were a lot of choices, we both ordered the hand-cut fries.Our Dinner:Sm. Onion rings - They were standard onion rings, not too greasy, crisp coating.  The side of ranch they are served with is key.Turkey Avocado Croissant w/ hand cut fries - A flaky, buttery croissant hugged some fresh slices of avocado, lettuce, tasty turkey, and a little aioli.  It was very good.  The FRIES are excellent.  The hand-cut bad boys were in-and-out strives to be, but falls short of accomplishing.  They aren't fast food fries, but they are similar to in-and-out in cut.  The RAMBO BURGER - Oh Yeeeaaahhhh!  (Hulk Hogan voice)As soon as I saw this I figured, "I worked hard this week, I earned this."  This juicy, 1/2 pound burger is stuffed with various cheeses, (mild with a hint of sharp cheddar) topped with home made BBQ Pulled Pork and an onion ring.  The lightly toasted bun was incredible.  If this burger won an award, it would first thank the bun for its great support.  There is a roll of paper towels on the table so fear not, a little contained chaos is what all of us need once in a while.  I liked the flavors a lot.  I asked for a side of BBQ sauce and dipped a bit because it was so good.Bottom Line:  My parents and yours would love this place.  I love Rambo's Kitchen because it is family run, practically everything is made from scratch, it is reasonably priced, and fun.  This is a Diner's Drive ins, and Dives spot waiting to be discovered.Horrible, Horrible service is what is was all about my last time there. I went there last week during my lunch break with a couple of people from my work. When we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order. We all ordered water and then ordered our meals.We were then IGNORED for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food. No check ups by the waitress, no I am sorry your food is taking so long. hey do you need a refill, no nothing. At that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave. That is when we were finally noticed. The waitress came running over almost freaking out  saying our food is just about ready. Where were you 20 minutes ago?Anyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go. I disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice.I understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh, but not 40 minutes. but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time.P.S. In response to the owner's comments, I stand by what I said in my review as accurate. So based on what the owner says, good customer service is to call me a liar, write a snarky insincere response, and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are?  I have read all the owner's comments left towards other Yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them. If something goes wrong during your visit, don't blame the restaurant. Not a very productive response in my opinion. I think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money. It is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business.Okay, let's try this again.....First let me apologize to yelp and the owner of Rambo's kitchen for writing a review that fell "outside" yelps TOS. I am usually a fairly soft spoken and respectful person and I am sincerely sorry for anything said in my previous review that was found to be disrespectful or a "personal attack".Now to my review of the restaurant.....I have been to Rambo's at least a half dozen times and despite what Yelp or the owner might think, I have never had a bad experience or a bad meal. All the food and service I have ever received there has been decent. As stated in my "too personal" review, I would give Rambo's a solid 3 stars to a soft 4 stars, which actually falls right into line with Rambo's average review, if it was just about food and service. More on that later.The Rambo Burger was excellent. I do think that the thimble sized portion of cole slaw is a bit silly.The first time my wife and I went there we order the fried zucchini app and it was one of the best we had ever had. Nice long lightly battered spears of zucchini that were just wonderful. The next couple of time we got the FZ the quality went down each time. We have never ordered it again.My wife loves their salads. My 16 y/o sons loves everything, but come on, he's a 16 y/o boy.Service? Hit and miss. Sometimes you get your order right in and it comes to your table in a timely manner, other times, not so much. Some times your water glass is always full, others not.As for the one star rating, it needs to be understood that my wife and I try to avoid the big chain restaurants. In these difficult time we choose to go with the locally owned mom and pop places. It take guts and determination to run your own restaurant.That said, I do not understand the attitude that the owner takes when someone gives him a negative review. Just be gracious. Accept the fact that sometimes your restaurant will hit a home run and other times it will strike out. Rather than going to the surveillance tapes to attack dissatisfied customers about their timing issues, why not just say "Sorry for you bad experience" and determine to improve in the future. People do not right reviews, good or bad, because they like you or dislike you. They write review because they had an emotional reaction to their experience, good or bad.With all due respect to the owner of Rambo's, I cannot separate the food and service at Rambo's from what I feel to be a severe disconnect from the owner when faced with a legitimate, honest reviews that he doesn't like.All parts equal the sum of this review and that's why it is a one star review.A co-worker recommended this place, so my sister and I went for dinner.  All in all I just wasn't impressed with this restaurant, so much so that I won't be back.The decor is psychadelic 60's.  Well, actually, it seemed to flux from random things of the 60's, such as bands or movies, to just psychadelic looking stickers.  It seemed like they were just desperate to fill in every empty space on their walls.  It's a bit over the top when you walk in, but I can understand the fun for people that particularly enjoy that decade.  I don't happen to and even if I did like the 60's, their decor could have been way less cheesy and still been faithful to the theme.Each table has books, toys or memorablia from that same decade, which I thought was interesting, especially since our table featured a Greatest Edition of Archie Comics, which I loved when I was a little girl.  Obviously the music they play is from the 60's and they even show muted Ed Sullivan Show clips on a large television.When we placed our orders, I told the waitress that I had wanted a hamburger, so she recomended the special which was a Rambo Burger.  The menu didn't really give a description on the specials part, so I ordered it.  It came out with shredded barbecue beef on top and an onion ring.  I really just wanted a simple burger and had there been a description when I ordered, I would have picked something else.  Still, when I scraped off the extra meat and put the onion ring to the side, it was a decent burger.  Actually, the quality of the burger is why this review is two stars instead of just one, espcially when my sister didn't like her chicken Alfredo.All in all, I wasn't impressed with the service and when we got our bill I was shocked when our total came out to close to $40.00.  Like I said, the food was good, but I can't spend that much in what I assumed would be a mom and pop style establishment.1/9/2013 (Response to Owner's Comments)If there's one thing that kinda irks me, it's the inability to quietly take a less than positive review and use it constructively instead of trying to defend youself against one person's bad experience.  I'm ALWAYS more than willing to give a second chance, and if you check my past reviews, most locations get a better review from the first time when I wasn't impressed.  This owner response was that second chance.  However, since the owner(?) was able to go into better detail of my review, I figured I would and could afford him the same courtesy.1. Cost: I hold in my hand my receipt from Rambo's Kitchen dated 12/26/12 for the total amount of $36.36 ("close to $40.00").  Now, even though I wasn't that impressed with the service, it wasn't horrible, so I decided to round up my bill with a tip of $3.64, more for my convenience than for the server's reward.  Hence, my bill came to $40.00.  Now, the reason for the increase in my bill is because I failed to mention the "$5.00" milkshake that we also ordered.  My apologies and the subject of my next issue.2. "$5.00 Milkshake": I love the name of that item, all I can think of is Vincent Vega and his outrage that something made of milk and ice cream can cost $5.00.  Of course, when he tasted Mia Wallace's shake, he had to agree that it was an amazing shake.  I couldn't.  The ice cream they used must have been thawed and then refrozen, because there were crystalized parts of it that just tasted like straight ice.  It wasn't quite blended well and I'm pretty sure if I was a waitress (as I have been, so I'm speaking from experience) I would have noticed if an item had barely been touched and asked if something was wrong.  I assume this is not a policy at Rambo's, but everyone has their off day and it's not like this is fine dining.  In fact, the person that ordered this shake, took one taste and didn't touch it again, I ate more than her since I didn't want to waste an entire $5.00.3. Quality of food: I apologize, sincerely, for stating that my sandwich contained beef, it was pulled pork now that I remember it.  I assume that I just glossed over that information and picture on the menu, so I apologize for that as well.  Now, as for the fettucine alfredo.  I had decided that I wouldn't go into detail in my original review, but fair's fair.  My sister loved it.  She brought the rest home to eat the next day.  Of course, when she woke up at two in the morning with stomach pains and spent the rest of the next day glued to the toilet, she instructed me to throw away her takeout food.  I'm not sure if it was undercooked chicken or something else, but the food made her sick.  However, I'll state it once again, my hamburger (once I had scraped off the pulled PORK) was delicious and I didn't get sick.In summation, I appreciate the archived positive reviews that were included and wish congratulations on the patrons that enjoyed this restaurant.  I was not one of them and definintely won't be.  Accordingly, I'll remove one star due to owner understanding.For the record, I hate giving this place two stars.The place is adorable.  Every square inch is packed with some kind of memorabilia or decoration from the 60's/70's.  There was obviously a lot of care and thought taken when decorating and it pays off big.  They also play a lot of Rolling Stones, Doors, etc, to add to the hippie experience.  The servers are also really great, especially Misty.  She's very sweet and willing to make recommendations on the menu.Unfortunately, each time I've been here, at least one person at my table absolutely hated their meal.  I'm not talking about "eh, not my fave" kind of reactions, but "I can't eat anymore of this, no, no, no."   One of those meals was a pulled pork sandwich (apparently the meat texture left much to be desired).  The other hated meal was my egg salad sandwich.  Now, I am a big egg salad enthusiast and will eat pretty much anything.  But, I really disliked this sandwich due to the overwhelming amount of celery in the filling.  I could only taste celery in each bite, which was gross. Also, the egg chunks were pretty large and not mashed like I prefer.  So, after a few bites, I was done and I sent it back.  I NEVER send things back, but it had to be done.  Luckily, they were very nice about it and brought me a chicken salad sandwich instead.  The chicken salad was much better, but not the greatest.Because I love everything else about this place, I'm going to give it a few more shots.  They serve breakfast all day, so, that might be the best bet.Went here today for the first time.  We were greeted when we arrived and chose a table in front.  Waitress came to take drink order and I put in order for my child's meal and a appetizer.  She brought the drinks but then didn't return to take the order until the app and kids meal was delivered.  We ordered our food, I fed my daughter, we ate our huge order of zucchini.  The zucchini came with a small dipping cup of ranch, we were charged for the extra ranch we needed due to the size of app.  After a while I went to go refill my drink myself and ask about our food.  2 orders of fish and chips.  It had been over 1/2 hr at this point and I knew there was a issue because I could see all the staff in the corner.  I could also HEAR them talking about a lost ticket.  We were about to leave and I even told the waitress "I just saw the cook drop in fish, is that ours?"  Wondering why it had been so long.  The waitress was sweet but clearly not trained to know how to handle a screw up.  She proceeded to lie to me and say "it takes a while because we need to make sure the fish is cooked, and what I saw was a to go order."  She clearly was oblivious that being the ONLY customers in the restaurant, no one came in for take out and I had a clear view of the cook.  Also its pretty common knowledge when you are ordering fried fish it only takes a couple minutes, not 30!  We proceeded to eat and before leaving a lady came over full of bad excuses... We switched staff, etc.  Well as I said had a clear view of the 1 cook who was there from when we walked in to when we left, and we had the same waitress so who knows what staff she was talking about.  She gave us a couple donuts which from what I have read is their "apology."   We also used a groupon, which by the way means you cannot order 1/2 the menu, no specials, etc.  Bad experience, mediocre food for the price, poor service, and penalized for using a group on.PS.. in response to Robert.  My daughter never sat on the floor, never colored on your very doubtfully "new" tile.  Shame on you. She was bored to tears at the amount of time we were there, as were we.  My experience was accurate.  I watched the SAME cook in the kitchen, and our meal there took over 1 hour.  Bought the groupon on the way in and have a time on the bill.  People came in after us and left before us.  As I stated we were the ONLY table.  There was not a 7-9 nominate delay, It took 15 minutes for app, than another 30 for meal.  The waitress LIED, a weak apology was given at end with a couple donuts.  If going back there was ever going to happen, your response has changed that.  Good luck in business.I had an extended bike ride this Sunday morning, so I decided to add breakfast into my morning ride.  I've been in the plaza several times when I was picking up Thai food nearby, but I never never stopped here.  Sunday, they open a 8 and I was there at 8:10.  A little warmer and I could have eaten outside, but it is December!Misty was my server and she was a gem!  Very pleasant smile, lots of helpful information, lots of coffee refills.  I ordered the Red Rock Bene which the menu describes as layers of Focaccia bread, bacon, fresh spinach, poached eggs, and homemade Hollandaise.  It's not "layers" of Focaccia.  Rather, there are two very large cuts of Focaccia each about two and a half to three inches tall.  I'm guessing those are the cliffs at Red Rock.  The rest was the standard Benedict except for the bacon.  The breakfast comes with choice of home fries or breakfast potatoes and if you get breakfast potatoes, you can get them plain or with fried onion and peppers.  There's a small charge for the onions and peppers, something I didn't see on the menu.The Bene was OK.  There's simply too much bread. I ate one slab and halfway through that, I moved the other poached egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff.  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and the onion and peppers were very good.  Worth the up charge.  Other than too much bread, my one complaint would be that the eggs were poached too long.  They were not runny when pierced but were semi hard yolks.  Note:  Saturday and Sunday are the only days they sell the two kinds of Benedicts.I really liked the inside.  The 60s, tie dyed things, peace symbols, and the music being played that I grew up with made for humming along with the sound track.  It was OK.  There was only one couple besides me in the place and they were at the other end so no one needed to go running out!The sign of Lucille Ball and Vitametavegamin sealed the deal for me.  A place that would have this sign is A-OK in my book!  Check out Elvis.  He's in the bathroom.So maybe Rambo's Kitchen didn't open to nationally televised fanfare, but someone is obviously reading my reviews because that's all about to change.Coming up this June they will be airing an episode of Jon Taffer's new show "Hungry Investors" featuring my favorite neighborhood diner - Rambo's Kitchen (its actually in my neighborhood).If I really think about it, I should be disappointed. I get the feeling that once the show airs, my quaint little neighborhood diner is going to become a little harder to get in to.Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Misty and the crew, and I hope the national spotlight proves to be a windfall for them all - but I will miss all the special attention they give this humble patron. I hope they remember this little guy when they hit it big. :)By the way, for those of you who thought this place couldn't get much better, they just changed their awesome homemade potato chips and now they are 'even more awesome' - thinner and crispier than before, but still as delicious as ever.And the chips aren't the only things getting better, time has certainly helped improve their skills in the kitchen, as just about everything is tasting better every time I order it.For those East-Siders who don't get around to our side of town very often, this is one place I promise is worth the drive. Pretty soon, there will be all kinds of people driving a whole long way to dine at Rambo's Kitchen.My suggestion, get here before the rush.On my last visit here, they took bad service to a whole new level. We were there a half hour before being acknowledged at our table. After ordering, we didnt get drinks for 15 mins and our food took 45 minutes!There was a server running around like a chicken without a head, nervously mentioning how she was new there. Each time we had to encounter her we wanted to ask her where the fire was. When we inquired about our food she went to check and reported back to us in such a somber, nervous way that we thought she was going to break the news that our dog died or something. Dramatic, much? Hold it together, this isn't life or death.The check was wrong on so many levels. They charged me for meat with my eggs, which I didn't get, and for a side of fruit (which could have replaced the meat), and extra for egg whites. My friend was charged for fruit, even though she plainly asked if she could sub potatoes for fruit. They accidentally brought her both, and charged her for both...It took so long to get our credit cards back that we thought we could sooner leave, cancel the damn cards, and get replacements in the mail before they'd return. After all of this, the food was just not good enough to get me back there. Ever. This place is a circus, and a poorly staged one at that.I found this place on Yelp when my husband and I were in the area for his job. I'm a total sucker for anything vintage so this place seemed right up my alley.As for the staff and the service I would give a total 5 stars for that. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She showed us the specials and never let our drinks get empty. I also would give the decor a 5 star. It's filled with old record albums from the 60's and posters from that era as well. If you visit the restroom don't let Elvis scare you! They also have a ton of board and card games you can play while you wait. How could you not like that?Now the food. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich that came on a buttery croissant. On the side I had their fresh made potato chips and coleslaw. I really liked the coleslaw! I'm very picky when it comes to this dish, but their version was yummy! (And was made with mayo! Yay!) I just wish I got a slightly bigger serving then a little tiny to go cup. The chips were huge, crisp and very tasty. The sandwich was good to, but just average. My husband ordered the "Rambo" Burger. It had a combo of chesses, bbq pulled pork and an onion ring. Which sounded delicious, but lacked flavor. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I'm going to have to go with a 4. The staff, service and decor are amazing, but I just was not that impressed with the food. I'm totally willing to go back and try it again. Hopefully I can update this review and give them the 5 stars I really hoped I could give them. Keep on going Rambo's Kitchen!I like the concept of Rambo's kitchen. Old school '60s diner with retro ambiance and bright colors. I love things that are loud and that stand out. Now the lack of execution with the food is why I give this a 2 star rating. The food doesn't stand out as much as the decor does. I've ordered many items from their menu and all have not left me wanting more. I've come to know of this place through my co-worker. Our doctor likes to order the fish and chips from here so we  do  order lunch here once in a while. Last time I ate here I had ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but unfortunately they decided to stop serving philly steak. They let me know I can have a chicken cheese steak instead. Ehhh.. I opt for it. Chicken was dry, bread was on the hard side, and fries wasn't crispy enough. I do love their ranch though. I can drink it like water. LOL.Their menu is kind of cluttered. There is too much going on. I don't know where to look first. I honestly would not eat here on my own pocket, but if the doctor wants Rambo's for lunch well I guess I have no choice. Any other day you probably won't see me here.Let's try to write another review since my last one was taken off for "personal attacks."I will keep this one short and sweet. The food at this place is very average. Without a groupon that gives you 50% off, this place would be very over priced for the quality of food one is served. The food averages around $10-$13 and although that may not be too pricey, I feel as if any random guy could cook the same quality of food. As the service goes, from reading other reviews it has come apparent to me that neither the owner nor servers are very nice. I don't like an owner who trolls on yelp to only dismiss and refuse to accept any bad reviews (the reason why my last review was deleted). I will not come back to this place to stand up for those who the owner has verbally attacked. In addition, the food isn't great and won't be missed.A wonderful "best of the neighborhood" restaurant that is probably the best kept secret in Spring Valley/Westside/Southwest . This is a self-described 60's diner. The ownership is local, the prices are friendly, the staff is motivated, and the food selection is immense. "Why is this place not on blast? "   Every helicopter parent and their Charge D'or should be here both days! "Mini Doughnuts" $2 for 6, $4 for 12. This is the utmost of comfort food: Caesar Salad $8 (add Chicken Breast grilled or breaded for 4 more)Brilliant people, brilliant concept, brilliant motivation, great prices. Why aren't you here? :)Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entrée was unacceptable in quality. FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that "the system" did not "allow" her to give any "discounts" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. His response? A defensive, "Well that's just like, your opinion." Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's "not afraid of bad Yelps" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he "doesn't give discounts."In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he "could comp the whole thing, whatever."  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.EDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 "filtered" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and/or food as well.
Quesadilla=If you are not staying at The Quad, odds are you will never find this place. Access is via a narrow escalator and you may chance on it if you are watching a show donwstairs. The place is awash in a red glow (lighting) with surfboards hanging from the ceiling and a spacious drinking area out front. The menu is typical - tacos, quesadillas, burritos, ensaladas. It was not busy on a Friday night, and mostly families and older couples were in the restaurant.But we stayed because one thing caught our eye: $1 margaritas ($2 if you get the strawberry one). All night. No limits. Even on weekends.No lines and easy drinks? I am set. The long drive to Las Vegas began to fade away after the 1st couple of sips. I'll make do with the acceptable food.
Eddie D's=Stopped by for Lunch and had a Johnny Sack (Hot Capacola, Sharp Provolone, Prosciutto, Lettuce, and Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil) $8.49.  One thing you should know is that most of their Sandwiches are made with their signature "Hard Roll", which is hard Italian Bread.  If you don't like Hard Bread, you may not enjoy this place.  I think they offer other Bread, but I'd call before you come down here.This was my 2nd time trying the Johnny Sack.....damn, it was good!  So good, I'm upping my rating for this joint to 5 Stars.  The kicker for me was the Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil....wow, that Sweet/Sour flavor brought out the flavors of the Meat & Sharp Provolone....what a great combination of ingredients!  The Johnny Sack didn't have that the last time I was here.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Will I return?  Don't be silly....of course!
Robbie Fox's Public House=My experience at Robbie Fox's Public House varied greatly from my experience at the lesser known Robbie Fox's Private House (invitation only).At the public house we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  We enjoyed the pub atmosphere.  I had the fish & chips (as I often do).  I was pleasantly surprised by the fish. It was nicely battered, thick but not too heavy.  The fish itself was done just right, flaky but tender.  There's nothing worse than chewy, overdone fish.  The "chips" were actually skinny or pencil fries, not what I expected or prefer with fish.  I prefer the thicker cut, more traditional chips.  I also enjoyed a 90 schilling.  Service was good throughout the meal.At Robbie Fox's Private House (you have to ask a server for the password to gain access to the secret entrance) I had quite a carousing time and the Irish Whiskey flowed like water. As a matter of fact, when I requested water in a futile attempt to stay hydrated and avoid a hangover, several drunken blokes at the bar turned and shouted that I had a face that would "drive rats from a barn."This of course led to a lively but short lived brawl that degenerated into Irish drinking songs.  All was tilting along fairly well then until a gnarly old hag slipped on bangers & mash that had been slung over the bar during the earlier melee.  When not a soul sprang to her aid immediately, she launched into such a profanity laden tirade that even the most jaded of drunkards about lost their ruddy color momentarily.I pulled Macklin O'Shea away just afore he mistook her for  the head in his drunken stupor and the last thing I heard her shout was  "May the cat eat you and the devil eat the cat!"I'm not sure if Robbie Fox's Private House is even open anymore but the Public House certainly is and I would recommend it for fish & chips and a bout of drinking.I like!!Great night life to it!! Really nicely designed inside and super nice bartenders as well !!! :) New top favorite on Mill Ave for now!!!
PT's=The reason why I am giving this place a 1 is over exceeding it. It should be a negative 5 star. My friends and I usually come here all the time since they live across the street. And my friend walks up to the bar and asks a simple question regarding a beer to see if there was a difference and the bartender replies "well obviously it's fucking different" with an attitude and the server stated that we should not go to the bar since she is our servicer. So does that mean you're not allowed to go to the bar to order drinks if your sitting down? The customer service from the bartender is terrible. His name is Mikey. That's just so rude for him to be a smart ass. We will never come here again!This PT's location is quite popular with my previous co-workers, and I've been here a few times to attend late-night going away parties. Located off Centennial and Losee, PT's Gold is a solid local's bar. The bar is updated and always has plenty of seating. It's never smoky in here and the people that come here are the relaxed, quiet variety. My get-togethers here usually are timed perfectly to coincide with PT's Late Night Happy Hour, which runs everyday 12AM - 2AM with half-off drinks and select $5 appetizers. I've never had the food here, just beer! On my recent visit I enjoyed a humongous draft of Heineken for only $4 (HH)! Service is great here, even with a large group of people. I'm sure I'll be back for another bon voyage party.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #189
Raising Cane's=I've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.Since I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.After a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!I munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.Will I return?  Probably not....it just didn't "Wow" me.Raising Cane's never ceases to satisfy my hunger!! I usually get the box combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips & fries, a piece of toast, secret sauce and cole slaw (you can substitute the slaw for another piece of toast =D, which I always do!)The toast is the best part to this boxed combo!! It is perfectly buttery with a crunch on the outside, and soft and delectable inside! Best bread you will have in a lifetime!The sweet tea & ice is also pretty great!! Eat there so you can enjoy unlimited refills! HAHA =)Raising Cane's just raised the bar for chicken strips to heights I never fathomed reachable for this familiar finger food.Chicken strips, chicken tenders- call them what you will. The name won't add any juice or flavor to these boneless pieces of white meat, coated in bread crumbs then deep-fried to mask their dry texture and dull nature.Ironically, in the middle of the parched Nevada desert, I found the moistest chicken strips I've ever had. The chicken was coated in a crunchy cover of breading and broke apart lightly. It came with an orange-colored, slightly tangy secret sauce that might have been some house version of thousand island. The crinkle-cut fries were cooked medium to medium-well, slightly crispy on the outside; ordinary, but they fulfill their purpose as a filler. The Texas toast was a unique surprise, a thick slice of buttery brioche slightly toasted outside while fluffy as feathers on the inside. The menu at this small fast-food chain from Louisiana is simple: 3 pieces (The 3 Finger), 4 pieces (The Box), 6 pieces (The Caniac), or 3 pieces inside a Kaiser roll (The Sandwich). All come with the toast, fries, and a drink; the 4 and 6-piece combos also have the addition of coleslaw. I got the 3 Finger Combo which was a good-sized lunch. For 6 bucks and some change, I learned that chicken tenders can be tender, and that food can be fast and affordable and still fit the bill for great grub.
Talavera=Yelp has a dearth of Scottsdale reviews on fine dining. So it stands to reason that places with only a small handful of 4 or 5 star reviews are met with a bit of skepticism. I wasn't too sure what to expect as we headed into Talavera. All I knew was that it was at the Four Seasons, so we could expect it to be pretentious and expensive. But would it be good??A resounding YES. This place was hands down the best dinner we had our entire 4 days there. My monstrous rib-eye was cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. It did not even need the smattering of gorgonzola butter that came with, I would have easily devoured this beauty all on its natural own. My husband's duo-lamb specialty was eaten with great reverence, and that plate was almost licked clean.A sweet, electric pink prickly pear blended margarita was a nice surprise in a fancy atmosphere that looked like it was made only for expensive wines. Try the Olive bread with the gorgonzola and red pepper spread. Skip the sides if you don't have the room. The ham mac n' cheese was good but I've had better. The charred corn was good, but again, I've made better. Save your appetite for the main event.The view here is simply astounding, there is no other way to say it. See my photo. If you are evening dining, you absolutely must sit outside, hopefully along the glass wall to get the best view of the grounds and valley.My steak was so good that I didn't even save room for dessert, which is virtually unheard of if you know me. Nevertheless, our tireless and friendly waiter presented the check with two little cheesecake bites on a stick covered in a shell of white chocolate. A perfectly sweet end to a fabulous pre-Anniversary dinner.Oh....and the only thing pretentious was the people sitting next to us demanding their wine, proclaiming their unhappiness, and denouncing our extremely harried (yet competent) server. Seriously, again...what is up with all the bitter people vacationing in AZ??Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third. Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? Misc:Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!
The Auld Hoose=Nachos as big as 5 Yelpers faces!On a Yelper Nacho-crawl, we ended up here. My first question was 'why had I not been here sooner?' Y'see, I was a total wee mini mosher in my day. I only didn't go to SOAD concerts for fear of being literally crushed in the mosh pits. I rarely indulge that side of my any more, but when I step into a bar and hear some good rockin' tunes on and some really ace staff who are friendly but chilled out, I feel at home.A group of 10 of us descended to feast upon their epic sized nachos. I thought I had seen big food before. But nothing compared to the big nachos. For £10.95 they say they'll feed 3 - 4. Ha. I'd reckon 5 - 6. The photos don't do them justice. Literally the biggest mound of nachos I have ever seen, heaped HIGH with chilli, and sour cream and guac. Cheese (really really GOOD cheese) melted across almost every layer. We ate for 20 minutes and it looked like we hadn't made a dent.As David S said, Man V Food proportions. I can normally eat a hefty amount and feel fine, but I actually had flashbacks to being 5 years old and giving myself tummy ache from eating just a little too much.Great value, and not scrimping on quality. Good beers and cider, friendly staff, and a kind of chilled out rock bar (rock music and rock staff, but not super loud music or super exclusive).I'll definitely be back.
Tin Front Cafe=Seriously folks, I'm not messin' around when I say this is one of thee best meals I've had in the Burgh!  Forget that they're all vegetarian, forget that it could potentially be "off the beaten path" in Homestead, just remember to get your booty there fast!Everything from the cute little ambiance (hello back courtyard in the spring!), the adorable owner and the scrumptious food... I just couldn't get enough!  To start I ordered the Pumpkin Martini.  When I think Pumpkin drink, I'm thinking creamy, but this was light but spicy and all around delicious with a cinnamon rim.  For an app we ordered the brie plate with fresh fruit on top and an ah-mazing loaf of bread that just HAD to be house made.  I really wanted to gobble the entire loaf down, the ENTIRE!For dinner I ordered the risotto in a portabella cap on a bead of greens. This sounds like a simple dish, but it was anything but!  The risotto was creamy with a light texture of what I believe was cheddar and possibly parm cheese.  The cap was grilled to perfection.  But the greens...something you'd almost toss on as a garnish, were cooked to perfection with a delicious lemon garlic sauce.  WOW!  I almost wanted to as how they cooked it because I wanted to recreate it at home (even though I knew I probably couldn't, let's be honest!).  Everything.  Just... WOW!  Toss in the half off shots when the fire bells alarm and we had a magical evening at Tin Front.  Oh wait, add one extremely friendly owner and you've got an amazing restaurant.  I will most certainly be back...maybe like tomorrow!I am so very disappointed with my visit to Tin Front Cafe today. So much so, in fact, that I am writing my first review.My friend and I stopped in for a late lunch. After an incredibly awkward exchange with a woman who we weren't even sure worked there, we were sat. The same woman, who we now know to be our waitress, brought us water and a menu. We sat for fifteen minutes, watching her sit at the bar and chat with another gentleman. After getting her attention, we gave her our order, which amounted to two cups of butternut bisque and two grilled sandwiches. Twenty minutes later, our soup is up. The chef rings a bell and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. After some time, the man sitting at the bar gets up to bring us our soup. We ask for silverware, we ask for napkins-- he brings them to the table after searching behind the bar reluctantly. We still aren't sure if he worked there.There is a hair in my friends soup. We wait, still no waitress.She comes back into the room and looks at our full bowls. This is after another ten minutes. She approaches our table and says, "You can't finish your soup?" to which I reply, "There is a hair in her soup." She asks "Where?" and we point, still floating in the bowl. She then says, "I don't see it. You must have better eyes than me," as she proceeds to take the bowl to the bar and find her glasses to search for the hair. Working in the service industry our whole lives, we are both mortified. She comes back to the table with the bowl and tells us she found it. No apology, no other acknowledgement, just "Well, what's wrong with your soup then?" I explained I wasn't interested in my soup after finding the hair. I explained I would gladly pay for it, it just wasn't appetizing to me anymore. She disappears again.At this point, we have waited an hour for two grilled cheese sandwiches and have been treated like we weren't supposed to be there. When she reappeared, she called to us from the kitchen window, "Don't you want your sandwiches?" as the bell rang. She brought us our lunch, and said "Remember when I told you it was shift change?" We were so confused what that had to do with us, or the hair in our soup, or her general rudeness. At this point, we were both very uncomfortable, so I went to the bar to request our check and a couple of boxes. She proceeded to tell me that they make everything fresh and that's why it takes time, and asked "Have you ever been here?" I told her that I had been here quite a few times and couldn't wait to bring my friend in, but that this was unlike any other experience I have ever had. It was the single most awkward encounter in a restaurant I've had. We don't particularly care about the wait for the food, it was the fact that we were treated so poorly, as if we were inconveniencing the employees by supporting their business. Needless to say, I will not be visiting or recommending the Tin Front Cafe in the future.
Caminero Mexican Restaurant=Caminero is like my mistress. I wake up thinking about you. You make me happy and never judge me. You don't get mad when I cheat on you and when I come back into your arms feeling guilty you give me a big hug. I can even bring my wife around you, although I here she is now making solo visits and not letting me watch.My latest hug was the Chorizo Breakfast burrito. Its the best I've had. Perfect blend of cheese, chorizo and eggs. The hug before that was the chicken taquitos, which might I say are hand rolled and very meaty, not from a box like that ugly whore "Berto" down the street.See you soon my love.
Rivas Mexican Food=I usually like Rivas and have ate there frequently but today KILLED it for me!!! I buy 4 entertainment books a year because my family and I LOVE to eat out, so being extremely hungry my sister and I went there today to order some food and went to use our Internet coupon from Rivas that we had JUST PRINTED!!! Some rude ignorant lady tells me that it's a fake coupon and she won't take it. I tell her we have used them before and there is a validation code on it and if she thought it was a fake call the number and validate it. She basically called me a liar and refused to do it.... THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS FOR GOOD!!! Juanita you need a better attitude and you could use a lesson in English as well!... My husband is hispanic and I am no where near a racist but if your going to conduct business you need to be able to properly understand and listen to your customers!
Luna Pizza=My new pizza place!  The pizza here is pretty dang good. So are the wings!The owner is great and it's obvious he takes pride in his business.  He's always close by the register and greets us patrons by our first name. I haven't eaten inside because I order Togo but it looks like your typical pizza parlor, it's not fancy but it is very clean.
Yanni's Gyros=Yanni's Gyros impressed me. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and let me just say, holy sh!t that thing was f'ing huge! It was packin! I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it. Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)I don't get the hype.. When compared to some of my favorite Greek/Mediterranean places such as the The Greak Greek, this place falls short...way short. This is the first Greek restaurant in which I saw Tapatio sauce on every table. Maybe I am behind on a new food trend, but Tapatio sauce does not scream Greek to me, it screams "run!". I ordered their every day special combo consisting of the traditional gyro wrap with a side of garlic feta fries and a sparkling water for which I was charged additional $.50. After tip this came out to be around ~$15. I don't mind splurging if I feel the food and quality are worth it.The wrap was BLAND...now I get why there was Tapatio sauce! They were so stingy with the Tzatziki Sauce and the meat had no flavor. The fries were nothing like the feta fries at The Great Greek.. they were some  weird fusion with a buffalo style sauce on them. I was starving and pregnant so I finished most of my meal..not like it tasted bad..it just didn't taste like much of anything. The quality of the food does not warrant the prices charged. There may have been a change in ownership, because I refuse to believe that this place is an overall 4 star rated places.
Richardson's=A New Mexican restaurant in AZ? This made me think of my best friend who lives in NM. =)I came here with a friend last night for dinner since she's been dying to come here. I think everything deserves a four star. I ordered the Pasta Hedi which was amazingly delicious! It's a pasta that comes with chicken on top of a tortilla. The sauce was sooooo yummy. I'm really into pasta so I really loved it. It also comes with a house salad which I thought was really good and very good size portion. I had to split it with my friend. We washed everything down with margaritas. I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita which definitely satisfied me after a long day..You have to try it! The service was also very good. Our server always came back to make sure everything was to our liking. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It's a great date spot.  The only reason it doesn't get a four star from me is because it's a bit pricey. Between the both of us with our entrees and drinks the bill came out to about $60. That and it's pretty far from me. I wish there was one on my side of town. But you get what you pay for! I'll definitely be coming back for that pasta and margarita again! Plus their brunch menu also looks beyond yummy and something that I'd like to try out. =)The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.I agree with everyone on here who said the food is great but management sucks.  We went in with a gift card we got for our wedding with the person who gave it to us and other friends.  It had never been used and should have had $60 on it--the server came back and said it only had $18 when we were paying the bill.  My husband wanted to handle it discretely because we were with a group, so he paid the server and spoke with the "manager" (stupid--he should never have paid until this was resolved).  The guy who bought it pulled up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid $60 and we had never been in there--so there was definitely a "mistake" made by the employee who sold it.  The manager did not know what to do and said he would talk to their computer guy when he came in later--it's been 5 DAYS now and no resolution, not even a phone call from the manager to let us know he's on it.  We have had  to call several different managers who all play dumb. I'm sorry, but this is theft--selling an $18 gift card for $60--and poor management for not handling it seriously. Too bad because we had a great brunch but I don't trust the honesty or the competency of people there. DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.Update: Filed a complaint against this company with BBB and Attorney General's office.Place is bomb dot comMust visit when in PhoenixIn my top five joints Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!Wow. Do not dine here. Please let me list the reasons why... Made a reservation three weeks in advance for a seven top reso for a bunch of Chicago 20 something's in town to go out and have a great night in Phoenix. Our server was non existent throughout our entire dinner... Our plan was to dine... Translation, spend money! No one was served more than one cocktail. When asked what to order, we were answered with; everything is good. We relied on one girl who has been here before to walk us through the menu. Food came out staggered, and when the food arrived, we asked the food runner (who was clearly the rude host with short spiked boy hair) which entree had meat and which had cheese... (We had a vegetarian in the group) she responded with, "I don't know, this is not my job" Okay, really?! As we are all completely done with this place, and parched because our waters hadn't been refilled on the 90 degree patio. I thought that I should just let the manager know about how much money they lost out on, and more importantly how neglectful his sever was. His response; I wish you would have told me earlier so that I could have fixed it. (Mind you, our entrees were still on the table) No, I'm sorry, no, let me send you dessert. No, apology or care for my complaint in anyway.... Talk about one, the server. Two, the host/food runner. Three, the MANAGER... Dropping the ball! Needless to say, we will never be back. We have now wrote this review, so hopefully other people don't go here. And lastly, to whom ever reads this internally. Find a manager who values the customer... And get a training program in place for all your other staff members who interact with the people who pay your bills.SHORT VERSION:MAJOR disappointment tonight.  Just paid $52 for 2 Pasta Heidi's (online menu says $22 each but they are now $24 each) from "Richardson's" when the EXACT SAME ITEM at "Rokerij" is $18.  Received horrendous service from Richardson's tonight.FULL VERSION:First off, it really kills me to write this.  My husband and I loved this place and met here often for dinner after work.  It's been a gem for us but I'm not sure we will go back after tonight.My husband ordered 2 Pasta Heidi's to go tonight for our dinner tonight.  Nothing else.  No sides, no drinks, nada.   It's pretty far out of our way for a to-go order (from our house) but we were craving this delicious dish from Richardson's/Rokerij big time so we were more than willing to make the trek.However, when my husband was about to sign for the bill, he noticed something felt off.  It was much more expensive than we normally pay.  He asked if the prices went up and the gal mentioned she wasn't sure, but that maybe it was because we had called the Richardson's phone number and not the Rokerij number. He then went to the Rokerij side and checked out their menu. Mind you, as many people who eat here know, there is a lot of carry over between the two.  In essence you can order many of the same items from one vs the other.  Heck, they even use the same font and menu layout!Sure enough, he was right.  There was a $6 price difference for the exact same item.  He asked about it and a male server said they had just had this conversation with management last week because it doesn't make any sense and people have mentioned it. My husband then walked back over to the Richardson's side and asked to speak to someone about it since it must just be a mistake.  Our meal was literally $12 more at Richardson's for no real reason.  After explaining the issue with the lady he was directed to (wish we had gotten her name) all she said "I don't know anything about that" and that "it is what it is" with a very condescending tone.  She neglected to offer any assistance to explore or amend the issue and smugly shrugged at him like he was crazy.For the record, if this were a mere couple dollar difference we wouldn't have bothered, but $12 is a pretty big difference.At the end of the day our experience was a seasoned patron's nightmare and it breaks my heart to share this story.If you absolutely must have the Pasta Heidi, save yourself some frustration and money by ordering it at Rokerij.Please see my photos for proof.  Both are menu screen caps from their website.   Both documents are dated 6.30.14, which indicates this is an issue they've probably known about for a while and haven't bothered to correct.This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm craving some good and fresh tasting New Mexican specialties. The flavors are out of this world and it will make your mouth dance with joy.Been to their other restaurants many times and always enjoy coming back. First got to experience this kind of treat at their older restaurant that mysteriously caught on fire. This place is a favorite of my boss and he usually pays. Nice!Love the Chimayo Chicken and on other visits order one of the Fish Specials written on the board. The appetizers are delicious and you can easily get filled up on them quickly. Really enjoyed the Green Chili French Onion Soup on my last visit. It had the perfect amount of heat for me and made me break a sweat.Service can be somewhat mediocre at times. Make sure to also bring a flashlight or have your smart phone app ready to go. It is ridiculously dark in there and can create a bit of a problem. You can always choose to eat outside at the bar or at one of the smaller tables.This is not a cheap and inexpensive dining experience. Then again it is not super duper crazy expensive. They do have valet parking at certain times so don't be surprised.Give them a shout out and get ready for some yummy flavors. You won't be disappointed. TOUCHDOWN IN MY MOUTH!4.5 STARS
Beauregard Food=They just opened so I will be gentle...My brother convinced our party of six to meet at newly opened Beauregard Food Co. for dinner this evening.  I actually wanted to try Calistro, but my brother insisted that this place was good!  He said he couldn't remember the name of it but that it's where the old Autostrada was.  Being the nice sister that I am, and always up for trying new places, I gave in.I arrived first, then Jared, and Joan... and twenty minutes later, in waltzed my brother with my aunt and uncle.  Typical.  Note to self: never trust that my brother will be on time - it still frustrates me every time!Luckily, we didn't wait on Zack to arrive before we ordered hummus with pita and a plain pita pizza as appetizers.  Joey, our server, was really sweet but I felt like the place was quite understaffed.  He was the only one really working aside from the kitchen crew. Once the rest of the crew arrived, we ordered more food and drink, but it took a really long time for the drinks to arrive and our orders came at different times.  We split three salads amongst the six of us and had a few orders of fries (sweet potato and regular) and two wraps.  The food was not amazing, but it was decent and moderately priced.  The sweet potato fries blew the regular crinkle cut fries away.Despite being full, Joey noticed that we were celebrating a birthday (Jared's), and generously brought out a box of Krispy Kreme donuts.  I later learned that the owner of BFC also owns the Krispy Kreme donut franchise next door... bonus for donut lovers!Overall, this place was A-OK - especially considering they just opened earlier this month.  I'd return eventually but I won't be rushing back immediately.  **If my brother convinces you to meet him there, take my advice and arrive fifteen minutes after the time you set to meet.
Du-Par's Restaurant and Bakery=On the advice on Angela H. , we came in search of pie. The BF has been on a quest to try all the pie and this was stop number two. This was indeed some really solid pie. I like that their daily selection is quite big, have a special seasonal pie of the month and they have a larger rotating selection that can be special ordered if it is not currently in rotation. We came to take home a pecan and a boysenberry pie. Both were good. The boysenberry was perfect, pecan a little bit too done, but still pretty tasty. I'm not a pie person but those are my two choice pies and I think they did them justice if I enjoyed it enough to eat a few slices over a course of a few days and not get sick of it. Only caveat was that it was busy, hassle to go park and walk so we wondered if it was good enough to be going there. Apparently, it was enough to try again. This time though, we found a much easier area to park and came at a less busy time. BF never had rhubarb so we got one. Good as far as rhubarb, but in the end he didn't like rhubarb. It's always busy in here so I assume this is some great diner food and wonder how I've not ended up here yet  for a after drinks meal. I can only comment on pie for now and  this is some good pie!One day while my sweetheart and I were sitting and waiting for an oil change on our car I pulled up Yelp on my phone. I was just browsing my bookmarks for a reminder of places that I still want to check out. I pulled up Du-Par's and started reading a few reviews and I showed my boyfriend some of the yummy photos and said we have got to try their pancakes sometime!Ok we are hungry as we did not have breakfast or lunch yet so the car is done and my boyfriend is headed downtown and is taking me to Du-Par's! Yay! Mmmmm I love my spontaneous boyfriend he is so loving!My first impression upon walking into this restaurant was the pie case and what did I spot? A banana cream pie to purchase and take home oh yes! I asked the kind lady behind the counter to please set the pie aside for me as we were going to dine in. I have been looking for banana cream pie made from scratch for awhile I was a bit excited when I saw this beauty looking at me through the glass! It was delicious with real whip cream and a nice cream filling with real banana slices, mmmm!We start off with two of their famous shrimp cocktails! Those were very tasty and a nice treat to start our meal off with!We knew ordering pancakes were a must so we decided to do breakfast this day! We ended up ordering a short stack (2) pancakes to share and we ordered an avocado, bacon and jack cheese omelet, comes with hashed brown potatoes and your choice of toast to split between us as well. It would have been too much food if we both had ordered a main course and pancakes plus we both started off with our own shrimp cocktail.  The food is great! I loved the homemade strawberry jelly for my sourdough toast, I have never had anything that good! The pancakes were delicious, golden butter sweet magic in my mouth! Mmmm yum those were some pancakes to savor for sure!We really enjoyed every single item we ordered including my iced tea something so simple even tasted better here! lolWe will be back for sure! The prices are higher however the quality is worth it and this is not a place you go to everyday in my opinion. It will be a spot we go to from time to time when we want something special and have a bit more money to throw around.i love the old school ways of this wonderful restaurant. All around is great, the service, the atmosphere and the food is Amazing!My phone died so I was only able to snap a picture of our shrimp cocktail and my whole banana cream pie I snapped pictures of later from home. Mmmmm yummy!Thank you Du-Par's!Breakfast, old-school Vegas style at the Golden Gate Casino.  I've lived here for 20 years and never been to the Golden Gate until Yelp told me that I should go and check out the pancakes.  Esquire Magazine said they're the best in the nation--really?  As a fan of Babystacks Cafe, I felt like a traitor the first time I ate here, but they are really two different experiences.  There's nothing like parking at Binion's and walking through the Fremont Experience with the all the lights, the sounds, the drunks, and the smoke to get to the restaurant.  The Golden Gate this morning didn't seem as smoky, though, which was nice.  I brought my gal pal who'd never been there and although she doesn't like pancakes, she loved the bacon--weird.  I had the Hotcake Sandwiches special, which was two pancakes, 1 egg, and 1 slice of bacon. The egg and bacon were standard issue, nothing special.  The pancakes, though, were scrumptious.  Fluffy and full of buttter--very rich tasting.  I couldn't even finish one of them and I don't know why!  I still love the Cinnabun pancakes at Babystacks the best, but if you're a fan of buttermilk pancakes, get downtown and experience these for yourself.I've had this place bookmarked for sometime now after reading all the rave reviews from other Yelpers.  I'm in DTLV a lot and have no clue why I've missed this place, especially with all the great reviews.  Located inside the Golden Gate Casino in Fremont.  DuPars is tucked in the corner and is a rather small restaurant.  Since Golden Gate is small itself, DuPars is easy to locate.  As soon as I opened the menu, I realized something.  I've been here before and to be honest, I wasn't impressed with my first visit.  I remember ordering what I thought was a Ham, Steak, and Eggs.  For about $15, I thought that this is a fabulous price.  When my meal arrived, I asked the waitress "where the heck is my steak"?  Turns out that I missed read the menu.  For about $15 it was a HAM STEAK and eggs.  My mistake and since I was craving steak, my first turn out wasn't good at all.  This had to be over 3 years ago and I have since learned my lesson. This time I made sure I got steak and eggs the right way.  I got their NY Steak w/eggs.  These steaks are grain fed, but I really didn't notice the difference.  The steak was a little dry and the eggs were small in portion.  I swear I probably had one scrambled egg, it's that skimpy.  My meal was just okay and since I've had better for about the same price, I have to say I was disappointed.  There's plenty on the menu, but nothing that really jumped out to me. I thought the portions were small for the price.  The service was actually better than the food.  Attentive, drinks kept full, lines but quick seating, and easy check out.  Would I come back?  I probably would only if I'm in downtown already.  I may even bring up my rating after trying their pancakes, which is what they are known for.The menu said they were voted Best Pancakes in America, so I had to order them.  Then I realized the award was given by Esquire magazine.  Hmm... what do dudes who read Esquire know about pancakes?  I want a review from Fatties Who Don't Care magazine.  Or the Aunt Jemima Fan Club.  But from fitness-conscious, fashion-aware guys with jobs... I began to doubt my order.But dangit if the folks at Metro Mag don't fully grasp the meaning of pancake perfection.Du-Par's serves the best "hotcakes" (I miss you, grandma!) I've ever eaten in a restaurant, hands down.  Fluffy, rich, sweet-n-savory yumminess.  And because we sat at the counter (do NOT make me wait for breakfast if you want to keep all your digits), I saw one of the reasons why: a ladle of melted butter goes over the top of every order.  Now, that's using your pancake.The portions are large.  Order the short stack, and don't add on too many sides, or you will end up like the Mr. -- a sighing, struggling pawn in the war between his tastebuds ("eat it all!") and his stomach ("she's gonna blow, cap'n!").Breakfast was such a delight that we made friends with the fundamentalists sitting next to us -- even after I accidentally mentioned creationism isn't a real thing.  But as we were under the influence, we all just smiled right through it.  All hail the diplomatic powers of the pancake.Perhaps my problem is that no one at our table ordered the pancakes. Those seem to  be the big thing that most people are 5-starring.I gotta tell you, though, the omelete fillings are a awfully skimpy. They say there is pepperjack cheese in the Denver omelete. I didn't see a shred of cheese in mine. Perhaps I should've sent it out for forensic analysis. And if these were three-egg omeletes, they must've been pigeon eggs.I've enjoyed much, much bigger omeletes with way more generous ingredients, for significantly less than Du-Par's $12.50.  All four of our hash brown orders were burnt.There's nothing "wrong" with Du-Par's. But there's just not a whole lot *right* with it, either.My 100th review deserves to be a 5 star one! Congrats DuPars! I've been hearing about this place for a while now. Old cafe style in a run down casino?! I'm there! Not to mention the claim of the "worlds best pancakes" was a bit intriguing. My daughter, boyfriend and myself were heading downtown not sure exactly of our destination and I remembered this place. If you valet park at the golden gate, it's a simple walk thru the small casino. Otherwise park anywhere allowed downtown and find your way. The waitresses and decor somewhat reminded me of a Waffle House. So right of the bat I was happy. The breakfast and lunch menu had TONS of comfort food classics. Never in my life did I think I'd order a meatloaf sandwich, but I did and was so happy about it. The kid had French toast with blueberries and the boyfriend went with a chicken pot pie. And then of course as a table we ordered a nice stack of pancakes. The super sweet waitress actually stopped and asked if we were serious when ordering all this food. (Did I mention I also had a $3 shrimp cocktail?) Well be proud miss waitress cuz we killed it ALL. The pot pie needed a little salt n pepper, but THAT'S IT! That's my only complaint. Great food. Genuine service. Exactly how I would expect an old school, cafe, Waffle House, waitress in cute outfits- type of dive should be! Well done.Part I:  L.A.

Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the "bear claw" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.After our UYE hike at Red Rock Canyon, we came here to have some lunch.  I opted to skip breakfast foods and go with a Reuben sandwich with french fries.  The sandwich was good but it needed some more Thousand Island dressing a good Reuben has.I am upping my rating to  four stars because of the excellent service we got when our previous server went on break, quit, or whatever, and we got Elias.  He got me a cinnamon roll to go and made sure it was packed well in a styrofoam container and then put in a paper bag.  He was also OK with our group of ten getting singleton and doubleton checks.  It just didn't bother him and was part of his job.Now, the Golden Gate needs to validate parking tickets whether you have a slot card or not!  You earn enough from Du-Par's.  That's a deal breaker for me with much of downtown.We visited Du-par's on this occasion for Sunday brunch.  This restaurant does a wait line like a buffet, not a list, so we like to sit at the counter if it's available. It is easier than standing in line with no estimated wait time.  Plus the counter seats are very comfortable and you get a real diner feel.  On this visit, we only waited about 5 minutes before counter seating opened.  The poor hostess was seating people, bussing tables, cashing customers out, and dealing with pies, so we were glad to be one less group she had to deal with.Today we ordered several items to share.1. Blueberry muffin 4/5.  It was soft and flavorful, but the waitress nuked it a little too long.2. The short stack of pancakes 5/5 (I'd give them 10 out of 5 if I could).  These are the best pancakes I've had in Vegas.  They do something sinfully good that you only see if you're sitting by the counter.  They have a hot butter dispenser and the pour hot butter all over the cakes!  Holy cow is this amazing.  Don't tell my arteries!  They were served with warm syrup in a cute little pitcher.3. Denver omelet 4/5.  The omelet was light and fluffy and not gunked down with cheese like so many places do to ruin a good omelet.4. Traditional Eggs Benedict 4/5.  No complaints, just how eggs Benedict should taste.It's rare for me to place experience above food. When it comes to dining, the most important thing to me is what I put in my body. And the food here? It's a'ight. Solidly decent diner food. Omelets, pancakes (which are allegedly delicious), sandwiches, pies, eggs n' meat, etc. My Denver omelet was decent enough, with the size being the major plus. My turkey sausage links? Not so much. But what really seems to fit the bill here is simply the authentic classic diner experience. This is an old school coffee shop/diner in the exact sense. You walk in and are greeted at a cash register, there are vinyl booths and a long counter with fixed swivel-stools (also covered in vinyl), and uniformed servers cutting pies, buttering toast and pouring drip coffee into classic white diner mugs. It's something I haven't seen in quite some time, and I like it. I'm kind of on a weird diet right now so I didn't get a chance to try the much-lauded pancakes, but I saw quite a few come out and they looked great. So did the hashers (man I miss those). And everyone dining there (mostly at least 20+ years older than me) all looked like they were enjoying their ham-steak and eggs, pancakes, etc. Pluses include classic diner service, atmosphere, and portions. Food quality hits about middle here. I've had a lot worse diner food. So if you're in the market for a solid greasy-spoon breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is your diner.One night, I wandered the streets in a state of what can only be described as "hangry." I was in a foul mood since my dinner plans fell through for the night. I stumbled across Du-Par's and they won me over with the promise of pie. My corned beef sandwich wasn't fancy but it was good. I opted for a half sandwich so I could have a slice of pie later. The selection of pie is very good and has something for everyone. I had a slice of egg custard that was rich in flavor and firm in texture. I wasn't disappointed. It's a great place to chill if you're tired of the bustle of Fremont. the old time feel of the place is comforting in so many ways. It's quiet enough to have a conversation but has a steady stream of customers. Things pick up more late night.I knew I was going to like this place (inside the Golden Gate Casino) when I walked through the door and saw Fresh Strawberry Pie in the display case.  I've eaten here 3 times so far!  Thanks to Yelpers Sylvia, Nelson, Norm, Terri, Mel and Ric for their reviews or else I would have never known this restaurant existed! For my first meal I ordered the Famous Shrimp Cocktail,  the Beef Stew, a slice of Fresh Strawberry pie AND the Pie of the Month which was the Fresh Peach Pie. The beef stew was kind of bland, but the meat was very tender.  It came with a plain roll.  I tried it with the gravy, but it didn't help.  I tried the roll with the butter...oh yeah! ! The Strawberry Pie was great... mmm to fresh fruit! The Peach pie was made with wedges of fresh fruit. I think I was supposed to cut it with a knife, but I really enjoyed biting through the wedges of fruit. So happy that the peaches weren't mushy!On my second visit, I ordered the Ultimate Trio which consists of a half sandwich, soup or salad, and a slice of pie. I got the Corned Beef Sandwich which was a disappointment because it was cold and it was between 2 pieces of plain bread.  I needed mustard and mayo. They were out of the Beef Barley Soup (shucks), so I got the tasty (but mushy) macaroni vegetable soup. The Cherry pie was really yummy - but then, I like pie in general because it's too challenging for me to make.  I'd rather have someone else make a pie! Note: The Fresh Fruit Bowl that came with the meal, was super because of the intense flavor.  Fruits shipped to Hawaii just don't taste like this! For my third visit, I got the famous Pancakes and the French toast (which was recommended by the waitress - it was average) and the Corned beef hash with eggs & hash browns (just okay).  GET THE PANCAKES!  I was skeptical because - how good can a pancake be?  The fluffy, buttery goodness is WOW!  I'm sure it's because there's butter in the batter!  It's awesome! The place has a cozy, old fashioned feeling. The service varies, depending upon where you sit.  You won't get much attention if you sit at the counter and have a super busy waiter.  Just stick with the recommended dishes (Shrimp Cocktail and Pancakes) and you'll be fine!  I want to go back for the Lemon Meringue Pie and maybe the Blueberry Pie.  The other pastries look good, too...let's go!I think I made a few mediocre menu selections here. What were they? Glad you asked!The chicken noodle soup: Dare I say I'm a chicken soup connoisseur? You're damn right I'm a chicken soup connoisseur! Does that mean I'm picky? Nope. I give the benefit of the doubt and I know that not all soups can live up to my expectations, but above all else chicken in soup should never be dry. How is it even possible when swimming in broth?The French dip sandwich: A classic hangover meal for me and a pretty damn good gauge when it comes to diner food. Unfortunately this dip fell a bit short on a few levels. First of all, for around $12.00 I expected a little bit lager sandwich and it was easily consumed in 6-8 bites. How about some more dry meat? You got it! To round it all out they are stingy with the beef au jus, which mean you have to be stingy with the au jus. When it comes to French dips, I dip and I dip hard. Dainty dipping just didn't cut it. Expect this star rating to go up because I'm sure to be back with some better menu knowledge.
Stingray Sushi=Stingray's grand opening was definitely a scene... it was packed but isn't that what grand openings are all about?  That night I sampled a few of their specialty cocktails, and I was not disappointed.  And when I was planning a girls night out tonight for my mom-in-law and I to go have dinner and see Sex And The City 2, I thought of Stingray... it was perfect.  We sat outside and while the view could've been better (they are doing renovations to the building nextdoor), the table was comfortable and the service was extremely attentive.  We started out with a seaweed salad and how could we not order drinks before the show?  Joanie had the Geisha A Go Go (watermelon infused vodka cocktail) and I went with a dirty martini... it was perfect!  We shared a few rolls - a futomaki, and eel, and a lollipop roll.  All were delicious.Stingray in Old Town is my go-to sushi spot, but it's so nice to now have an alternative for nights like tonight on the other side of town.  And a note about the parking - the first two hours are free... just validate your little coin and you'll be all set.  Enjoy!Miso happy.Miso love Biltmore Stingray.Miso love our lovely server.Miso LOVE the open decor, the soothing colors and the comfortable furniture. Miso happy.Miso love the Miso, the yellowtail nigiri, the dragon roll, the spicy tuna roll...miso can't even remember all the yummy sushi goodness I engulfed.Miso ready to go back.Miso happy!Stingray has an awesome happy hour and it is not limited to just the bar area. You can enjoy half priced drinks and rolls in the entire restaurant until 7pm. I went there yesterday and tried the lemongrass infused vodka (yum) and had a bunch of different rolls and the calamari tempura. While it may not be the best sushi in town it is more than decent and cheap, cheap, cheap.Great place to meet up with friends after work, but expect it to be crowded as more people learn about the smoking deal on happy hour.Ok......now this has been the best sushi spot so far since I've moved here!! The setup inside is good for a late night hang out in the bar section and the dinning area is open inside and outside. The sushi bar is decent as well. The service is solid. The hostesses at the front are really polite and accommodating. On Friday and Saturday nights it can get a little busy but the wait has never been to long. I've never waited for more than 20mins. The menu is pretty robust. They have a large selection of rolls and seafood dishes that are amazing.... I recommend the shrimp & scallop entree. You won't regret it. I have tried many rolls and non have ever been a disappointment. All in all I would have to say that this is the best sushi in town. If anyone can top this spot please let me know!! GO SUSHI!!!!!!

Dine inside and get the full experience!
Picosito Mexican Grill=Ok, so this is right down the road from me, so I thought convenience!  Unfortunately, that did not save this place.1. menu is expensive.2. Food is alright, but not memorable in any way really3. The staff are pretty much worthless.  I went there 3 times... 3 times!  And each time they screwed up the order.  The girlfriend is vegitarian, and of course they still put meat in it, so she couldnt eat her dinner.  Then when we told them about this, they just said sorry and thats it.  The next time we went back we ordered churros, didnt get them, but they didnt forget to bill us!  Of course, when we called they said "ohh well come back and you can have them.  Yes I get that, I paid for them, but lets not go out of our way and go above and beyond... lets just make me waste my time and gas for your screw up... and then there was another time they screwed it up.So we have a rule.. 3 strikes and your out!  Would not recommend this place...
Rocket Burger & Subs=I love mom-n-pop type establishments. I love really good chili dogs, fresh-cut fries, gyros, and other sandwiches. I love it when the staff smiles and greets you when you enter the establishment. I love having a wide array of beverages to choose from, many of which are not available in most  food establishments. And I love it when you get all of these in a place where the prices are extremely affordable. What more can I say -- I love Rocket Burgers and Subs! And I love the fact that it is in my neighborhood.It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- *More Real Than The Original*...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  ...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.I feel like I made a new friend.Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.Their chili burger with cheddar is terrific! Their onion rings have a light cornmeal batter, so they're more onion-y and crispier than onion rings you'd find at most burger places. With one of their many kinds of root beer, this meal combo was fantastic. Love this place!Okay so I've said before that I'm a big fan of owner operated businesses, and small local businesses. This place is one of them. You walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about 250 different specialty sodas. All priced at a $1.89 and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers. One of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like. Very friendly and helpful!!!!! While I was there I asked a couple questions of the owners. One was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich? The guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good. Indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right. Needless to say my sandwich was well portioned. Rand H. and I both got a Large Ruben on Sourdough and split an order of fries. I really like this place for a lot of reasons, some of which I noted in my review. While we were eating I saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish.I must apologize to Norm , Daren and Iain for not listening to my favorite No Pho friends sooner.. Because I made a BIG mistake waiting to go here!! I will promptly make up for it by going as many times as possible this week!! I love this place , yup local owned with a sense of mom and pop goodness. Reminds you of back east...The soda selection is phenomenal and looks great on display as you eat. The Ruben is my new favorite , rye bread , juicy well seasoned pastrami, sauerkraut and light toasty goodness. Plus one had the Cheese steak that was really good except he opted for extra heat and I couldn't handle it .. but still great. Fries are fresh and plentiful ....one basket will serve 2-3 people . Go here Go here now ....and take a friend , let's not waste another moment.'There is no way we are going to finish all of this' This is what we told ourselves we stared at the sizable amount of food placed in front of us.  What possessed us to order two double cheeseburgers, fries AND onion rings?  We wanted them. That is why. I can see how easy it is to over-order at Rocket Burger. Everything looks good. Cheese fries with real cheese? Yes! Rocket (onion) Rings that magically and mysteriously aren't greasy? Yes! Tender, juicy burgers with lots o' cheese? Yes, Yes, Yes! Rocket Burger isn't fancy. It isn't a 'dress to impress' destination. In fact, it appears that maybe once upon a time it was a convenience store. Coolers line one wall containing a fascinating assortment of beverages, including one whole section dedicated to root beer, and one drink the owner admits tastes like 'tree'. Really, tree. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist! The charm in Rocket Burger is that it isn't trying to be something it is not. In fact, you can see the whole open kitchen area behind the counter/cash register. It is simply good food, prepared and served by friendly owners and staff. Oh and yes, we ate it all. :)Just had their latest creation - the chicken tender bites salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-ZBfr1BHvArFp1d6XH8jOQ?select=VQg07pVUi7ZiSTao92KkRg  It was mega-flavorful! I love that this is not a chain eatery; it frees them to be creative, so they keep coming up with delightful new things to offer.Never Ending This describes the choices of food and drink here. On today's menu was a small toasted California Club and a Black Cherry sodee-pop. Don't let the sound of small fool you either, it is huge! Crammed packed with turkey, bacon, tomato and sprouts. This is a sub to try!The staff including the owners are amazing. They have such a great selection of food and drink you can take your picky eating kid or a cranky grandad, both will find something to enjoy.Wowza!  This place is AMAZING!  Thanks to Paul V. I was able to try Rocket Burger many times and every time has been fantastic.  I had the Bacon double cheeseburger  with fries or cheese curds and it's so delicious.  The burger is greasy, cheesy, and has lots of bacon.  Ya can't go wrong!  The french fries are also good, especially the cheese fries.   Paul has ordered take out from here for me quite often as well.  The cheese curds get a bit mushy if not eaten right away so go with french fries if you have take out.  Whether you eat in or get take out the food is awesome!Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!Seeing is the name of this place is "Rocketburger", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........Rocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a "rocket sauce" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird "tang" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.Diet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!The guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back.Rocket Burger & Subs is a very casual and divey. You won't get the most high end burger in the valley but you'll get 100% angus flat patties that are prepared to your likening  and are delicious with several choices of sizes and toppings. Besides burgers they offer sandwiches, subs, beef hot dogs, soft serve, floats and the biggest selection of bottled sodas I've ever seen. Portions are very large and prices aren't much more than fast food. You are getting food that's MUCH Better than fast food.After watching RB&S on Check Please Arizona I went with what everyone else tried the popular NY Double Burger with fries. I liked that they carefully toasted the buns and the burgers were prepared medium just like I asked for and were juicy and tasty. A generous amount of tasty grilled pastrami and house made slaw and rocket sauce topped the burger. It was all good tasty and humungous and a giant amount of fresh cut fried potatoes were yummy too. Check out Rocket Burger!It's a Blast!Came here yesterday because I was craving a burger. This is definitely a no frills type of place.  8 or so tables with order at the counter service (they'll bring your food to the table when it's ready). Settled on the Cali burger and a vanilla milkshake.  While I waited, I browsed what seemed to be an infinite number of bottled soda selections.  They were categorized by what appeared to be flavor so you can hone in on what you're in the mood for.  Both of the girls working the counter were extremely pleasant.  My food (to go) took about 7 minutes from the time I ordered it.  Total for the burger(single patty, no fries) and milkshake was about $9.50.  Got home and tore that burger apart.  Man, that was good.  I liked the Rocket Sauce that came on the burger.  Think a ketchup/mayo blend with a ton of pepper for kick.  I didn't even need to put ketchup on the burger.  The bacon was crisp (score!) and the avocado perfectly ripe. The buns they use are also on point.  Definitely more "sturdy" than a traditional bun (it reminded me of challah bread).  I saw a couple other burgers I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back and bring some friends along.
Hussong's Cantina=The only reason I'm giving this an extra star is because I didn't get a chance to try their food. I'm keeping an open mind.This place was listed under "late night food" at the Mandalay Bay's selection of restaurants. We arrived at 12am expecting to satisfy our hunger after coming back to our hotel. Their "late night" menu only runs from 11pm-close, which was at 12am. Not only do you get only 1 hour to eat your food, but doesn't late night usually go until at least 2am??Also, when we arrived at the restaurant, there were no workers on the floor, so we decided to seat ourselves. The TVs were all still on and the small place still had quite some tables eating their food. I figured they were just a little busy, being that they had "late night specials". When a staff member finally spotted us, he didn't say anything. We had to ask if we could get menus, only to find out that the restaurant had already closed.They need to make a "WE ARE CLOSED!" sign.I have found my new spot! I really wanted to give this place 5 stars I really did! Our server was terrible :(OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I'm totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called "The Romance".We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.I had the "Enchiladas Suizas" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.My man had the "Beef Fajitas" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.My mans Dad had the "Chili Relleno"  and this cost $16. He really enjoyed it.I totally recommend this place to anyone who loves margaritas and great Mexican food!!!!!When I heard the name "Hussong's" I thought it was some type of Chinese restaurant. But paired up with the name "Cantina" threw me off as it's actually an Americanized-Mexican resto within the Mandalay Bay Shoppes. PERKS+ great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys)+ gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the "Bull Dog" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria+ FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu)+ CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!DIRTS- prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more)- noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers- not authentic- mediocre drunk grubFYI*located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor*you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all*laundry list of margaritas are available *drinks range from $8-14*many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game *Rick Moonen's "RM" restaurant is just around the corner for sustainable seafoodI came here with my co-workers for a little get together after a meeting. I'm not sure if I'd eat at this establishment again. But for great service, good drinks and mediocre food, it's okay, but probably not my first choice.Maybe I just had an usually smooth experience here, but I loved it! I fully expected it to be douchey as hell, based on the whole marketing B.S...but I was really pleasantly surprised and will be back!My experience was around 8pm on a Wednesday evening, we were seated immediately at a good table, the service was EXCELLENT and very attentive, and what I ordered was fantastic!I had the huarache, which was fanTAStic. The meat was seasoned well and everything just came together perfectly. Even the chips & salsa they put out are amazing...some of the best tortilla chips I've had at a Mex place.My friend had the carnitas platter, which he wasn't thrilled with but said it was OK. And we shared a pitcher of margaritas. I think the total tab was $70...not too bad, seeing as we had 3 small margaritas each, plus food.This is an ok optional for a casual lunch. The service was ok as was the food. The place is deep and narrow with a long bar on one side. The decor is ok.The chips and salsa they bring out is ok. The chips were crispy and the salsa had ok flavor. For my meal I ordered the steak stacked quesadilla. You get a good sized portion. It should fill up most people, especially after snacking on chips and salsa. I would have liked the steak to have better flavor. It certainly could have benefitted from some seasoning. The chipotle aioli inside does make up for the bland flavor of the meat. None the less, the meat should stand on its own if needed.Our server was ok. She came around with good frequency but made a few small mistakes with the orders. Overall it was an ok experience.Yum! Since I'm at MB often I always come here for lunch. I frequently get the mango habanero guacamole XTRA HABANERO! And it never disappoints. Home made chips and a side of habanero sauce how could you go wrong? The veggie tacos and the Mexican street corn are equally enjoyable. I haven't been able to enjoy a margarita yet but I've heard they're amazing. Shout out to the manager Chad! He's awesome.
RNR Gastropub=It always nice to be one of the firsts to see a new restaurant, nightclub, bar, etc.  Especially because the service is typically great, everything is shiny & new.  And the enthusiasm of many familiar faces is felt from the moment you walk in.   RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.  There was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.There are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for "The Place" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)My girlfriends and I ventured into RnR last night for their first night open.  What a gorgeous building and warm atmosphere.  RnR is going to be the perfect spot for day drinking (due to their abundance of outdoor seating).  My favorite structural aspect of the decor was the wine wall - you can't miss it.We didn't sample the menu items, just the cocktails.  The cocktails were great - an unusual selection of specialty cocktails. The menu has a a variety of selections without being overly pretentious. I can't wait to visit again to see how RnR settles in.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great place frequent for lunch and for nights out.OK, this is not a food review. ...let's start with the good. Great space, beautiful, modern industrial space, good outdoor space. Well, that ends the good. So, on a Sunday before a spring training game I showed up hoping for a fun brunch before some work. After checking in and requesting the "rare" and unavailable breakfast menu, we were seated on the upstairs patio...and then the wait began. And...we waited...and waited...and wait, that table over there apparently has a server. Oh apparently he isn't our server. OK, well the table behind us complained. So, that table got a "well I'm not your server but I am helping out."  So...20 minutes in, hmmm, maybe this place can't plan for the reality pre-game Giant's game, or maybe they think this is Suede or some other "club" where people come in despite the horrendous lack of attention to detail and service...but hey, we can wait a few minutes longer...but should we need to wait 20 minutes? OK, let's go to the bar. WHOA! All the waiters are hanging out around the computer entry system..."Umm, dude, what's the code for water?" Ummm, hey, there are 6 of you here, how about serving some tables. I'm no expert, just a suggestion. Let's leave. So...I can't speak to the food, but a good source tells me it matches the service. Disappointing at best! Please don't waste that building!  Either get your act together or hand over the space.  Scottsdale is full of wannabes...it doesn't need another.We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again." He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcoholHonestly my lunch was just okayHonestly they have a drink called the stigmataHonestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hypeBut, I am supposed to be honest.This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. What I paid for this was ridiculous.The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.The food was meh.Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!In my opinion, Sunday Funday should always start off with a bottomless mimosa brunch, and RnR is just the spot to do that. For $10, you can get all the mimosas or Bloody Marys your heart desires and your liver can handle from 10am-2pm. Our party of five must have averaged 7 per person. Key word is "averaged." There were two in our group (who shall remain nameless) who probably pounded at least a dozen.The food was really good! I'm not really sure what the whining is all about from a lot of the other reviewers. I loved my pork hash and maple bacon scone (genius), and my friend's grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, brie and sun dried tomatoes and side of sweet potato tater tots (even more genius) were delish! Obviously, service was amazing, as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long. We had fun being rowdy out on the patio, which is an ideal spot on a nice sunny day. Happy hour specials (daily 3p-7p and reverse happy hour W-Th 10pm-2am) are awesome. Make sure you follow them on FB as well, as they're always announcing other specials.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6 other times because I tried to give your restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and I will not return. Despite one experience with good service, there have been six other times when I have had  incredibly awful service. That's not a good ratio and at this point, I just can't justify coming back nor would I recommend RnR at all.My most recent experience sealed the one star review. First, there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us. We sat ourselves. Then, we sat at a table for about 10 minutes. No waiter to be seen. No one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons. Ah ha! Next, we spot a waiter. After inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter was/if they were closing or something (trying to give them benefit of the doubt) the waiter looked at us begrudgingly, gave us a half eye roll and said, "I guess I can serve you."Well, after that remark I just wanted to get up and walk out. But I stayed (a decision that I now regret) only to experience more poor service. We needed more drinks, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and I know my order wasn't being taken or put into the computer... instead it looked like social hour. Unprofessional. This is not the first time that I have experienced inattentive and no-where-to-be-seen service at RnR, and I guess I should have known better. I don't even think my request to be seated so that I could have a waiter take my order was THAT outlandish.I work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some "RnR" on the weekends. So, with lots of other places (like AZ88, Old Town Tavern, Mabel's on Main, Firehouse, Pattie's, The Lodge, Geshia-A-Go-Go, and the list could go on) where I can count on being served... by an actual live body nonetheless... who doesn't even make me feel like they hate me just because I walked through the door... there's no reason to come here.It was especially awful to be treated so poorly when I'm a Giants fan, and my team's flag is hanging out front of the establishment!! I'm going to pass on anymore of this place's "RnR," as I'm pretty sure it actually stands for "Really Rude" service.Bumpe up to a 4.  this place deserves it!  Tots Fun.  Tots Cool.  Tots The SHIZZLE!"Dirty Bits... Dirty Bits.."  *singing*  whenever I pass this restaurant, I think of that song by the Blackeyed Peas "The TIme -- Dirty Bits" because this restaurant has these awesome Dirty Chips!   Homemade chips with blue cheese, bacon, cheese... Yums... I usually love them.I like RnR for 2 reasons... Dirty Chips and Sunday Brunch/Day Party.  When I have friends in town, this is the place we skip church to go to for food and bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's from 10-3pm.  If you have these type of friends in town, this is a cool place to go for brunch and bypass the snooty brunch locations in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  RnR has the craziest hours of a restaurant like this... 8am - 2am.  Yes folks... I have gone here after a night out for those Dirty Chips.... Dirty Chips. *singing*A DJ starts around 10ish.  If you have a large party, make a reservation.  Get there just before 10 to avoid the crowd.This place calls itself a Gastropub, but I wouldn't.  I think of it as a cool local bar eatery.Return Factor: 100%.RnR is a great place to grab a drink and take in a game. Stopped in here at 10pm on a Saturday and the bar was in full swing. The bartenders are wicked fast, they had to be keeping up with over 100 thirsty patrons and the service was as impeccable as it was speedy. There was also a great mix of people and the male to female ratio was perfect. Something you normally would never see at a bar like this. I really enjoy the floor plan of this establishment as it opens up to the street providing an airy feeling without losing any energy. The drink prices were very reasonable as well, a trend I noticed throughout Scottsdale. Maybe it is that OC/LA is that damn expensive? Your call.I also noticed they offer a full menu and will have to return on my next visit to AZ to sample their offerings. As a bar alone you get no complaints from this Yelper. RnR brings the ruckus!To be honest, I love this place. There's two different types of environments I've encountered here: Sunday morning and every other day/night. SUNDAYS:Now let me tell you, if you like to people watch, Sunday Brunch is the place you need to be. They do bottomless mimosas (or bloody Mary's), which is either 25 dollars without food or (I believe) 15 dollars with the purchase of an entry...which is usually 10-15 dollars. You might as well get the food! Also, they serve mimosas till 2. Be aware if they are having large groups come in, because when we got there right when it started, it was a 2 hour wait....but you can always walk in a sneak a place at the bar! No reservations there. Plus, I like the bar better. You don't have to worry about an extra wait time on your drinks because the bartender stands right in front of you, the second your drink is empty, you blink and BAM! Drinks are ready. They also have a DJ playing, loudly, so if you plan on sitting and having a nice discussion, go somewhere else. Everyone that attends Sunday brunch is very composed...until about noon. Then you have drunk ASU kid + every other type of person in their 20's dancing, then ordering shots and this is where the real drama unfolds. I urge you to check this out, because it is hilarious. The things I witnessed on my trip to the bathroom (which took 20 minutes trying to wiggle my way through the crowd) are permanently burned in my memory. Awesome way to spend the early portion of your Sunday. You know, if you aren't going to church. MON-FRIDAY:They have great drink and food specials. And their food is amazing. 3-7pm they do half of select drinks (with a great beer menu) and 6 dollar select plates... Dirty chips for the win! They also do somewhat of a reverse happy hour from 10-midnight it's half off ALL food and 1/2 off select drinks. If you want to come in and try their food without spending too much money, this is the way to go. And if you didn't get the memo above, their service is great. I always find myself talking to our servers at our table instead of just ordering. I think we've even invited them to sit down with us a couple of times. One time they did! Haha very down to earth staff, very approachable. There was one occurrence when we had ordered food and a pitcher.... After eating and finishing our beer, we didn't see our server for 15-20 minutes, we asked another server to bring us our bill if he got a chance, when he brought it buy us.. Our total was 0.00!! They said "sorry for you wait"... Now that is service!!! I think we tipped him the entire bill cost, but how awesome is that! FOOD SUGGESTIONS:Dirty Chips: (as an appetizer) it's bacon, ranch, bleu cheese, buffalo sauce and their house chips. It's Amazing. Taco Plate: (at brunch) you get 3 tacos: chorizo and egg (the best) potato and egg (tied for first) and bacon and egg. I want to say they all come with cheese too. Plus you get a side of potatoes.Chicken sandwich: now this isn't some plain chicken sandwich it comes with BRIE on focaccia bread with some type of aioli sauce and sundried tomatoes. Is is a heavenly sandwich for lunch or for dinner.Sorry this review is so long. I just love this place. Haha I hope you try it!
The Notorious P.I.G.=*sigh*Initally, I gave this place a 4 star review this morning, but I decided that I needed to be honest, and share an experience here that I had that initally I had wanted to leave out, but now i feel that I can't.  I wanted to ignore what *really* happened, as it's been bothering me more and more and more as the day has gone on.When I came here, the place was empty.  It was just 2 workers, and not a soul in sight.  Despite the food being good, the service here left me feeling angry and upset.  Here's why:The guy that seated me, (and obiously worked here as some form of staff member) made it his point to flirt with me non stop, so much so that it actually RUINED my experience here, and I don't know that I will be back.  He was so aggressive in his tactics, that he actually had the balls to pull up a chair TO MY table while I was trying to eat and enjoy my dinner.  Mind you, I was alone, and trying to enjoy a good book and some quiet time...and this douche ruined it.He sat with me through the majority of my dinner, asking me personal questions about if I was single, what kind of guys Iike, and other personal questions that I found grossly innapropriate.  I was so annoyed, that I actually had my dinner boxed up and left half way through, lying and saying that I had somewhere to be....just to get out of here.I found it rude, annoying, and downright disrespectful that a staff member at this establishment made it his personal playground, and taking it upon himself to not only hit on me, but spend most of the time sitting AT MY TABLE talking to me discussing things that I found grossly inapporpriate.Due to this experience, I will NOT be back to this location.  EVER.
Pita Shack=11/09/10Was going to Whole Foods to buy a few staple items when I was hit w/ a craving for falafel.  Remembered there was a pita shop next door, so popped in after dropping some cash at Whole Paycheck.  (I actually am a fan of WF and am willing to part w/ some cash to get bread and organic uncured thick-cut bacon my system can actually stomach!)  Service was friendly, as always, and I even scored a whole piece sample of their delicious homemade walnut-filled baklava!  (It's topped w/ pistachios, so those w/ a mild pistachio allergy could just peel the top layers off, and you're good to go.  Believe you me, the remainder is well worth the $2 (or maybe less... IDK, I didn't pay!) you'll fork over for it.  :)The falafel patties were huge!  However, just like the hummus they're made w/, they weren't very flavorful, but I liked the crunch of the patties, even if they were on the dry side.  The extra sides of hummus and tahini didn't really add any flavor, but they helped to mitigate the low moisture content of the falafel.  I wouldn't buy another falafel pita here (2 stars), but the friendly employees, clean environment, and the complimentary dessert deserved an extra star!It's Tempe AZ... not Irvine or Laguna Niguel, and frankly, I was ready for Mexican. I really wasn't expecting a decent short list of Middle Eastern cuisine cafes. But yet, I found that short list on Yelp. Lucky for me, the yelp reviews for Pita Shack were all good. And even luckier, after driving into Phoenix around 630p, I was tired, but tired with an appetite. I lucked out..... fresh food, fair prices, and because I didn't give in to the burger joints from Indio to Phoenix..... I had an appetite. And... PS is only a couple minutes from the Embassy Suites, Tempe.This is a small shop, with a clean kitchen, and they cook everything to order! Don't expect fast service (although it isn't a long wait either)... because they're cooking from scratch, so to speak. While the falafel mix is ready to go, they form your falafels, and then put them into the fryer. Your kabobs are cooked to order. The only thing that was already prepared was the lentile soup, which was excellent!For a total of $24 with tax, I ordered the Combo Kabob Dinner with steak and chicken, rice, salad and soup, the 6 pc falafel appetizer, an "abundantly filled" gyro sandwich. While I'm not going to say the overall quality was better than our local Panini Grill chain, for a family run restaurant, I feel they're a very solid 4 star. My wife's side is Lebanese Brasilian, and I'm around spectacular Middle Eastern food on a regular basis. I even have my own hummus recipe... so for me to feel comfortable and satisfied with Pita Shack can be taken as a strong endorsement. When I'm in the PHX area on business, and if I'm staying at the Tempe Embassy Sts., I'll probably choose PS before any other local place.
Grand China=After hiking out in the Sloan Canyon National Recreation Area, Grand China was my post hike lunch. I had used the Von's Shopping Center as the trailhead to access the Henderson trails leading into Sloan Canyon. Not too far from Von's but closer to BW3 is Grand China. I'd catch their lunch special.   The Grand China lunch special is a hot deal. Literally!  For $6.50 you get a choice of entree, either hot & sour or egg drop soup, fried rice, egg roll, and a beverage. You have to get there before 4.  The restaurant is more of the cozy than take out Chinese restaurant. It is a full service restaurant.  From the time I walked in to when I left, the service was good.   I ordered the beef chow mein lunch combination with hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup was hot and delicious. I am of the opinion that soup is their strength. A yelper and friend complimented my picture of the hot and sour soup saying it looks delicious. Terri. R stated in her review that the soup was good. Plus 1 for me. This encourages me to return to try their wonton soup. The soup was the strong point of the lunch. That does not mean the beef chow mein and fried rice were weak. Not the least. As a matter of fact the beef chow mein was good. But! The beef chow mein was not as good as The Lotus in downtown Henderson and the food was not as good as some of the local Chinese restaurants I dined in.   In conclusion, Grand China is not the best Chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. It is a good Chinese restaurant that features a reasonable lunch special.
Chompie's Deli=Latkes and blintzes and pickles oh my!I just came from dinner here - best NY style deli in the valley.  I am thrilled and a little frightened at the implications of Chompie's opening 5 minutes from my office.I thoroughly enjoyed the crispy, slightly oniony latke (potato pancake) appetizer.  My chocolate phosphate was to die for.  Maybe not that good but it was spot on.My corned beef on rye?  Like buttah.  Oy like I need a great corned beef sandwich 5 minutes from the office.I loved the decor and the hustle and bustle the place already has.  Great NY scenes all around blended in with an open modern feel.Bonus wifi room past the deli counter.  Yes, you'll see me there with my laptop, coffee and some of that divine looking chocolate ruglach I saw in the case.Mazel tov to the Borenstein's on this great addition to the southeast valley!My first visit to Chompies and it was delish!!  So much to choose from on the menu it took me forever to decide.  My waiter was patient with me and offered up some suggestions.  I was bad, so bad.  I had a Monte Cristo Sandwich with fries.  While I waited for my food I took it all in.  I love the NY vibe, the walls with pictures of NY and all the great things about NY.  It made me want to get on a plane and take another trip to NY!!!  And there are several TV's to watch events.  This evening I watched the Mets play and sadly, they lost.  My sandwich was delish!!  Nicely dusted with powered sugar and the ham and turkey were excellent.  The fries were perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffly on the inside.  And my waiter checked on me several times which I appreciated.  I cannot wait to return and try more things off the menu.  I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous.  I took half home.  I am giving three stars for now but I'm sure I will bump it up after I've tried the  potato pancakes and the matzo ball soup.   *drool*The first time I ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I was neither friends nor family at that point (I was discussing a book event with Wendy), though in typical tribal fashion I was adopted by the Borensteins and made mischpucha (translate: family for the non-Yiddish speaking and goyem). Anyway, since that evening I've been there six or eight times. It's always terrific.Though I always order a lean corned beef on rye, I've had a number of things with family and friends. Everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food I ate since emerging from the womb. Though I will caution about the matzo ball soup; it has a sweetness I don't care for. We've had blintzes, latkes, fish, knishes... The list is longer but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Everything has been terrific.Same with the service. I've been treated very well every time I've been there. For good or ill there is now a Chompie's closer to my house. The jury is still out on which it is, I mean, nobody ever said a "latke a day keeps the doctor away." You know what I'm sayin'...No, honey, you're not in New York, Chicago, or L.A.See those tanlines on your thighs? Yes, you're in Arizona.Your backsweat confirms this.Out of the car, sexy. It's time for lunch.Nope. Definitely NOT Brooklyn.NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, "don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's" casual, sit-down restaurant. Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your "I only eat healthy chick food" waistline has a deathwish.What a way to go, ho!- fantastic soups of the day-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token    offering of lettuce- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast    hidden somewhere beneath- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY- pickles. On EVERYTHING.- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your    table, or at least one very fat man.- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?'Sactly.Oh, and mom called.She said f*ck your diet.The first time I heard about Chompie's, I was watching Travel Channel's Man v. Food and I saw Adam Richman taking on the Ultimate Slider Challenge in the Tempe location.  While I had no urge to try and stuff myself silly, the sliders sounded tasty!Chompie's is a casual eatery with a laid-back vibe.  It's not a date spot but definitely a great place for a quick bite and good times.  Some of my favorites are the Jewish Sliders, Greek Benedict, Mark's Monte Cristo, and the Western Sliders.  Don't forget to pick up some rye bread or bagels on the way out.  Yum!I hear they do a Valentine's Day special now.  Oh to be young and kosher...
The Sushi=So we were looking for an ayce sushi place on a Saturday night and called around to a few different places in Summerlin.  A lady answer the phone and said that their ayce is $20.95. Great price for the location! Well we get there and there is no one in the restaurant and upon further examination of the menu, it turns out their ayce is +$4.00 for Nigiri.  They don't tell you this on the phone and basically use the bait and switch to get you in the door.  After voicing my concern that I felt misled and lied to and requested they waive the $4, she came back and said the manager refused to authorize it.  We got up promptly and went across the street to Naka Sushi, which is not only cheaper but also had a better crowd and ambiance.  DO NOT GO. PRICES ARE MISLEADING AND MANAGEMENT REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.I was really excited to get AYCE sushi, I was not impressed that they didn't put how many pieces per roll so when the bill came and they tried to charge me a "left over fee" I couldn't help but feel cheated. It does state "left overs are extra charge" but who are they determine my left over ratio? Alas, I wasn't charged extra and they even didn't charge me for my Sale either.  Also we couldn't get the servers to go away to take our order and then we couldn't get them to come back for our check or to order anything else.Food: 3 starsMenu: 2 starsStaff: 2 starsReturn: nah sushi places are a dime a dozen here.I really don't know where to begin, I wish I could give this place 0 stars because that is what they deserve. The service I received here tonight was absolutely horrible and disgustingly unprofessional. My family and I decided to do AYCE (it was 7 of us). The waiter comes to our table to tell us to write our order down on a piece of paper, we kindly tell her that we know what we want and if she can just take the order. She writes down our order and gives us attitude because it's a big order, but it's 7 of us doing AYCE. Anyways, 3 of the same rolls come out, but we only ordered two, so we kindly tell her that we ordered only two and she visibly gets upset and tells us that we are wrong. She gets her paper where she wrote the order to show us; we feel bad so we just take the roll. The owner (she told us she was the owner) comes to our table shortly after to tell us we have to eat everything or she will charge us. When we asked for spicy mayo on the side she said that the rolls already have sauces on them. As we eat, my cousin tries to ask a waitress for a refill on his tea, but she says "hold on" and walks away never to return. Our waitress never returns for the rest of the meal. After about half an hour passes, we notice that half of what we ordered didn't come out so we ask the owner and she says that our hour long of AYCE time is up and that we cannot eat anymore and if we want dessert. We tell her that we are still waiting on food and she says we are wrong. We tell her to look at the paper in which our waitress wrote the order, AND BEHOLD, HALF OUR ORDER NEVER CAME. She tells us that we past our hour and we cannot eat more. We literally sit there and argue with her but it's going no where. When she brings the bill, we end up splitting the bill four ways. After about 15 min of them not returning, we ask about the payment and turns out they charged the wrong amount on the cards. It takes them 30 min to do the voids and charge our cards again. This experience was so ridiculous and horrible. I wasn't even full when I left and I will never come back here again. What a shame!!!
Slidin' Thru=FINALLY!!! Hitting the streets of Las #Vegas the 1st gourmet @SliderTruck. I took part in their soft-opening event at the park on W Flamingo/Buffalo last Saturday from 11-2. What a great start!!When I arrived shortly after 11 there was already a good size crowd gathered and things were in full swing. Chuy and Ricardo the operators of the truck were real friendly and very personable welcoming everyone to try some of Las Vegas' Gourmet street food.There was a limited menu to keep it simple for the event and all items were ONLY $1 each so I ordered one of each:) Pancakes in Blueberry sauce-A Captains Order Slider and a Monte Cristo.The sliders were FANTASTIC!!! I wanted to make sure everyone got to try some or I would have went back for another half dozen "Captain's Order" Sliders!! :)The pancakes were great too, what I got to try the kid snatched them and ran off to scraf them down;)I really enjoy street food and hope to see the @SliderTruck succeed maybe even encourage a couple more trucks soon ;) I've already passed out 200 flyers in my neighborhood to get people out to try the @SliderTruck this Thursday 3/25 11-12pm. Come join us at 3100 W Sahara just 1 block West of Palace Station!!One word...pissed?I was so excited to go to the Slider Truck today after work - I am in the neighborhood....so I decided to walk!  Yeah, it is cold and windy, but I thought it would be worth it!  I stood outside at the street corner in the cold crazy wind for 45 minutes, and Slider Truck did not show.  I walked all around the area, but no truck.I just checked the web site, and it still says by UNLV 6-8, so maybe they have the wrong time zone?  Now I have no dinner, I am disappointed, and I have somewhere to be at 7.I hate when there is so much hype and then such a let down!!  What ever happened to punctuality?  This thing only operates a few hours a day!Sigh.UPDATE: thanks for everyone who sent me negative messages because of this.  I do not have Internet on my phone nor do I have the ability to stare at twitter or facebook at work.  I checked the slidinthru.com web site's weekly schedule and it never changed so let me update the review when I actually try it!  THANKS!  I promise my review doesn't affect you.The concept and marketing approach are awesome, guys that run it are great and I'm happy they're killing it in LV.  I'm sure they'll do so for a long time.  But this is pretty much a one and done for me unless I know they're breaking out some of the crazy looking specials they got on their site like the montecristo.  Being 10th in line when they opened and having to wait 40 min is understandable but I'm not planning to do it again anytime soon.  My wife and I tried 5 of the burgers w/ the Pep Pep being by far and away the best one and the Barbie coming in 2nd.  Captain was dry and fries were fries.  For $9, I would rather just go to LBS for happy hour.The last time I saw 3 guys in a bus handing things to a huge crowd I woke up a week later on the Phish tour bus with a girl name Love Moonbeam...or Moon Lovebeam...or Beam Moonlove. Maybe it was Nancy.  Whatever.  It was told I had a good time. I was told I was a God.  I was told to get off the bus immediately. Damn hippies are so sensitive.  Make one Grace Slick heroin joke and suddenly you are Pol Pot. Never trust a hippie. Always wash any midget you come in contact with. Two things that will serve you well dear readers.Well, what does this brief moment with the unwashed have to do with anything? I don't know. I just swallowed two green pills I found in an alley way I woke up in last night. (Another long story, but it begins as all long stories do...with a fist full of cash and a woman of ill-repute.)  So, before I nod off or run 15 miles backwards again...I will continue with my words of love, food, and tiny microbes that live in our brains.So, everywhere Rex has hung his hat, his lovely purple feathered hat, one constant thing I hear is "how the hell did you find us?"  After that is how good the Slider Truck is.  Slider Truck. Screams as they run. Faint murmurs of Slider Truck. Silence. Time and time again. The same pattern.  I know why they scream, I didn't understand the Slider Truck obsession.  Well, Rex is no stranger to herpes and taking food from strangers in a vehicle.  Usually with those two things I see a cause and effect.  Thankfully this time I didn't have to do anything untoward, just pay money and the food came.So me and my favorite part time wench went to a park in Henderson to try this local phenomenon.  I got into line. The line barely moved. I waited. The line barely moved. I waited 30 minutes and I was not much closer. Rex became angry. Rex became incensed. Rex cried out to the skies. Rex cried.  After an hour, two beatings, and a slight case of heat stroke I arrived at the window. I had gone to their website and studied their menu. I knew what I wanted. I ordered like a pro. The kid who took my order smiled brightly and called me his hero. I blushed. Me and my sometimes intimate partner I only have to pay scale moved over to wait some more.  We ordered 1 Barbie, 2 Pep Pep and 3 Pulled Porkies. We added drinks and the sweet potato fries.  We waited some more. It took time. Rex hates waiting and this has tried my patience and my left hook to the point of exhaustion.  Finally the food came. We celebrated. We danced. She cried out of her non-glass eye.  It was a beautiful day, only about 200 degrees outside. We sat under a tree. The food smelled great.  I ate the Barbie and the BBQ sauce was great and the caramelized jalapeno balanced the sweetness.  The Pep Pep was like an attempt at a gourmet Big Mac. The sauce was very familiar and very tasty. Tangy and sweet. It was good. Then the pulled pork. Tender pork, bbq sauce and a little heat from the jalapeno. I ate one of the sweet potato fries and then put about 75% of the container in my mouth at one time.  The verdict...decidedly mixed.  I admire these kids and their attempts to recreate the food trucks of other cities...but it needs to be more than just clever and right now this is just clever. The star of the show was the pulled pork, and why...it was the  only thing that wasn't overcooked. It wasn't sauced enough and it needed a little more flavor in the pork when it was cooking, but overall it was very good. The bun has a bit of grease on it and that made it very buttery. That was nice.  The burgers had the potential to be amazing, but they just weren't. They were so far overcooked that the Barbie I had was like a hockey puck. The Pep Pep was very good but again over cooked and under sauced. I loved the fries. They were well done and relatively inventive. Salt, sugar and spice. Excellent. Another surprise flavor could have really stepped it up a notch, but I am not going to nitpick. I want to like these guys, I want to support them. But when I spend almost 30 bucks on dinner I better get more than some really over cooked meat.  The portions were "slider" size but the prices were gourmet (3 for 7 bucks), and the execution was decidedly NOT gourmet. I think the worse thing I can say is that given the wait, the overcooked meat and the lack of some basic fundamentals with the food I can't say I would come back. If I didn't have to wait an hour I would eat there again, but right now the town is obsessed with novelty food that lacks sophistication...why should I spoil that for them.  To me this is like dating a supermodel without a vagina...slightly depressing, terribly irritating and not worth the time you put into it. You want to love her, but you can't.You can love Rex. Try as hard as you can. Rex can't love you.I really hate to do this, but today was a serious wtf on behalf of the Slider Truck.Got to the Lakes location at 5:55, they were supposed to be there at 6 PM. There was already quite a line, but it didn't look like more than 30 minute wait. We didn't wait 30 minutes. We waited 45 minutes and only moved 15 feet with about 20 people ahead of us still. Matt and I did not get food tonight. You know why we didn't get food? We overheard that some lady up front ordered TWO DOZEN sliders. When you are a business that makes items as they're ordered and you see a crazy-long line, you have to draw the line somewhere. Seriously, it should be 6 sliders per customer, period. TWO DOZEN. Who the hell needs 24 sliders?? You should not be ordering for friends or family, you need to drag their butts down there so you can stare at all the people glaring at you for holding them up from eating. I don't think we would have been served in an hour and a half, and there's no way that the Slider Truck is worth that kind of wait. Half hour tops. And that is usually all I have to wait if not less. But once it gets past an hour, it gets ridiculous. I'm seriously thinking about selling my Groupon that I have for them because the wait times have gone up like crazy and I don't think I'll be able to use it anytime soon. Oh and P.S. Anyone who cuts the line at the Slider Truck, you have a separate circle in hell waiting for you.Our friend had never tried the Slider Truck and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to take his S.T. virginity. As soon as he got off work we rallied and rushed over to their spot for the night.We stood in line for over 45 minutes and left empty handed. Not only that, we were insulted by the sheer greediness of some people.It was happy hour; $1 everything. There was a big crowd but everyone was being pleasant, politely waiting their turn to gobble some slider goodness. Since they were at Sunrise Coffee, people were dipping into the shop and getting coffee while waiting. After 45 minutes, the slider guys announce that they "have 40, count 'em FORTY sliders left! Don't be greedy, please, and there'll be enough for everyone!! :D"We see an old woman leave with at least 9 sliders and a big snot-eating grin. And then- "SOLD OUT!"Within TWO customers, they went through FORTY sliders. Whuuuuuuuuhhhh?!Fact is, we probably wouldn't have been able to get a slider even if people only ordered 2-3 each. Any time you wait that long, it can be annoying, but I'm not really upset about leaving empty handed. We were all insulted by the fact that as soon as they announced the shortage, some greedy individuals felt the need to swipe up ALL of the remaining sliders for themselves. Obviously, all of us waiting in line are there because we love the Slider truck- and those greedy few hoarded them all for themselves? Really? REALLY?! Thanks, people, for crapping all over my friend's experience & ensuring that his first impression of the Slider truck is NOT positive. Some of the shimmer has been smudged for me as well. I don't think I'm going to be able to find the motivation to wait in those lines with the knowledge that people so greedy are scattered amongst our midst. I'm over it. My friend, who didn't even get to try to food, will most likely never be back because of this. Greedy fools ruining the fun for everyone, I tell ya!Call me a hater but I'm not about to start giving away superfluous high marks to restaurants simply because their business model puts them on wheels.  I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.Like I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  The guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.  If you pay by credit card, the order taker says "My machine is asking if you would like to leave a tip."  I understand his machine may be asking that, but maybe post a sign that say you can leave a tip when paying by debit or credit rather than put people on the spot.   Jeez, thanks for putting me in a pickle.  I mean are you going to tell the guy no straight to his face?  I just think thats a tad audacious.  My visit corresponded with their new semi-residency at lunch time on Thursdays at UNLV.  Don't let the wheels seduce you...Before you get mad....... Slidin' Thru ACTUALLY gets a 2.5. I get it. They're nice guys, they fist bump you to make you feel special (even though you're not), they have a cool atmosphere with what some consider to be good music (I don't), and they serve (pretty) tasty sliders. I've caught the truck twice before in the past, and both times my stomach was still hungry and the pockets in my pants felt molested.I'm not going to whack around the bush; Slidin' Thru's prices are outrageous. If you are like me and thought that 3 sliders for $7 was a bit much on the truck, you're going to be totally disappointed now. Seven hundred and forty six dollars for a single mini-burg. Just kidding! But you can pay upward of $3.50 for one burger; and as of opening day, no 3 for $7. How cheap! And not the good kind of cheap either. In the end, I agree with the masses that Slidin' Thru has a lot of character and good eats. But unfortunately they also have steep prices and long wait times. Did I mention my slider buns weren't exactly fresh either? If I'm going to pay nearly four dollars for one tiny hamburger; it better give my mouth a boner! While it's good to see Slidin' Thru open a location so close to my house, I think I'll take my three million Carl's Jr. coupons (thanks, mailbox!) to Uncle Carl and gets me some full-sized charbroiled burgers in the future. Call me cheap : I work hard for my money! The menu is refreshing and the fist bumps are a nice touch; but it'll take more than that to get MY yen.* This review is for the Durango location.My First Love.... in Food Trucks that is. I remember going to their truck stop during the summertime by Yogurtland and getting a coupon for a free cup off yogurt after you eat their sliders... Great, great marketing strategy ;) The energy they bring when ordering makes all the difference in the experience of their followers. I didn't even know what to expect coming from having a mentality that "Food Trucks" were dirty and the food was considered.. junk. I had an immediate change of heart from my first experience in trying this particular food truck. Fist pumps, the enthusiasm that makes you smile, and of course the sliders and sweet potato fries... I was literally blown the heck away.Now to the goods... These are my usual:The Barby: Love cheddar cheese.. it's melted on top of the thick mini patty with a piece of crisp bacon, tangy bbq sauce. On the bottom layer.. there are some caramelized jalapenos and crispy fried onion strips. The soft fluffy buns with all these elements of deliciousness. makes this my favorite slider...The Yaya: Reminds me of some greek food, but in a slider form. I'm not a huge fan of Feta Cheese, but in this combination.. it works. This slider was somewhat... refreshing to bite into. The fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and red wine vinaigrette made it like a healthy treat than anything else. Loved it.The Captain's Order: Another feta cheese version that I did like...  You can't go wrong with sauteed onion and crisp bacon in a slider.. I call this a Classy One. Included balsamic reduction, roma tomato, and arugula. Flavorful and nice bite from the balsamic reduction. The feta cheese in both sliders really give it a lot of character and color to each bite. Enjoyed this one very much.Sweet Potato Fries: Long thin rectangular shaped fries... Absolutely LOVE them. Occasionally I'll try something different... I did like the Pulled Pork. The meat was so tender!!! The spice from the bbq sauce and caramelized jalapenos brighten the whole taste and gave this slider a great kick!!! Ha Yaaaah on that! I did go adventurous one night and ordered their Mystery Slider... which was Da Irish Hash!!!  A WHOLE hash brown, egg, chedda peno, n bacon. As I was eating this slider, half the hash brown fell off and even eating that only was so darn good!! Crisp on the outside, tender in the inside... now that's a great piece of hash! This mystery slider made my night... it was so delicious and hearty. I so needed this from dancing like a maniac at work and let me tell you... I left Very happy!!! Now for dessert.. I did try their Sweet Potato Smores. They bring it out to you like a baked casserole. Melted marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and topped with crumbled graham crackers. Dig in and you'll find yourself lost in sweet ecstasy. So warm and so good. This really is soothing to the soul. Some think soup.. but if you're sick of soup.. think of this dessert! ;)  Service has always been exceptional here... Nick introduced me to Jarritos. Delicious lime flavor that goes well with sliders and fries.. Thanks Nick!!! My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she was confused at first on why I chose this spot to have a nice birthday dinner. She goes... you sure?!?! There's some nice places in the hotels you know? I told her.. I know, but you asked and this is where I want to go. So we met up here and she was just pleasantly surprised how good this place was. She told me... now I understand why you wanted to come here :D Damn right girl!!! There were times where the server? would attempt to skateboard with my food in his hands... I thought that was quite cute and amusing... until he dropped a few of my sweet potato fries!!! I was like Oh Noooooo!!! AHhhhhh!!! I almost... almost dived down to the ground to catch it in my mouth, but he ran all those fries over... such tragedy of sweet potato fries in my mouth world. One time they even came out dancing to serve our food.. So entertaining! I thought it was the cutest thing :D It's a treasure to have a place like this here in Vegas... One of my loves for life.Really disappointing!  My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 40% on my reason for coming to this festival was to finally try Slidin' Thru.  First off, the line was really, really long.  I hate waiting in lines.  But, I'll admit its a fairly reliable sign of good food.  After about 15 minutes of waiting in line the person in front of us stated that Slidin' Thru was out of everything but the Plane Jane.  Thanks a lot Slidin' Thru for not telling us sooner.  At this point we were committed, even if I could only try the Plane Jane.  As we got near the ordering booth I noticed a group of girls lingering around the ordering booth.  They were typical high school girls: over concerned with their looks and not particularly friendly.  Perhaps, Slidin' Thru groupies as Slidin' Thru has earned their street credit as a cool place.  Then, it was my turn to order (around 30 minutes of waiting already).  The man was slow to take my order.  I'm sure he was tired because I know they were super busy, but the food festival had been going for only three hours (it was 8 pm and the thing went from 5 pm to 9 pm).  The truck was nicely decorated and hip-hop played on the radio inside.  We ordered two Plane Janes and one Caprese, they were out of everything else.  Then we began our wait for the order to be cooked.  One of the groupies picked up an megaphone and said "Hey, people of the truck.  We are out of everything but the Plane Jane."  Okay, so at least one works for the truck.  They were not all just groupies.  And, why hang out right at the ordering station?  The area was really crowded already.  It did not need 6 or 7 more people lingering.  Especially with their attitude.  Also, why not give the public service announcement every 5 or 10 minutes?  Why wait so long?  People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that.  Our food finally came out.  Total time, about an hour.  The meat was under cooked.  It was pink in the middle and cold.  the buns were dried out and crusty.  The Caprese fell apart as we tried to eat it.  The food was not special.  I prefer In and Out Burger, and I always know where they are at.  The man working the counter apologized and began handing out cards for a free slider at their fixed Northwest location.  It was a nice gesture, but the food was not good.  I overheard him explaining to another customer that one of their storefront locations had recently closed because it could not make enough money.  I understand why.  I think this place probably makes descent sliders on most days and the whole food truck craze and their cool vibe has served them well.  However, they have become a victim of their own success.  Rarely do things meet over inflated expectations.  I'll give this place another try aside from a food truck festival, but for this experience, what a dud!Man, I spoke too soon that it was in good hands. The BF and I were hurrying off to a busy day and needed a snack as we had a early dinner to get to. We both grab a barby and share regular fries. Things have changed since the last visit drastically. The burger patty was very, very thin. Think of White Castle type patty when these originally started pretty fat when Ric owned it. When I grabbed my burger the basket had a pool of oil. The flavor was okay because of the bbq sauce, but it was mostly bread and greasy onion crisps (which probably caused the pool of oil).The fries changed in that the thin crisp breaded shoestring fries are now thicker fries,- think like 5 guys like. They weren't very crisp and were soggy on the bottom since they got crammed in the cu and just steamed themselves. Girl up at front was much more quiet and not as personable as previous counter folks. $9 for this 2 slider, fries and drink combo isn't worth it when those sliders are super skimpy. They used to be worth it when they were fat and juicy. Just look at the photos from the beginning vs. now... they recently fused the truck reviews with the reviews for the brick location and you can see the difference. I should've stopped and taken a picture, but I was in a hurry and just jamming something in my mouth in the 5 minutes I had to spare. This wasn't the burgers with heart that sold itself. Also Ric WAS Slidin' Thru and the personality carried through in the staff he picked. It's missing that little sumthin' sumthin' on top of being skimpy. I regret that I will not be back.I finally got around to checking Slidin' Thru today.  And I don't know why it took me so long!  Hallelou, I have seen the light!My husband and I went here for lunch today while we were out and about.  I tried the Peppep and the Buffalo Soldier sliders.  I really enjoyed them both, but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.  My hubby tried the Porky and the Plain Jane.  I stole a bite of the Porky and almost didn't give the slider back because it was so yummy. I totally couldn't have eaten a 3rd slider, but I didn't want to look like a pig, especially since my hubby only ate 2.  The fries were really good too.  They tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.  YUMMY.  Take a bunch of napkins though.  The sliders were saucy (in a very good way) and did kinda get all over the place.  Double yummy on the saucy sliders!I do think the prices are a bit high.  For what we got on the sandwiches, I think $0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.  Even with that, I think we will be back regularly.  The prices on fries and drinks were spot on though, in my opinion.On a side note, the place was completely empty our entire meal.  Even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.  We didn't really see the staff either.  It was a little weird, but when we did see them, they were friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I think if they were a little more present and didn't disappear for long periods of time, it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.  I hope we just went during a weird time or something, because now I am hooked and want them to stay around!!!Another positive was a free slider just for checking in on Yelp.  Now that is a great deal!  How I love free food!I know Slidin' Thru has been around for some time now, at least 2 years.  But I never had the opportunity to eat here until last night.  Our original plan was Tea Time for boba, but ended up here instead since they were closed at the time.  What you get at Slidin' Thru is basically sliders that are infamously sold through their food trucks.  There's a list of sliders that you opt for, including pork and chicken. It was my first visit and decided on the Captain's Orders and the YaYa. Each slider is $3.50.  However, one is free when you check in through your Yelp app.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Both sliders were extremely tasty and full of flavor.  The YaYa was a little rich for me.  It's all good since I went back and forth taking bites out of the YaYa and Captain's Order.  We also washed down our sliders with some of their delicious sweet potato fries.  Perfect combination if you ask me.  I've been told that Slidin' Thru restaurant isn't as good as their actual food trucks. I wouldn't know the difference since I never had a slider from their food trucks.  All I know is that at this joint, their sliders are good enough for me to want more and cheap enough for me to come back.
Mundo Restaurant=Ok, now it's time to talk a little bit about their brunch!  We went for dinner, which was my first review. Dinner was excellent, but on our way in we noticed a sign for their brunch specials on the weekend. Brunch is perhaps my favorite meal of the day, so it was decided --- Mundo brunch for my birthday :-)We had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!So first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire! Genius since I love bloody marys, but bottomless could weigh you down after awhile. Food - I got the Benedict Mexicano --- DELISH.Jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffin.Pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon/ham.Green chile hollandaise instead of normal heavy hollandaise. Genius. It was so good, it makes me wonder why Mr. Benedict didn't just make it this way from the beginning.  Normally I have order envy, where no matter how happy I am with what I order, I covet what my neighbors have. Not this time. I didn't want to trade, I didn't want to share.  I can't even tell you what the other 5 people at my table ordered, but they all loved it too, so I don't think you can go wrong :)In a city with few outstanding Mexican (or TexMex) restaurants, Mundo stands out as one of the best. Located in one of the northern buildings within the World Market Center campus, it's one of the better off-Strip restaurants. Not only does it have wonderful food, it has an interior to match -- as you'd expect from a place surrounded by a design center.With a restaurant.com gift certificate in hand, I brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday. We started off with chips and salsa and a wonderful  guacamole with diced onions and tomatoes, slices of radishes, and topped with cilantro and cotija cheese.The chicken taquito appetizer consists of two taquitos cut in half and topped with sour cream, cotija cheese and green onions, with some lettuce and a sweet chile paste beside them. The chicken was a touch dry, but in combination with the other ingredients the flavors were excellent.My wife's dish was a large chile relleno stuffed with cubes of filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese in a smoke chile sauce. If you like a little heat, this is the dish to get. The tender beef was a great vehicle to soak up the smokiness of the sauce and deliver a bold punch of flavor to the palate.I'm a sucker for some swine, so I went with the carnitas and they didn't disappoint. You'd be hard pressed to find a better version in Vegas. The succulent chunks of pork was sitting in a large mound in the center of the plate with onions and cilantro on one side, avocado pico de gallo on another, and a cucumber habanero salad on the opposite side of the plate. The pork contained a balanced ratio of mostly lean meat with a little fat here and there to offset it with some additional flavor.For dessert we had churros. The eight small pieces were filled with a caramel sauce in the center and had some additional caramel drizzled on top. Also on the plate was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small bowl of chocolate sauce. It would have been a great way to end the meal but they brought out one more thing after that.An order of flan came out with a candle on top and two of the waiters sang happy birthday to my wife. I definitely wasn't expecting them to sing. I thought they only did that type of thing at TGI Friday's or place like that. But, it was much appreciated. As for the flan, it was unbelievably light, smooth and creamy with none of the eggy taste you get from lesser variations of the dish. Mom, I'm sorry to say this, but I've found flan that's better than yours.For drinks we had a margarita and mojito, which we were happy with and we checked in through Yelp and got a free glass of wine!The dinner was close to being perfect, but the service could have been better. Despite our waiter being very informative and friendly, he was too busy to give any of his many, many tables *great* service. But, that's more of a management and staffing issue than a reflection on him. The only other issue we had was when they cleared my wife's plate (of which she only ate about half her meal) and tossed it instead of offering to box it up.So, aside from a couple hiccups it was a successful bday dinner. One where we were able to save a bit through restaurant.com and the Yelp check-in and still have a wonderful meal. Come to think of it, the food here is a little similar to what you would get at Mesa Grill on the strip, but much cheaper.4.5 StarsThe boyfriend and I decided to have date night and dress up.He planned the night and chose this place as his roommate raved so much about it.As we drove up, I was pretty shocked that it was in the World Market Center because I thought only people in conventions were allowed in. Low and behold, it was right outside World Market. The walk up was simply amazing as WM is just a huge behemoth of a structure.When we walked in, it felt so homey and comforting. Like I was in grandma's extremely nice house. All about the lighting, I guess.We had a table with one of those big/king sized chairs. So big that the BF wound up sitting next to me during dinner.Our waiter was really funny and informative about his and the restaurant's fave dishes.Started our dinner with a few cocktails. I forget the names of them but, I know his margarita wasn't as sour/tarte as they normally are so, I liked that a lot.We ordered the ahi tuna pizza app and it was AHHHHMAAAAAZIIIIIIIIIING.Crust was thin and crispy. Reminded me of a really good and waaaaay fancier Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell (but, obvs way better)! I could've eaten 4 of them stacked on each other as a meal!For entrees, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and he had the filet stuffed Chile Rellano; and elote for a side.The sea bass was soooooo beautifully presented. All wrapped up like a delicious gift!His filet was perfectly juicy and tasty; and went very well with the spiciness of the Chile. The sauce added extra kick and spice to the dish.The elote was elote. My FAVE, as always. You can never get Mexi corn wrong.We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert. Which I would love to come back for.What's even more great about this place is that they are vegan/vegetarian friendly. I was excited to tell my roommate who is dating a vegan/vegetarian.All in all, I'm excited for more date nights here. Very romantic and intimate!If you are thinking of trying Mundo for the first time, please readthis. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.Unfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verballyattacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for theexperience only. Here's what happened.My husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, askingif they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and politeand said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had ababy in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.We arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I hadcalled, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHERPERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. Wesat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered acocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. Thebaby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food onits way- so far so good.Then a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, "Iwant you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but childrenare not allowed in the restaurant." I looked at him with a confused look,since we had been seated there by the host, and said, "Well, I calledahead and asked--" and he interrupted me and said, "I don't care. LikeI said, there's nothing I can do about it now." I said, "are youasking us to leave?" and he responded again, "I don't care."I asked him, "Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being sorude?" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and Ipointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant andwe had called and asked. He repeated, "I don't care," and turned onhis heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.We were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurantin my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and havenever seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about thebaby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks andfood, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I gotpunched in the face.He was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved likea child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone whowants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner isunprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him.This review is not for the food.We recently stopped in for drinks at the bar. It was our first visit to this restaurant. While seated at the bar, the manager or owner (not sure which) decided to discipline an employee in front of all of the customers seated at the bar.In all my years, I have NEVER witnessed someone talk to another human being the way that man talked to his employee. I wanted to cry. It was terrible and I knew right then and there that we had to leave the restaurant. I seriously had nightmares about this place after I left.  Never again.
Hungry Howie's Pizza=I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.The people working here are nice and the inside is clean. I had howie bread and that was hard and the pizza sauce that came with it tastes terrible. I liked the thickness of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself really lacked flavor. The pepperoni and sausage on my pizza did taste okay but the pizza all together just wasn't anything special. The amount of toppings on the pizza was fair. There was supposed to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but I tasted nothing but a so-so pizza crust. I'm a big boy who can eat a lot and could only eat 1 and a half pieces. I'm not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actually has taste to it.
Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse=I still dream about the bone in ribeye I had here.  Best creamed spinach ever (Peter Luger's being #2).  We went on a pretty slow Thurs night so our waiter was cool enough to bring us several samples of the huge wine list they have there at no charge.  I imagine very few places are better than this downtown.  You can't go wrong with this place!!How do you end up at Vic & Anthony's? I'd have to agree with the other reviewers..... usually a referal; someone tells you about this high-end steakhouse. For me, it was the concierge at our hotel.I was trying to put together a dinner-show package for clients. Trade shows in Vegas usually come up for me around the first quarter of the year. And when entertaining clients, I've got a short list of reliable spots in Vegas for dinner. And it's not just about the food; it's definitely about an enjoyable evening, which has to include a relaxing, and tasteful ambiance. V&A's is all that, and reasonable.In the past, I would have made reservations at Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crab at the South end of Caesar's Forum Shoppes. But now, I have a very good alternative. And about those "reasonable" prices? Not as high as you might think. For our party of four, a couple cocktails and sodas, two appetizers, the NY strip, a bone-in Ribeye, a salmon entree, a chicken entree, three vegetable sides and a dessert we four split, our bill was about $250. That's very reasonable for a steakhouse meal. Funny thing. When we had been seated for a bit, a group of four young guys came in, sat down, opened the menus........ and then in concert, stood up and walked out. I'm thinking they thought they were in the hotel's cafe? Things that I really like about this hotel restaurant...... it's easy access, just inside the East side valet entrance to the hotel. The servers are formal, but very accomodating and non-intimidating. The atmosphere is really casual, and the food is very good. Even if I'm by myself, I'll consider getting my next Vegas meal here. And I don't like eating by myself, but for their steaks I'd break that rule.I just got back from one of my best steak dinners ever.  When I arrived, I was seated on a great table close to the bar where I can sit on one of their cool leather chairs and watch the NFL Draft at the same time.The decor is totally awesome, a cross between the Capital Grille and Craftsteak.  It is furnished like an old school steakhouse with deep rich cherry woods and leather chairs but with beautiful trendy stained glass ceilings and low mood lighting....very sexy.I love this type of steakhouse....truly a Frank Sinatra hangout with Suits, Steaks, Whiskey and Cigars.My meal began with their delicious warm sourdough bread and their incredible lobster bisque.  The bisque was super creamy and spicy....one of the best that I have ever had.For dinner, I ordered a bone-in rib eye steak and a side of sea salt fries.The steak was super tender and juicy with the right amount of marbling.The fries was a perfect side with the great steak.For desert, I had their famous croissant bread pudding with ice cream and a toffeestick.....super sweet and good.Vic and Anthony's is one of the best steak houses that I have been to in the U.S.The decor and ambience is sexy and romantic.......the service is outstanding.  I felt like a celebrity......the hostess and waitress made me feel as if i was the only customer in  the restauarnt.  The Mgr. came by my table a couple of times to check on me and when I left, they comped my desert and gave me a complimentary glass of cabernet franc to finish my meal.I came in my pants twice.......it was that good.  No sex needed for a week....I am so satisfied!I can see why they are a Michelin rated steakhouse and was voted as one of top 10 steakhouses in the country.I wish there was a V@A in California and NY!VEGAS OLD SCHOOLI'm a trendy Angeleno.  I KNOW good food...especially steaks.  That's because LA is blessed with the swankiest steakhouses:  Boa, Mastro's, Cut ($130 filet mignon). During our stay in Vegas, my sweetie said she wanted to try this place she found on Yelp called Vic & Anthony's.  My face said "sure!" but I scoffed inside.  Why am I leaving our suite at Cosmopolitan, not to go downstairs to dine at STK, but to drive all the way to the business district of Vegas for...Vic & who?My first impression was that this restaurant's decor was dated, sort of Sinatra old-school.  I scanned the room and was surprised it was full of people all seemingly in rapture with their meals.  Probably local Las Vegans whose desert-baked brains can't comprehend modern upscale dining.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, no accoutrements.Juicy.  Tender.  So good I sat up from my slouch.  I was enveloped by a wisp of humility as that savory hunk of steak yelled out to me:  IN!...YO!...FACE!When my sweetie asked if my filet mignon was up to par with those from LA, I answered, "It's not bad".  Damn, I really got ripped-off at Cut.I'm just going to be honest and let you all know that my memory of eating at this particular steak house is a little fuzzy because I had been playing blackjack and drinking champagne for, oh about 7 hours before realizing that if I didn't eat dinner now!, then I would have to eat at a diner or some form of 24 hour place and it probably wouldn't be as good. Also, Nick has a tradition of wanting to eat at a steak house at least once while we are in Vegas and this was our only chance on the short trip we took there recently.With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the meal and I'd easily go back again. I ordered a classic filet and Nick ordered a strip and both were cooked perfectly. We also shared some of the mac and cheese (sooooo good), the Brussel sprouts (eh, average), and a chop salad that I really enjoyed. And while I know it's not part of the menu, the bread and butter were worth mentioning as well. I'm normally not much of a bread person, as I prefer my carbs in the form of purer sugar, but man alive! I couldn't stop eating this stuff.While it isn't the high roller steak houses you can find on the strip I think the quality is definitely great here and you also miss out on the waits and attitudes you might find in some places on the strip. Plus the cost, while high, wasn't as high as some of the other steak houses I've been in Vegas. More money for doubling down is always a good thing!There are some experiences in life you have to live at least once, and dinner at Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is definitely one of them. I've had the privilege of coming here for a third time; two previously with my fave uncle, and this time with my husband, my cousin, and her husband. We sat at a table tucked in a balcony area, where our server, Ben, gave us superb service as he provided us with dinner specials, suggestions for drink pairings, a little bit of history, and entertaining jokes throughout our evening. The four of us shared a bottle of Pinot Noir that Ben recommended. We followed this delicious and smooth wine with individual cocktails, I had the Spiced Pear Martini, which might not have been the best choice to pair with my filet and lobster tail, but it hit a great spot my taste buds were desiring. We shared a calamari appetizer that was mixed with shishito peppers. The plate was just right for the four of us, especially since two of us aren't big fans of this particular seafood. For our second course, we chose different salads. I enjoyed the heirloom tomato penzanella, which seemed to be a variation of caprese. It was rich, light, and scrumptious. Around the rest of the table were Caesar salaf and Spinach salad. The main course consisted of two specials of 8oz filet and I think 12oz lobster tails with fingerling potatoes and sautéed mushrooms (yellowfoot, bluefoot...and one other that I can't recall at the moment, mostly because I have them to my man to enjoy since he is the only fun-guy I like! lol). The other two plates were filled with porter house ribeyes that my cousin and my husband savored until they couldn't eat anymore. Yes, leftover meat taken back to the room and chewed up for breakfast. Our additional sides were au gratin potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and in house made creamed corn. We covered the table with our feast, everything set in a wonderful presentation, flavored amazingly, and eaten with great delight. Ben paid attention when we mentioned we were there to celebrate my cousin and her husband's wedding anniversary, and he generously brought out a creme brulee with a candle. It was just the right amount of sweet for four spoons that filled us to our limit. It was a fabulous evening of food, conversation, service and overall memory making that the four of us will get to share and enjoy the rest of our days.Guys! This place is amazing, and I'm about to tell you how to make it more amazing!!Only at Las Vegas and Atlantic City locations do they have the "Distinctive Dining" deal. $50 for 3 courses.Step one... Cut a hole in the box! Kidding. Okay, go to the website and print out their special menu because It's ONLY VALID IF YOU HAVE THE PAPER!Not valid on holidays, but still valid on weekends. Step two...-order your first course, lobster bisque or salad. Both were fantastic. More deets later. - order your entree, and yes. An 8 oz filet is an option. What. Is. Happening.- pick your side, which is big enough to feed THREE people. - pick yo' dessert- bread pudding, chocolate mousse, or creme brûlée Step three... Stuff your face and be amazed by how wonderful the food is. Step four... Pat yourself on the back for enjoying a three-course meal at Vic and Anthony's for $50. Then go blow some money gambling as you waddle off your food baby. Food:- Lobster bisque 5/5- wasn't too salty and had sweet chunks of lobster meat!- Filet- 4/5- had an excellent crust on it but wasn't cooked to medium rare. One of us ended up with medium, and the other ended up with half and half. Still tastes fabulous. - Creamed spinach- 2/5- omggg soooo much cheese in this that I wasn't sure if I was trying to convince a 5 year old to eat vegetables by hiding them in cheese. Are we eating cheese in spinach or spinach in cheese? Couldn't stomach it.- Au gratin potatoes- 3/5- the guys loved these, but soooooo much cheese again. A few bites of this, and you'll be set for the next famine. - Bread pudding 5/5- the silkiest bread pudding I've ever had. - Chocolate mousse- 5/5 comes on a thin crispy layer. Fantastic flavor and texture. - creme brûlée- 5/5 while a little thin, fabulous presentation with tons and tons of brûlée for you to eat with berries. So basically, just say yes to all of the above in this gorgeous, glamorous old school restaurant. Vic and Anthony's, thanks for the affordable and splendid dinner. I love you. Or y'all, I suppose, since there are two of you.
Lulu Hawaiian BBQ=Im always down to try places I have not been to so I was assuming this place would be similar to Aloha Kitchen or L and L.With that said it was just ok. I ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Spicy Chicken, and Loco Moco. To top it off we ordered a Mango Smoothie with Boba.The Honey Walnut Shrimp was a bit on the sweeter side. The Spicy Chicken was medium spicy and a bit on the greasy side. The Loco Moco was really good but for some reason they gave me way too much rice. Now for the Mango Smoothie with extra boba. Waaaaaaaaay too sweet! I could only take a couple sips and I was done. They are situated in a pretty nice location complimented with a Super Wal-Mart across the parking lot. Their set up is pretty spacious with a decent amount of tables and booths. Service was decent. They get you your food as soon as its done.So overall, I have nothing overly good or bad to report. I would probably go here once in a while. It just wouldnt be my first choice.
Jack in the Box=So the only things I like at Jack in the box is their Munchie meals and Milkshakes.  They are both very good and fill the fast food craving.  The stacked Grilled Cheeseburger is very nice and is a meal in itself.  The included tacos and pretty good but on the greasy side.  That makes them tasty but you can feel your arteries harden with each bite.  The included fries are the mix of standard and curly but you can choose either one if you have a preference.  We also had the Chicken Tater Melt which was surprisingly delicious.     The Munchie Meals are $6 after 9PM which is a great deal for the amount of food you get.  The Milkshakes are creamy and delicious.  With the yummy whipped cream they are a welcome sweet treat.  I don't eat at Jack's often but when I do it is always the fast food I love and expect.  Nothing fancy just quick and good.
Tuscany Gardens=oOoOooH I hit the jackpot in Vegas!Not $$$!4 dollar steak and eggs!dirt cheap & delicious(also service was wonderful)Nuff said... :)
Athens Bar & Grill=I've visited Athens a handful of times in my search for the best Gyro around the Phoenix area. While Athen's doesn't take top billing in my book, they come in at a close second or third. They make a mean gyro and you can't hardly beat the $3.50 price tag. For just two extra bucks order it with extra meat and you'll walk out for about $6 with an over filled belly! In case you're wondering - they DON'T serve those crummy gyro pre-packaged pieces. This gets shaved right from the cone.The pita is good and they could stand to change up the tatziki sauce a bit - it's a little on the runny side. Definitely a sound choice if you're close by and feeling a good quality Gyro.Quoted in the weekly Yelp newsletter 8-3-2011: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=XY441K1tpmDw830RFs5LBAI had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but it failed me. I can't say the same for my coworkers though, because they liked it. For me, the gyro sandwich was extremely plain. There was only tomato and onion with taziki sauce. I gave them another shot but it was the same thing with a whole container of taziki slathered on it. Traditionally, there is more stuff that comes on a gyro sandwich. The food sat heavy and the toilet was my best friend after eating here.
Phoenix Roadhouse Diner 66=It's tough... I wanted to hate this place because, well, it's not awesome. But something about it made me fall a little bit in love. It's totally kitschy, it's loud, it's overcrowded and the service is incredibly slow. So what's to like?I was traveling with a friend and we had to circle around the restaurant 3 times before we spotted an open table. There was a woman sitting at a two top who decided to use another table to rest her bags on. Not sure if this is something the restaurant would feel comfortable monitoring or not but they were losing business because people were too lazy and impolite to rest their bags on the floor. We kindly asked if the table was taken and she moved her stuff noting, "Whoops. I've been here for 40 mins. Sorry about that." We take our seats, find spots for our bags under the tiny table and wait. And wait. A woman offered up menus and left us for a few mins to decide what to eat and drink. Wanting some wine I asked, "Do you have a house wine?" And the absolute best question followed, "Yes. What color are you looking for?" Haha. But it got better. The wine comes in two serving sizes. 4 oz and 9 oz. I had a good two hours to kill so I ordered the latter. When it came it might as well have been served in a fishbowl! No complaints there, though. I slowly sipped away on the wine and placed an order for some food. My poor friend got some sort of roast beef sandwich and couldn't even finish it. It looked downright gross. Something made in an elementary school cafeteria. My boneless tangy wings were pretty good though. Having low expectations, I actually enjoyed them. The serving size was huge too, I couldn't eat it all.So all in all it wasn't terrible. Something about this place was adorable in a sad way. It's messy, the servers look like they're all hating life and the food is not so awesome. But with such limited options and everyone wanting one last meal or drink in AZ before taking off to somewhere else, this "diner" will do the trick. Just order the 9 oz wine and life will be good.
Cici's Pizza=Took my Son here for lunch last week.  We enjoy our CiCi's lunches....there's always a great selection of Pizza.  So, why did I bump them up a Star?  Because while we were there a soccer team with over 20 kids plus their families and coaches came in to eat.....and the CiCi's staff kept up with the massive demand of Pizza.  They'e really good at their jobs....and the Pizza is decent too.Will I return?  You can count on it.Customer service here is A-MAY-ZING!Here the managers are sooo sweet and welcoming! They seriously go the extra mile to make sure you enjoyed your experience! You want a weird pizza? DONE! They do whatever you want, bc they want YOU to be happy! AWESOME! What I love is here you can MAKE YOUR OWN SALAD! You can load that shiz up with jalapenos, bacon bits, or whatever your little heart desires! You can also get a cup of ranch for your buffalo chicken pizza! BOMB!!I usually only eat the buff chicken pizza, the deep dish pepperoni with white sauce, or the macaroni pizza! They have awesome others though, the Philly cheese steak, cheeseburger, taco, and whatever you could think of!They also have a good little soda area and a pretty dope game room!Def child friendly and huge!
Remedy's Tavern=The service here is complete crap... WTF? It's a bar, can I get a beer? Spend some money? Annoying...
Five Guys Burgers and Fries=3.75 FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers, I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef. I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did. Hand pattied, fresh burgers, flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger "traditionalist" I ordered the regular with bacon, lettuce, tomato's, pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much, I may go with the single next time. The building was busy with customers and staff, they run a tight ship. The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart, the frys are large, the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers, share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL I will go back.4 stars for a flat top grilled burger... must have been good.A burger with whatever-the-hell-you-want on it for no extra charges for things like jalapeno, grilled onions or peppers,etc sounds like a smokin deal.  $5 for that burger alone, with no combo deals in sight, brings you back down to earth.The beef is high quality, with no grissly bits, and the toppings choices are many with plentiful, almost too much, volume.  Makes for a deliciously sloppy affair to eat a burger that is just as tall as it is wide!I was worried when I unwrapped my tinfoil and saw that the bun had been pretty much smashed down during assembly.  I looked around and it was standard operating procedure, so I dug in, and the bun held up surprisingly well for being so pushed to its limits of moisture absorbtion and weight support.Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!  free for the taking.  They are everywhere -- something to be aware of if you have one of those allergic kids that they shut down school for when a classmate opens a PBJ sandwich too close.I also worried about their storage technique for the sacks of potatoes.  Either they are wasting hundreds of pounds of spuds, or they plan on using these after storing them out where any kid could poke their grubby little fingers into holes in the sacks, or stab the potatoes with a pen, or punch and bruise them, etc.Prices are high, but I dig Five Guys B&F.  You seem to get what you pay for, except for the drink -- $2.19 for a 32 oz is just gouging.Holy let down batman. I totally got sucked into the "Five Guys hype": reading the owner's story about opening the restaurant with his kids:  how he doesn't spend much on the restaurants themselves, but instead focuses on the quality of the food:  How they don't deliver, that nothing is frozen, etc.  But above all how good their food is. Mr. Boss of all Five Guys franchises:  Please visit your restaurants.  In and Out  = better than Five guysSmashburger  = better than Five guysDelux   = better than Five guysFat Burger  = better than Five guysMcDonalds  = better than Five guysPerfect (twice fried) french fries?  Soggy mess.Fresh ingredients?  I can't disprove this, but to cook said ingredients to death and then dress them up with "as many condiments as I want" ? No high five for you. It's like offering me fancy ketchup with my well-well done filet mignon. (though to be fair, most places cook everything to well done... it was just a mess here though) And the kiss?  I paid 5 bucks for said tasteless krabby patty of woe.  I went in to the restaurant thinking:  WOW ME 5 GUYS, FUCKING WOW ME.   Thats all I wanted!  Give me a reason to come back!  I can't believe you formula for success is to bank on the masses having mediocre taste buds.  Can't say this isn't the right formula for success, but come-fucking-on!Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!Add "beefy" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of "look at me" crap on the walls ("Best Fries in Hoboken!")The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work..."I come from a land down under"...I shuddered a little bit at the part "and men chunder"...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).Anyway...I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you "accidentally" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!) And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.Sometimes I crave a big, juicy burger.  On a recent Friday, a few co-workers and I went to Five Guys to get our dose of beefy goodness.The menu is simple - burgers, hot dogs and fries.  One thing that is important to know is that the regular burgers come with two patties, while the 'little' burgers come with one.  Convinced (or perhaps challenged) by my co-workers to try the full-size, I went with the cheeseburger.  From the long list of toppings (all free) I chose to go 'all the way' except for the tomato which meant mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles,  grilled onions and mushrooms.  The burger was pretty good - juicy and messy.  I think I should have skipped the grilled onions, though, as there were far too many of them.The fries come in two sizes (big and huge) and two ways - regular and cajun.  We shared a large order of cajun fries among the three of us, and I think it would have taken two more people to finish them.  The fries were thick-cut, which I really like, but the cajun seasoning made them very salty.All orders are served up in plain brown paper bags, even if you are not taking the food to-go.  A cute idea, except that the brown paper really soaks up that french fry grease.  I know burgers & fries are greasy.  Duh.  I just don't want to have such obvious visual confirmation of that.  The shiny glistening sheen that had soaked through the brown paper bag was NOT what I wanted to see after finishing my meal.Overall a tasty burger, and so-so fries.  Would I have the burger again?  Sure.  However, Five Guys will not replace In-N-Out as my go-to place to satisfy my burger cravings.  Yes, I will always be a California girl at heart!I like Five Guys Burgers a lot, but this one was just OK.  I came here for dinner the other night and ordered:Little Bacon Cheeseburger w/Grilled Onions, Mustardhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=QkSMzAtjE7aDljIRxLgUfACheese Dog w/Mustardhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=1kvdxxurxO7Xbotp8dDZ1wRegular Size Cajun Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA?select=3SUu_0EAJIJHhCrduGIaVAThe Bacon Cheeseburger was just OK....I don't know why it was so underwhelming, it just was.  The Cheese Dog was underwhelming too, just didn't hit the spot....it was average.The only thing above average was the Cajun Fries.....they were excellent!Not sure if I caught them on a bad day, will have to come back and give them another chance....in the meantime, just 3 Stars for them.Return Factor - 75%
Shin Yakitori House=Another izakaya place has opened up in Vegas - this one goes by the name of SHIN Yakitori House.  What makes this an izakaya?  Ultimately, it's a Japanese establishment that serves food to complement drinks.  The food usually served are small bites, similar to tapas.  But what makes SHIN more unique in Vegas is that they have a long list of yakitori items!  And that means various goodies served up on skewers and put on the grill.  And their specialty is Okinawan-style food as well!This restaurant has taken up the former space of Sushi Hana - therefore there are two private tatami rooms, a counter, and quite a few tables.There was a modest group of diners on a Monday evening, and our luck was that we walked in during happy hour!  (Mon-Thurs 9 pm to 12 am)Our waitress greeted us pleasantly and offered us the counter or table.  We took our seats at a table and looked over the various menus given - one for sushi, one for yakitori, the picture menu, and the specials board.Our mistake was not coming here on an empty stomach.  This visit was more of a taster for bigger things to come on a return visit.* Hotaru Ika ($6.95) - This came off the specials board.  It's raw baby firefly squid and served in a sweet sauce.  It was surprising good and something I've never seen before.  * Monkfish Liver ($6) - Also known as ankimo and something we just love.  It's buttery slices rested on a bed of seaweed with delicious ponzu sauce.  Always a favorite.* Wagyu Harami ($4.75) - A tasty beef skewer that was juicy and tasty - we ordered two more!* Tebichi Soba "Okinawan Style Noodle in Soup topped with Pork Feet" ($7.50) - This was probably the one disappointing dish we had that evening.  When ordering, I asked the waitress if she recommended this dish or the Grilled Pork Feet.  She liked this one better, so we got it.  It had only one piece of pig's feet, green onions, and noodles.  It lacked taste.  In the picture, it actually looked like there were a few pieces of feet and a different style noodle.  In retrospect, we definitely should have gone with the grilled feet instead.* Chicken Thigh with Spicy Mayo ($2.45) - Tender pieces of chicken thigh with a drizzle of spicy mayo, sounds good and tastes good!* Smelt Fish ($2.75) - Also known as shishamo, and comes two in this order.  A squeeze of lemon and a light sprinkling of salt makes this grilled fish full of eggs just burst into your mouth.* Quail Eggs ($2.25)  - One skewer consists of three eggs and what we love about this dish is that the egg yolk is smooth and creamy inside.  Makes you want to make it at home.* Chicken Skin ($2) - Who doesn't love some grilled chicken skin?  The fattiness is something you just can't say no to.We'll have to come back to try their shark cartilage, salmon carpaccio, miso cream cheese, deep fried octopus balls, deep fried tofu, stingray fin, pork belly, and honey toast.Service was good - our waitresses kept our tea and water filled all the time without request, something I definitely appreciate.We also noticed that the majority of customers and all of the staff (from what we could see) were Japanese, as in Japanese-speaking too.  Makes it feel even more authentic!  Happy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays from 9 pm to 12 am (Half off Chef's Choice Specials Menu, $1 Sapporo)Lunch: Everyday from 11:30 am to 3:30 pmDinner: Everyday from 6:00 pm to 3:00 amUpdate! (05.07.10)Went back for a second visit and just wanted to add on to this review.* Octopus Marinated with Wasabi ($5.25) - I'm a big fan of this having tried it at Shuseki first.  Now I've had it at quite a few places and it's just yum!  It is a bit slimy and takes some getting used to, but I love this slippery goodness.* Rafutei (Simmered Pork Belly Okinawan Style) ($5.75) - Fatty chunks of pork belly with just a tad of hot mustard for some eat and that means good stuff all around!  It just melts in your mouth!* Okinawan Yaki Soba (Okinawan Style Fried Noodle) ($7.50) - This was a surprisingly yummy dish - red pickled ginger slices, bonito flakes, and chunks of meat mixed in with the noodles and vegetables gave this dish a nice taste.* Agedashi Tofu ($5.50) - Always a favorite of mine and they didn't disappoint here at SHIN.We did order the quail eggs again and we just love how the hot yolk just melts in your mouth.  As a result, I went home and made it myself!
Johnny Smalls=So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my numberThere was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. ...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.This Place earns a solid 5 stars on food, 3 stars on atmosphere, and 4 stars on service, so I'm giving it 4 stars...and here are the details.We went late on a wednesday for the AYCE Tapas, the special is pretty hard to beat, you can have anything from their menu, you get to order 2 plates at a time and once you finish, you can order 2 more, however if there is anything left uneaten you have to pay menu price for the items (like many AYCE sushi places).The atmosphere is pretty good, it's dark and trendy, my major complaint was that the music was really really loud, and the selection sucked, in a place like Hard Rock with a solid music selection, the techno/pop crap they were playing at eleventy billion decibels was out of place.My only major complaint with the service is that longer we were seated, the longer it took to bring out our food, I don't know what was going on but our first plates came out almost immediatley, however with each passing order it seemed like it took longer.I would strongly recommend bringing a friend so you can try a lot more food, share some bites and eat your way through most of the menu.Beer Cheese Dip- (4th Fav) This was our first plate, the dip tasted a lot like the beer cheese you get from the store, but had bacon in it, the pretzel sticks were soft and chewey but could have used a little more salt, however it was a great starterSmalls Balls- (2nd Fav) One of my favorite items on the menu, it reminds me a lot of Arancini, risotto, short ribs, and Parmesan. Not as rich as Arancinis I've had before, which was actually a good thing, I will be having these again.High Rollerz- (3rd Fav) Smoked Mozzarella, Serrano Ham, and Pesto, served in taquito style rolls. You can really taste the Serrano ham and the smoked mozzarella, A great small bite, a little crispy in the wrapper, but all in all really good.Thanksgiving Dinner Sliders- First off thier "sliders" are more closer to a small hamburger than a slider per say. They are bigger than your average slider and come 2 to an order. I was thinking this would be like a bobby from capriotti's however it was quite different, the first bite was mainly over powered by butter that was served on them, the rest of it tasted like a turkey burger covered in sage, it was good, but I couldn't taste the cranberries or the stuffing.Jack and Coke- (my Fav) no this isn't the drink, it's skewered beef that has been marinated in a combo of Jack and Coke, it thought it sounded a little odd, but it was hands down the best thing I ate, just enough seasoning from the marinade but not too much to over power the delicious meat.Pizza Pops- (least Fav) I was really looking forward to this item, imagine if a muffin and a pizza roll had a baby, what could be wrong??? Well pretty much everything was. The muffin was doughy, the "toppings" were decent but not great, the marinara served on the side was Ice Cold, I was really disappointed in these, possibly me least favorite item of the evening.Surf and Turf- Lobster and Filet on a skewer, great idea, vanilla butter sauce...not so much, it was odd eating a nice tender piece of filet and having the overwhelming taste of vanilla in your mouth, it worked better with the lobster, but was still an odd combo, may work for some people, not so much for me.Mac and Cheese Daddy- Sliders served with Fried Mac and Cheese on them. Balls of deep fried mac and cheese served on a slider bun with tomato and arugula. I love sliders and I love any thing deep fried, however these were just carb overload, I really liked the idea, but the execution was missing something.Chicken and Waffles- Fried chicken drummettes, maple glazed waffle fries, and southern style white gravy. The Waffle fries were amazing, the maple glaze and the saltiness of the fries worked well together, I really like them. The chicken was good, a tad too crispy for me, but none the less still good, and when dunked in the gravy got an added pepper flavor that made it even better.Tuna Sashimi- I am not really a huge Sashimi fan, but this was really good, the tuna was fresh, and the slice was just the right size. The sauce was flavorful and not over powering. Not the world's greatest but still a very solid offering.Shorty- Braised short ribs, there were really good, 3 small slices of perfectly seasoned short ribs. Meaty and delicious.Tempura Fried Green Beans- It's hard to mess this up, crispy and delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the Thai Chile sauce accompaniment.Meaty Balls- Good meatballs, a little dry but still really good.Fish Tacos- I didn't try these, my buddy liked them.So Beefy- These were under the beef menu, but were sliders. Good slice of filet and Pancetta, I ate it outside of the bun, and liked it, didn't really work as a slider.Grilled PB&J- Chunky PB :(, but still a good end to the meal.sorry to cut the last reviews short, but I was hitting the character limit...Didn't know yelp had oneMy friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be "in the money".....aka "get your money's worth".I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):Round 1Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)Round 2Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)Round 3Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!Will I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%I tried Johnny Smalls last night with a meetup group. While they were getting our table ready, a few of us sat at the bar and had a drink. I decided to ask the bartender for one of his personal specialties. He ended up giving me something he calls the Naughty Irishman. I didn't really watch him make it, but it looked like it was primarily Jameson and Bailey's with crushed ice. I give him props for hand crushing the ice. The drink was pretty good, but it came with the typical Vegas price tag of about $13.Once seated, we did the AYCE tapas thing for $19.99 per person. Note that you technically need a Hard Rock player's card to get that price; otherwise, it's $23.99. Based on the prices of each item, I got my money's worth. On the other hand, if I disregard how much they list each item, I still probably got my money's worth. I'd say their tapas are a mixed bag. Most of them were decent to very good. Nothing was amazing. If I do this again, I have a few items I would skip.The Good* Poona Tuna - I started off with this because someone mentioned it on Yelp. The cherry limeade was an interesting sauce and the tuna was maybe slightly overcooked, but I enjoyed the dish.* Jack & Coke - One of the better items. Very tasty.* Lettuce Cups - Shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that's just being picky. This was quite tasty.* Sea Bass - I only tried some of this from someone else's order. It was pretty good, but not my favorite.* Tuna Sashimi - It's hard to mess up ahi tuna. This was simple and tasty.* Surf & Turf - The vanilla butter added a strange flavor to the mix, but pretty good overall.* Grilled PB&J - I found it a little strange that the jelly was on the side i.e. you had to add it yourself, but it was still good. Honestly, I prefer the Fried PB&J we had at the Elite event at Republic, but come on. It's Grilled PB&J!The Bad* Chicken & Waffles - Disappointing. The chicken was not tasty at all. I didn't like the breading and (once again) it was overcooked. The waffle fries were pretty good though.* Octapussy - I don't like the tapioca batter that they use. Skip.The Ugly* Tater Tots - It might be the truffle oil, but these smelled and tasted like gasoline. They were nauseous.You can view their entire tapas menu on their web site: http://bit.ly/jsmallsI'm going with a rounded down A-OK on Johnny Smalls. I'd return if someone suggested it. The decor is trendy and there are definitely some tasty items here. $20 is a good price.
San Gennaro Feast=5 stars last year? What a difference a year makes! This year's experience, pardon my language, sucked donkey balls. Let's break down the formula for the San Gennaro Feast, circa 2012 edition. 1: Parking. Fleece your customers to park sort of close or fleece them a little less and make them walk halfway across the west side of Vegas to get a parking space. 1a: Find the surliest, most hateful parking attendants in Vegas. Hire them based on attitude. 2: Find the most disorganized and slow way of getting people to the gate to pay admission. Did the ice sheet in Antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in? 3: Once inside run past the pushy merchants trying to sell you everything. 4: Pay out the nose for food. No let's take an arm and a leg too. 5: Offer a super tiny itsy bitsy teeny weenie little place to sit and eat your overpriced food. (Think Strip prices but on the wrong side of I-15). Oh wait, we don't want you to sit, that would take up too much space we need for maximum monetization of the event!6: Let's charge way too much for carnival ride tickets. 7: Let your friends cut in front of everyone that waited 20 min for a ride. (Happened 4x)8:Fight hordes of rude, stupid people who must have been born in a barn and don't have a freakin clue about basic courtesy.9: Walk back to your car that was supposedly watched by "security" to find your mirror broken off and dangling and other damage done to your car. Las Vegas deserves a San Gennaro Feast that is in the Italian traditions, not the Mafia traditions. I felt like I got fleeced, mugged, and downright abused at this year's event. Someone needs to step back and rethink what the heck they're doing here. This could be a world class event but the way it's going, this will be the last year I go back. 1 Star, posted under extreme howling protest. Eek! Methinks not, indeed!My Italian family back in Pittsburgh would smack me upside the head if I were to bring them here and then call this an "Italian Festival."  Seriously, all I can hear in my head is my Uncle Vince saying, "What the hell is the matter with you??!"  When you walk in, you are greeted by Republican candidates, real estate agents, and several booths where you can "Spin the Wheel! Everyone is a Winner!"  Once you get past the gauntlet, you find yourself amongst the food.So we started to make a lap around the booths.  I was hoping to find some Italian restaurants from town I could try and maybe grab a slice of pizza.  Instead, I found nothing.  Either it was not vegetarian or had been sitting in the hot sun for far too long.  Ummmmm now what?  We made another lap.  That's when I noticed that none of the booths had a business name on them.  They all just said "Italian Sausage" or "Calamari" or "Pizza."  So this is just a traveling festival and nothing they sell here is local?  LAME.I finally found a local caterer and wound up getting a $5 Caprese salad that came in a Dixie cup with a slice of garlic bread.  I'm still starving!!  I then broke down and went to one of the generic booths selling pizza.  They wanted $7 for a slice that looked like it had been sitting out for the last two hours.  No thanks.  I got an ice cream cone and decided I had enough.  I'm out.On the way out we walked past some circus side shows that involved snakes and monkeys.  I knew I would get too depressed looking at them so I kept walking by.  And then I proceeded to get super depressed watching the poor ponies being forced to walk in circles in the heat without any kids even riding them... or the sheep covered in wool that looked like they were going to pass out from the heat..... Then there went someone selling used hot tubs....and crappy jewelry....and ugly t-shirts....Oh, and did I mention that they also sold Mexican, Greek, and Japanese food here?  There goes my Uncle Vince again....So in short: I have been to Greek, Lebanese, Indonesian, and Hawaiian festivals in this town.  They all represent their cultures well and are made up of small businesses or churches.  The people running this mess apparently think that Italians only eat sausage and old pizza and like to buy used hot tubs.  Needless to say, I will not be returning.My friend had free tickets - if I had actually paid the ridiculous $9 admission and then overpaid for food I'd be way pissed right now. The bacon wrapped turkey legs sounded amazing, but eff paying $16.50! that's worse than Disneyland! We tried mediocre Philly cheese steak, garlic fries. Supposedly homemade ice cream that wasn't creamy like non commercial ice cream usually is. The one and only worthwhile thing was the funnel cake specifically from 1 of the 5 or so stands. They had 6" and 8" but we went with the 4" mini trio $8 including toppings like apples and cinnamon, blueberry/strawberry w cream cheese frosting, bananas, chocolate, bday cake, smores and probably a few others I forgot. It has to be from the one next to the corn stand - the rest were flat and looked like crap. It was packed with probably the most ghetto @ss crowd I've ever seen in vegas. Even w a free ticket I probably wouldn't go back - I can go to olive garden if I want mediocre Italian food. At least they have a/c w free soup and salad
Rudy's Italian Restaurant and Bar=Rudy's Italian Restaurant & Bar is as awful a place as I have ever come across. Rudy's has really terrible food, really terrible service, very high prices, and to top it all off, they committed credit card fraud. Allow me to give some details about this dreadful restaurant.TERRIBLE food. We ordered two house salads. The menu describes the "Insalata Rudy's" as "Field greens tossed w/diced pears, caramelized walnuts, raisins & gorgonzola honey dressing". What we got was lettuce w/very unripe, hard and flavorless small cubes of pear. Hardly any walnuts and raisins. And no gorgonzola honey dressing. Instead of any actual salad dressing, the lettuce was coated with oil. Not olive oil. The lettuce was oiled up with unflavored cooking oil. I would guess it was either plain Wesson or canola oil.VERY HIGH prices. When you look at the real cost that you are paying at Rudy's, you feel like a sucker for paying so much for such lousy food. The real cost includes the menu price, plus tax, plus 15% tip. So for two "Insalata Rudy's" you are going to pay over $17.TERRIBLE food. For an appetizer we ordered the "Baked artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and spinach in a roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce". What we got was a few marinated artichokes right out of the marinated artichoke jar that is found on the store shelf. Instead of garden fresh "Baked artichokes" we were served unpleasant, sour, vinegary, marinated artichokes. And the "roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce" never made it to the plate. No sauce at all. This was a truly terrible, way overpriced dish.TERRIBLE food. One entrée special was the "Pan seared Tilapia with a garlic sauce". The fish was not pan seared, it was baked. It was mushy. It was flavorless and was served without the sauce. TERRIBLE service. Our server, first thing, told us that "tonight was half price martini night". When our bill came I noticed that we had been charged full price for two unusually expensive martinis. His explanation was that "half price martini night only applies if you are seated in the bar".CREDIT CARD FRAUD. I discovered that a week after dining at Rudy's someone at the restaurant had increased the amount of the credit card charge by 27 %. This was illegally done without my permission and without my knowledge. The lessons to be learned from Rudy's is that what you read on the menu or are told by the waiter is not what will be served at the table. Once Rudy's has your credit card, they may try to swindle you (as they did me). At the end of the meal you will have overpaid for appallingly bad strip-mall-food.
Wood Flame Burgers=Good idea, poor execution.Being a 5 minute drive from the house and getting a coupon in the mail was enough for us to give this place a shot.  I like the idea of a very basic concept with few options to start and then you can make it your own after that.  It just didn't deliver.Here's the breakdown:Pros:++ The buns - they are made there, are really light, very tasty and a good size.  I don't like burgers with too much bun!++ Three sizes of burger to choose from - something for everyone.++ Ingredients seem to be pretty fresh++ The regular fries were pretty good++ You get to add your own fixinsSo-So:= The sweet potato fries were a little charred - enough to give them a bitter taste.  They also are thicker cut with skins on (which was okay by me) but could have used a little more salt/seasoning.= The place seemed clean overall, but there were quite a few flies around=They seem to have a decent selection of sweets, but we didn't try anyCons:-- The fixins bar is weak.  Not a lot of fresh produce and they offer shredded lettuce (which I think is messy).  It could use fresh avocado, pineapple, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, etc. Something more than raw onion and two kinds of pickles to dazzle up your burger with.--We both ordered our burgers medium and they were both definitely well done.--Watermelon lemonade was a special drink made that day.  I was excited, but it ended up just tasting like watered down watermelon - should have been more like lemonade with some watermelon than watermelon with some water and a little lemon in it.--It's crazy quiet in there. With no music and not many patrons, it was like a library.--There were about 6 people working this small lil' place which probably could have been run by 2-3.  Team that with the quiet and you felt kind of on display for them all to watch and wait for more people to show up.--Weird hours - only open until 7 and I *think* they're only open M-F possibly M-Sat - definitely not sure on that part though.Mediocre at best.  If they worked out the kinks and revamped some of their stuff, I *might* give 'em another shot - only if I had a coupon again though.This place is great! Outstanding burgers that I crave relentlessly, if you are in the area definitely stop by. Not only is it a great deal but it is incredibly affordable. Go check it out today!
Rincon Peruano=¿Qué más se puede pedir? This is what 5 stars is all about, and yes, I'm doing it after only one visit. ONLY?!? This one visit was a near perfect restaurant experience. ¿Qué más se puede pedir? This is another of my favorite combination of a grungy, old strip mall hiding an absolute gem of an independently-owned eatery. Kind of like a geode in restaurant form. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE is a great place to start. All I was doing was minding my own biddness, reading the menu posted in the front window as I strolled by. (Maybe I was going to the tattoo shop, maybe trails, maybe 7-11, maybe cheba hut, who knows? (oh, yeah - me, but who's saying?(i could, but that's not important right now.))) As I began to get a feel for the menu, but still not quite sure if i'd venture in, Raul opens the door and warmly welcomes me inside. Vocalizations of reluctance are futile, as he insists that I sit inside and cool off, even if just to read the menu, which he places in front of me and offers to answer any questions. He's away and back in a flash with a tiny dish of toasted corn (pic), which he proudly declares is what they give in restaurants in Peru instead of chips and salsa. Along with it, he added a sample of what he called Peruvian 'lemonade', which was actually passionfruit juice -- FRESH juice, with tiny, weird, soft seeds floating in it, and everything! Of course, I was hooked, and he knew it. I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes, and even several photos to help a gringo like me. ¿Qué más quieres? EXCELLENT FRESH FOOD Okay, they've got that in Peru, apparently, and brought some here for us! There are a variety of 'regular' mexican items, but flip that menu over and find another page full of Comida Peruana. A multitude of ways to get your fish, chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, octopus, egg, beef heart, corn, veggies, yucca root, plantain, and spices. quieres más? Seco de Cabrito? (goat stew?) sorry....... only on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. My Lomo Saltido(pic) had beef, chicken, rice, onions, tomatoes, and HOME FRIES mixed with cilantro and other spices to make a tiny amount of an au jus like gravy on the bottom of the plate, which i made sure flavored every bite that got into my mouth. Not greasy at all. Yes, there were chunks of fried potato that really were basically home fries mixed in, and yes, it was absolutely delicious.  I did not even use the two salsas that were offered -- i didn't need them -- but watchout! the samples i had were zoomin' hot. Even the milder green was fiery, but the orange (habanero-tinged?) hotter one was out of my tolerance range! es que todo? NO! Although the hole-in-the-strip-mall setting will turn a few folks away before even getting to the door, "Peruvian Corner" has really put some effort into making the inside inviting and clean. They've used stone and tile and vibrant paint to create an environment a half-step up from the typical stripmall pad turned restaurant.(pic) Ahora estoy contento, VAMOS!
L'Assommoir=3.5Came here for last call and, for a late night bar, I was pretty surprised to see things so empty. Granted, it was a Monday night but closing time seemed to come a wee bit earlier than my local host anticipated. The bar staff was very pleasant to let us have a drink but there was no atmosphere of which to speak. i imagine that in a more populated time, L'Assommoir could be a very fun place. As it was, my experience there was slightly... awkward which was a buzzkill from the fun I was having earlier in the evening. Rather than the perfect place to end the night, LND became the place where the night sort of just... fizzled.Seeing that it was late and a bit on the cool side, I opted for the Jamaican Espresso: rum, Tia Maria coffee liqueur & cold espresso. There might have been some whipped cream/chocolate action on top. I'm not admitting to anything. The drink was just fine for what it was supposed to be: a dessert nightcap for a late night. The Tia Maria was a bit too bitter for me and even the sugar from the espresso & whipped cream (ugh; admitted) wasn't able to offset it as much as I would have liked. This isn't a drink I'd normally get at a bar but for an after dinner alternative to coffee, it'll do. Sorta. I'd need to come back to LND on a busier night and order a drink drink (maybe some apps as well?) to really get a feel for the type of place it is. As it was, it's a-ok.
DW Bistro=Plenty of natural lighting, vibrant color scheme (white and orange), and tasteful decor instantly scores an A on my restaurant decorating score card.  And the cheerful greetings and friendly smiles vaporizes any lingering traces of everyday life stress that you might have brought with you as you crossed over the threshold. As far as I was concerned, I was in near Zen state to enjoy whatever deliciously food the kitchen has to offer from their Restaurant Week lunch menu.As I was seated at my table, I was offered a choice of DW's own beverage creation. I opted for the Pomegranate Iced Tea, which was served in a tall slender glass with a wedge of lemon.  It was refreshing and not at all tart, a great start to any meal or a pick me up after a spa treatment. And below is my review of the three courses served as part of the RW DW Bistro's Lunch Prix-Fixe menu. First Course: It was a tough choice, but I went with the DW Spanish Chorizo with Shrimp & Summer Tomatoes (instead of the Farmers Market Fresh Berry Salad with Grilled Pineapple & Jerk Pomegranate Dressing - which garnered a lot of attention from the ladies at the next table while they were still debating what to order).  With the elegant and not over the top presentation, fantastic flavors from the Spanish Chorizo and nicely cooked shrimp and tantalizing tomatoes, this was easily my favorite item of the meal.  And lucky for me, it is available on their regular menu!Second Course: Trio of Sliders. Maybe it was the whole food truck phenomenon in the past year, but my mind was made up when I read sliders.  Although I did forced myself to read the remaining options, out of standardized test taking habits. The plate of sliders on mini brioche buns and sweet potato fries looks great.  The sliders individually are small (smaller than Slidin' Thru's sliders) but all three of them combined into up a fair amount of food.The first slider I tried was the Jamaican Jerk Pork, which left a noticeable puddle of grease on the plate and underside of the bun. My first and only Fuku Truck burger experience, complete with the horribly grease-soaked buns that I suffered through did an instant replay in my head before I managed to locate the mental stop play button.  Luckily, it was a lot less grease, but still a sharp drop from the excitement from the first course. Slider #2 was the mini-me-sized DW Turkey Burger.  The turkey was juicy, and the mango pear apple chutney combined to make miniaturized fireworks in my mouth.  If the regular sized burger has the same juicy turkey, then I will happily order that again on my next trip back.  Favorite #2!The last slider I ate was the New Mexican Red Chili Pork Slider.  It has a kick to it, but I felt that it was missing something. Maybe crispy fried onions for a little crunchy texture or over-easy quail eggs for the addition of the rich and creaminess of the egg.Third Course:DW Trio of Desserts featuring Red Velet Cake (was good), Lemon-Lime Pudding with a fresh Blueberry (a spoonful is not enough,I want more!) and Jamaican Black Bottom Banana Cream Pie (Not sure if this was what I was served? But the chocolate dominated the other flavors, which wasn't bad as I have a weak spot for chocolates).  Overall, the lunch was good.  Definitely top notched wait staff that flawlessly attend to the guests while they dine.  The appetizers seems to be the star here,at least for me, and I would come back just for that section of the menu alone. Ambiance:  5/5  From the other reviews I am not alone in thinking that they hit a home run with their interior decorating concept and execution.  Care to give me your interior designer and contractor as a referral?Service:  5/5  Just simply pleasant without being over the top.Price:  4.5/5  Looking at the pricing and the portions of the regular menu items, it is a nice lunch spot to go to recharge for the rest of your day.  Items are mostly in the $10-$13 range, which is more than the average lunch specials, but is a great deal considering the upscale surroundings and pleasant service.Food:  4/5  Some items are perfect, others needs some more tweaking are needed. Overall, still great food.Location:  SW Las Vegas.  Pretty far for out-of-town visitors staying on the Strip.  Definitely a cool spot for locals that work or living in the area.Solid 4.5 stars!  I am an excited fan hungry for more.  Burp!Yet another place you can throw into the argument for best local restaurant!  My wife and I have had a hankering for awesome Jamaican food ever since we vacationed in Negril a couple of years ago.  While this place isn't traditionally that, they blend a lot of what makes that cuisine great with their own creative twists to it.  We couldn't start the meal with anything but the Jamaican Curry Soup.  Anthony M recommended we have it the night before along with pretty much every Yelp review and it was tremendous.  I would strongly consider just getting a large bowl of this with a side of rice for my next visit.  In fact, my wife enjoyed it so much, she ordered another bowl of it WHILE eating her entree.  Who backtracks back to the appetizer?I got the oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which was rich and filling.  The jerk spice was jerktastic and the portion was pretty generous.  We went for the "perfect chocolate cake" to finish the meal.  Pretty bold to call it that and while I've had better, it was a nice ending to an awesome meal.Love my neighborhood bistro!Came here the other night for date night! Repeat offender, been here 3 times now... and will be back often since I live down the street from this amazing place!I love bringing my friends here! good place to have dinner with your girls or date night!I've tried everything from their sliders, lollipop chicken, ahi salad, lamb, carrot cake, and I'm always open to trying their main entree of the night and the dessert special of the day. don't forget to try their selection of breads~ yumm!On my last visit they gave me the dessert special on the house! Thanks DW!I'm surprised that a lot of people don't know about DWB! I'm spreading the word! A must in Vegas especially if you live in the area!Indoor/outdoor seating. trendy. great customer service. fantastic food!ilovejewelyn approved!I'll be back soon DWB!love it!- Miss Yelp 2012First and foremost I wish I could give 10 stars... by far THE BEST dining experience i have ever had in Las Vegas.came in this morning and sat at the bar with the bartender San. My bf and i have been in search of a good brunch place in Vegas and we've found our new spot! the decor is simple modern and elegant. DW was also behind the bar and he was so humble and nice! I started out with a Strawberry Ginger drink (its on their specialty cocktail list) it was amazing! so refreshing. then i moved on to a Bloody Marry. Amazing! their Bloody Mary mix is made fresh and it has a jerk spice that really kicks up the classic cocktail. for Brunch i ordered a roasted veggie egg white omelet. by far the best omelet Ive ever had. Roasted squash, peppers, and potatoes. and the various hot sauces they have really made the dish! my bf had the turkey burger. the bread on the turkey burger was so light and fluffy it was so good! we finished our meal with a strawberry mojito, but instead of soda water San introduced us to a Jamaican Soda called Ting. its almost like a Squirt but far better! all in all i cannot wait to go back. we almost came back a 2nd time tonight for dinner haha. Amazing place i will be recommending this to everyone!I saved my 700th review for something righteously outstanding. We decided to square in on something difficult for us to get to normally for our staycation time and this was the one place I was I really wanted.The space is modern and vibrant and it was a lovely day so we sat outside. They had a white peach pomegranate ice tea that is a must order. It's fruity and refreshing. After much back and forth on several attractive sounding dishes and suggestions from our waiter we decide on our lunch. While we waited, he came back with a little amuse bouche of sorts. He wanted us to try some of their very popular curry soup and it was quite nicely spiced and complex. Promising for our food to come.He brought a few bottles of hot sauces to the table that were favorites and explained each one. A place of my heart - I love things to be more spicy as of late! Short rib sandwich was a beef dream. The braise on them was done right and it was tender and juicy and the jalapeno bacon was smoky and really nicely crispy contrast and their ciabatta bread was good and held up to the meats. I threw on some Scotch Bonnet hot sauce on this was it elevated it perfectly. Sweet potato fries were really light and crispy, more like chips in that addictive keep dipping in the chipotle mayo on the side and popping it in your mouth sort of way.The "bowl of the day" was spiced chicken and chorizo bowl with roasted corn and chilies. This was such a hearty portion we could not finish. Lovely spice and I like that the chorizo was crisped up on the edges. This went well with the mango hot sauce on our table and was such a addictive combo. Being Asian I've cooked up just about everything and ordered everything with rice that it's hard to make me think it's the best thing on rice since white on rice. I loved this dish and reminded me of what my carribean creole neighbors mango gumbo fed me as a kid. Gah, nostalgia gets you every time. Since it was our first time there,  our server got us a small slice of their carrot ginger cake to taste. We were full and didn't think we can take more than a bite, but we had to eat it. It was moist, had a very nice balance of spice and the frosting was not too sweet. The raspberry and mango sauces and fresh berries on the plate were perfect accompaniments. I love carrot cake and haven't had one make me smile in a long time. My little heart is pining for some right now. I want a whole cake - none for anyone else. Service here was amazing. Our server Lorenzo was so upbeat and friendly and uber attentive to little details. That's what puts this place over the edge for me was all the small things which is such a rarity. Since it was our first time he told us the story of the place and food, took his time running through the menu populars and his personal favorites when we couldn't make a choice. It's rare that a place goes beyond to make your first time special and wanted us a bite of their star curry dish, try some of their banging carrot cake, brought us favorite hot sauces that pair well with what we ordered. It adds a depth of warmth and thoughtfulness that normally is reserved for regulars and even then is lost on many establishments. Something I expect from  ungodly pricey places, but isn't always delivered. Drinks were always topped off and we were checked on in a very present but not overbearing way. Also when we were handling the check, our ice teas were still to the top and he asked if we would like to take them in to-go cups with us and since it was delish of course we did. It was a nice touch. He also showed us their dinner and brunch menus and hoped we enjoyed everything and come see them to try out their other menus. I have been stingy with 5 stars, and almost never give first visits a 5, but this IS as good as it gets! One of the better dining experiences I've had in this city. Vibrant, exciting food, lovely atmosphere and thoughtful service. I put off going because I never have a reason to be in this part of town, but with a experience this strong this IS the reason to come out of the way here, and come back fast. It may even have to be this weekend.In short, DW Bistro is a fantastic brunch spot.  Here are the keywords/phrases to help you consider whether or not DW is for you: FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, JERK FRIED CHICKEN, and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS.There is always a warm greeting from the hostess and courteous attention from the wait staff. As busy as they get (and trust me, they can get busy--I wish they took reservations), they keep an eye on you (and your BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS).  Even the customers at the bar are FRIENDLY. We met a regular named Randall. He was giving me drink suggestions while we waited for our table. People who frequent this place really care about it and want you to enjoy your experience.  And by the way, Randall was right about the Bloody Mary--it was a bit too spicy for me. I'm glad he asked he bartender to let me taste it first.  It was perfect for my Dad-in-law, so there was something for everyone. Of course I didn't need any help from Randall with ordering the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS. When people linger too long, I believe these drinks are often to blame. This is a place to gather and linger.  That adds to the energy of the place.  I can see how that lingering can be both a pro and a con. We've been coming to DW since they opened. Even from those first visits they were putting out a delicious, high-quality product. DW takes a Caribbean/Southwestern angle with their relatively traditional dishes.  I don't LOVE every dish. But I do enjoy them. Their unique take does lead to some less successful dishes for me. But I so appreciate the creativity and effort.  They always have tasty off-menu specials. This trip we tried the JERK FRIED CHICKEN sandwich and it was divine. I have no idea why it is not a regular item on the menu. It was one of the most tender, flavorful chicken sandwiches I have ever had. My mother-in-law declared it was THE best she had ever had. This is a fabulous local spot. I'm glad they are becoming a popular, regular spot for so many.My guess would be this place is a hit for breakfast or lunch, at least that is what the majority of the reviews are raving about. We stopped in for dinner. The restaurant has a very cool and modern vibe to it. Our server came over immediately and brought out water for us. The water was lukewarm and had no ice, which I found a tad strange. The dinner prices on the menu were on the high side and hence why the lower rating. Their "from the grill" section averaged at about $25 per plate... I just ate a fine dining restaurant on the strip and my entree that absolutely blew me away was $32... so the price at this restaurant threw me off a bit. Simple salad averaged at about $15 here.. You get the point. It was pricey for an off strip restaurant in the middle of a strip mall.I opted for the Jamaican curry chicken bowl with couscous ($14). The portion was huge, the veggies fresh, and the curry was adequate; there really wasn't much kick to it. I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper to my left overs which made it more delicious and less bland. Now, they could have EASILY made the portion half of what it was and had lower price points (this is especially applicable to the higher priced items on the menu). This would affect the marginal willingness to pay of the consumer. But, I digress. Boyfriend had Jerk Chicken Scampi over Linguine ($16), and that was very delicious..but once again the portion was quite large.Our server was great, friendly, and accommodating throughout. They brought us a complimentary slice of their carrot cake, and it was amazing. The gesture was also well appreciated.  I would probably try them for lunch or breakfast again, but this would not be my choice for dinner.My suggestion would be to reconsider the portion sizes, and price accordingly. But, something tells me that most of their revenue is generated during brunch/lunch, and dinner is an afterthought, therefore this business model works for them.Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those "I don't care about money" days. Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.Filet Mignon and Eggs:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0W-jiyxIbSz02IOaeaPnGg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQMy only treat from their pastry basket:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KYkm65GAGeA5Esh3aZ8evQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQVery important for every meal:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HL691i6bSmoft7U-i2hWzA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQArtwork by Pamela Nielsen (cooler than the other side the pillow): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vKEXDzm3KTazmz1B0A-4HQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4rIE47Bzm_rgHMCGQfg0uA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=z1irvA2JCL1C0GFMWQZwXQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQThis year, I've had the opportunity of eating brunch, lunch, and dinner here thus warranting an updated review. Overall, I love the location. It's less than ten minutes from my house and it's within walking distance from my parents' house. Extremely convenient. Also, parking is simple and it's easy to find. Can't ask for more. The food is different, delicious, and fun. Mostly simple and fresh. The atmosphere is hip, upscale, but still casual. Great for a quick lunch or a fun date night. Service is inconsistent. I've had really wonderful service and I've had just okay service. Everyone is really friendly and great. However, I felt they were too overwhelmed while busy during brunch and everyone needs to learn to be more aware and not ignore tables (no one would stop at our table or take our order until I stopped a hostess and we didn't get our seasonal fruit, even though everyone else around us did). And they kept hitting our chairs - I'm never sitting in the middle of the restaurant again.My go-to brunch options:NEW MEXICAN-STYLE SLOW COOKED PORK OMELET ($13): Great flavor in the pork with the New Mexican Red Chile and that's what really makes this dish, plus, the eggs are so fluffy! Finished with jack cheese. The breakfast potatoes are all right. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're flavorless. Not cool. I'd eat that pork any time and on anything though. JERK FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES ($15): The chicken is moist and the batter is great, but the jerk spices are VERY spicy! Thankfully, you have DW's signature maple syrup to cool you off. The waffles have a good batter and the crisp is good, but it's also a bit dry. Hard to eat a lot of it. DW NICOISE ($16): Wonderful assortment of fresh, delicious vegetables (haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, cherry heirloom tomatoes), fresh mango, hard boiled egg, and pan-seared fresh tuna. Brought together with a bed of greens and dijon champagne vinaigrette. Really great. FRESH BLUEBERRY & WHITE CHOCOLATE SCONES ($8): Really moist and flavorful. Delicious!Lunch selections:My favorite lunch selection is the DW BLT ($12) with jalapeno bacon, yellow heirloom tomato, lettuce, and chipotle mayo; served with sweet potato fries. Really delicious! If you want a light lunch option, the DW SIGNATURE SALAD ($9) with baby field greens, caramelized pecans, orange segments, seasonal bell peppers, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette, is nice and a great price.Dinner favorites:DW FRIED CHICKEN ($19) has the same jerk seasoned flour, but unlike brunch, it's served with housemade cornbread and jerk cream gravy. The cornbread is moist and gravy is delicious. Pretty spicy as well, so beware. VEGETABLE CURRY ($14) that has seasonal vegetables and served with rice or couscous. Really good. JAMAICAN CHICKEN CURRY SOUP ($7) is made with New Mexican green chile and jalapeno bacon. It's thick and filling. PAN SEARED SALMON ($22) is served with guava beurre blanc and DW house rice. Salmon is well-prepared, flavorful, love the sweet beurre blanc and it completes the dish. The only dish I've ever disliked was the JERK FRIED CALAMARI ($10 for half order). Jerk seasoned flour with a sweet chile glaze and sweet hot peppers. The calamari was not fresh, the size of dimes, and really tough. But with only one bad dish, I call dining here successful.Also, make sure that you ask about their desserts because the menu is forever changing and always seasonal. Always delicious too. Most recently, I had their PUMPKIN GOAT CHEESE CAKE. So, so good. Great cinnamon, pumpkin flavors with punches of goat cheese. It had a graham cracker crust and dulce de leche topping. Deeeelicious. Grab a slice while you can!Brunch is really popular because of their bottomless mimosa option ($20). They're extremely generous with the champagne and your glasses are constantly being filled. Once, we went when they opened at 10 am and it was already packed! So, weekend brunch is great, but tread carefully because it is VERY busy. Also, it is the one time they don't take reservations. I would recommend sitting at the bar. I had a wonderful experience when I did that.Hmmm. I've been back a few times since my initial review and I debate with myself if I really like this place. The food is hit or miss. The dishes they hit out of the ballpark with are amazing and the flops really flop. I've been here for breakfast/brunch as well as for dinner and on our most recent visit, I was less than impressed with their New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork bowl. The flavors just weren't dynamic enough. It was spicy, but bland which seems weird. The jerk fried calamari was the star of our meal. Just the right sweet to spicy ratio. I have enjoyed a number of their breafast dishes on previous visits, but nothing has stood out as something I need to come back for regularly. Service has been hit and miss on my visits to DW as well. Service is always friendly, but can drag at times.When someone asks for a nice brunch spot, I almost always suggest DW Bistro, so I know I will be back, but I can't say they are the 5-star experience that I had on my first visit.JERK!  Yes, the flavor of Jamaica. It's in 30 percent of the menu.  That said, what's a group of hungry, foodie poker grinders to do?  Order every "jerk" dish of course.Side note:  this is not a Jamaican restaurant rather a contemporary neighborhood bistro.  Large portions, good prices, and friendly off Strip service.  Hits and misses on flavor and preparation but overall a great value.The jerk seasoning, a good spice blend with pronounced allspice flavor that lacks the fiery scotch bonnet peppers heat and floral pepper taste.  Sadly it results in an earthy taste not often complimented by the other ingredients.The run down:Jerk oven roasted baby back ribs with grilled pineapple and a buttermilk ranch sauce - Tender but very earthy in flavor.  The pineapple provides much needed acidity.Jerk fried calamari with a sweet chili glaze - Pass.  Oily, soggy, and a sticky mess.Couscous salad with jerk seared ahi seasoned with a herbaceous pesto, heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese and a hint of truffle oil is refreshing but the fish is previously frozen.  All good, it's natural flavor is obliterated by the seasoning.DW fried chicken with cornbread and a jerk cream gravy - Southern cooking taken a little too far south.  Jerk seasoning has a burnt, dirt taste once deep fried.  Flabby dish.Jerk lamb chops - Excellent.  Cooked to temperature.  The jerk seasoning enhances the natural game and mineral flavor of the lamb.Jerk filet - Very good.  Like the lamb, cooked to temperature while the seasoning enhances the mineral flavor of the beef.Jerk chicken breast - Flavorful but slightly dry.  The orange glaze does not pair well.Overall, a solid neighborhood bistro with a twist.Oh DW, why must you be so far far away?! And why must you only be open for, four, short little hours on Sundays? I guess when it's that good, you have this option. Overall, I would say DW Bistro, is THAT good.My most recent experience was my second time dining here. The first time just me and my other half, but this was a group of ten. It is safe to say if there was not a crazy wait time, I would give this place 5 stars. They do not accept reservations, but often seem to get large parties. Considering they offer bottomless mimosas, I could see why. I went against the mimosa and chose the DW Bloody Mary which comes with olive, lime, a pickle spear, and 3 slices of jalapeno bacon. It has a bearable kick, and could be considered a meal in itself. Among our table I tried the jerk chicken and waffles, the eggs benedict served with NM style pork, pork jerk hash, a caesar salad, chicken flautas, and the vegetable curry.  My personal favs were the flautas, the actual chicken on the waffle dish, and the curry. Never would I had thought to order curry from here, but oh man I am grateful Vanessa N. kept shoving it down my throat cuz it was freaking delish! My first trip was superb customer service. And with the group, I would say almost the same. I noticed a couple things that went missed, but nothing too major. And with a loud group of 10 obnoxious Yelpers, (who may have been tipsy), I cannot complain about the service we received. It sucked having to wait over an hour to be seated. But great company made the time pass. This is a solid choice for some above average New Mexico style comfort food with a kick. I hope DW decides to expand. I would love to see another location in Henderson somewhere.Unique culinary expressions with a New Mexico meets Jamaica flavor in a trendy, up-scale malleable environment including patio, bar, and table dining fashioned for relationship-building and relationship-sharing. Come here to meet other people of a like mind. Make new friends over some appealing libations and luscious culinary treats. This establishment appropriately includes the term "Bistro" as part of its name, and the "Bistro" vibe is as evident and obvious as it is workable. That is to say: go with the flow, relax and ease into things, absorb your surroundings, shake hands with someone new, step out of your comfort zone of the static, stoic, serious, sultry dimly-lit jacket-and-tie lounges and feel the energy of this place.  This venue is incomparable within the Las Vegas culinary community.  It doesn't have to be perfect. It is. As is. That's the greatness of it all. An example of a dinner recently: House Salad: a sprinkle of goat cheese complemented by the candied walnuts over a delicious selection of gathered greens and accouterment.Side of Fried Chicken (1 piece): a crusted chicken breast deep fried with a kick of spice. Just right for that "craving" sized portion as an appetizer, maybe to split!Lamb Chops: Recommended medium rare to medium. The jerk seasoning graces the tenderness of the quality meat.A selection of fresh bakery treats accompanies every meal with an inspired spread.  A respectable and varied wine list and an admirable selection of beers and a half-dozen or so cocktails of the muddled-over-ice variety. First time visitor? You get a piece of cake! Just ask.  "Pickapeppa"-brand condiments on every table. The chef-inspired creations are of higher quality than you will find at most establishments in Las Vegas. For example, veal with pancetta and gravy over braised greens and pan-fried potatoes on special was a luscious cut with just the right amount of heat. The story of this restaurant is worthy of recognition: a Jamaican-born immigrant growing up in New Mexico with a passion for food partnered with a business-minded shaker-and-mover. If you are looking for something else other than that, something else than an independent restaurateur experience, something for discounts or assembly line or union or blandness, just go somewhere else and leave this underappreciated hard working group of wonderful people to the folks that appreciate them for what they are: a strong contribution to the local Las Vegas community. Good date night experience. Good business meeting experience. Good hang out experience. Good eats. Good drinks.This place is the best! I can't even remember how many times I've been here. The staff is fabulous! You can tell that they are happy to work there. You won't sit through your meal without a few table touches from either your server or the owners. So rare of many restaurants nowadays, so refreshing to see owners care about their product and customers. One of my favorites on their menu is their Truffle mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms. This side dish blows my mind. The best mac and cheese ever! Please take my word and order it. Their jerk fried calamari is also excellent. All of their desserts are great except for their red velvet cake. It was incredibly dry and disappointing. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it might have just been a bad day for them. I ordered this at night so it might have been the last piece of a cake that has been out all day. Regardless, it would be unfair to give DW anything but 5 stars.Top shelf dining experience for under $100 per couple! Dinner for two...1) App: Plantains with cayenne and honey 2) Dinner: Salmon 3) Dinner: Oxtail4) Dessert: Pumpkin swirl cheesecake 5) Two glasses of wine Total: $90The service is 5-star and the food is exceptional! Great decor and location! If you want great service EVERY time...just ask for Louis! He is the man and never disappoints! Awesome recommendations and always has the meal on the table quickly and efficiently!2 words for you: UNLIMITED MIMOSAS! For only $20 too! That said, I don't recommend coming here for brunch if you have to be sober and productive later in the day ;) The staff is great, the food is amazing, and did I mention unlimited mimosas?! Just plan to wait for a table cause their Sunday brunch is really popular-not just for the mimosas but for the atmosphere. Plus it's a local joint run by locals so it has that special flair to it.I like my mimosas just like my beach attire... bottomless. I mean over seven hundred reviews and a four and a half star rating, DW is obviously doing something right. From the decor of the venue, to the amazing food, and don't forget the drinks. No wonder this place is always packed. Walking up to DW Bistro you can already feel the buzz and I'm not talking alcohol... yet. On Sundays this place is humming with hungry brunchers, and with an hour wait ahead, why not start starting sippin' on some bottomless mimosas. These will cost about twenty dollars a person, which really isn't a deal bad especially if you're here with a large group. They aren't stingy either, every time my glass was empty, before I could look around for a server my glass was being topped off. We finally sat down and immediately ordered the pastry basket. This is filled with chocolate croissants & blueberry white chocolate scones. The soft pastries were very fresh and surprisingly not overly sweet. This basket is overflowing and will easily feed five people, a great way to kick off the brunch party. With a group five I won't bore you with what everyone ate, I mean it's really all about my snacking skills, right? Kidding of course (NOT REALLY) I ordered one of their "off the menu specials". A Mexican-style slow cooked chicken omelet. This was a delicious, and I didn't feel bad about eating an omelet with chicken inside. I mean who cares which came first. The chicken was super tender and came soaking in a New Mexico red chili sauce with peppers, onions and pepper jack cheese. I would most definitely order this bad boy again. Our service was point and our party never had any issues. We ever stayed after they closed and the servers were still pouring mimosas.  This place is a great local hangout spot and the owner, DW, is awesome. He even topped off a few of our drinks personally. PRO TIP: DW does not take reservations. So if you plan on coming here for brunch on Mother's Day, better get here early! Just sayin!First impressions: the interior reminds me of somewhere a desert cult might hang out to recruit rich members, in a good way. The mostly-white interior with orange accents, lots of windows and light, and small decorative touches like hanging lamps and rustic patio seating all come together in a really nice way. BEST OPTIONSSpanish chorizo with shrimp (app)- incredible, the sauce was similar to a curry and the shrimp were perfect. I'd pay double for an entrée-sized portion and be happy with just that. Fun mix of bread options for dipping.Green chile cheeseburger- Perfectly cooked to medium, massive portion, good variety of flavors. The jalapeno pepper bacon makes this dish. Side it with the salad, which has a light dressing, walnuts, and goat cheese. Sweet potato fries are for suckers.New Mexico Spicy Pork Bowl- the most disappointing of the "good" dishes. I'd get it for the great value ($14 for a 2 pound bowl that will last you three more meals) and because the spices remind me of a dish my mom used to make with brisket... but it doesn't actually have much flavor. Eggs weren't cooked properly (one under, one over) and they don't actually go with the other ingredients. Hearty and comforting but underwhelming.SKIP THESEChicken Flautas- these were accidentally brought to our table, then comped, but tasted like they were out of a box in the frozen section. Not particularly crispy or flavorful, but plated in a fun way. Not a fan of the filling.Jerk Shrimp Salad- the shrimp is blackened to greatness, but the salad itself fell flat. Dressing was bland and didn't tie the elements together. Ate less than half.DW Bloody Mary- $12 glass, split among our table of 3, still didn't finish it. The drink is 1/3 garnishes (love that jalapeno bacon!) and the beverage itself is nicely spicy, but it wasn't great and we agreed we wouldn't get it again.Service was professional. Most other parties appeared to be drinking heavily during their visit, so this is probably best experienced as a brunch place. Not sure if Id return without someone else suggesting it.This place doesn't need any more reviews. I just came here to praise the service. I set up a brunch for a friend's birthday for 14 people. The table the set us at was too small and we literally had no room -- so they moved us to an empty room so there was much more space for us. Perfect. We figured that since they only opened it for us, we'd get less service. Nope. These dudes/dudettes were on top of it. They were constantly checking up on us; refilling our drinks without even having to ask, and the food was out so quick. I didn't even mention that it was my friends birthday, but they brought her some cake anyways. I've been here quite a few times for brunch and this is why. Always excellent service, food and I love the atmosphere. I love this place. Probably my #1 spot for brunch in Las Vegas.During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited DW Bistro again for lunch on a Sunday.  The place was jammed packed, which is always a good sign.  We had eight people in our party making the wait for a table even more challenging.  The person (I think he is one of the owners) who checked us in was so friendly and welcoming that we trusted the fact he said it would not be too long, and he was correct.  DW Bistro has a pretty cool check in system that sends a text indicating your name has been recorded and when your table is ready. After being seated, they offer all you can drink mimosas for $20.  After a hectic weekend, we went with pomegranate iced teas, and one person had an amazing Bloody Mary.   The pomegranate iced tea was super refreshing, and the Bloody Mary was exciting.  The Bloody Mary comes with a garnish containing an olive, a pickle, and a piece of bacon...yes a piece of bacon.  There was certainly nothing boring or routine about the Bloody Mary. I started off with the Chicken Flautas as an appetizer.  The flautas were spicy enough, and the chicken inside was perfect.  The presentation was equally impressive.  My main course was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Waffles with homemade syrup.  Do not be concerned when you see the coating around the chicken.  The coating is dark, thick, but it is so delicious.  The coating is complex and contains several Jamaican spices.  Others in our party went with the Eggs Benedict, and they indicated it was delicious as well.  The item is served on fresh biscuits and a side of potatoes.  In regards to the service, it is clearly five stars! If you find yourself in south Las Vegas near Summerlin, you must give DW Bistro a try.  On the other hand, if you need some time away from the strip, drive 15 minutes south and enjoy the unique dishes that DW Bistro has to offer.
Ondine=At Ondine, when you see food, eat it.One of Edinburgh's top seafood restaurants.   Elegant setting, properly appointed, pressed linens, and well-dressed patrons ready to get their hands dirty diving in to piles of Scotland's best seafood.Straight to it, uber fresh cold water oysters are to die for. 4 to 6 different species, each with its well-defined salinity and incredible creamy texture like nothing available in the States. All show a very clean oceanic finish. It's liquor like sea water accented with just a squeeze of lemon.Do not pass on the roasted shellfish platter. New Haven lobster claws, barely warmed through oysters, roasted Dunbar crab (similar to Florida stone crab), Mull scallop in shell, piles of east coast cockles, sweet, succulent razor clams, plump, fatty creamy Shetland muscles, and tender Tarber Langostines all cooked in rich creamy Scottish butter, a splash of wine, and parsley.  A mountain of seafood for 2 to 4 to share. Simply put, outstanding.  Each item is cooked separately to proper doneness then assembled together for serving. The simple preparation brings out the best flavor of each shellfish.Still craving more? A plate of grilled scallops. Presented and still attached to their own shells. A broad bean purée adding a vegetal touch that heightens the sweetness. Sausages of pork and offal adds a subtle metallic flavor that accentuates further the clean oceanic characteristic of the scallop.The lemon sole, gently crusted with breadcrumbs lemon peel capers and parsley then fried. Crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Sautéed brown trim adds a deep "shrimpy" flavor that greatly enhances the flavor of the fish.Finally a Scottish classic, haddock and chips. What to say. Perfectly cooked. The classic minted pea puree further enhancing the mild flavor of the fish.Very well chosen selection of European, old world wines at very reasonable prices.   Average bottle price £40.Extremely friendly, proper, efficient and accommodating service.Reservations two months in advance required.In a word, wow!
India Oven=Just LOVE this place!  I always get the all-you-can-eat buffet which has an amazing range of food choices for all kinds of eaters.  The meat section has a variety of chicken, beef, lamb, and goat dishes.  For vegetarians like myself, about a third of the food bar is made up of different veggie-only dishes--my favorite being the Paneer Tikki Masla--I always go back for a second helping!  The servers (who are all very attentive and pleasant) bring out a steady stream of hot garlic naan bread--which is my second fave thing there!  They also have a small salad bar and mango lassi, mango custard, and rice pudding for dessert.  If you go for dinner, they bring tandoori chicken to your table along with the naan--so if you're vegetarian, make sure you tell them not to bring you any from the get go!  Bollywood music videos play on all the TV's.  The place can get pretty packed around peak lunch and dinner hours, so go early!  Lunch buffet costs $8.95 and dinner buffet runs $9.95.  Pretty decent prices for amazing all-you-can-eat Indian food.  Definitely the best around!Hoh. My. Goodness. How I have missed you Indian Food. A trip to India Oven should be on everyone's "Must Do List". Buffet style (unless you wish to order an entree) has hidden dangers. You might eat too much.  The food is clearly labeled into groups. (Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, Salads and Dessert). I recommend diving in unless you feel strongly about eating a particular type of meat. I sampled (like a pack of starving dogs) every item and enjoyed every bite. My pants may not fit, but that has nothing to do with my ability to write. (Full Disclosure: I have eaten tons of Indian food in my hey day.) As the restaurant serves Northern Indian cuisine spice is not a concern. Food items were moderately (to mildly) spiced and the majority were cream based. Dishes were well balanced with ghee (or whatever oil is used). Naan is delivered to the table as is tandoori chicken. (Just try it kids! You'll like it.) Rice is available at the buffet. I was surprised to find mango lassi (a yogurt drink) and chai tea as part of the buffet price. ($12 total during dinner.)India Oven prefers to have groups pay on one check. However have no fear! Our large party was individually able to pay directly at the cashier. However, that might have been possible as we all ordered the same thing. (Buffet!)Thank you India Oven for hosting our very large group. Yelp International Supper Club UYE rocked!After having gone to India Oven a few times now, I'm updating my review for their buffet to 4 stars. I think it's great that they have it for dinner as well which is fairly uncommon to see for an Indian restaurant. For $12, you can have some good Indian food. The highlights of the buffet are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and the paneer tikka masala. Other solid options are also the palak saag, samosa, and pakoras. Everything is mildly spicy. The garlic naan that's brought out is always piping hot, soft and fluffy. I go mostly just for that!Unlike other buffets, their desserts are also pretty good. They have carrot halwa and gulab jams which are served hot. Both are good.I can't give it 5 stars because the service is sometimes on the slow side. I've noticed that when you go in a group, it takes a little bit to get naan and for them to clear plates, get the check, etc.
iKitchen=02/21/11Came here after reading Linda W.'s delightful review.  Had the green tea, gyoza (potstickers), beef and pork egg noodle combo, and a strawberry boba shake.  The gyoza app was good, though the six pieces were too small to share, BUT they were definitely MUCH better than those I'd found at China Magic Noodle House!  The noodle dish was good... preferred the BBQ pork over the beef pieces, but the leftovers weren't as good-- I threw them out after the first bite.  The homemade boba shake was a very nice surprise... creamy and a bit too sweet for me, so I stopped after about a third of it.  Many of the boba (tapioca rounds) were too big to pass through the straw, and that straw was HUGE, as straws go, and that was another reason for me to quit trying.  What I didn't like was finding a bit of plastic in my mouth after taking a big slurp-- the shake was made on site, then mechanically topped w/ a plastic wrap cover that had to be broken w/ a straw in order to drink out of the cup- blech!  Having written all that, I'd order another shake in the future, and I'll be sure to share it w/ a friend, or two!
Bonanno's New York Pizzeria=Not every meal in Vegas is going to be over the top. Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat after laying by the pool all day. Bonanno's is located at the Food Court in the District. It is convenient to the MGM Pool Complex. Also, they are open late(maybe 24 hours? They do serve breakfast)Just had a quick slice of pizza, but it was delicious, cheap, and quick. Exactly what I was looking for. Great option for a late night snack too since most places in the area stop serving food around Midnight.
The Flying Biscuit Cafe=Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!
Papi Chulo's Mexican Grill & Cantina=Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!Thanks to Groupon, I found this place.  We've been here several times and I don't agree with the 2 1/2 stars rating.  it's definitely not the best place I've ever eaten, but it's good.  Here's what I've had here:Cheese Crisp - $8.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=vobH3MGb5ostI01qY3SeWQ#vobH3MGb5ostI01qY3SeWQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=Fj8kmoSXVJUhF1joHVkK9w#Fj8kmoSXVJUhF1joHVkK9wGround Beef Hard Tacos - $11.29http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=BI3NZTRm3Ignx-CLsv3DtQ#BI3NZTRm3Ignx-CLsv3DtQMexican Street Tacos (Steak Soft Tacos) - $8.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=_CcDpdhF8kOB-Qta9NL8sg#_CcDpdhF8kOB-Qta9NL8sgSteak Burrito - $11.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=IstAnjmDnrHP0TYMb483oQ#IstAnjmDnrHP0TYMb483oQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=e4PNiSPBgSAnH0g39c88pg#e4PNiSPBgSAnH0g39c88pgChicken Tortilla Soup - $7.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=cMLPs88zNzsNC4sRm6EHpQ#cMLPs88zNzsNC4sRm6EHpQAll of these are pretty good, especially the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Hard Tacos, and Soft Tacos....yum!The complimentary Chips & Salsa comes out with a mild Salsa, but if you ask they'll bring out very Spicy Salsa, which is awesome.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/papi-chulos-mexican-grill-and-cantina-scottsdale?select=s_E6fYrea1MBkOLUUwdglQ#s_E6fYrea1MBkOLUUwdglQThe people who work here are very friendly and always welcome us with a smile.  As a matter of fact, they know that we'll start with a Cheese Crisp and Spicy Salsa so before we sit down they're already working on the order.  I like great service like this.There's also a lot of TV's in the restaurant, so we come here for lunch on Saturday or Sunday and watch football while we eat.Overall, it is definitely a 4 Star experience in my book.Return Factor - 90%
CiCi's Pizza=I don't know what all the fuss is about CiCi's pizza?Finally gave it a shot and wished that I had not given it a second thought.It's not even that cheap, if you consider the total after drinks are added.The quality is just not there of course. Not going to find anything gourmet in their AYCE buffet.I guess I am one that prefers quality over quantity.The $18 bucks or so we spent for two was not worth it by any means.I am not a fan of cheese covered cardboard which is their version of pizza.Oh well I tried it, now I know what it is all about.Life will go on without ever consuming their cardboard cuisine again.Enough said...
Siena Italian Authentic Trattoria and Deli=Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.Do NOT believe the hype. I have been here four times.  Each time something worse happens. I'm not sure who is to blame for the poorly behaved and badly trained wait staff, but one thing I can say for sure, after the fourth visit, is that the poor service and way below average food quality are definitely consistent!My last (and final) visit to this restaurant included:  frozen, reheated crab cakes, that were disgusting; an 11.00 spinach salad that consisted exactly of spinach, six raw walnuts, and 5 pieces of artichoke hearts;  and then there was the entree.  The entree was our final knife in the gut and pocket book.  We ordered the lobster and steak special.  We specifically asked the waiter for a filet cut of steak.  He served us a small piece of grisly meat that my giant, sharp, steak knife, literally could not cut through!  When we told him it was not filet, he was condescending and rude and acted like we didn't know what we were talking about!  Grrr!  We were highly insulted that they would pass this horrible quality and poorly made menu items off as authentic Italian cuisine. If that is authentic Italian cuisine, no one would ever lay claim to it!The manager half heartedly apologized, although she seemed more worried about upsetting the condescending waiter than she was concerned about our horrible experience, and she removed the uneaten special from our bill.  I have not ever wrote a bad restaurant review, however, they should not be able to get away with this in a city filled with amazing restaurant options.   I hope that they can address their issues and be an asset to our community in the future.This review is for the deli.I had been wanting to try this place and was surprised to find out they have a deli and restaurant! From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left. I ordered a "Sicilian Sandwich" priced at $6.99 and a "Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of "Pecan Cheesecake" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set. The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point. I enjoyed the sandwiches and dessert enough to return! Inside was clean and the employees were very friendly and helpful.I had no idea they had a nicer resaurant side and a deli & bakery on another. Now that I do, I will be stopping in more for lunch. I always see the parking lot packed with cars when driving by so my wife and I decided to check it out. The deli & bakery side has glass cases of breads, cakes, cookies etc. I originally wanted a sausage sandwich (the sausage is made fresh at the restaurant) but they were out for the day so we ordered a meatball and Sicilian sandwich. Both were good and affordable. The meatball sandwich was cheesy and the sauce had a good taste. I don't know how many meatballs are supposed to come on it but they weren't shy with them at all. The Sicilian sandwich had a lot of flavor for not looking like much. There was either an Italian dressing or maybe oil and vinegar on it but whatever it was I liked it. The bread on the sandwiches was good but I picked out a loaf of bread from the bakery and it wasn't as soft and fresh tasting as I hoped for. I will pick out a different kind next time and give it a try. Good to know there is another solid sandwich in town.Las Vegas has roughly 5000 delis- this is tone of he best.Half of the building is an upscale restaurant and half is a grocery/deli you can dine in- immediately turn to your right upon entering to to to this section. The other half is basically for upscale dinner-quality dates.The bakery-deli-grocery has everything you could possibly need from fresh pastas to calamari salad to real canned peeled San Marzano tomatoes for kitchen adventures and more marinated artichokes, olives, and peppers than you can shake a stick at.Order at the back counter for takeout or dine-in: the first sandwich listed on the "hot" page is what you want to get. It's a chicken cutlet with spinach, fresh cheese, and God only knows what else, and it's frickin' amazing.Runner up is the Sicilian sandwich, the first listed on the "cold" page, with ham, Genoa, and mortadella with mozzarella- get it with everything on it. Fresh crunchy veggies, complementary spices and oil, and the freshest and most flavorful meats and cheeses I've yet encountered.  Both sandwiches are made with the freshest, most delightful french roll bread. Oh, and they're frickin' huge. Like half of a single sandwich is an entire meal, huge.If that's not enough for you, there are two cases of desserts and the service is phenomenal- be sure to get the guy with the thick black-framed glasses, he's delightful! And they have both regular happy hours (3-7PM, daily) and reverse (Mon, Tues, Thurs, 9PM to close) with half price drinks and apps.This review is for the deli only.  I wanted to make something different for family that was staying with us.  My neighbor recommends this place highly so I gave it a try.I bought some boxes of frozen stuffed shells made in house and a container of their house made marinara sauce.  The result when I baked the shells was very good.  I took a look at the other frozen pastas they have, and while the price seems higher than supermarkets. I think the quality is higher.Service was just OK.  Even though it was an hour before closing and no one else was in the store, I had to wait to ask a question until the two young guys on duty finished the conversation they were having.  After looking at me, one of them turned back to his co-worker and continued the conversation.  I was going to give the deli 4 stars, but I deducted one for the lackadaiscal service.While out and about early on a Sunday looking for a bite to eat we saw their tiny lit up sign in the window that read "OPEN".  I looked at the hubs and we thought...why not!  They offer a full menu on Sundays along with a brunch menu. We decided on a full meal rather than brunch.  I split the small chopped salad that tasted great!  It was full of fresh cut meats and cheese along with some red onion and garbanzo beans.  All tossed in their great tasting caesar dressing.  I had the rigatoni bolognese.  The serving was HUGE and was incredible.  We were served some bread that tasted fresh!Service was spectacular!  Our water glasses were filled multiple times.  I look forward to stopping my their deli in the near future or even planning a night out with my husband.  This place has a great warm ambiance.  I noticed they have a nice looking bar too!
Lush Burger=Can't say as I was impressed.  They are going to have to improve the ordering system if they plan to survive.  I can get table service an comparable places for the same, or lower price.  We waited in line for 20 minutes (we were only third in line) just to give our order, and only then did they open up a second register well after the line had snaked out the door.  Even then, the cashier (for lack of a better term for her) was robotic, and constantly interrupting us mid-order.Once ordered, we waited a normal amount of time for how busy the place was.  The chocolate shake was bitter, the fries arrived cold, and my wife's Infusion burger was less than spicy.  My classic was supposed to be medium (the "chef's recommendation") but it was more raw than anything else.I would try it again, but this place is on a short leash, as not many people will make a second trip out there unless the service and quality takes a huge step forward soon.  If you like a drive and a burger, your better off going to Greasewood Flats.Kind of a cool retro vibe inside with digital screens for menus.  I was excited until the lush experience began....Don't bother asking the cashier questions about the food.  She acted like they were slammed....1 party of 4 behind me.We waited over 30 minutes for our food (fast-casual??).  This includes sodas!  We were told we were supposed to get the drinks after ordering.......well the cashier was in such a hurry to get rid of us and she never gave us drinks or told us to wait for them.......very weird and confused set up.  They were not busy.  My burger was dry and not even close to medium.  No one at my table said anything positive.  How hard is it to cook burgers?The fries were greasy and soft....not sure if this is what they're going for?  Not for me.Burgers are $8 - $12 dollars.  An extra $4 gets you (or is supposed to get you) a drink and greasy fries.....put a salad, shake, or dessert on top of that and you're looking at $20 per person!!!  Ridiculously overpriced.  Low quality.  No flavor.  I will NOT be back nor will my fellow diners.
E2=I was really disappointed by this place. I went as a double date on a Friday night. Tim had been here before and really enjoyed it. I tried to make a reservation, but was told that they only take them for larger parties (6 or more) - and that if I wanted a guaranteed table, I should show up before 7 because there is typically a 45 minute wait.Harley and Matt arrived slightly before Tim and I and our bottle of wine. However, they were able to easily secure a table. They said the host took a while to appear to seat them and answered the phone a few times before acknowledging them.There was a ridiculously long wait for water and wine glasses. We didn't even get a bread platter. Our waitress was kind and gave us some recommendations from the menu. Other than that, we did not see her the entire meal until it was time for us to pay. Our food was dropped by the host and a busboy. We refilled our own wine and water. Someone gave us a bag of burnt bread with our entrees. The food was bland and not very good - the guys enjoyed theirs, but Harley and I did not enjoy ours. I had the lobster risotto - it was overpowered with chewy lobster. And that is something one would not normally say about a lobster dish. I was starving after finishing my plate and choking down two pieces of charred bread. I ordered beignets for the table, hoping to give e2 a second chance...but the beignets were chewy and bland.We left very quickly.
Ocean Trail=Just returned home from having dinner here w/ Mom tonight.  I've wanted to try Ocean Trail ever since I heard about a new sushi place opening up at Talking Stick Resort six weeks ago.  The resort opened on Tax Day, April 15th, and Ocean Trail was supposed to open a couple of days after, but its first day was actually Thursday, the 22nd.  The sushi menu was discarded and was replaced by a Creole/Cajun- style seafood.  Specialties include pan-roasts w/ a lobster-based broth finished w/ tomato cream and gumbos, roux-based stew containing andouille sausage and chicken.  You may choose to add chicken, shrimp, crawfish, crabmeat, or oyster, or a combination of whatever strikes your fancy!  (Prices start at around $15.)  The elegant, pearlized one-page menu lists a few starters, such as oysters-on-the-half-shell ($9 1/2 dozen and less than $18 for a full order) and lump crab cocktail ($14.75), and P.E.I. mussels w/ a garlic-wine broth, salads (half- and full orders) and chowders (a New England clam chowder, which I sampled and found delicious, and a corn chowder that looked amazingly creamy and decadent!), the said pan-roasts and gumbos, plus $5 (approx.) sides of red beans, red beans and rice, rice, and steamed collard greens.  Croutons aren't housemade, nor is the wonderfully-balanced caesar salad dressing, but the desserts (no set menu thus far- this week's selections are chocolate cake, berries and cream anglaise, and a key lime tart- so you'll have to check in weekly to see what the pastry chef, who used to create pastries for Casino Arizona's McKellips location, creates.  (If you've ever tried the delightful desserts served at the Eagles Buffet, then you know what she's capable of.)For dinner, we had the crab cocktail, a small order of caesar salad, and berries and creme anglaise for dessert.  The salad was perfectly dressed w/ a nice amount of parmesan tossed in, the romaine lettuce was crisp, and the croutons crunchy and light, and there weren't a gazillion of them, either.  (I feel so cheated when a salad has too many croutons.  I say, light on the bread and give me more veggies!)  The crab cocktail was also very nice, but I'd have preferred a bit more lump crab and less of the homemade remoulade (mayonaisse-based w/ capers, celery, onion, black pepper, dijon mustard, and Old Bay seasoning, among other seasonings).  The martini glass it came in must have contained 2/3 remoulade and a 1/3 of the actual crab.  While I wouldn't agree w/ Mom that we could get this and the salad at any Red Lobster, I did see how paying $15 for this item was a bit too steep.  (I had noticed that the menu at the Blue Coyote Cafe, located on a lower level, also offered a lump crab cocktail for $12.25, but upon inquiry was told that the host imagined the one served above would be "more flavorful."  I'd like to find out if there is a difference.  I'll keep you posted.)  We were also served a big "cone" of table bread and a side of butter.  Just a plain white bread roll, sliced and warmed, but it paired well w/ the crab cocktail and salad.  Thank goodness for the berries and cream.  It was the only item we ordered that Mom didn't shake her head at (she thought the menu was overpriced).  This ambrosial dessert consisted of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries sitting on a well of creme anglaise (a rather shallow well, I thought), and topped w/ homemade whipped cream and a very pleasing rolled cookie.  I inquired about the other two desserts, and we really fell for the description of the chocolate cake-- a slice of four-layer cake w/ a chocolate ganache filling.  Mom isn't opposed to coming back to try the cake :)Loved the blue-tiled walls, marbled round counter, and light fixture above the bar, but have to agree w/ Mom that seeing the serving bowls, open pots and double-boilers, and metal food containers did take away from the gourmet dining experience.  Having to choose to sit at the "back" of the round counter, away from the casino floor, and the excited slot machine player, also lessened the enjoyment of the cool atmosphere that Ocean Trail offers.  However, chatting w/ the chefs and bartenders does add to the fun experience, if you just keep an open mind to enjoying your stay here.This is by far the best bang for your buck without sacrificing quality in this Valley when it comes to Oysters and Chowder.I have eaten at the place on at least 5 seperate occasions. It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's, with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils, and cajun concoctions.First off, the Oysters on the Half Shell are reasonably priced, as fresh as I have had here in the Valley, and everytime that I have ordered them, they have been consistently fresh. I'm not sure that type of Oysters they serve off the top of my head, but they are great!As for the Clam and Corn Chowder, they are both amazing for the Valley of the Sun! The clam chowder has a great consistency, and does not have that taste of fishy, canned clams. The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent, and the clams are just a nice tender, mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup. The Oyster crackers that they garnish the chowder with are actually seasoned, and are very tasty.The Shrimp boil is another favorite dish. They boil the shrimp in a Citrus, Lobster Stock and finish it with a Tomato Cream sauce. They serve most dishes with crusty sliced bread so you can soak up and enjoy the juices of the dishes.The only thing that I am not a huge fan of, was the crab salad slider. I'm not going to knock the rating down, as everyone else loved them, and the presentation was great. I think that it just wasn't what I was looking to have at the time.When you visit, you will most likely have the pleasure of a very nice woman of asian descent cooking your food directly over the bar in front of you. She goes by the name of Tip, which looks as if it's the first three letters of her extremely long first name on her name tag. You will quickly notice that she puts a large amount of love into her food preparation. Chat with her, she is a sweetheart, and deserves compliments on her work. Tip her out on the side if you care to, as the tips are only pooled by the servers at this restaurant. The manager, Frank deserves a couple of bucks for seating you and taking your order, but in my opinion the one who prepares the meal should get the majority of the reward for the culinary experience that they provide, but that's just my opinion. :)  Frank is an East Coast guy with a stratight face and $500 haircut, but trust me, he does have a sense of humor, give him a hard time..lolOne last thing, and I will cut this short. The specials that they served on Easter and Fathers Day, consisted of a one and a half pound lobster with claws, caesar salad, and red velvet cake for around $30.If you decide to order the Collard Greens, make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper, with bits of swine for flavor, as well as a bit of vinegar. It may not sound so great to the untrained tongue, so I suggest you give them a shot and teach your tongue a lesson.Cheers! :)This is my new favorite restaurant. This is the perfect date restaurant and the perfect try something new restaurant. While the menu is small, the food is amazing. I have been three times now and tried several thing and they are all better than the previous! My favorite so far is the shrimp boil. The ettouffee is also very good, better than mine! Oysters and shrimp cocktail are also some of the best I have ever had. This is a very small restaurant but worth the wait. I like sitting at the oyster bar and watching them make all the dishes. The red beans and rice are just as good as I had in New Orleans! The only dish I haven't tried is the gumbo and that is up next on the list for me. They let you pick the spiciness of the dishes you order. I get a 4 which is a little hotter than tobasco sauce which is how they explain the levels to you. 3 is tobasco. Service is really good. Prices are very reasonable for seafood and the portions which are huge. I always have some to take home which I just make some rice and have a whole other meal!
Subway=This is a good location. I've never been to a Subway where the staff was friendlier. They really hook up a nice loaded sandwich and sometimes after hanging out downtown I like to stop here for a cold cut combo. No casino marks up here I got my cold cut combo for $5 plus tax. There is seating and the area was clean. I don't know what this Subway is doing so different but other locations could take a lesson because this is a great Subway!
Yogurt In=This self-serve frozen yogurt shop is located at Mandalay Place (right where Mandalay Place meets Mandalay Bay).  They had a decent though not great variety of flavors and toppings (fruit, nuts, candy bar, and Ghirardelli syrups; surprisingly, they were missing cereal).  The frozen yogurt (like chocolate and pumpkin) was okay--pretty good flavor and firm enough but not icy texture.The problem with this frozen yogurt shop is that it is quite expensive ($0.49 per ounce).  While that high price should not be too much of a surprise considering that Yogurt In is located in Vegas, this place's quality and variety alone would put it in the average to below average range when compared to other frozen yogurt shops.They also sell crepes here.  Service was quick and fine.Mandalay Place has a complimentary parking structure.  Complimentary valet parking is also available.
The Lounge=3.5 stars -- Somewhat reminiscent of Sidebar, this place has potential! I'd venture to say adding a happy hour is about all I need to bump it to 4 stars. (Of course, a crowd would be cool too but I'm sure the owners want that even more than I do! So, get out there, guys!!) Last night, I enjoyed a scrumptious keylime martini ($8) which went down way too easy and a glass of Hey Mambo ($8). Snack categories range from bruschetta ($3 a piece) to house made potato chips ($3), pizzas and nachos to hummus and grilled veggies (mostly $8-9). We ordered the potato chips which were well salted and not too greasy, but they were a little slow to come from the kitchen which appears to be shared with its sister, Il Posto. The Lounge offers a chill vibe. In addition to the funky furniture and light fixtures, Magic 8 balls are scattered through the room -- Fun conversation starter! Morris J. is right, the beer selection is mediocre but if you're looking for a cocktail or a glass of wine, this place is a real neighborhood gem!!I joined my gal pal Chrissy P for a drink at The Lounge last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Like she said, it is definitely the Sidebar of Sunnyslope!We had great, friendly, attentive service from Chris (and he wasn't rough on the eyes, ladies!!) and he was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks.I opted for a red wine flight and was pleased with the selection. There were two cabs, two zins, a red, a pinot noir, a merlot, two malbecs, and another choice or two. Mostly from California. The flight was $9.They had a ton of variety of chairs and areas to sit, which was really awesome. You could sit on the high-tops, share a table for four in big white contemporary chairs, grab a normal table by the window, or opt for these really huge oversize comfy purple chairs, which we did. Mellow lounge music played over the speakers and there were several TV"s with relevant sports on. The Magic 8 Balls were a cool touch. The place has a really good vibe. I dig it. The food selection was made of appetizers, but unfortunately as a gluten free vegan, all I could eat were the freshly made potato chips. By unfortunately I mean "THANK GOD" because they were delicious!Overall I am really jazzed about this place! A quick five minutes away from my house, this is the perfect way to wind down from a stressful day!I hope they adopt a happy hour and add some more vegan items to the menu and I will become a regular!My apologies for taking so long to update my review! 3.5 stars - pshaw!Probably my favorite neighborhood stop for a cocktail! GREAT drinks -- just tell Chris, the bartender/host, what type of drink you like and he'll hook you up with some sort of fantastic concoction! The service is outstanding. Always striving to ensure we're having a great time and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Even "opening" the kitchen after it had closed for us to get some late night eats!And there's happy hour, now!!
Elbow Bar and Kitchen=This place served me comfortably the best Sunday roast I've sampled in Edinburgh, so far. A quirky little spot, which I imagine suffers slightly from being a little betwixt and between places, it really is worth seeking out, as the kitchen is serving up some really top quality fare.Overall, we said: "I was delighted with Elbow. I'm sorry not to have discovered it before now, as I'm often asked for Sunday brunch/lunch recommendations, and I know many people who would be as highly delighted with this place as I was, today. For sure, it goes right to the top of my list of recommendations as a great place to spend a Sunday, particularly when you're feeling the need for a hearty roast."The nights are drawing in, and this makes me want nothing more than good food, good company; and make that comfort food! In fact make it a Sunday Roast... for 10 people please!Turns out that Elbow do a Sunday Roast with all the trimmings for £8.95. It's "there till its gone" as the menu states, but when I called up to book a table for "8 for the Sunday Roast" they made enough Roast for us all. It was only 5 of us that went ahead and ordered the Roast in the end but there was enough for all!And what a Roast it was. Chicken, with gravy, potatoes, brocolli, carrots, and a yorkshire pudding. The broccoli was actually delicious as it had been cooked in garlic, as had the chicken. There were also two full breasts on my plate. So much chicken, for £8.95!I then had the Whisky Cranachan for dessert and it was nice. The crumble looked delicious, as did the Elbow Mess. All in all, everyone around the table was very satisfied with the Sunday Roast or Sunday lunch of some sort. Not a scrap of burger was left on the plates, or chorizo and prawn salad; and the chips were cooked in duck fat! (also all gone).I caught a peek at the menu, and they had a pretty tasty looking brunch menu too, as well as a tempting "catch of the day served with duck fat chips".The waitress seemed a little put out that we were there, I can't tell why (perhaps that we didn't all order roast?) although she had been lovely on the phone when I booked. I will be back, and I do hope we hadnt put it her off kilter in someway. We were just a hungry bunch of folk looking for a friendly Sunday Roast together. I'd highly recommend it for a great value, good feed!
Noodle & Rice=Let me start by saying this is a review for me and for another guest whom I do not know.First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.Needless to say I will not be going back. My meal was plentiful but not well prepared nor flavorful.
The Vig Uptown=Forgive me Yelp community, but I had to do it.  I have heard about the Vig opening a new location for months.  Many friends were telling me about the location.  A good yoga friend is actually the designer on the project.  For these reasons and that I really wanted a Vig Azz Burger today(with the fried egg), I had to be there for the FTR.  This place is a goldmine, literally, it was a site of a former neighborhood bank.  I mentioned that on the review that was offered after the meal and my willingness to invest ( i wish...)!  Ask for Raven, she will take great care of you.Imagine the Vig Arcadia, with more of an indoor/outdoor feel and the prerequisite bocce court.  The vibe is similar, yet more open.  From the moment you chance upon the exterior, your not quite sure what is to come.  The anticipation builds, so no interior photos for you on this review!  You have to visit and see for yourself!  I like that and much more.  There is even a firepit!   Go once, go back, go often, but first, just GO to the Vig Uptown, you will not be disappointed.The Vig Uptown is a textural dream. For me? This will definitely be a recurring one. Maybe it was the unique "cactus columns" upon walking in or the herb garden to the left, but there is truly something charming and down to earth about the new Vig location.Do some research and modern enthusiasts will quickly find that the remodel of The Vig Uptown was originally Ralph Haver's AIA Award winning 1961 Arizona Bank building. Sweet....The Vig's food is pretty good. What's great about their menu is that they offer a range of dishes to choose from (many items the same from the Arcadia Vig) so surely there is something for everyone.I always seem to drink wine when I'm at the Vig Arcadia but I couldn't look past the "Take Bethany Home" (Clever!) with Crop Organic Cucumber Vodka, Watermelon Puree, Fresh Lemon & Agave Nectar. A fantastic name with a drink to match.The booths at this place are huge, great for happy hour (1/2 off Apps and $2 off drinks) We sat at the tables by the bar but the patio looked fun and I'll have to feel that space out next time.True to it's predecessor, although it was the "soft opening" there was already the parking nightmare we've all come to know and (not) love about many places in the valley. But surely, a good dream is always worth revisiting.1st experience at the new Vig was great. I sat outside and had a very friendly server, she was prompt and personable. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but worthy of a second try. The new Vig is pretty cool, very similar set up to the Arcadia one, nice open patio and Bocci ball court. 2nd experience at the Vig was awful!! The service was horrendous, but let me back up... I arrived just before 6 and attempted to pull in to the parking lot.. I saw the valet guys making wild hand gestures to cars, but wasn't really sure how to interpret them. Cars were honking trying to get past me on 16th street, I pull in and they tell me the valet is full and I have to park across the street, another valet has parked a car in front of me and there were already 2 cars that pulled up behind me. Where was I going to go? I finally was able to get out and park across the street, and when I walked over I saw about 3 other cars going trough the same ordeal. Here is a tip - Put a sign out saying Lot Full. It's not brain surgery, its Valet parking.I got in and joined our table of about 20. We had one server for our table, he was flustered and had a really bad attitude. He seemed to be only serving half of our table. It took him 25 minutes to make his way over to us and take our order.. Well partially, he took my order an then ignored everyone sitting next to me. He actually ignored Nathan for about half an hour.. At one point he turned to some one and said "You'll have to wait because everyone is yelling at me at once" Sorry buddy, maybe you should have more than one person serving us if you can't handle it. Yes my food is getting cold and no you still haven't brought me that fork I asked for 10 minutes ago. Better yet why don't you take it out on the customers here. What an ass.  In addition to the service, they ran a charge for $348.00 on my card. It didn't actually post as a charge because they caught it, but it took away from my available credit in my checking account for about 6 days. I will go back, because the food is decent and the décor and ambiance are great. I'll just make sure to park across the street and get a different server.Wow. I've never felt so unwelcome at an eating establishment ever before. Last week the hubs and I drive over to his moms house (our old hood). She lives on the same exact block the Vig Uptown resides on. So we walk on over. We are all very excited to try the newbie that just popped up in the neighborhood. We walk in. Where we stand for FIVE (yes 5) minutes before the person who I am guessing is the host finally wanders on over. He looks us up and down. We say there are 3 of us. He looks at the list and says "Oooooh, ya. We are pretty busy. I don't see you being seated any time soon" we look at each other all baffled....One of us asks, can you give us an estimated time when a table might be available.... he looks around and says..."um, yeah, like I said we are pretty busy" Oooooooook then. We walk out, cross the street and go eat at the Phoenix City Grill, where they are always happy to see us, seat us and serve us. Dear Vig, you might think you are all that, but seriously. Get over yourself. The hubs family has lived on that block for 34 years, they have seen restaurants come and go. If you keep up your attitude, you will find yourself pushing your LOCAL customers away.As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.They listened.They created.They named. (after me!!!)We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.Lovers of the Old Vig, I know what you're thinking. Is the new Vig as fabulous as the original Vig with their boche ball clad outdoor patio, live music Sundays and a great hang-out any day of the week? Me thinks my answer is...yes! And here are 10 reasons why:1. The indoor patio is brightly lit, but saves 'zonians from melting in the heat. It's genius when you think about it. Now you can choose which Vig to visit based on your temperature desires. So, if you want an outdoor patio, go to the other Vig, but when it's 115 outside, I'll see you at the Uptown spot. 2. They serve greyhounds with freshly squeezed grapefruit. You can't find a freshly squeezed cocktail very many places in the land of the desert. 3. Boche Ball. See it exists, even at the new location! And it's large and in charge and big enough for a group to play. 4. Friendly staff. They're attentive, friendly and aim to please. 5. Spacious and perfect for a big group. Check out the area by the fire place. It's perfect for mingling. 6. Awesome spinach dip with these tasty (sweet potato?) bread sticks for dipping. 7. Tastilicious flat bread pizza with Tandoori Chicken - it literally melted in my mouth. 8. Lovin' the Central Phoenix vibe and location. It's close enough to the Camelback corridor and within driving distance for most of the Phoenix/Scottsdale neighborhoods. 9. Great HH specials depending on the day. Check out their $5 Vignature cocktails. 10. And let's not forget about the entertainment. The DJs with accompanying instruments make the Vig rock and I heard a rumor live music is coming soon. So check it out right this minute!Go to the Vig Uptown for the bathrooms alone. Seriously. If you are one of those neurotic people out there like myself who judges establishments and the frequency of which you will attend them by the cleanliness among other features of their bathrooms, then I am thrilled to say you will not be disappointed. The stalls are gigantic, completely separated from top to bottom so you have full privacy and don't have to stare at people's disgusting dirty feet, and best of all, they have a little ledge for your cocktails! Why more places don't consider that sometimes we like to take our drinks to the bathroom with us is beyond me, but it creates a real predicament once you walk into a stall and there's nowhere to put it. Oh, and if I ever become rich I am ripping all of the sinks out of the bathrooms in my condo and replacing them with whoever's sinks are in the Vig. In a word, GORGEOUS!The second thing that makes the new Vig a winner is the Kid's Menu portion of Mac n Cheese. It is so freaking delicious I have no words. Almost tastes like fresh pasta smothered in Velveeta. Plus it costs like $5, possibly $6, whatever, I've never once been able to finish it.Drinks are a little pricey for me to spend as much time as I'd like here, especially with regard to their gorgeous bathrooms, but still affordable enough that I'll come party here once or twice a month.Go check it out for yourself, just watch out for their Sunday Brunch if you're not into babies...because they're everywhere!Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.) Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too. Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.  ...And i lived happily ever after.You had me at gluten free menu. Then you sealed the deal with your Strongbow Cider and free ride home service. I'm in love! The tandori nachos are amazing as was their gluten free burger. I don't think you can understand just how exciting it is to eat a hamburger with a bun for once. The patio area had a great atmosphere and my waiter was the greatest!Undoubtedly the best and my most preferred Vig location in Phoenix. Not only is it close to Luci's Market Place (another favorite place of mine) , but it's also just up the street from my mom's place.It was the Vig's one year anniversary the other night, so my friends and I decided to have dinner here. The restaurant  has a minimalist , trendy and modern atmosphere. We enjoyed several half off appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts!  (See pictures) We did order a lot for three people and had plenty of left overs. They were half off, so how could anyone resist? I was also able to pick up wifi here and that automatically gets a boost in rating from me. I'm definitely coming back to bring my mom for brunch next time.Sunday evening my hubby & I were looking for a place to have dinner & The Vig came to mind so off we went. It was pretty early, about 5:45pm, so we beat the dinner crowd. We were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio. I know this is such a girl thing to say, but I love their bathroom sinks! For starters we got the crab & artichoke dip. It was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people. The spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing. I also got a cocktail, captain appleseed. It smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking. For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.Total (not including tip) for a cocktail, an app, 2 entrees & dessert was about $57. A lil pricey but the food was great so I'd say it's worth it!This is my 300th review.The end.Hahahaha, just kidding. Well, it *is* my 300th, but I'm actually going to write something.I met my boss here for a dinner meeting. I can walk to this place, but had never been. I know, I'm late to the Vig trend, but when it comes to trendy places, I bush the system somewhat. We needed to find someplace that had gluten-free options and a lot of people suggested The Vig Uptown.It's WAY bigger inside than you'd think at first. Oh, everyone has to valet and it's free. You go in through a huge orange door (I really like orange. I hate yellow, though.) and can pretty much pick a place to sit unless it's really packed. Luckily, it was a Wednesday night and there were quite a few tables available. We sat in back next to the bocce ball thing. Is it a court? What would it be called? It's just a long strip of green. Whatever.The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation. There was a guy playing the guitar. It was pretty impossible to hear half of what my boss was saying. I bet he offered me a million dollar raise & I missed it. Just my luck.I had the Cobb salad. Holy cripes! The thing was huge!!! Ok, it was $12 but still, I had to take half of it home to eat the next day. Huge chunks of bleu cheese & bacon. There wasn't too much dressing on it, either. I actually like the taste of vegetables and don't like a lot of dressing on my salads.The service was super friendly and quick to refill drinks.Oh, and the bathroom is super cool, too. The sink is one of those flat ones that makes you feel like you're going to flood the bathroom when you wash your hands. How embarrassing, because people may think you just peed a lot but it's really from the sink. Haha. That would happen to me, too, as well as missing my boss giving me a million-dollar raise.Oh @TheVigAZ, you usually do so well, but when you fail me, it's always an epic fail. Last night, you fell flat on your face.I ordered the Vigazz Burger, anticipating greatness.My girlfriend and her daughter received their food, and finished their meals. I got nothing.While my girlfriend was still eating, I inquired with one of the back servers about my burger, and was told it was almost ready.15 or 20 minutes after my party finished eating, I was still waiting.The other people around me, who'd ordered around the same time as I (some before, most after) were finished with their meals, and still I waited.I had by this time decided I no longer wanted my meal, but no server was present to inform.While I waited for the server to come by to deliver the inevitable check, I noticed people who'd arrived AFTER we ordered, getting their meals.And still, I waited.Finally, after over 30 minutes, and nearly having to yell to get her attention (she was delivering more food to people who came long after we ordered, right next to us), our server came over.When we informed her that I did not receive my meal, and that my girlfriend's order was incorrect (onions and tomatoes present, despite a request to not have them), and instructed her to remove my meal, she just asked if I wanted it to-go.When your service comes up so short as to completely miss a meal, you don't merely offer to make it to-go.In fairness, when she brought the check, she stated she'd spoken to the manager, and he'd also removed my girlfriend's burger from the bill.It was a nice gesture, but last night it was too little, too late. I went home hungry, with a major headache.I love The Vig, but sometimes it's a major disappointment...feast for the eyes AND for your gourmet tastes. PROPER kitchen makes everything from scratch and it shows.--freshly-made bloody mary mix, and freshly-opened olives jar (yes, you can tell). i'll have 3. at $5 for sunday brunch you can't go wrong.--shepherd's pie is the BOMB-awesome. they even fuss up the plate so it doesn't look too pretty, but don't believe your eyes: what's under those eggs will rock your mouth with pleasure!--potato coins are fun!--cheese plate was not on the menu, but chef happily obliged to accompany my v.c. yellow-label (no longer on the menu). they even made toast points for me. wowza.--these wings are the best i've had. perfectly cooked and the best sauce ever.--super friendly staff knows their stuff, ingredients, and serves it with big smiles.--great family place (kids can play bacchi or bean bags in the patio), and --goes upscale in a flash too; awesome acid jazz feel--new converted entrance gives the smokers a nice spot and yet keeps them on their own.--free wifi for your business meeting and big booths to boot#argh. dropped the yellow label from the wine list. mumm is motor oil. how abaout tattainger?#forced valet parking is a bust. i know they have to do it, but i just want to park my own car. (if you see the valet, just park across the street if you're as fussy as me)#wish they opened 30 minutes earlier on sundays; 10:00 leaves me standing outside every time.vig uptown gets my award for most-improved food quality. whether it's the temperature, the freshness, the plating, the preparations, the simple but perfect blend of seasoning and flavor, vig uptown should be proud.not many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out.This Vig used to be a BofA hiring center!! What a turn-over wonder!! :)I must mention that I had a bad experience at the Vig Arcadia, and promised not to step foot into that place again. However this location turned my experience with The Vig around, I came her on a Friday night to a co-workers birthday celebration! Those you can't say no to, so I came here thinking I would just sip water through out the night, but no siree. I really enjoyed the vibe, the music and the staff was ever so nice and friendly. Plus the food was delicious, I had some of the cheesy tater tots, YUM!! As well as one of their Hot Vings, wow were those sticky and spicy, but good! Also just half of a Hot Chick sandwich and an Arnold Palmer!! Oh so delicious!!! I was really glad I came and that this place took me by surprise!! The food was great and the staff here was just as good!! Great time with the co-workers and friends!! :)Met up with a friend for Happy Hour at the Vig, it's another place I have been meaning to check out.  I didn't do any research on the place so when I pulled in and my door was opened by some strange man I was sorta thrown off, but overcame that quickly as I walked toward the restaurant.   I didn't see any signs saying it was valet parking, so that's why I was a little caught off guard.Once inside I got to check out the place , its retro with a cool vibe, I could see how hanging out at the Vig has become popular. My friend and I were headed to another event so eating wasn't really what we were into, but after a quick look at the menu we decided on some guac & chips and grilled fish tacos. The guac was fresh and creamy; the added pico went great with it. The fish tacos though stole the show, the tomatillo & avocado salsa on blacken white fish with spicy slaw, explosion of flavors! I might have to go back soon just for that! So good!The Vig is a great place to start your happy hour off at, nice drink selection and food choices! Look forward to coming backI've always wanted to try the Vig and never had a chance. Saturday afternoon we were in the area so we decided to try it. We walked in for lunch and I guess for lunch it's a pick your own table no hostess. Very modern looking. Very interesting inside just can't describe besides very modern. The inside is pretty dark where we sat. They had modern music playing. Pretty upbeat but not rocky. Anyways, I ordered the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was interesting with grilled red onions, tomatoes, cheese, and greens. It looked really good but tasted ok. Let me put it this way. Not a lot of taste. I really loved the sweet potato fries. Overall, I thought it was an okay meal. My wife ordered the Turkey sandwich which had tons of turkey with coleslaw and cranberry on a pretzel roll. Nice combination. I stole a quick bite and it was really good.  The service was really good. We were greeted quickly at our table. Drinks were at our table quickly and refills regularly. They even boxed my wife's leftovers. So overall, we had a really good time. Great relaxing atmosphere, good food, and good service. What else could you ask for. We enjoyed it. I hope you do too.Alright, this is going to be a short review because we popped in on a Friday night just for Moscow Mules.  No food was consumed since we already had dinner but the menu was read with envy.Such a trendy place!  It was super busy, the bar was gorgeous, and the place itself was lovely.  The patio looked really nice from what I could see.  The stylish patrons made me feel under-dressed but whatever.  Give me my draaank!  Music was blasting for this energetic crowd and there were lots of couples on dates.  Kazi didn't enjoy her Bloody Mary and the waitress let her trade it for a Moscow Mule with no grief.  $4 Tito's vodka all summer long, kiddos.  Yes!  Our table already had a trivia game in place so that was fun.  We sucked at it but it was still fun.Thanks for the bev, Tomcat!
Chipotle Mexican Grill=Ok here is a shocker... I went to chipotle for the first time when I was recently in Arizona... talk about unexpected. But it was free and ummm yeah it was this or some other disgusting fast burger/taco joint...Why are there no good taquerias in the greater Phoenix Metropolitan area? WTH! I would riot over that if I lived out there. Thankfully I do not...So yeah back to chip-oat-lay. This place is the subway of burrito places. I doubt the tacos are worth it since they are small and the same price with much less food as the burritos I think... Pro Tip: Ask for stuff on the side, you often get a lil bit more if you do!But back to the burrito... I got a barbacoa meat burrito. Not sure what kinda meat barbacoa is, but it was aight i suppose. It coulda been cat meat for all I know. This joint is absolutely overboard with regards to carbs and thick hunnies wanting to eat here. I think I was the skinniest person there and I dont think I am skinny. The build it up burrito/taco concept is solid and better than some other joints that I have been to. I consider the food fair, but nothing special. Just lots of carbs n meat in a burrito bun =P So yeah, not sure of a reason to go back unless everyone I am with must go here, but otherwise, its all good!The Chipotle chicken salad is the largest food group in my nutritional pyramid. And I treat this Chipotle like my personal home kitchen! Except I really don't do any of the cooking. And it tastes delicious every time..The workers here are for the most part very friendly, generous, and efficient. Like all other locations it gets busy during peak dining hours but they do their best to keep the line moving. Until you get those n00bs in line that speak too quietly or don't know what they want which in that situation nothing can be helped. My personal recommendation is to order ALL THE SALSAS! Go for it. Don't be shy.This is a typical Chipotle location. Service is attentive and efficient. The line moves swiftly even when they are crowded.
Peas & Carrots=I was extremely excited when I heard about a vegan food delivery service in town! But opposite of Misti Y,  I cook so much that it took me forever to find a time that I wasn't gonna be able to cook to order some food.  I'm so glad I did! I ordered the ginger pear bread, mac n cheez, peanut-tofu-kale noodles, lasagna, tofu curry, and chick'n and dumplings.  Plus a container of bananas foster "ice cream" which I got for my friend (she did let me have a taste though! YUM!)Entrees run about $7, for a healthy-sized serving of homemade, mostly organic food.  (Read: you will be pleasantly full, but not stuffed.)  I think this service would be great for vegans who were staying on the strip and had a microwave and fridge/freezer in their room.  Or anyone really.  Eating out healthy in Vegas isn't necessarily an easy thing, especially for vegans and vegetarians who are visiting! This food is tasty and filling without having the overbearing fat and salt of restaurant food.My dishes took about 10 min to heat up in my home and work microwaves except for the lasagna which took about 30 min in my oven.  I really liked everything except for the lasagna; it was very filling but pretty bland, overwhelmed by whole wheat noodles.  The peanut noodles were delish - probably my fave- but the mac n cheez was damn good too.  I would order the noodles, mac, curry, and dumplings again for sure! The ginger pear bread was perfect- great banana bread-like texture, just sweet enough, with delicious chunks of pear! My dog agreed with me, as she stole half of it off my kitchen table! (and yes, I ate the rest, it was that good.)They are now offering Holiday baskets that sound like a great deal: bread, cupcakes, cookies, and candy (hello, vegan peanut butter cups!!) for only $25.  Someone on my holiday list is definitely getting one of these, and I might have to get one for myself.I highly recommend trying them out! There is a $5 delivery charge, so I would suggest ordering lots of stuff to make it worth your while.  They keep in the freezer for over a month, so you'll have time to use it up.  Great for folks who are looking to eat healthy (especially lower sodium!).
Thelma's Filipino Restaurant=I remember going to Thelma's in Waipahu. My aunty loved them and we would always be there at least 2-3x months. She called to tell me that they were opening up in LV. Lately we've been going to Elena's but it is pretty far from us, and because of the Yelper's, now I don't have to drive that far.Thelma's serves Illocano food and it is very familiar  and almost as good as Grandma's cooking. You read that right...ALMOSTas good as. LOLThey have a good menu and offer either dishes or  combination plates.We ordered:Pinakbet, Pancit, Chicken adobo, and a Halo halo.They were all good especially the pinakbet- its been awhile since i had pinakbet.The restaurant was very spacious and clean. You can't see the restaurant from Sunset Rd. or Marks St. But they are in same complex as Aloha Kitchen & Vitamin World across from Best Buy.The service was also very good and the food came out quick. My little pinoy princess also got a free treat. Salamat!I will definitely be going back very soon. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu.Aloha!!When my boyfriend and I arrived to this cute little bistro, there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied. The walls of the interior are painted a light green color that I enjoyed. There are gold statuettes along the walls, as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light. On most, if not all, of the tables are little vases with orchids. It was a pleasant dining area even with the TV playing in the background. It can be hard to spot if you don't pull into the parking area behind Aloha kitchen. The menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties. J quickly decided on the lechon kawali, a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy, fatty meat on the inside. It came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion. It was REALLY crisp, crackled when you bite into kind of crisp. I found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3-4 pieces- but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat. I ordered the adobo, which was a large bowl full of super tender, soy and vinegar-spiced pork chunks. The cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas I've had, with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel. The flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would've disappeared easily. It seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time, a signature of many comforting dishes. I would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness, but it was a delicious dish. The texture of the rice was great with the pork. We also got an order of the Shanghai lumpia, which would have all vanished if I hadn't caught J before he got to them all! Crisp, narrow cigar-shaped little pockets of deep-fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce, it's easy to see why. We also had an Ilikoi passion drink and Kona coffee. The coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non-dairy creamer, which saddens me a little. It's really a small detail, but when having such a nice variety of coffee I want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose/hydrogenated processed things. Not a huge deal because it still tasted great, but something I find worth pointing out. I was really excited that they offered kona coffee! The passion fruit drink was also tasty, though J drank most of it. The water tasted like tap water, so we barely sipped any.Overall, the food here was great. If you're a fan of the Hawaiian Sun drinks I imagine you'll be happy. It's a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and I'd rather go here than to another McChipotle or Pei Wei. Not my usual neighborhood hang out, but I can see going back sooner rather than later!Took my mom out for a shopping trip and since we were near Thelma's, I figured my mom would love it. AND SHE DID!She, literally, wanted to order the whole left side of the menu. She had 4 item mix plate AND we still ordered food (oxtail, chicken long rice, fried fish) for home. My mom said: "You have to take me here every week!" Oh gawd, what have I created.Another great thing about this restaurant is the service. They are so friendly and helpful and funny. Like they're family =)And FYI - if you're mail is late, the mail ppl are prolly having lunch at Thelma's cuz, I SWEAR, I saw like 5 postal service trucks parked outside.I had to try this place since I am Filipino and am always looking for great place to remind me of mom's and family home cooking!!Lunch Orders:3 item combination: Gisantes(Filipino Marinated Pork and Peas), Thelma's Special (Pan Fried Pork with onions, tomatoes and soy/vinegar sauce) and Pork Adobo with white rice. Gisantes was Addicting, Thelmas Special was Especially Delicious and Pork Adobo Much Better than most Adobo I've had!!Lechon Kawali: Pan roasted pork dish with a brown dipping sauce. Came Neatly sliced, Crispy Skin, Succulent tasting meat and Not too oily! Dipping sauce was the Best I've had and was a Must with every bite!!Sinigang Soup and Veggies Only: Filipino Sour Soup/Stew was a nice to sip on between bites of meat and rice. However, I've never tried a Sinigang with a mild sourness and I believe under seasoned soup.. Although, it wasn't my type (I've had Many versions of Sinigang, I like more sourness)  it was still heart warming and the chunks of tomaotes and green beans felt healthy compared to everything else I was having!Damn Close and Comparable to My Mother's and Family members Cooking!!! Reasonable Value, Corteous and Polite Staff and Clean dining space makes me a Fan For Sure!!!Wow. This has instantly become my favorite Filipino restaurant. I first heard about this place a while ago from my coworker. I wish it didn't take me so long to finally go.Since I'm not in the area much, I figured I'd try as many things as possible. I went with a four-item combo consisting of Mongo, Pinapaitan, Thelma's Special, and Pork Adobo. Of course, I added a small bowl of Sinigang for $1.The Mongo intrigued me because it's Ilocano style, which I've never tried before. It's less soupy than the Mongo I'm used to. In addition, it's white as opposed to green. But more importantly, it was delicious.Pinapaitan isn't something that would normally interest me. I don't like bitter dishes and the name screams bitter. Thankfully, the lady told me their version is more mainstream. And I do love tripe. The end result is very good, but I can still taste the bitterness obviously.Thelma's Special is basically lechon with onions and tomatoes. It's pretty hard to screw this up and they certainly don't. Delicious.As for the Adobo, this was the one thing I ordered that is probably the most ordinary. The large chunks of pork didn't really look like they would be tender, but they indeed were, surprisingly.Make sure you check in before you order so that you get your 10% off. I actually forgot, but then when I mentioned it to the lady, she was totally willing to redo my ticket and give me the 10% off. I saved a whole 95 cents! It pays to pay with cash sometimes.First off, I had to drive all the way around the building to find it. They are located in the back. If they didnt have a sign in the front of the building, you would never know they were there! Make sure you check in to get 10 percent off your order. Just about everything on the menu is dee-lish. I usually get the lechon and pork adobo with steamed rice. I love the fact that they give you a small cup of diced tomatos and onions mixed with soy sauce and vinegar. You gotta have that along with the Mang Tomas sauce for the lechon. It's not lechon without it! Now I don't need to describe it to you if you're a first timer. I would say its a safe bet for your first time. Once you get a taste of these two items, you will come back for more. Of course you gotta eat it with the steamed rice to equalize the flavor. Otherwise, you will complain that it is too salty.To top it off, you gotta get the Halo-Halo for dessert! Its so good that they named it twice! Good to share but if you are able to finish it by yourself than you better get checked for worms! LOL. Service is ok. When you have a grip of people in there, don't expect to get your food with a snap of your fingers. They take cash and cards.Gustung-gusto ko ng masarap na pagkain.I am honestly somewhere in between a 3 star rating and a 5 star rating for this place, so that is why the four. Not perfect but pretty damn good.We came with an appetite and ordered a crap load of food. We ordered so much food, they moved us from a small table to a big table. Yeah, it was just me and my hunny and my son.The following is what we devoured:Spam MasubiLonganisa MasubiLechon KawaliMarinated BangusA mixed plate with: rice and macaroni salad, shoyu chicken, pancit mix, and squid guisado.Another mixed plate with: rice, squid guisado, pinkabet and dinuguan.I fell absolutely in love with their lechon. Some of the best in this valley that I have tried to be honest. Their mang sauce is definitely not watered down like other restaurants do. (My mouth is watering just thinking about the lechon now). It was fried perfectly with a perfect ratio of skin, to fat, to meat. And most importantly, it didn't leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.The bangus was on point and was boneless. An extra plus for my hunny. The squid guisado was delicious as well. Not overpowered by the bagoong.I find that a lot of places fill their pinakbet with squash and this was a good balance of all veggies. Both of the masubi's were delicious and the fact that I could order a longanisa masubi made me very excited.  Honestly, it was all good. Except the dinuguan left me very disappointed. I was not a fan of the taste or texture of this one.We spend a little under $40 for all the food and had plenty to take home. Just know that if you order hot tea, it is simply a lipton tea bag and they give the hot water and lemon and honey. And if you like they play TFC on the TV.Gawin ang iyong sarili ng ilang mabuti at kumain sa Pilipino restaurant na ito nang hindi bababa sa isang beses.HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #5What started on a whim last week has resulted in the 5th day in a row of halo-halo for Mel C. and I.  Tonight we brought the challenge to the other side of town and invited a couple of Henderson Yelpers and the Asian Persuasion family to join us.  Shirley B is the duchess of Thelma's, a spacious restaurant near Sunset Station.  First tip:  use your Yelp app to check-in and get 10% off your order.  Ian A. checked in after he ordered and paid and missed out on the discount--sayang!  Next time, na lang.  There are two halo-halo versions here:  the plain one for $5.25 and the special one for $5.75, which includes macapuno and ube ice cream.  We had the special version and the ingredients were:pinipig (first time in 5 tries.  These are toasted rice grains--think Rice Krispies)macapuno (coconut strips)ube ice creamkaong (sugar palm fruit)nata de coco (coconut jelly)langka (jackfruit)cherries**See, we are learning the real names of the ingredients as we go along, instead of saying "those red stringy things," and " these green balls (!)."  Yes, Mel and I are both the kind of Filipinos whose parents didn't really teach us Tagalog growing up stateside so we've had to learn as we go.  BUT, I can understand a lot, especially when you're not saying nice things  ;)What was missing:ubeleche flanred beans (azuki)Everyone's halo-halo preferences are different, so we're just doing the leg work for you and letting you know what we find along the way.  I am still on the hunt for the halo-halo that has ube, leche flan, red beans, langka, kaong, nata de coco, macapuno, and ice cream in ONE bowl.  The search continues.  Halo-Halo Contender #1: http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwHalo-Halo Contender #2:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaAHalo-Halo Contender #3: http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQHalo-Halo Contender #4: http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQI came here with friends due to the glowing yelp reviews. Service was excellent. Of the dishes I sampled, their Kare-Kare was the shining star with real peanutty flavor and lovely oxtail and veggies. This Sinigang Stew with Shrimp  (a sour soup made with a tamarind base) was pretty good and arrived with ample shrimp. I personally wish it was twice as sour but it satisfied.Less impressive were several dishes:The Lumpiang Shanghai, a deep-fried meat-filled spring roll with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, lacked flavor and texture.The Pancit Palabok craved seasoning and any anato seed flavor. The rice noodles were unexpectedly thin like a vermicelli but the lack of flavor was the main issue.The Halo-Halo (mix-mix) Special as dessert was just pure disappointment.  In their menu, the regular Halo-Halo description included several components while the Special seemed to include the regular ingredients plus Ube (purple sweet root crop) ice cream. The special arrived in an okay-looking presentation of crushed ice with condensed or evaporated milk, red nata de coco (coconut gel), something else that was red and seemingly coconut-based, as well as Ube ice cream. It was missing red beans, garbanzos, macapuno (shredded, sweetened coconut) and pinipig (crunchy, crushed young rice). Any addition of even just one of those ingredients would make it truer to its name.STILL MY FAVORITE FILIPINO RESTAURANTWe had our UHE "Unofficial Henderson Event" with several other Henderson community Yelpers. Lunch was family style for the five of us. More than enough food with plenty of leftovers for a snack later on. It was also a chance to catch up with Thelma's two daughters who operate this restaurant.Great place to meet, chat and enjoy great Filipino cuisine.I have to start this review by saying that I hate Filipino food at restaurants. I grew up with the traditional Filipino mom who made a home cooked Filipino meal every night. So my expectatios are really high. Restaurant Filipino food tends to be on the bland side to cater to everyone. I'm used to all the fatty, salty, greasy deliciousness. My family lives in California so I don't get to eat as much Filipino food as I would like to. However, the craving can get overwhelming at times. So where do I go?!?! Here!!!This is the closest it gets to Filipino home cooking. Everything I've eaten always comes out piping hot and fresh. Everything is flavored correctly. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. My favorites are kare kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in a peanut butter broth served with shrimp paste) and Thelma's special (pieces of lechon with tomatoes and onions served with special sauce). All sounds off if you aren't used to it, but trust me it is delicious. Only reason why I docked a star is because this isn't my mom's cooking, but it satisfies the need.This past Tuesday, I was feeling adventurous in dining. I wanted to try someplace new. I set out for a dining adventure at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant. What really made this adventurous dining is that this was my first meal in a Filipino Restaurant. My real-life and Yelp friend Shirley. B would be my adventure guide in my very first dining experience in a Filipino restaurant. In similar style to a first-rate adventure guide, Shirley. B did some research on the food that I appreciate. She concluded that I have reviewed plenty of Chinese restaurants. Consequently,she matched three of the four items with an entree and appetizers that I have ordered in Chinese restaurants. We shared a plate of pancit mix (similar to chow mien noodles), beef vegetable lumpias (similar to egg rolls), garlic fried rice, and BBQ pork on sticks. Thelma's makes sharing easy. They provided serving spoons and extra plates to share the food. This eliminated the worry about germs that many diners have. Thelma also made the pace of dining relaxed by bringing out the different items separately. My favorite item was the pancit mix. If I wasn't dining here with Shirley. B, from looking at the pictures that yelpers posted, the pancit mix and the garlic fried rice would have been the dishes I ordered. Although, pancit mix is a different entree than noodle style chow mien,it was just as delicious. Anchoring each side of the plate was a lemon, that I did not need to squeeze to add flavor to the noodles. What can I really say about garlic fried rice besides it tasting similar to white rice with a garlic flavor? The lumpias tasted similar to the delectable egg rolls that are my usual appetizer before the entree. Finally, the BBQ pork sticks tasted similar to the BBQ food that I have enjoyed in L&L BBQ. I tasted the quality in each bite of the meat that was more taste than messiness. Complimenting the food was bottomless cola.   The trail-head for this dining adventure is a restaurant located in a small strip mall in the shadow of the colossal Sunset Station Casino & Hotel. It is off Sunset Road just west of the Marks Street traffic signal and Gold Rush Casino. Thelma's faces the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. The inside of Thelma's looks more similar to L&L BBQ than an elegant restaurant. The elegance is the deliciousness of the food. To kick off this dining adventure, there are menus along a partition separating the cue from the kitchen. It is in a spot where nobody is watching over you, and you can take your time. The adventure initiates when you order your food and pay. If you are drinking a soft drink, they hand you a cup that you serve yourself. Ultimately they deliver the food for your dining adventure.   In my opinion yelping is about being an adventurist in dining that tries new places, then shares them through reviewing. Its very similar to the concept of living life as an adventure. In my pursuit of living life as an adventure I will occasionally step out of my comfort zone by trying cuisines and restaurants that I never experienced, then ultimately sharing  these experiences. With that said, "Thank you Shirley. B for being a fantastic guide in adventurous dining."A Filipino co-worker/friend suggested several foods for me to try. Yelp reviews suggested Thelma's. Made the drive to Henderson last night...Challenging location, at least for me, to find Thelma's. Located on Sunset Rd., west of Marks, in a strip mall shopping center behind Vitamin Shoppe.The moment I walked in, the wonderful smell of authentic Filipino foods urged my stomach to speak suggestions my co-worker recommended to some of the nicest ladies I've ever ordered food from.Take out or dine-in. Clean restaurant, decorated w/ pretty Filipino wall art, well lit, 4 ceiling fans providing excellent ventilation, a comfortable 77 F thermostat, a single flower @ each of the 20+ tables spaced well apart, all added to the encouragement of me choosing dine-in. (see photos below)Order & pay in advance @ the counter. Served food within a fast 10 minutes @ table of choice. TFC (The Fiipino Channel) on TV showing music videos, soap operas, and Filipino commercials in English.Was told Thelma resides in Hawaii, and her daughter runs this place. Her daughter is doing a great job as this restaurant has earned an A Grade from the So. NV Health District and several awards including Best Of Las Vegas RJ Poll.Considering so many suggestions given to me prior to my arrival, I sampled several entrees ordering the mixed plate w/ 4 choices: (see photos below)1. Pork Adobo - Juicy & melts in your mouth upon each bite! 2. Dinuguan - Two spoonfuls of this pork blood stew was enough, as I'm not a vampire!3. Pancit Mix - Bihon rice noodles/canton noodles w/ pork, onions, carrots...very flavorful!4. Thelma's Special - Chopped Lechon Kawali (crispy roasted pork) w/ tomatoes, onions, soy sauce...delicious!Appetizers included: (see photos below)1. Shanghai Lumpia - deep fried eggrolls w/ ground pork & vegetables served w/ a sweet chili dipping sauce. Very good!2. Sweet Longanisa - Sweet tasting pork sausage.Thelma's serves breakfast all day, offers lunch specials M-F til 4:30pm, stays open til 9pm every night but Sunday til 6:30pm, and will prepare special orders by pan of Small (15-20), Medium (30-40) and Large (80-90) w/ 24 hour notice.Please take a look at my photos below to hopefully encourage you to patronize Thelma's. I know I'll be back!
El Chorro=The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest "staid."  Perhaps even "stodgy," but that may be more harsh than I intend.Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with "the best Caesar dressing ever" and "polenta croutons?!?" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.Last night I went to the new El Chorro. It's nothing like the old El Chorro and it pulled on my heart strings to tour the beautiful, yet unrecognizable, restaurant. Nothing stays the same and I love change, but not when it involves my valley institutions. Soon nothing in my life will resemble my childhood and I will have no attachment to this town. When Avanti goes, that will for sure be the end. Ok, I'm done whining. Hey, I wasn't the only one. I noticed plenty of others reminiscing... they did happen to be my grandparents age, but I guess that just means I'm wise beyond my years. Ha.  The new El Chorro is incredible and if you knew nothing of the Old El Chorro, you'll like it that much more. It was a last minute idea to swing by for dinner and the place was packed. So packed that we couldn't get a table. I've never been without a reservation and I figured a weekday was a good time to try... think again. Luckily, the bartender (where the old bar used to be) told us not to worry because she wasn't going to turn customers away. She obviously wasn't working there the time my uncle threatened to burn down an umbrella because it was blocking the view... he did tip $100 to the guy for moving it, though. His personality allows him to say things like that without causing anyone to feel alarm... or maybe it was the $100? Anyway, El Chorro lacks nothing in the customer service department.So we sat, my mother, her ex and me. An odd group of three. He is totally still in love with her, so I encourage these little gatherings. Between the three of us, we ordered the filet, trout, and escolar. All delicious, but I am still saddened by the menu change. No beloved eggs benedict (that was served all day). No chicken livers. No jumbo shrimp (even though it's on their menu). The only thing retained- the sticky buns. Thank God for that.  Highlight of the meal was when the bartender made some after dinner shots when he overheard us discussing dessert. I asked him, "what are these babies called?" He responded, "wet dream."  Great, I was having a shot called a wet dream with my mom and her ex. Not awkward at all. Actually, it was pretty funny and the shots were deliciously cinnamony.   El Chorro, I still love you. You're like a relative who got a facelift and although I no longer recognize you, you're still the same inside.The parking lot here is a dirt lot. Keep that in mind ladies when you're picking out your shoes. There is a beautiful fountain as you walk into the courtyard (minus the yard) which is made up of two large patios. We chose to sit outside even though it was still quite warm out because the atmosphere and view outside was much more appealing. They have live music set up on the patio that is to your right as you walk in so if you want a bit more of a quiet atmosphere sit on the patio along Lincoln Rd. After we ordered they came out with a relish tray, which consisted of cold olives, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrot sticks and some peppers. The sticky buns were brought out at the same time and were pretty good, but quickly got a bit hard and were almost inedible. We both had a French onion soup which had pieces of steak in it as our starter. It was pretty good, but after I noticed a couple of patrons with the house salad I wished I had ordered that instead. For diner Mike had the pepper crusted sirloin with frites and I had the pork chop with a green chile risotto and green beans. The servings were pretty big so we were definitely not leaving here hungry.  However, nothing really stood out about our meals. Mike commented that he couldn't even taste the pepper on the steak and that the steak was pretty bland. He immediately asked our waiter for some A-1. My pork chop was pretty good. It came with a salsa relish on top. If it wasn't for the salsa my dish would have been pretty bland for the most part as well. The risotto was ok. Lastly for dessert we both had the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake was a little rich for me so I had trouble finishing it, but it was pretty good. The food was ok. However, it's not worth the regular price.  For restaurant week it was a decent deal. The service was great. Our water glasses were constantly being filled and plates taken away in a timely manner. Skip dinner here and come and enjoy happy hour at their outside bar and partake in the amazing view.Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for any place with ambiance. Even if I'm in the middle of nowhere and I find a place with ambiance and character, I'm sold. Now, El Chorro Lodge is nowhere close to being in the middle of nowhere. In fact, it's in the heart of some of the most gorgeous homes in Phoenix, and the ambiance gets an A+ in my book. When the weather is nice, I think this could be one of the if not the best patio in town. It is calm, comfortable and overlooks the beautiful Camelback Mountain. Inside El Chorro Lodge is just as nice, especially after the renovation. The white stucco and blue accent coloring play off each other and I enjoy the tile that compliments the character. El Chorro represents old Phoenix and has been around forever. The food here is good but on the pricey end so only come here if you're planning on dipping into the pocket book (but it's definitely worth every penny). The sticky buns deserve a yelp business listing on their own. El Chorro's known for their sticky buns and although the restaurant changed a good amount with the renovation, they kept the sticky buns. Bravo. Did I mention that the sticky buns come with every meal? If you really like them, you can take some to go too. So while this isn't the latest and greatest place to hit town, it's one of the oldest and is filled with history, great food, an amazing view, ambiance and it's the perfect place for brunch or dinner.Maybe my expectations were super high since El Chorro Lodge is like an Arizona institution, but after experiencing a meal at this restaurant, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars.  Don't get me wrong, it was "A-OK," it just didn't blow me away.The history of this place dates back to the 1930's and is pretty amazing.  You can read about it on their website.  The outdoor dining area is huge and has great views of Camelback Mountain.  The live music provides for a nice ambiance as well... at least live music when we were there on a Saturday night.  And our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticky buns - yum!  But the service was really slow and the food was nothing to write home about.  We found it to be overpriced as well.I'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns "to go" sometime, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner.We went to El Chorro Lodge for brunch the other day and what a wonderful experience we had. There are a lot of reviews already written about this Arizona landmark restaurant so here's another review to consider if you're thinking about trying El Chorro Lodge.Restaurant ~ they have one of the best dining patio's in the metro!  Great views of the desert and mountains, everything is shaded with umbrella's and they have the misters going full throttle this time of year.  There is usually some light entertainment in the evenings on the patio.  The restaurant is somewhat a "mission style" clean lines, exposed ceiling rafters and white walls with some nice art work.  It's smaller inside than what most people might think, so you will most definitely want to use Open Table or call them to make reservations before going.  Service ~ good servers here. Most of them are very attentive to your needs and very accommodating.  There were a few times we saw some of the servers blast past customers without a "pardon me" while going to and fro to the patio. Food ~ WARNING, eater's discretion is advised here!  Yes they serve you  sticky buns throughout the day and they are sooooo good and very addictive!  You'll want to order more but dont!  It will spoil you appetite before you get your main course.  These tasty little buns or goodness will swell in your tummy so just enjoy one (or two) that way you'll have something to look forward to on your next visit.  On this last visit I had smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, capers and some other goodies.  It was awesome!  It came with a side of hash brown potatoes and toast.  We also had their Creme Brulee french toast and ordered a side of bacon.  This sounded much better than what it tasted.  They use thick challah bread that must soak for a very long time, for this french toast tasted more like and eggie bread pudding.  The apple wood bacon was slightly over cooked but still tasty.  We also had their  eggs benedict which was delish.  You have your choice of proteins with your EB ~ canadian bacon, smoked salmon, lump crab or beef tenderloin and served with asparagus.  El Chorro Lodge has a great ambiance, good food and service.  It is what we expected most of the restaurants would be like prior to moving to Phoenix.  This is a great place to go with friends and family.  I recommend dining on their patio for brunch or a late dinner.  Hope to see you there sometime!I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? Easy question, you say?Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise.What am I missing, class?Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch.This review has to be broken into the tale of two worlds - happy hour and dinner.First review will be our experience in the bar for Happy Hour and the Second in the dark, dark world of the outdoor dinner seating.We valet parked our car without a care in the world. It was my wife's birthday so we thought we'd get to the restaurant early and enjoy the happy hour in the bar. Rachel was an absolutely lovely waitress. Our cocktails (party of five) and appetizers were simply a very warm, inviting, and lovely experience. The arisan cheese plate was enjoyable along with the grilled sausage trio. The happy hour buffet that is advertised simply didn't exist. Cocktails beyond their house pours were overpriced as expected. Overall the experience was very nice and I'd return for this portion of the evening. (but, you might want to read my review of the dinner experience).---After a lovely experience in the bar for happy hour (separate review) we were seated in the outdoor dining area (no one "got" us as we requested when our reservation was ready, and they didn't come to our table but asked us to come up to the hostess stand - no big deal but a bit tacky and awkward for all). (This is very sad as we're Phoenicians for 25 years and have experienced this restaurant over the years)Our waiter, Eric, didn't seem to want to be there or make our experience better in any way. Eric seemed to have had a bad day and so would our table of five along with my wife, for her birthday celebration. We ordered directly from the dinner menu as we had just enjoyed app's in the bar. It was obvious that Eric wasn't' pleased with this but he marched off and placed our orders. Upon delivery (next time we saw Eric), all was just fine until I cut into my $44 strip steak. After some time, Eric stopped by and asked how dinner was. I showed him the steak and asked if it was medium. No, and he took it away. He came back and asked if I'd like another glass of Cab - well, no, unless your manager is buying so I might have it with the steak I ordered. Ten minutes later, when the rest of the table was about done with dinner, my steak was delivered. And, yes, it was cooked to a perfect medium (although, who's hungry after sitting that long and nibbling off everyone else's plates?). How's my wife's Birthday going? Well, not real well. Did Eric bring the wine, dessert, or anything to enhance the experience? No. I spoke with Alec, the manager, and he simply could not have cared less. His eyes were glazed-over as I explained the experience and lack of response from his staff. Alec was truly the manager of a restaurant that I would never want to experience again. He didn't sympathize, apologize, or even care about me or my family. DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT A GOOD EXPERIENCE! Spend your $ elsewhere.This has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. It reflects the feeling of Old Phoenix and it makes you feel like you are visiting your friend's beautiful southwestern estate. Plus, I could probably eat a dozen of their sticky buns in one sitting. When we were planning the wedding and looking for a rehearsal dinner location, we immediately thought of El Chorro. They have multiple areas for private parties, the atmosphere is lovely, the restaurant has a lot of character and the backdrop is just stunning with the restaurant being nestled against the north side of Camelback Mountain. El Chorro lived up to expectations! We had about 40 guests attend the rehearsal dinner and we had a combination of an indoor and outdoor event. They set up several tables with nice linens outside while twinkle lights light up the area. We also had the indoor area that had dark wooden paneling and felt like a beautiful southwestern home. The servers were friendly, the drinks flowed and the food was simply phenomenal. We had a buffet style set-up with a combination of Mexican food, a meat station, a slider station and french fries! It was elegant comfort food at its finest. I personally think that this is one of the best (if not the best) locations for a rehearsal dinner!For our last night in Arizona and family obligations over I figured it would be a good opportunity to take my wife to an outstanding restaurant.I made reservations three days in advance on OpenTable.com and they actually called me the day before to confirm and check whether we wanted indoor or outdoor seating.  Since it had been so cold the last few days we were there we opted for indoor dining.A little history about El Chorro.  The main building was an old grammar school.  They added on the courtyard, dining area and gardens when it became a restaurant.  It includes their own garden for herbs, produce for the chef.  It also includes several outdoor fireplaces and a bocce court.For an appetizer, we started out with a small cheese plate which consisted of parmesan, provolone, bleu cheese & brie with cranberries, dried apricots and candied walnuts.  While we were working on our appetizer out came the famous sticky buns.  They are delicious, not too sweet and definitely worth trying.For entrees, we ordered the Niman Ranch Pork Tenderloin and the Pan Roasted Duck Breast.  The pork tenderloin came with green chili risotto and butternut squash.  The Duck came with celery root mashed potatoes, pearl onions, brussel sprouts with a pomegranate reduction.  Both were tender and delicious.  Even though having tried Duck previously and not really being a big fan I have to say the duck here was done perfectly and not as fatty as my previous tries.For dessert, we split a piece of their vanilla cake with carmel sauce garnished with a blackberry and cappuccinos (they were very strong but not bitter as some can be).This was a perfect way to end our stay in Arizona.  You cannot beat the views.  Next time maybe we will be able to do a weekend brunch and sit outside to enjoy the fabulous views.On a side note, they even called me the next day to thank me for patronizing their restaurant.  I was very impressed.Unpleasant. I could write an essay on my disappointments here but I will just choose the one that put me over the edge. They charge $5 PER SLICE if you bring in your own cake to celebrate an occasion. That's right folks! If you go to their restaurant to celebrate any occasion that requires you to bring in a cake, they will gladly take your cake in the back, slice it up, and serve it to all your guests for $5 per slice. I don't like getting nickel and dimed at a brunch that costs me $350 for 6 people in the first place.  I am far from cheap. I didn't bring a cake in to save from spending money at your restaurant. I brought it because that particular cake is a tradition for my mother's birthday and I will not pay you $30 for my 5 other guests and I to enjoy my already purchased cake. On my final note, I was advised by the server if I cut the cake and served it myself, I would still be charged the fee!!! Classless... Absolutely classlessI'm writing this review based on the despicable service I received when attempting to make a reservation for a holiday party. I've never been here but have heard that it's a beautiful venue. I called the hostess who was very friendly and when I told her I had a group of 20 was transferred to someone who handles larger events. I told her I was looking for something for 20 people on a certain date but we wanted to do more of a drinks and appetizers type set up. She cut me off right away "we usually run 100 dollars a person so...." READ: "You can't afford this place." I found it to be incredibly disgusting. "Ok I wasn't sure....I've never been there before so wanted to know what you have" cut off again "well we are booked out anyway so try happy hour..."Yikes. Not once did I tell her my budget. Will never understand why people who work in more upscale places often think of themselves are exclusive and celebrity. I will never come here for any reason now. Sad.Not even sure where to begin on this horrendous experience. First off I was giving El Chorro a second chance as I last ate here a couple of years ago and did not have a great experience but that was nothing compared to last nightMy girlfriend and I wanted to treat her kids to an "iconic" Phoenix dining spot with a patio as her daughter was home for spring break and she graduates from college in a few months. Needless to say we wanted this to be a special evening. Unfortunately it was quite the opposite. After being seated we had to wait 20 minutes before our waiter even acknowledged us and then it was 45 minutes before we had cocktails served. We were not in a hurry and wanted to have a leisurely dinner but this was a bit much. After appetizers and ordering a bottle of wine for dinner we waited over an hour for our meals and also had to order an additional bottle due to the long delay. In the meantime the table next to us who was seated after us had finished their meal and we're leaving. By this time myself and my girlfriend were not only frustrated but embarrassed by the situation as we really wanted this to be a special evening. We expressed our frustration to both the waiter and the manager who never once during the course of the evening stop by our table. To their credit they did comp part of our meal but that was not the point as the evening had already all but been ruined. Then to top things off when the waiter dropped the bill off at the table he copped a whole lot of attitude about my being frustrated and stormed off. Then this morning we realized that we had never even been offered the so called signature sticky buns which pretty much demonstrates how messed up they were last night. Needless to say we will never be back and will certainly warn anyone not to as well.
Chez Vous Crepes=4/6/12My first visit, and it's been a long time coming!  According to my bookmarks page, I've wanted to try Chez Vous since 4/25/2011!  Funny that it took almost a year to do make it over here...Liked the interior, which is a mish-mash of dark brown leather seats and tables near a playable piano (I know, bec. I played "Long Long Ago" on it!) and regular wooden chairs and tables across the display cases.  It is intimate and very cozy, yet not too claustrophobic.  I met Romain, the affable young son of the owners of CV, who informed me that he'd just arrived from France less than two months ago.  I also enjoyed the music selections playing that morning and mentioned this to Romain, who replied that the music was from his iPod.  It was easy to like Romain, whose enthusiasm for music was clearly evident when he'd sing along as he did his tasks.  Ah, how do I love the French accent... too bad Romain's a bit too young for me-- perhaps he has an older brother?  ;)  For my fist visit, I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to start http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ#88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ, and a Chef's Choice savory crepe for my main http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ#y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ.  The cappuccino was beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste- the foam in it was perfect!  The chocolate croissant, I was told, was fresh from the oven, although mine wasn't warm to the touch.  However, it tasted marvelous, and the crisp layers of the croissant revealed the freshness of the pastry.  (I did order another croissant to go, which had just come out of the oven.)  It was all I could do to eat only half of the pastry, since I still had the savory crepe to look forward to.  The buckwheat crepe was filled with warmed cubes of green apple and chevre, and drizzled with honey and chives, and it came with a side salad (it automatically came with a brown sugar mustard dressing, something I cannot have, and which Romain replaced with fresh salad and Caesar dressing for me).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw#5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw  It was dee-lish!  Sweet enough to satisfy my sweet breakfast cravings, yet not too sweet that the back of my lower jaw, where it meets my ears, hurts.  It felt a bit weird to have salad that early in the day, but I tried it anyway, in case it wilted before I had a chance to try it for lunch.  The dressing tasted very fresh, and I asked if it had eggs in it, to which Romain replied that it didn't, but didn't it taste like it did?  "Yes, it does."  I truly enjoyed breakfast here, and, as you can see, it wouldn't be too long until my next visit...4/10/12Cappuccino, chocolate croissant, Exotic (sweet) crepe, and Lorraine omelet.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0A#iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kA#890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw#tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw  The croissant was once again very good, but the cappuccino wasn't as pretty to look at as the first... I now wonder if I may have ordered the latte the first time around?  No matter- the coffee still delivered.  The Exotic, a white-floured crepe filled with dark chocolate ganache, bananas, and toasted coconut, was very nice... A little bit too sweet, but not so much that I couldn't finish the whole thing!  I made a note to perhaps wait till I have someone else to share this with the next time I order it, as it is so smooth...  One second it was in front of me, and the next, it was gone!  :(  So, I had to order something else to keep me company-- the Lorraine omelet.  Oh, my goodness, what a disaster!  It is my preference that my eggs be soft and tender, and the yellow more on the darker side; in other words, not overcooked.   This omelet arrived very light-yellow and looked hard.  A quick touch confirmed my suspicion.  Didn't like the cheese nor the bacon that the egg enveloped, either- the bacon had a gamey scent and flavor, and the cheese... Eh, I'd rather not wax on about this dish.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutw#wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutwStill loved the coffee, croissant, and sweet crepe, so still going to give four stars!4/13/12Cousin-in-tow, I ordered the Moka (with double shots of espresso), chocolate croissants, and the Brittany for us to share.  Cousin asked for the roasted tomato to be omitted, and chives substituted instead.  The Moka is fantastic!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q#kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q  Our order was accompanied by a mini-carafe of more hot chocolate, and we finished it!  OK, so cousin had another cup, and I had a total of three during our breakfast course.  :PI initially ordered one croissant, since cousin didn't want any, but I offered her a taste, and it didn't take long for me to see we'd need another one STAT.  The Brittany, a savory buckwheat crepe filled with roasted chicken, caramelized onions, creme fraiche, and the substituted chives, was d'lish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA#09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA  Definitely something to order again.  :)Arrived around 7:30 am to find CV closed and not due to open for another 30 minutes, so I drove further down to Wildflower Bread Co. to check out its breakfast selections.  Perhaps it was the few bites of the two scones I purchased to-go there that caused me not to thoroughly enjoy my staple selection of a raisin croissant ($2.75) today. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=52oY8x3SL4Rc4R4xt9BNOQ#52oY8x3SL4Rc4R4xt9BNOQ  (I agree with an article I'd read years ago that only the first few bites (four, I seem to recall) are the most pleasurable, and succeeding portions lose their potential to cause excitation of the sensory nerves.)  I also ordered a Moka ($3.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=ABggPbd3PviD8f9pdwEBgg#ABggPbd3PviD8f9pdwEBgg and tried a new (to me!) crepe, a savory one called French Favorite (shaved ham, Swiss, and sunny-side egg in a Sarazin buckwheat crepe, $9.50).The Moka was delicious- it came unsweetened, which was OK with, since the bites of scones and croissant had enough sugar to sweeten the occasional sips I took of it.  The crepe was very tasty!  I forgot to inquire how the fried egg would be presented, and I wasn't asked, so I'm assuming the kitchen cooks it sunny-side up.  If you like your eggs cooked differently, make sure to speak up!  Today's version wasn't so bad, and it made for the "money shot," anyway. (Or maybe not!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chez-vous-crepes-scottsdale?select=VoSHxUsHFXKGGQS_wPfjNg#VoSHxUsHFXKGGQS_wPfjNgIsabelle was sweet and accommodating, as always, as she did not rush anyone out of the cafe, switched out the salads when I asked if the vinaigrette contained mustard (it did), and brought me regular coffee when my Moka ran out.  Tip- order the Moka when you are with a friend, as you will garner not only two cups of delicious mocha coffee, but a pot containing about three extra servings!  Then again, the first and last time I did order this coffee selection, I was with my younger, and ultra-sexy cousin (guys NEVER fail to look twice when she's around!  My Mom and sisters also have the same effect on men, I swear!), so maybe it was a one-time deal...  I won't name names, but I think someone had a crush on my beautiful cousin!  ;)  In any case, I enjoyed my delightful Moka and savory crepe, and, at a lesser extent, the raisin croissant, so thank you Chez Vous!
Ma Dang=Wow -- thanks to the sole Yelper who reviewed this (an out of towner, I might add...) I took my fellow foodie adventurer out to find this place in the Commercial Arts Center (always sketchy...).To be honest, I was on a hunt for KFC = Korean Fried Chicken...but I just can't pass up bipbimbap...so we had the stone pot version with an order of their "KFC."    Our server, a lovely bilingual Korean woman, was surprised that I knew about banchan...and in seconds, out she came with a rolling cart (yes, there were that many), and began to set us up.  From potatoes with jalapenos, spinach bean curd pancakes, kimchee, sprouts, fishcake, seaweed and daikon, pickled radish - and more (there were at least 10) and they were all delicious.  The dolsot (stonepot) bipbimbap is such a treat...perfect for this weather...the egg was fresh and the yolk was still runny.  The beef had tremendous flavor.  Add chili sauce, stir, mmmmm  But then she brought out this ENORMOUS plate of chicken wings - with the bipbimbap, it's really more than 2 can eat, but we soldiered on...because...that's what we do...but it needed one thing to make it all perfect - Hite!So we shared a hite beer...and I've decided if I can get through the rest of the day without needing a nap, it will be a huge accomplishment.  We also came to the conclusion that not only will we go back again but we'd help spread the word... and instantly this has moved up to our #1 lunch treat...Don't expect to find Ma Dang on the door -- look at the reviewer's picture of the exterior -- see the word Garden?  That's what you need to look for -- it's down a few doors south from Birria Jalisco...  As the previous yelper said, it's a hidden gem.Ma Dang had been bookmarked forever, but I finally got to try it last night.  I was joined by Jun A., a Korean student that I know from work, and Eric R.  The first part was finding it - I knew about it because I had seen "Ma Dang" on the restaurant in the past when dining at Komol.  However, it now says its name in Korean and then its translation "Garden" so I was not sure if that was the right place.  Luckily, Jun A. was already there when we walked in.They key is to come here with a Korean speaker.  The menu has all of its items in English but everything sounded so good I would not know where to start as a first-timer.  Jun A. ordered LA style beef short rib and spicy chicken stew for the table.Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Jun A. called out to her in Korean whenever we needed something, so we had great service.  We were the only ones in the restaurant initially but soon it had 3 other large groups of Korean eaters.  A rolling cart with banchan brought out 8 initial dishes: cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, fish cake with jalepeno, potato with jalepeno, scallion pancake, plain bean sprouts, spicy sesame bean sprout, and broccoli with sweet chile paste.  Everything was delicious, with unlimited refills.  We also got a 9th banchan dish, very similar to dashimaki tamago in Japanese cuisine (layered egg crepe).  I really liked everything but was especially fond of the scallion pancake.Our beef ribs came out first on a sizzling plate with onions.  They were deliciously flavored and hot.  We each got a bowl of rice which was refilled on request (I am not sure if there was an additional charge for refills on rice though - don't think so).  Then, a table burner with the chicken stew arrived.  Once the stew boiled we were able to eat it.  Tender dark meat chicken, potatoes, and green onions in a spicy broth surrounded us with great scents.  We ladled the stew into bowls and ate it with rice.  The flavor was great, but the chicken needed work with hands and mouths to free it from bones.  It was hot so a few fingertips were burned, but it was worth the effort!I would definitely return.  There are some interesting menu items to try including monkfish, sable/black cod, and mackerel dishes that may be calling my name soon.
Wandering Horse Buffet=we have a new 5 star casino Buffet in the valley and it is great!!! Rand H. and myself went there on opening day and the place was pact at about 11:00 am .I started with a great bowl of soup and then I had a plate of salad items. they had this one macaroni salad that was unreal it was so good it had sun dried tomatoes,feta cheese and barbecued shrimp in it yumm!!!! After that i tried the hot food items that were all excellent. Then it was on to my favorite part, dessert.Well they have quite a selection of mouth watering sweets but the one that really got me was this hot caramel cake. It was so good i went back for more even though i was stuffed   YUMM!!!!!!!It's Monday and I am still stuffed...maybe that will resolve itself through the course of the day today...we'll see.I had clients in town yesterday (and they are friends, as well...always nice to do business with friends:) and they wanted to see the new casino at the 101 and Indian Bend and have brunch...all in all, excellent ideas!The casino and resort (which has been under construction since I moved to town) have really turned out nicely (at least the portion that is finished...some of the landscaping, pools, finish work inside...well, about 80% of the resort is done...so they have that going for them:) is really very lovely...2 or 3 giant steps ahead of what I expect from a local casino (we aren't in Vegas, after all!).The important pieces are done...and by important, I mean the pieces that make them money!...the rest of that stuff is just for show.The casino itself is very nice for a local casino...the restaurants are open and going...they actually serve Peet's coffee here (if you are a Bay Area transplant, you'll know what that means:) and the staff is super accommodating!We showed up for brunch on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait to get a lovely table near the window so we could look down on the construction of what will become a desert nature walk area (probably kind of "Disney" version of desert and native American life...lots a dirt and concrete right now...should be nice when they get it done:)The dealio seems to be essentially unlimited champagne, bloody mary's, blini's, and mimosa's with brunch...for $25 a head...and given the quality of the food...and the quantity of the food and drink...that's a terrific deal:)We sat there (well, sat and ate, went and refilled, repeated as directed) for 2 and  1/2 hours...the place wasn't busy and it seemed we had our own wait staff making sure that our drinks were never dry and that dirty plates never piled up...in short, assuring us of a wonderful time:)I have sampled a few breakfast buffet brunches around town over the past few years, from the Phoenician to the Fairmont to Eagles Nest to the Wrigley (The Beautiful Carin loves no meal quite so much as a Sunday Champagne Buffet Brunch), and I can tell you that this place measures up in every way...and exceeds many of those much more expensive brunches!* The food is presented so appealingly...on porcelain instead of in steam trays!* Chef's at the ready for any special request (if you don't care for the pizza that is available, they'll make whatever you want...no extra charge:)* Gelato, as well as pastry for your sweet tooth:)* Fresh shucked oysters on the  1/2 shell...on ice...with all the accouterments!* A grill next to the carving station (you want your prime rib with grill marks on it?...no problem:)* You want sushi fresh cut, or a fresh stir-fry for your meal...they whip it up while you wait...wonderful!The buffet is laid out much like the Wynn in Vegas...tucked behind the massive bar and easily accessible, but not in line of sight, so you can enjoy your meal('s)... without all the clanking, cooking, and other things that often accompany a buffet.None of that would matter if the food and drinks were crap...but they aren't crap...in fact, the food and cocktails were terrific!I talked to several of the chefs and told them how really good I thought this place is and they just beamed with pride...they are having a good time and making some good chow and it shows in every bite:)And for me, the bites kept adding up...I didn't find anything that wasn't tasty (and I ate pretty much everything:)The good news is that I was wearing my "eatin pants" so I was ok right up to the time we dropped my clients off at their hotel...then it was all I could do to drive home and drag myself to the couch...moaning...in pleasure (no, food pleasure...I couldn't have done anything else:)Even Carin needed a nap Sunday afternoon (in spite of eating a much "healthier" brunch than I did, with her special request stir-fry and what have you)...those champagnes glasses do add up:)It looks like Sunday has become "Brunch Day" once again, now that a good one is so close...and so reasonably priced!Now I just need to figure out a new workout program that will allow me to deal with the extra 12,000 calories every Sunday:)Lunch - 4 stars ($12.95)Weekend Dinner - 5 stars ($24.95)Sunday Brunch - 5 stars ($26)Three visits, one week.  Hopefully, this is enough to pacify my husband, and we can take a break from the all-you-can-eat concept.  Big open dining room that includes a bar with seating is nice.  I always liked the wall of windows that opens up to additional outdoor seating.  It should be really nice when the view includes more than dirt, and it's not stinkin' hot outside.  We found drink service to be excellent at all three visits, and plates were promptly cleared.  Servers were also very accommodating in providing new utensils upon request.  First visit was lunch.  As far as buffets go, this one has plenty to choose from.  We found Asian, Mexican, Italian, steak, chicken, fish, and pork at the carving station that day, in addition to plenty of salads, cheese, cold cuts, and desserts, including a gelato bar.  There were a few minor issues that need to be resolved.  The steak was not a tender cut of meat, and a few of the dishes were not as hot as they should have been.  Also, some of the items were not labeled.  Yes, I don't need a label on fried chicken, but one on the soup might have been nice.  While I found this to be an above-average lunch buffet, I think for the price I would prefer to just order off a menu.Sunday brunch was the second visit, and worth every penny as the price includes unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's, bellinis, etc.  Although I can't personally vouch that it really is unlimited, I do know I had two and my husband had something more than two, and there was not the ridiculous wait that often comes with "unlimited" drinks.  Buffet had upgraded options from lunch, including oysters, shrimp, prime rib, smoked salmon, and eggs benedict.  Also more selection of cheeses, breads, and fruit.  So much to try that I had to restrict my intake of inexpensive fillers, and focus on the value-added items.Third stop was weekend dinner.  Similar to brunch, minus the breakfast items and champagne.  New York steak was at the carving station and mussels were on the menu that day.  No crab legs, but smoked salmon, oysters, shrimp, and some other fish entrees made an appearance both at the buffet and on my plate.  At all services, the buffet was very clean and plates are available in numerous locations.  My only suggestion would be to include an extra fork with the utensils.  Since there are none at the buffet, you need to ask if you accidentally leave it on an empty plate or you don't want to finish off your key lime pie with mashed potato residue.  Those potatoes by the way, had a ton of butter in them!Hands down the best buffet in Arizona. Seriously!I tried the sirloin, roast beef, shrimp, mussels, mahi, and pork. All were well prepared and fresh. I also saw crab legs, salads, pasta, pizza, and calamari. They have a ridiculously large desert selection too! The atmosphere is very modern and open, with an optional outdoor patio.It helps that this is in the new Talking Stick Resort & Casino, which offers several other upscale restaurants to explore. *Check out the 15th floor bar while you're here.Just a note that I overheard the manager at WHB tell a customer that when he was training staff, he used Yelp to find out what things employees should not do!  Yay for managers who find value in our reviews!After consulting the Great and Knowledgeable RAND...my plus one  and I went out to Talking Stick for our bimonthly  Mommy -Daddy Date night . This night's excursion was all about Talking Stick. We wanted to see if it was worth having a stay-cation there. First off Low Carb  heaven here folks!!   If I jump back on the Low Carb band wagon again this will be my Mecca.   Prime Rib, big sweet shrimp, lovely oysters ( actually better than we have had at Durant's and Bandeaux..seriously. ) Loads of fresh salad bar faves, like blue cheese , choice olives, mushrooms, bacon , nuts  etc. They also had a cheese / lox/ fresh fruit area that looked super healthy  , I must tell you the Kobe beef was very delicious and I wish I had had that first instead when I was full.  They also had some uninspiring Asian food and a pizza area..not necessary  for me but I guess somebody would like it. Desserts were good ..not stellar , but pretty tasty,  they had some great gelatos, and cute little Brulees, fruit tartlets, good banana and coconut pies ..THE WORST ...surprise, the   Cheesecake, it was sticky, sweet peanutty..what's up with  that!? the had an interesting fruit bread puddingish  dessert that reminded me of desserts I had in Germany...yum.Service was great , drinks were refilled way before they emptied , good service, nice staff.   We will be back ...In my book 25.00 was worth it. Want to make it 5 stars..give me tender Prime Rib and tastier Desserts.I came here today for a birthday get together for fellow Yelper Arana W.  Being a Saturday I was expecting the place to be slammed.  It was only about 1/3 full and it only took a few minutes to set up a table for 10.  In good weather there is additional seating on the patio.  This is a new building and I noticed the layout could be easily remodeled to a full service restaurant with a full bar and a private group dining room in place of the buffet serving area.There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good.  I have finally come to the conclusion that 2 plates of food plus dessert are all I can handle any more so I had my two plates of food and in that I had at least 20 different items in small portions.  I skipped the dessert trip (well I did try some of Arana's gelatos) because my next stop for the day was Sweet Republic.  Everybody had positive comments on the foods they had, including the desserts.The service, both at the table and the serving area, was excellent.  We were there 2-1/2 hours and at no time did we feel rushed.  In fact they were still coming around refilling waters and drinks.At $12.95 this is an excellent value and I am not sure why it wasn't packed as the casino itself was quite busy.  Lunch is only 11-3 and then they shut down and get ready for dinner, which I think starts at 5.  I very seldom think of a casino buffet as destination dining but this place sure comes close.My friend and fellow Yelper Robyn N. put together a little birthday UYE for me at this amazing buffet.  We were joined by Jeromy H. and Scott W.  And of course my daughter, Claire.  This is by far the best buffet I have been to in years!  Since it was a Sunday we induged in the mimosas and Bloody Mary's they offered with our meal.  Walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream.  There was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups. And several different areas of asian food with my daughter's favorite, fried shrimp, as well as my favorite, coconut shrimp.  There was an omelet station, delicious bacon and yummy potatoes.  I had the best salmon I have ever had!  It was like butter and metled in your mouth.  And there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven.  My daughter and I watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping, black olives!  She loved it!  There were so many choices and everything was delicious.  And desert.....omg!  They have a gelato station with about 12 different flavors.  I tried the Limoncello and it was delicious!  There was pie and cake and pudding and cookies.....my daughter was in heaven!!  We had a great time with good friends and delicious food!  I can't wait to go back!Consider this Sunday Brunch buffet the Godfather to all buffets in the Valley. If you're like me, you won't quite realize what you're getting yourself into until you've been seated and you make your way into the buffet room. Yes, I said buffet room and I mean that it's an entire room dedicated to the buffet. Here's how it works: you stand in line to enter the restaurant, you pay upfront, you're seated by a hostess and then the feeding frenzy begins. Once we were seated, we took a moment to take in our surroundings. I looked to my left, I looked to my right and everywhere I looked, people had food piled (and I mean piled) high on their plates. Had they eaten in weeks or had they just eaten last night? It's hard to tell, but really, it's also hard to blame the gorging-like behavior because the second you see this buffet, an animal instinct triggers in your body and you must attack the buffet as if it is your last meal on this earth. People piled entire meat shops on their plates and then topped it off with heaps of fried Chinese food, cheesy Mexican food, Seafood glory and any pastry, dessert or breakfast dish imaginable. For the amount of traffic this buffet gets, the staff, service and structure is spot-on and even with just one person working the register, we got through the initial line pretty quickly. Once we were inside, we were let loose to discover the culinary creations on our own. The buffet room is clean, stocked high with food and organized in a structured way. People pile the food high on their plates and this results in the food disappearing off the serving platters faster than the chef's can put it down. But the chef's aren't phased and keep cooking as fast as they can. There is every type of food imaginable and there's no possible way a human could enjoy everything this buffet has to offer. But it's definitely worth a shot. The Sunday Brunch Buffet is $26 for adults but it's absolutely worth it. I was told it's pricier because it's a seafood buffet. It's not your 5 star resort "stuffy" brunch but rather a nice quality casual buffet and probably the nicest one Phoenix has to offer for this price range and quantity. I will be back soon to try out the $9.99 buffet they offer on Saturdays. This is absolutely the buffet to check-out in Phoenix. You'll walk away as in awe as I am.Let's see there are not enough words I can use to describe just how great this buffet was....so I will just put it this way:Brick Oven Pizza.....CheckMashed Potatoes....CheckCreme Brulee......CheckShrimp Fried Rice....CheckFried Shrimp.....CheckChicken Casear Salad....CheckClam Chowder.....CheckAll Non-Alcoholic Drinks included......CheckKEY LIME PIE.....my favorite......CheckFirst Class Service......CheckAwesome Dining Area.....CheckNow that was just a small sampling of what was available at this establishment. If your into Red meat.....chips and dip....Bananas Foster...Sushi....Crab Ragoon....Gelato......Apple Pie....Cherry Pie....Fresh Fruit Parfaits.....Pasta.....etc.....I think you get my point.....They had all of that as well. Now it will cost you about 26 bucks per person....but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT.....I will definitely be back to try Sunday Brunch. So let me wrap this up by simply saying this is the BEST BUFFET I HAVE EVER TRIED.....and trust me for those of you who know me that is saying something. So if your ever in need of a buffet dining experience or just simply hanging out at Casino Arizona here  in the valley of the Sun......run don't walk to The Wandering Horse Buffet.....I promise you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!The place.Cant talk about Wandering Horse Buffet, with out mentioning Talking stick casino, its the tall building east of the 101 in Scottsdale. Im glad the people decided to ditch the tents and build a nice building with a golf course around it, and by the way the rooms are really nice with out a big price, if your a local check out  their deals during slow seasons.  Yeah and its hidden as well in the maze of slot machines and black jack tables. Well for the buffet, no problems here close as you can get to a fancy Casino Buffet in Vegas.  The menu is always changing so keep up to date great specials.  Another tip, the Wandering Horse Buffet also hosts great food for holidays.  As for the service staff, I leave a nice ti. Im being real when I say, I don't tip at all buffets.  For the atmosphere Clean classy casino buffet.  you don't eat in a smoke haze. the seats are nice and comfy if i remember right they have wheels, don't tell me that not fun.  Personally any place that can satisfy a dessert feast after a large meal wins me as a fan.  Anyways casino prices,    * Buffet Breakfast - $9.95    * Buffet Lunch - $13.95     * Buffet Dinner Sunday thru Thursday - $20.95     * Buffet Dinner Friday & Saturday $26.95     * Sunday Buffet Brunch - $27.95     * Holiday Buffets - $42.95 kid prices as well.Took Mom and her sisters for lunch here last week.  While I couldn't eat (was still full from breakfast), they had a very good time- especially my aunts.  The items that garnered the most "oohs" and "ahhs" were the sweet potato fries and the desserts-- aunt loved her coconut cream pie (it did look very fresh and rich and creamy... I was almost tempted to take a bite!), and Mom and another aunt really enjoyed the sorbets (mango was the fave).  Service and the views outside were excellent.  My aunts definitely want to go back.  Maybe next time, we'll dine outside and I'll be able to try the food.Sadly, WHB has slipped off its pedestal for me.  Lately, there have been some disappointments.  Actually, many disappointments.  As usual, prices have gone up while quality has gone down.Even though items are put out in small batches, many times they are not fresh.  I used to regularly enjoy their petite steaks, but now they're just dry, tough, and overcooked.  The pasta dishes may or may not be worth considering.  The crab legs on occasion are just bad.  At times, I have wondered if they were left over from Sunday brunch.  And when I asked for a freshly made tortilla (per the sign that says "made to order"), I was directed to the ones sitting in a basket that were already stale on the edges.  Really?  The guy manning the station was doing NOTHING.  While there are days WHB is nearly a 5-star visit, those days are becoming further and further between.  We used to eat here almost weekly, but have dropped to maybe monthly because of the inconsistency in quality.  It's become a "we have to eat now" situation, and usually not worth the $45-$60 price tag for dinner for two.What a deal, $13.95 per adult and $8.00 per child at lunch.  11-3 Monday-Saturday.  We enjoyed the lunch pricing and enjoyed a $47 bill for 2 adults and 2 kids.  What a great lunch.  Where else you going to eat for such a low price and eat white truffle oil infused ravioli, duck pot stickers, duck legs, prime rib with Au Jus sauce, mash potatoes and gravy, shrimp, oysters, scallop low mien, pistachio gelato , cheese cake, apple pie, banana cream pie, and plenty of other deserts that I could no longer look at.  Delicious calories waiting for me to fill my belly.  Seriously I almost ate all of that at lunch.  This buffet totally blew my diet and it should with so many great items on the menu you should find something that you will like.  In fact you should like it to the point that you will have to loosen you belt a notch to make room.  This could be the best buffet in Arizona, I have to agree with Rand H. on that one.I love buffets!  One of the main reasons I go to Vegas is for the buffets.  Wandering Horse is the closest to a Vegas buffet but at less then half the price.My daughter chose to go here for her birthday.  My husband takes a look at the prices for lunch online and is shocked.  It was $8.95 for kids and $13.95 for adults.  Wow!  That's a deal!They have a good variety of food to try.  I loved the bbq duck legs.  Yum!  The dessert bar was wonderful! The kids love the gelato and so do I!  But my favorite dessert was the chocolate chip cookies.If you are dining on a budget and want good variety, this is the place!Plate 1: Chocolate donut, strawberries, blue berries, blackberries, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, 2 pork egg rolls, a maple bar and a yoplait yogurt.Plate 2: steak, sausage, bacon and icecream.Beverages: Water, orange juice, coffee and a diet coke.Servers and bussers: SUPERB!Cost: $9.99+tip on Saturday morning...AMAZING!So obviously I am not going to become known for my food pairings, but the point is they have all kinds of stuff to meet anybody's desires at the Wandering Horse Buffet.  I think I only tried about 1/4th of all the options available!  It also all seemed very fresh.  The donuts even seemed to be made fresh in house as opposed stale ones that have been sitting around and sourced from somewhere else.  The fruit bar was my favorite.  I was too stuffed for the Mexican breakfast bar and cereal bar, but they also looked appetizing.   I am not really a buffet person, but I definitely left fat and happy!  If you leave this buffet hungry, it is your own fault.Upon the upcoming of a 2nd The Breakfast Club UYE, I realized I did not write the rave review of the last one as I intended. The mind get's a little slippery with age I suppose!I for one have never been a breakfast person but this was an opportunity to hang out with some Yelp friends and make new ones too, met at The Wandering Horse Buffet at the Talking Stick Resort & Casino. All you can eat and drink for $10.00 sounded like a great deal to me.The food was fabulous! Where else can you get any breakfast food you desire from fruit & yogurt, eggs made to order, fresh cut bacon,fresh pastries, with the baker making them onsite, the list goes on and on. Then to my surprise food of the Asian Persuasion for breakfast, I was in heaven! As if the first two plates of food wasn't enough, I decided that hey if you can have dessert after dinner and lunch why not have it after breakfast?I had melt in your mouth gelato, a small scoop of pistachio, salted caramel, and caramel cookie crunch, soooooooo good! I can hardly wait to go back, taking my Aunt when she comes to town and sweat pants!  Wandering Horse definitely converted me into a breakfast person! Thanks Monica for setting up an awesome UYE and choosing the best breakfast place in town!We just came here yesterday for lunch and still full today.We were a group of 6. We wanted to take my Mother for an  Early Mothers Day. Since my girlfriend has to work on that day. Anyway, this is very much like a Vegas style Hotel ,and it was packed. Everyone gambleing on the Wednesday afternoon.The Buffet was nice,although there was a party in there of about 26 people who thought they were the only ones in the place. After they left it was clam.The resturant is very clean,nice dining area. Our server was very attentive.He refilled our drinks many times and was always coming by.The choices are good. Lots of fruit and cheese,salads of all sorts.Mexican, chinese, and meats and potaoes. Lots of choices.Gelato was amazing. cakes and pies, Berry tarts.I always over eat at this type of Buffet.it is a really nice place to go with a nice view from the dining area. We had arrived about 1:45 so the girl did come up about 2:45 and tell us it would be closing in 15 min and to make our final selections for food. That was nice as well. They did add the tip on the bill in the beginning ,I am sure because,there was 6 of us.The Breakfast Club UYE was back at Wandering Horse Buffett again! Guess we cannot get enough of this place! Since our last visit in Jan, this has been the most talked about place, and we have been eating breakfast all over the valley the few months!  We met up on a Sat morning at 8am,,,oh lord was that early for me, but it was the perfect time, it allowed us to eat, socializing and well eat some more!The food was amazing, I always wonder if a place would live up to the 1st experience you had, and well Wondering Horse does, this is a really great breakfast buffet, it has everything you can think of, and more. I caught out of the corner of my eye a huge bowl of fresh blueberries, my hands were already full, but I wanted to take the blueberries with me!! haha  I tried breakfast potatoes, more like potatoes Obrien with fresh peppers and onions, a breakfast burrito, BACON!!!, waffle, chicken chow mien, fried rice, egg rolls, danish, donut, salted caramel gelato, coffee chocolate chip gelato, raspberry gelato , oh and coffee and orange juice haha.  Everything was perfectly pleasing!If you haven't been to the Wandering Horse Breakfast buffet, go and give it a try!Wandering Horse isn't the cheapest buffet around, but OMG what a buffet it is.I can sum it up in all up in five words:All you can eat steak.And not crappy shoe leather steak--delicious mini kobe or other steaks, as much as you want, pile it high.And you can do the same with the chicken, the fish and shrimp, the pork and crab legs, the Mexican food, the Asian food, salad, veggies, and tons of different kinds of desserts but. . .The steak--endless steak, tasty, tender steak, eat until you pop steak.  Just go back and get moreWalk into the casino, head in, pay once. and let the beef commence.* Review is for the SUNDAY DINNER BUFFET which was a GOOD DEAL *it's random that we ended up here of all places but several people had mentioned it at the airport. thought we'd check it out since it was close to scottsdale.now, as a californian, i hate smokers.  hate is a strong word.  totally appropriate in this case.  i am probably bothered by smoking many times more than the average californian.  (in fact, when i was a kid, i used to pretend to cough my lungs out while walking around vegas at the sight/smell of a smoker.)  really dislike places where they allow indoor smoking. in phoenix downtown, we would smell cigarette smoke almost everywhere we walked since they had to smoke outside.  don't people know that they can save themselves $3000+ yearly for kicking the smoking and starbucks daily habit (probably more with the healthcare they have to pay when smoking leads to cancer, etc) ??? *SIGH* sunday dinner buffet was a great deal at $20.95 per person.service was prompt. your drink orders arrive quickly. when you get up to do round 2 (or 3) of the buffet, your plate is cleared within a minute or two. their selection of teas are peets teas. so many desserts. i walk in trying to focus on what to eat before dessert.  all i see are plates of pie, cake, mini parfaits/puddings, the gelato station, bananas foster station... the soups were okay. i had the viniagrette tomatoes, olives salad that was refreshing. put some chicken (dark meat), honey smoked salmon, mashed potatoes with gravy, veggie ravioli, potato salad, etc. don't remember everything i ate. the asian station didn't look appetizing though..they didn't have prime rib but the beef brisket was delish!!my favorite dessert was the banana cream pie.  i wanted another piece but couldn't do that to myself.  the chocolate brownie with walnuts was also an indulgence.  the little cups were pretty but not worth grabbing. mini fruit tarts were yummy.we also noticed that some people ate a short dinner so that they could get back to gambling. haha. 3,5 starsThis review is a reflection on the UYE Breakfast Club get together that we all enjoyed so much. Monica O is definitely the Queen of putting together large groups of Yelpers and she does a swell job of making the event fun and exciting.This is my second chance to visit the Wandering Horse and always seem to have a great time. Brought my wife so I could introduce her to some some of my really cool party animal friends. She always hears me talking about them and this was a fine occasion to take it to the next level.The food at the breakfast buffet is always very good and fresh. They serve everything that you would need to get your tummy filled up and make your belt buckle loosen on it's own. There is really no reason that you should still be hungry by the time you are finished and leave this place.Service is always delightful and the place is usually very clean and tidy. Would like to see a faster process up front at the money takers. The line was very long before they opened and it felt like it took forever.Big shout out to Monica again for all her efforts and time. You are the Best and deserve a gold medal or a new cute badge. Hi to everyone who came and to those to did not make it. Hope to see ya again next time. It's going to be awesome. PARTY TIME!5 STARSI was expecting Vegas quality but this is just a small casino in Arizona.  Get real, Joyce W.!  :(We arrived at 6ish for a Saturday Dinner Buffet.  I believe it was $14/pp but I'm not entirely sure since my MIL picked up the bill.  They had NY Strip, oysters both raw and fried, king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, tilapia ceviche, a fajita station, pizza, a cheese selection, fruits, salads, Asian stir fry, a very impressive dessert bar, et cetera. Sure, the king crab legs were plenty and always stocked full but it was all frozen firm meat.  At one point, my brother-in-law asked someone to heat some up for us because it had ice chunks inside.  The raw oysters were sadly not fresh.  I was telling everyone I was going to down at least a dozen by myself.  Two fishy oysters in, I gave up.  You just can't choke down oysters that can't be pried off their shells.  I also ate one with too much horseradish to try to off-set the weird-taste but all I got was a clear sinus from it.  Whoa!  I heard the NY strip with au ju was pretty decent.  I regret not getting a cut because I was starting to feel like an ice cube from all the cold foods I was eating.  I think the highlight was dessert.  Everything was small and dainty and the serving size was perfect since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Give me more creme brulee and I'll be a happy camper.  I even had some sugar-free spumoni in honor of Brett B. and Jasmine F.All-in-all, it was a decent dinner buffet for $14 with an okay selection.  It's a very clean dining area and the wait staff is friendly and on-point with clearing dishes away.  They keep the glasses filled and the tables stocked with wet napkins.If you haven't been to the Wandering Horse Buffett for Saturday morning breakfast, what are you waiting for?  It's from 8am to 10:30am, for $10.95 (plus tax)  per person,  but if in parties 6 or larger, gratuity is added, but with tax included its still under $14 bucks!  They have everything you could possibly think of, from breakfast burritos, omelet station, yogurt & granola, waffles, quiches, slabs of thick juicy bacon SLABS!!!!, chicken chow mien, Thai spring rolls, fried rice, general Taos chicken, donuts, pastries and more!  I have been quite a few times in the last 3 years and each and every time service was great and the food was delish! My family and friends really enjoy this breakfast spread!If you haven't been, you really need to go, it's one of the best Saturday morning breakfast buffet I have been too.
Big in Japan=Came here last week with an old high school buddy since we decided to try out a place from the Montreal episode of Anthony Bourdain's series, The Layover. so we settled on trying this place since neither of us had gone.First up, we decided to order 2 appetizers and share, what came was a very tasty dish of fried chicken and a second dish of fried pork under a mound of fresh watercress and sliced radishes and onions. Both were very tasty and by appetizer-standards quite large dishes and very filling. We began to wonder if ordering mains may have been a bad idea and overkill.I ordered the Green Tea spare ribs and my friend ordered a Ramen noodle dish with beef and eggplant. My ribs, if a bit dry, were OK, (FAR better than Bar B Barn, which I can't stand), and the green tea sauce at the bottom of the dish was very lightly flavoured with matcha. It's not the best ribs I've ever had but I'll give them points for originality. My friend however was very disappointed with his dish, he described it almost as if it was a Taco which they just threw into a soup with Ramen noodles and vowed never to order this again.The décor is very funky and clever and yes, it does almost have a cafeteria-style and vibe to it. The service we received was friendly and casual. I'd come back here if for anything else to try out more of these appetizers!
Flaming Kabob 2=Some 3 stars are better than other 3 stars.  That's because The Yelp won't give us half stars or quarter stars.  Or any portion of stars.  No stardust either.  I did get some pixie dust at a Yelp event once but that is a completely different story than I am not prepared to relate today.All I am prepared to tell you today is that we had dinner at Flaming Kabob 2.  It was overall pretty good.  We started with flaming cheese (we felt that with the word flaming in the name of the restaurant we needed something flaming and we couldn't get certain friends to join us so we had to order burning food.  Actual burning food).  The cheese was served fajita style, that is, on a small skillet with a wooden holder.  It was very tasty but rather greasy.  What did I expect from burning cheese?We followed that with a couple shared entrees:  a gyro platter and some kind of chicken platter...I'm afraid I don't remember the name.  Both were tasty.  The chicken was heavily sauced (haven't we all been once or twice) and flavored strongly with garlic (haven't we all been once or twice).So to bottom line this for you (don't we all just want to go straight for the bottom sometimes?  The bottom line)  I would eat here again.
Boba City Cafe=Nice little local spot for boba in the Spring Valley area. Boba City Cafe is a good place for a daytime snack or for those small get-togethers with a friend or two. It's really convenient because it's right around the corner from where I live. I came in to get a quick snack before running errands and had the honeydew fruit slushie with boba and their order of chicken wings.Usually when I go to boba places that offer slushies, they're not blended well and I end up having to chew on little pieces of ice. Boba City Cafe's slushie was blended well and had no bits of ice, just the full flavor of the honeydew. The boba was close to perfect with it being not too gooey in texture, but not rock hard either. It was more on the softer side, which I prefer. The chicken wings were pretty bomb. They were golden-brown in color and had this seasoning on it that had a little spicy kick.Seating is limited (each table had two chairs each) and they didn't seem to have a "small" size (the smallest size is their medium). Great place to pick up a little snack and drink if you don't want to venture into Chinatown for boba.
Ghost Lounge=I was really looking forward to this spot, as Hotel San Carlos is such a dynamic location and lends itself so well to a lounge environment. But my experience was less than stellar. Less than mediocre, actually. But I can see this turning into a prime night spot if some changes are made. Like: neutralizing that funky odor; lowering the bartender side of the bar area, so they aren't towering over you; banning staff from using cell phones on the job; discouraging staff from sitting on the bar (this should be alleviated once the leveling of the bartender zone is completed); educating the staff on the history of Hotel San Carlos [come on, people! You host a haunted hotel event every October. It's fun to learn the freaky side of the property along with the hip end of it.] Will I be back? More than likely. But some serious attention needs to be paid here. Prior to being served, I envisioned this as a primo location for hosting a '30s gangster event, with cigar smoking on the patio, martinis, clappers and all the glamor of that era. I can still see it, just not as passionately. Fix your issues, or be prepared to vanish like a ghost after a proper smudging.
Roseleaf=As the chosen restaurant for the Yelp Christmas Dinner, I had high hopes. Adorable traditional British gastropub that serves cocktails in teapots alongside bangers and mash? Yes please.In the process of booking the table of 20 people (which turns out to be their entire dining area) the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, patient when waiting for orders. So big kudos to the staff for pre-event arrangements and also service on the night. There were 20 of us, they staggered the meals well and kept us all well fed.The pub itself seems to be really popular with the locals, and other parties. When we arrived a wedding party were filling the bar. It has charm it's old-worldly but like I said, does cocktails in tea pots (which are called 'pot-tails' not the other way of fusing the two words, which I blurted out without thinking...)The Salamander Slapper that Catriona C and I shared was quite nice (we're talking pot-tails here) although I couldn't really taste the alcohol or feel the effect. There was a lot of ice in it. But good for the novelty value.It does pain me to then lower the stars somewhat and give an 'a-ok' review. The food itself is where I was a little let down. We all had to pre-order our meals off the Christmas menu. I went for the smoked salmon starter and then the "Haddock with Oat Risotto, Applewood and a happy egg". Now, on the menu that seems to be 'haddock WITH risotto', not 'risotto with haddock.'So when the mains arrived and the waitress asked "who ordered the risotto?" I thought 'uh oh'. I don't like risotto much but was willing to sacrifice it as a side for a delicious piece of haddock and a happy poached egg. What arrived was a bowl of risotto with a few wee bits of haddock on top, and a poached egg that was overly poached so wasn't runny.The risotto, being oat, tasted entirely of porridge. It was, as Aidan put it very well, glutinous, overly filling and bland. The fact that it was in abowl and the haddock was on top meant there was no space to cut the haddock apart from on the risotto, so the haddock tasted of porridge. And the un-runny poached egg gave no yolk to mask the flavour. (see uploaded photo)The result was like eating a big bowl of porridge with fish and egg. Weird. Bland.Luckily I was able to share a little of Kay L's butternut squash and nut wellington, which was far more flavourful. And the pork belly disappeared faster than you can say "cock-pot". (Damnit, I just said it again didn't I?) And the beef pie looked amazing. (See all uploaded photos)The smoked salmon starter was really great, the salmon in such thick slices. And the chocolate tart I tried, witha soufflé consistency was nice. But as Louise C said, there were no coffees or mince pies after. Yes, we make consessions that it's Christmas so it might be slightly higher priced. But...I did come away just feeling a wee bit disappointed with my main option. I'd be willing to give Roseleaf another go based on other good reviews and photos I've seen. The burger looks epic. It's  agreat cosy wee pub too. I was just a little let down by my main and had a wee bit of a sore tummy for the rest of the night because of it. I want to like Roseleaf, I do and I will come back. Just please don't serve me porridge with fish.
Fast Eddie's Diner=Definition of Meh.The place is brand spanking new, but the fact that it's the carcass of a former Village Inn, as opposed to a new build, is obvious.There was a lot of unfinished look around -- not that they weren't done with it, just crappy quality of workmanship.Look at the new light fixture on the newly painted wall, and see how the paint is smeared all up on the fixture.Everything sure looked pretty dirty, for only having been open a couple of days....made me think it may have been left over construction filth.There are sarcastic posters saying they'll eat bisbehaving children, and other such nonsense, framed in RAW sheet metal frames, complete with child-safe sharp corners within little hands reach, for your bloody dining pleasure.Burger and fries, a diner staple, shouldn't be too hard.  Supposedly fresh, never frozen, burger but who could tell?  It was bland and in a stange paradox, looked barely cooked to medium rare in the center, and yet was dry and crumbly upon eating.Fries were ok, and they gave a very generous portion of all the standard burger veggie toppings.Service was pleasant and friendly in a normal, expected way, but nothing stand-out.  One of the supposedly witty signs said something about "Sassy Servers" but I saw nothing of the sort.  (Probably a good bet, since I don't think the NoPho'er Denny's/Village Inn crowd would enjoy attitude ala "Dick's" in Vegas)I would say I'd be back anyway, and very soon, to enjoy their Daily breakfast special -- 1.99 through April 15, then graduating to 2.49 and 2.99 after that -- except that they won't allow substitutions, and I don't eat eggs.Whenever the dreaded "No Substitutions" appears on a menu, or is mentioned at all, I always think of the Peanuts cartoon special where Charlie Brown goes to that Chateau in France, and they keep wandering around finding that everyplace has a sign that says "No Dogs Allowed" (and there was a cheesy song to go with it, too)I am a 70's TV baby.  (which made me laugh at the children's menu items named The Cunningham, The Ralph Malph, and the Pinky Tuscadero)
The Holyrood 9A=I came here for burgers, I saw burgers and then I ate them.On my 'best burger in town' self-imposed mission, when I had a craving for a burger one evening I skipped my usual go-to option (which is currently my personal favourite) to try something new. Always risky, as if it doesn't live up to its predecessor, disappointment can abound.Holyrood 9A specilaises in two things: beers and burgers, and great ones at that (according to its motto). The burger menu is pretty big, with more inventive options from Italian (mozarella, pesto) and one meat-injection overload that I can't remember the name (burger with turkey AND prosciutto) with a few chicken options, and then some 'special' ones like Lamb (that did sound delicious with cumin etc.) and venison.I pipped for the peri-peri chicken, which I was promised would be a whole grilled chicken breast. Immediate bonus points, as I don't like the bread-crumb covered chicken breasts that were so popular in my childhood. As we were waiting in the back restaurant area, it was a pleasant ambience. A complete mix of students, and all us other folk over a whole age range. Big props to the staff who were all really friendly, attentive and genuine. They seemed to enjoy working there.When I passed the kitchen I looked in and could see them frying the chicken breast burger alongside the beef patties - no grilling. This wasn't what was promised so let me down a little.The burger itself was presented on the thick wooden board that is so in vogue right now, along with a purple cabbage coleslaw and skinny fries. Nice fresh sourdough bun, big chicken breast and PICKLES. I've realised that my other burger-place doesn't do pickles and how much I've been missing out as a result.The chicken breast burger was really quite lovely. Very filling but in a healthy way (despite being friend, not grilled). My partner's bacon and cheese burger disappeared fast which I take as a good sign, although the beef patty - on my very close scrutiny as I am on a real mission here - wasn't quite as exciting as it could have been. I like to see bits of fresh coriander or chili mixed in with the beef. But still, it was hand-made.The skinny fries were ok but I've gotten very used to hand cut potato wedges that have that rustic feel and I think that's my prefered potato option.As you can see, I am analysing every part of this burger experience. The reason being it wasn't my *favourite* in town and I can't quite work out why. It was good, and I would come back, and next time will probably try the lamb. But my quest for theeeeee *best* one continues.Overall though, great ambience, fantastic staff, filling food that is hand-made and not overly greasy or heavy, and I assume great beers (not being a drinker of such stuff myself). My ONLY complaint is its 3 doors down from my gym which I have to pass to get there. Guilt trippin' before the beef, sad times.
North Forty Saloon and BBQ=The latest in the Saga of Eating Challenges.....Stoney's North Forty was selected as the location for the 4 lb Omelet eating challenge.  Scheduled for a 9 AM start, I had to rush to get there in time to witness the action.  Four guys in our group of 12 were going for it.I didn't participate in the Challenge, but posted some pics of the Giant Omelette & participants.  I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn't feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.  The Skins were topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, and Green Onions....Ranch was provided for dipping.  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.Our food came out pretty fast and the waitress was pretty cool to handle our huge order.  The Omelets came out first.....they are really, really BIG!  Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it's covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.  Scott T gave it a valiant effort and came up a few ounces short of finishing the Omelet....seriously, check out the pic....he was soooo close, but couldn't do it.  Ken M who organized this thing did ok....respectable.....plus had ate it with a Shiner Bock....+1 for Ken for a Beer at 9 AM!Our Skins were very tasty.....the combination of toppings went well together.  The Sour Cream was drizzled over the top of the Skins instead of a blob of it that you have to put on yourself.....for some reason I prefer it drizzled over the Skins like they do it.  The Skins are very large too.....and stuffed full of the toppings....I'm glad I split it with my Son.....I was full after eating 1/2 of the order.Looking around the joint, it's a Country Western Dance Hall at night with plenty of room on the dance floor.  There's also a mechanical Bull in the corner for those who dare.....needless to say, nobody in our group was in the mood for a Bull Ride.....not after trying to house a 4 lb Omelet, ha!Overall, it was a great time....Will I return?  Yee haw!  that means "Yes" in Cowboy....I think.
Stevie's New York Style Pizza=I love the pizza here! After living in Arizona for the past few years, I've tried a variety of different places in addition to the standard chains of Pizza Hut/Domino's and I have to say nothing really compares to Stevie's! I love that they make a good, simple, delicious New York style pizza for an affordable price. They have the perfect balance of crust/cheese/sauce and every slice is delicious as the last. Everyone that I've had try their pizza has been converted into a fan. I'm definitely going to miss this pizza when I move back home. I hope they stay in business forever so I can come back every time I visit AZ!
Chang's Chinese Buffet=When you enter this quaint little buffet you are greeted  (my best guess) by one of the Two owners (again I am guessing) a husband and wife team and maybe a dishwasher. She is reserved yet friendly.Directly to your left there are 4 booths that seat 4 and the rest are tables that each seat 4. (I'm sure if you had a group they would hustle to accommodate whatever arrangement you chose.  Rand H. and I paid and immediately chose a seat . We sat in a corner booth. I ran straight to the food and got some Hot and Sour soup. It was perfect!! I also grabbed some of the entrees. Yummeeee!!Okay 4.5 stars !!!!! This quiet little buffet with 23 items and a capacity of 28was a pleasant meal where I was actually able to try everything except the fried chicken and the fried fish (wasn't in the mood) Egg fu young looked like a hockey puck but was Tender and TASTY . . . plain or with the sauce! Thanx Iain B. for nudging us to try it!! because of work I'll not be partaking with Mike C and Rand H. on our next usual Monday buffet run. =( so anyway I personally didn't miss the salad ... a star crusher for the great and mighty "salad loving" Rand H. I also wonder about Mike C's feelings for this place because he is ALL about the DESSERTS. they had 2 kinds of pudding and 1 or 2 kinds of jello.,. WHATEVER I'm with iain B. if a small but sufficient dose of Chinese Buffet is what you are down 4. Come support one of the worthy small businesses in your hood!!!!!!!!! This is what makes America Wonderful!
Tropical Smoothie Cafe="She barely knew your name"-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------Quick Review™+   Service -- in the morning -- is great.+/- Smoothies are alright. Aaaaight. Service during lunchtime is hit or miss. Don't come here in a rush. Like at all ... -    Free smoothie during birthday was not honoured. Check the check-ins, yo. I ain't a newbie. They wouldn't honour a single birthday freebie for a stupid ass reason and I will never set foot in here again. One-star all up in yo' face! -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------I am not necessarily proud of this, but I have tried nearly every smoothie and sandwich on the menu. Not every smoothie at some Tropical Smoothie Café® at some point, but almost every smoothie from their menu exclusively at this location.  Why? Well ... ain't shit else open (besides McDonald's®) around here that early. And I need shit to eat early. It is right across the street from the CSN campus. Service is fine in the morning.Now, what is my proverbial beef here? I've been here dozens and dozens and dozens of times (verified check-ins: 58, although I have been here more times than that) after all. I received a birthday email for being in their E-Club (which is worthless, by the way [not just because they won't honour what is sent, but because there is no point to it]) and printed it out like a good lil' soldier. Pro Tip: The E-Club is useless. Don't join it.For whatever reason (I am not IT), my name did not print with the stupid email. I don't know. Don't really care. My name is on my ID card and I have the printed electronic mail. If one would go through the trouble of searching for the email template just to ... what ... photoshop someone's name off of it ... don't you think that you would just also insert one's own fucking name in there? I mean: seriously. Pro Tip: Photoshop your fucking name on there if it prints sans. No one accused me of photoshopping another person's name off of it; however, how else would it be nameless if they are insistent that they are never sent that way and they cannot honour it. The manager said fuck off in not so many words. I had been here over sixty fucking times in a relative short period of time. If they shit on a regular customer like that, what kind of service do you think you will get while going through the drive-thru or just dropping in one day. Possibly the second worst run Tropical Smoothie Cafe® on Planet Earth* ....*Second last to the Red Rock Resort one.I don't play games: enjoy your one-star from a long-time customer that will never patronise this location again. Cheers!Pro Tip: Ask for the manager to be fired.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------Rating: One-star, "Eek! Methinks not." (Consider this a corrective mechanism.)
Iruna=It was the summer of 1994... Salamanca Spain.I was there for a six week study abroad program, and I loved every moment of it, but I particularly loved the culture and the food!This all came back to me last night when I went to Iruna for their grand opening.  I felt like I was back in Spain as I drank sangria, people-watched, enjoyed the fabulous service, and of course, savored samples from Aaron May's latest menu...The tortilla espanola was my favorite, but I was also a fan of the gazpacho and the artichoke and clams.  One look at the regular menu and there is a ton more comida that I'll have to try.If you like any of the following, let me know:*ensalada de arroz con atun*pulpo a la gallega*paella*spinach and goat cheese croquettas*calamari con pimenton*gambas al ajillo*any / all of the vegetable sides - gotta get that verdura in!We can set up a tapas date and share!And it looks like their "hora feliz" (4:30 - 6:30 daily) has some awesome deals!I'd like to eventually travel back to Spain to relive that summer, but in the meantime, I look forward to making do at Iruna!It's true!I haven't been one of Aaron May's biggest fans over the past few years.Ranging from the mediocre and puzzling "Lodge" to the execrable and gloomy "Over Easy" (and it's lamentable cousin at the skating rink in NoSco)...I just haven't cared much for his offerings...no pizzazz....at least to me (oh sure, I saw the Travel Channel special, too...I know the Sasquatch is gigantic and gooey, but even I have my standards).But I'm prepared to change my thinking about the AM empire, all because of a few small plates of food...tapas...done the way tapas should be done!I wanted to stand up and applaud after my first few bites of the first plates to reach our table last night!But The Beautiful Carin was nibbling my ear and murmuring about love, the wine, the food, the warm night and the mood and well...standing up and applauding would have been embarrassing!So we sat there and snuggled in our little booth-like corner on the patio for a couple of hours and had a number of marvelous small plates and a couple of glasses of excellent wine and thought "How very, completely civilized!"And, then we thought, "Why haven't we been back to Espana, lately?"...Well, why bother with the flight when Iruna is within walking distance!Spend the airfare on tapas and wine!Iruna is a marvelous little Tapas bar that would be right at home in Malaga on the Costa del Sol...no kidding!From the communal bar/table to the walled patio to the colors and the lighting, somebody got the décor just right!And Iruna got the menu right, too!Crispy Chicken with garlic and pickled onions; shaved ham, quince and cheese cold plates; spicy scampi with a soothing aioli and chilled asparagus with spicy romesco all hit just the right note...well thought out and well executed dishes...satisfying, tasty and delightful!We even had room for a little dessert!We shared (so sweetly intimate) some sort of chocolate/vanilla crème pudding with orange liqueur and dark chocolate sauce...decadent and the perfect accompaniment to the very solid selection of available porto's  (I really did feel like I was back on the Iberian Peninsula for a while last night).While we didn't hit the bar too hard last evening, we did glance through the selection of single malts (a big "hello" to Mac and all the Glen's) and took note of the decent selection of brandies, cognac's and bourbons  (and for my buddy Brian...Blanton's, Woodford's Reserve and Rowan Creek are on the menu, too).After a busy week and a hectic Friday, it is hard to imagine a much better way to spend a warm Friday evening than a leisurely and sensual dinner of tapas and wine with the girl of my dreams, followed by a slow stroll home and...So here's the scenario:A foodie website with lots of citizen reviewers is holding an event at your restaurant.  You go in knowing the people at the event will in all likelihood write reviews of your restaurant.Do you:A. Treat the attendees as if you are doing them a favor, run out of food early and generally put out the feeling that you would like the whole ordeal to be over as fast as possible so you can get these folks out of your establishment.B. Seize the opportunity to put your best foot forward and capitalize on the opportunity to present your great food and friendly, professional staff to the reviewing community, in the hopes of receiving praise and business in return.If you chose B you do not run Iruna.To be honest, I am not privy to the negotiations and such that go on between Yelp and a restaurant hosting an event.  I do however have a solid grasp of business and marketing.In my opinion, Iruna's behavior at the recent Yelp event reflected answer A above rather than B.  It was unfortunate.  The food varied from good to mediocre.  I heard some folks got more than a few morsels, I'm not sure who they were.I experienced attitude from staff members myself and witnessed a number of other people receive the same.  I was frankly quite surprised.  It was clear to me the staff did not grasp the opportunity they were presented with and viewed the event as a problem to get through.As a contrast, I attended a Yelp event at The Breakfast Joynt over a year ago. The staff and management was pleasant and welcoming and the food was very good.  I have returned to The Breakfast Joynt 6-7 times since the event.I won't be back to Iruna.
Church's Chicken=Just went Churchs Chicken in Surprise Arizona and was called a skinhead and he thanks us for our people eating there. This is because I told him that they got my order wrong. He said F@#$ YOU you didn't order what you think you did. I told him I was calling corporate he said F@#$ them I own this place not them. I paid a million dollars for this place not you. There is the road now go away you F#$%ing skinhead. This is very nice for my first and last time ever eating there. Now everyone will know what a raciest this owner is. Just because I am white and have short hair Im a skinhead. WOW -If there was a zero star that is what they would get.
Cafe Rio=I finally took the time to take my butt over to this spot. My brother has been telling me that this place was bomb dot com for weeks!! He also kept comparing it to the neighboring Chipotle and how humongous their servings were!!Everything previously stated were all true, but I still find myself under Chipotle's customer satisfaction list.  Yes, Cafe Rio is similar to Chipotle because of the whole burrito, tacos, and salad assembly line (where you choose meat, beans, rice, veggies, and dressing), but the tastes make it totally different and incomparable.I had the Fire Grilled Chicken salad and it was pretty good.  The portions are definitely huge and can be taken to-go as your second meal of the day!! What turned me off was the rice though!! There was just something weird about the taste and texture (I can't seem to find the words for it). The lime rice at Chipotle is definitely undefeated!!! I did like the avocado ranch dressing though! That added another star to my rating! Haha, but overall it was an OK place. You'll definitely need to hit it up on an empty stomach so good luck & eat well! =D
Dressler's=Oh wow oh wow. I'm a big fan of Charlotte local eateries, but Dressler's takes the cake...the CHEESECAKE. For days, I've been talking about Jon Dressler's mama's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. OMG it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. But I won't get ahead of myself, let's go through the digs and the meal first. This new location is nestled into the upscale Midtown shopping center and is easy to find and to park. Inside, it's a nicely styled upscale restaurant, complete with comfy booths and a decent sized bar. There is also a nice patio, but it was hella hot, so we chose to dine indoors. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, offering suggestions and personal feedback on potential menu choice for all parties. I ordered the Tuna Seared to Perfection - a sizeable piece of sashimi grade tuna, you know it, seared to perfection over a tasty rice cake. The best part was, however, the insanely delicious peanut sauce that was drizzled over the tuna and the plate. It was just enough not to overpower the item. Price wise, it's comparable to other upscale eateries, expect to pay roughly $20-$30 ish per entree, but it is worth it. Completely. All six of us ordered different menu items and adored them. Make sure you hear about the specials too, they sounded great. And back to the cheesecake...it was peanut buttery goodness in one little slice of heaven. Creamy cheesecake with the right amount of peanut butter and the perfect number of chocolate chips, all set on the most delicious chocolate crust. They should seriously make it a menu item, as it was a dessert special the night I went. Jon Dressler made a call to his mother as we were making our way out, and let my mom and I pay compliments to her dessert handiwork. Not only was she extremely humble, but she was just as sweet as her creations. I can't wait to go back to Dressler's for the fantastic food, great service, and, of course, the peanut butter cheesecake.
Wild East=Stopped in for a quick takeout lunch today and was very impressed. The menu offers, typical Chinese options, plus sushi, curry and some Thai! The lunch specials are very affordable for the portion!I went with beef broccoli, which came with choice of soup and rice...all for $6! The container was even high class and not your typical Chinese containers. I also got the veggie egg roll app for $3 which came with two rolls. I'll be a regular in no time!Fancier Japanese sushi restaurant, Wild East is dark and dim and has lots of wood. Well decorated and quite fancy with bamboo inlays for the chairs and tables. The sushi menu had a good selection of "creative" rolls and the usual list of regular rolls. As well, some cooked food available for those who aren't into the raw fish (you know who you are).We ordered four rolls with a soup and a seaweed salad to start. The soup and salad arrived swiftly and we had plenty of time to enjoy them before our rolls arrived. (Yes, she asked if it was okay that all four were on one plate.)The rolls were tasty and fresh. Nicely arranged, nicely topped. Very nice.A good amount of sushi and while the prices were a little higher than I'd usually go for, it was good. I would return.Very good sushi. I usually get Chirashi plate, since you kind of getting sashimi and rice. But a little pricy!
Teriyaki Time=WHAT TIME IS IT? Sorry, had to say it. Anyways, I have always had a soft spot for teriyaki places so when I saw these guys I was excited to try them out.Originally I was gonna give them 2 stars because I have actually had better. But since this was my first time, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.Since I don't usually eat breakfast (I know, people tell me that's a bad thing), when lunch comes around, I am starving. So I ordered the Chicken n Beef Combo Bento. Comes with one scoop of rice and salad. This is where thoughts of 2 stars were dancing in my head. When I received my food, everything was lukewarm. Believe it or not, the teriyaki sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle was actually hotter than my entrée. The salad was decent, which was I thought was better than the beef and chicken. Kind of sad if you ask me. Lastly, the portions were not much. At some other places, I get almost twice as much food for what I paid for which was around 9 and some change. After I got done, I admit, I was not all the way full, like I can eat so much more.Im hoping my next visit will be much better because I am gonna order a different entrée. If it disappoints again, it's going down to 2 stars. Some positive notes are that the place is pretty spacious, they take cards, and the wifi is free.In closing, I will try them again, that is, if Cugino's Deli doesn't call my name.
Thai Buffet & American Sandwiches=This is now my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley. It is modest in appearance both outside and inside, but the food is awesome, and Joann (the business card says "Joann's Kitchen - Thai Buffet & American Sandwiches, etc.") gives the service such a friendly, personal touch. At the start of your meal, you are served a delicious chicken lemongrass soup and appetizers of chicken satay, beef, sticky rice, and green papaya salad. The selection of main dishes may not be as extensive as in most Asian buffets, but the dishes are excellent, freshly prepared, and have a comforting home-cooked flavor. As my fellow yelpers Rand H. and Robyn N.  noted when we had lunch here, it's like dining in a Thai family home rather than in a restaurant. As with most buffets, you can eat all you want. But in this establishment, you go to the food counter and choose from the array dishes to be served to you. You can also ask Joann to prepare dishes to order, as Hector F. mentioned in his review - another departure from the usual style of Asian buffet restaurants. Fresh fruit is also served, at the end of the meal or with the meal (fresh fruit is eaten with the main courses in a number of Asian cultures), and if you have room after all the feasting, coconut ice cream, lychee rice pudding, and pumpkin custard cap the meal. This place is a bit far from where I live, but it's definitely worth the drive ... and I'm so glad it's not far from where I work. Yay!!!I loved this place!  It's like going to your Thai Mother's house for lunch, but better.  I was here a week ago with Norm R and Rand H and we all agreed it was a wonderful experience with fantastic food.  It really did feel like you were eating in someone's home.  They say it's a buffet, but it's so much more than that.  For $7.50 a person ($10 each including a diet coke for me and tip) this place is definitely a bargain.  Don't let the outside fool you either, it may not look like much on the outside, but they put all their effort into the food and service.It's not the typical buffet where you serve yourself from 100 items - our first course was served to us - a plate of papaya salad, chicken and pork satay, jerk beef and sticky rice.  I could have just had all that and been satisfied.  But no, there is more.  We walked up to the counter and they made our plates cafeteria style, a little of this a little of that and more of all the rest.  Yellow curry, a noodle dish, a veggie dish with eggplant, fried rice, jasmine rice and more that I don't even know what it was.  I'm not usually an adventurous eater, but everything tasted great!  Just when we were about full and done - there's even more food!  Served to us at the table was a plate of coconut ice cream, homemade pumpkin custard and lychee with sticky rice and a cup of hot tea.  OMG unbelievably good, my mouth is watering just remembering how delicious the food was.The most amazing part was they offered to make us other food that wasn't even on the buffet and suggested if we wanted something special to call ahead and they would prepare it for us next time.  This little place is all about service and homemade food.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks Norm for turning me on to this place!Seriously, Joann... raise your prices.Not often I would say that, but the very last thing I would want to see from this family business is for it to fail because of low margins. You get so much for such a low price here, its really ridiculous. And I know Joann (the chef/owner) reads these reviews, so having told her this last night I wanted to repeat it on Yelp as well, because this is the kind of dining experience most people will probably never come across, but is amazing. Im now sitting here wishing other restaurants were ran this way, because it would make people like me (I want to try everything!) SO HAPPY.Im the date in Rons review, so you can read that for most of the details. Just know I have never liked Pad Thai anywhere before, and when we finished off the large plate of it and Joann asked if we wanted anymore, I think my heart stopped for a sec in pleasure. And the dessert? Oh my god... oh my god. I could eat that every nightCouple of warnings though- the papaya salad is spicy. Unassuming too, so be careful.The 'green bean' in the curry is NOT a green bean. It is a very spicy little chili, and apparantly it was quite funny to watch me discover this informationSeriously. Speak slowly and clearly when saying 'peanut sauce' or you will have two 30 yr old men giggling like little school girls. Go, support Joann, and take a peak at her old photos on one of the tables in the middle of the restaurant. Shes smoking hot.I'm sorry. I feel guilty writing this review.  The people were nice, friendly, accommodating. But I have never been so let down after finding good reviews on Yelp.I don't mind that the location is a touch sketchy or that the interior needs some love.I did mind that the food varied from good to not very good and I paid 55 bucks for it.I did mind that there were ants...in several places.  On tables.  In the bathroom.  Deal with your pest problem please.I see why some reviewers say it feels like you are at someone's house.  That's probably why I feel guilty dropping a 2 star review on them.  For the money, skip the buffet and go somewhere else like Palee's Crown, Thai Lahna or even Thai Rama.Be warned if you go here and write a poor review you will be attacked by the owners and possibly a customer or two thru messages.  I won't respond to their childish messages which are one step above "I know you are but what am I?"For the record, my bill was $55 and for the record four of us dined there and all saw ants - including on the table.  My review is not the only one to talk about ants, read the filtered reviews.Message from owner:"When did you come in and pay 55 dollars? We know all customers and dont know you, a 55 dollar bill has never been written, unless you can prove otherwise. Customer satisfactory is very important to me. Please come back and there will not be any ants.from joann the owner"Message from another Yelper:"Thats funny that I go there once a week and have never saw any ants, yet someone like you goes there, and there are ants every where.  If you bathe and wash your clothes, ants wont follow you where you lay."If I were the owner I might have responded privately with something along the lines of:"We are very sorry to hear about your experience with our establishment.  While we have not seen any ants we have had someone out to make sure this is not a problem.  We would like to invite you back to try us again, we're confident you will have a different experience.  Thank you again for the feedback."
Zaba's Mexican Grill=Was going to do an afternoon study session at the Starbucks next door and stopped by this joint for lunch.  If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?Back to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.They make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.The Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?The Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.Overall, it was OK.Will I return?  Eh....maybe.
Rachel's Kitchen=Pricey yummy upscale diner food type stuff here but what you can also get is a watermelon smoothie.  A watermelon smoothie that tastes like a real watermelon. Like seriously, surprisingly like a real watermelon.Like I was with someone who was in Vegas two years ago and had one and insisted on bringing me here to have one. Watermelon.No artificial flavoring, just watermelon.WaterMelonWahTerMelOnW.My ladies and I decided to have a nice girl's day out, so we headed to Rachel's Kitchen for brunch. I was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service!!! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical. Heat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite. All in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though.Occasionally, I try to undo all the damage yelping does to my arteries.  So...I head on down to Rachel's Kitchen.My go-to drink is Sweet Greens with kale, cucumber, lemon, ginger, spinach, apple, etc.  Yes, it sounds revolting unless you're a hippie.  However,  I tell myself it's good for me (guh, who actually likes eating kale??) and gulp it down.  They have other, less intense juices like watermelon, if you're a wuss.They also serve food and it's pretty good.  I enjoy the vegetarian sandwich.  It has goat cheese and I truly believe most things taste better with goat cheese.  They also have some great vinaigrette salad dressings. Also, randomly, they serve alcohol.  I'm tempted to order oatmeal and wine one day.  Maybe I'll head there right now...Finally got around to trying Rachel's and I'm so glad I did!I met Ms. Fake-Up herself, Dana S, for a spur of the moment lunch and jaunt around The District. I had a hard time finding her in the restaurant because I'm not used to seeing her without all that fake-up lols. I was hungry but also trying to just be a healthier person (don't tell that to the peanut butter cookies I just snarfed) so I got a curried chicken salad over top a green salad. The green salad part kind of ruined it--personal preference...I just don't like vinaigrette and I didn't realize it had vinaigrette on it. No matter, though, because the chicken salad was good and next time, I'll get just the chicken salad with a sandwich instead.Also got the watermelon juice. Yes, it was tasty. Yes, I can understand that it's winter and the prices have to pay for more than just the juice. But over $4 for this juice was really pricey. I will skip it next time to just save a little change. As for the other aspects of business--service, excellent. Decor, excellent. Dining al Fresco? Gotta get on that before it gets to be like stepping into the seventh circle of Hell outside. Skip Panera and come here. Actually go to Panera just for the cookies after lunch. No Danas were harmed in the creation of this Yelp review.I met the Moll-tern here for lunch since both of us had this place bookmarked for a while. The high ratings are definitely well deserved as the food was delicious and fresh and the space plentiful and clean. Also, I am loving the patio seating until it gets scorching hot outside.I parked in the plentiful lot behind Lucille's BBQ at The District, and it was only a short walk form there.I ordered off their "Lighter Side" menu and opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. Both the salad and the sandwich were delicious. The sandwich had grilled chicken breast, grilled eggplant, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and reduced fat mayo. Clocked in at about 330 calories with the salad. Not bad for a filling, quality lunch. Calories well spent.My only gripe is that the calories are only displayed on the "Lighter Side" portion of the menu.This is a great go-to spot for a healthy lunch.Definitely not in love with Rachel's Kitchen, but something keeps drawing me in. T: Too loudH: Have earplugs. Holy fucknuts it's so loud in here.R: Read the menu for calorie counts. Some of the meals are in a healthy range.E: Eat the Chicken Curry Sandwich. It's in the awesome range.E: Eat the pasta not the pancakes. I've tasted the pasta and it is light and has a great garlic flavor. My banana chocolate chip pancakes had craters where the bananas must have fallen out or stuck to the pan. FAIL.S: Sit in the chairs and not the bench against the wall if you have short legs. T: Tasty beverages. I will give them that.A: Awesome cucumber water. Nice touch Rachel's.R: Ridiculously loud music. Did I say that already?S: Sit outside when the weather permits so you will have more space and won't be sitting close enough to strangers to scope their chunky earwax. Even though I feel they are VERY three stars I will absolutely be back several times because shopping makes this hippo hungry.This is going to be my number one place to eat a healthy and wholesome breakfast in Henderson, NV,Rachel Kitchen is in The District which is a shopping center,there was a lot of work going on in the area,so it was like a maze getting her kitchen,you know you are there by the cute patio in front of the building,the place is not that large but a nice size to enjoy your meal,the staff was very friendly and helpful with our order,I had the french toast,with fruits and a side order of turkey becon and a cup of O/J,wife had pancakes with fruits,becon and a cup of watermelon juice,she said it was soooo good,the decor is pretty cool,there is one TV on the wall,I think there may be two restroom here,but I used the one of the left which the sign says male/ female only a stool ( so mens don't for get to lift and lower the lid) Oh they also have gluten free food,cleansing juice,protein and smoothies,burgers,warps,pasta,and salads,definitely recommend.I've been to Rachel's Kitchen twice and both times were very enjoyable. The first time I had the cobb Salad (several months ago, back when gluten and dairy were part of my diet) It was delicious. I ate it out on the patio and enjoyed the nice April weather. I ate here for a second time this weekend. I ordered the Angel Hair Bolognese with gluten free pasta. It is a homemade meat (beef only) sauce. It was really quite good. I also ordered the Malbec. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place offered wine. This time I sat at a table in the back and I was happy to find that they had a outlet near my table, excellent for charging my always dead phone. So far both times I've come in alone... I think next time I'll bring my tablet and catch up on my book, rather than sit on FB/Yelp the whole time. ha.I wish they had a few more gluten + dairy free choices... but I'm sure I'll be back soon.Located inside the District at Green Valley Ranch.. Rachel's Kitchen has never disappointed me!Small, up-to-date, cute restaurant. Friendly staff and good service!They have breakfast and lunch items to choose from! Wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc. My favorite items have to be their pastas -- either Signature or Garden Pasta, substituted with their gluten-free quinoa pasta! Very tasty, healthy food!Suggested for your reps to bring this in the office for lunch meetings and such!My review of Rachel's Kitchen in the District is long over due.  I have enjoyed many a meal people watching at this location!  When the weather is nice, it is a fantastic casual place to dine al fresco.  They serve breakfast all day, which I love, and have beer & wine.  I was worried that when the District added parking on the interior road, it would make dining outside less enjoyable but I have not found that to be an issue or bother at all.On this visit to Rachel's, we started by sharing the yogurt parfait, which comes with fresh berries and their delicious housemade granola.  This vanilla yogurt parfait has the perfect mix of salty and sweet with a great crunch.Then I got the scrambled eggs w/ tomatoes & basil meal.  This comes with toast and breakfast potatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and the tomatoes & basil were fresh and light.  I ate a couple potatoes, which were good, but I was already full from the parfait!The BF got the sautéed mushroom cheeseburger.  He said it was fantastic, but since I hate mushrooms and swiss, I will have to take his word for it.
NYPD Pizza=If you are looking for good pizza at a low price and not the cheap little ceasars type ingredients and flavor then this is the place for you! NYPD serves great pizza with just the right amount of seasoning , cheese and sauce . My experience here was average . I was here on a date we ordered pizza and wings. The pizza was fast and hot and delicious . The waiter was polite and courteous for everything. Te wings however did not come on time . We had to wait and eventually ask the waiter where they were. Me and my date ate our fair share of pizza in saving for the wings. Im guessing the staff dis not take me serious since i was only 16. , they believe teens dont deserve the se respect and priority as adults. After expressing my thoughts to the waiter and stating the manager will hear about this and that i wouldnt pay for the wings if it took any longer they took me a little more seriously and the wings came 5-10 minutes afterwards . That service took it away from 5 to 3 stars!
Munchbar=HOT DOG - HOT DOG - HOT DOGNaughty treats for drunken souls! This may not be the best place to go if you're a girl that doesn't want to see your man (or woman) looking at other girls dancing in scantily clad clothing 15 feet away from you. Directly in front of the Pussycat Dolls Casino, MunchBar's greasy, all-American menu sounded great at midnight. We were buzzed and craving some serious naughty food. The fiance ordered the wings (honey and spicy) and I ordered the hot dog w/ pretzel bun & criss cut chili fries!OMG did that hit the spot! It was soo good. He's a wings aficionado and raved about the wings. They were fantastic. The spicy wings were more on the spicy/vinegary side and not gross and buttery. They were meaty and very crispy. The hot dog came out perfectly grilled on a warm and squishy pretzel bun. This wasn't some $1 after hours hot dog. This was a real treat. When my hot dogs are delightful, I like to dress them up with the honor they deserve: mayo, ketchup, pepper and mustard. My baby got the works and it was among the best hot dogs I've eaten. The chili fries were very good, but frankly, I was transfixed by the glorious hot dog to notice the nuances of the fries and the chili to cheese ratio. Service was fine. The view of the dancers and other female diners evil-eying their boyfriends all added to a glorious night of hogging out. I carbed out and it was totally, utterly worth it.When you only have a 45-minute poker tournament dinner break and won't be allowed into Mesa with your jeans, hat, and poker shades, then Munchbar presents itself as the only option. Located right next to the Poker Room at Caesar's, Munchbar is a small, open burger joint with some tables and a half dozen stools at the bar. The menu items are scribbled in chalk-like print all over the two enclosing walls, so you have something to look at while waiting for your grub.I ordered the Turkey Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wyPkRQg3F5Yz2WqRFax7-g?select=ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA#ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA) with mushroom stuffing, cranberries, and herb mayo. The turkey patty was pretty juicy and I liked the cranberry and herb mayo combo. The fries, however, were absolutely horrible. They were mushy and tasted stale like they had been hanging out in the fryer basket for a couple of hours. I'm sorry, but a burger joint should know that it is important to change the fryer oil on a regular basis so you don't end up with mushy, rancid fries. They won't get crispy in old oil! Also, fries should be made fresh to order - they only take a few minutes (way less time than my turkey burger patty takes to cook through). My boyfriend had the Bleu Cheese Burger with applewood smoked bacon and mushrooms. He also enjoyed his burger, but pushed the fries aside after trying one. This seemed to be a pattern with all the other patrons at this place. I almost laughed out loud when the bartender asked me if I wanted to take the fries to go. I would have sent the fries back for new ones or at least explained to our bartender that they were horrible had I had more time, but I was on a ticking clock. Not a big fan of having to wait 5 minutes to get my card swiped when it is laying right there on the bar while the two bartenders are cracking jokes with what seemed to be the manager of the place. Go here if you're on a budget, or have no time, or are not going to get anything that comes with fries and you'll have an average experience. I really wanted this place to be better. Shame.
The Duce=The Duce is an interesting space with big ambitions. I'd happily visit again and again with a group of friends, but it's out of the way enough I don't see myself seeking it out on my own. There's a ton of potential for the space. If someone's involved that can put together events that make good use, Phoenix may have a new hot spot.There are so many things going on here I'm going to have to break it up to tackle it.- The building (five stars)It's a cool repurposed warehouse. Lots of intentionally retro touches. The different areas flow into each other. There is the food area, which is open air because the roof burned down a few years ago and they decided to keep it that way that serves food out of a 60s travel trailer, the bar that was transplanted from a rat pack era Chicago jazz club, and the retail area which has vintage clothing, novelties, will have produce, and houses the gym, an area with stadium benches and an LCD projector, the coffee shop, and the soda shop. I wonder how they plan to keep an open food area tolerable once the heat of summer sets in.- The food (three stars, four if the prices were better)There's a brunch menu, a selection of sliders, salads, a hot dog stand, a couple dinner items, and some deserts. They're obviously going for fun and casual. I had $8 meatball sliders and liked them, the bread was good, and the tomato sauce tasted savory and homemade. The price seems a little high to consider eating them for lunch though. I discounted the hot dogs this visit, but thinking about it, I'm kicking myself for not seeing if they offer a real chicago style loaded dog, because Chicago street food staples should be the focus of the food here. I actually wish the experience was a little more "street food."- The drinks (same as the food)They have a selection of $4 beers, fruit juices, and several cocktails served in jars. I had a spiked lemonade, and enjoyed it, though I hate paying $11 for any drink. It had decent lemon flavor and came with berries in it. If you're with a group they have a large size for almost double the price that gave two of the people I was with two glasses each. Seems like a better deal, but they way they talked their drinks had to have been more watered down (from melted ice) than mine was. They really need to offer (reverse) happy hour specials.- The coffee (four stars)I don't know where the beans are sourced or roasted, I should have asked. But the prices were great, $1.90 for bottomless drip, I had a decent mocha for under $3. The coffee shop has a walk up window facing the street, which I thought was a nice touch. - The retail (two stars)Not everything was done / operational in this area during my visit. As far as the what I did see, it was mostly novelty. I'm too cheap to pay over $50 for any item of vintage clothing. My friend found a neat bartender's cup with tools and cocktail recipes for $12. The gym is $5 per use, but seems like more of a novelty than even the clothes.If you go by what Mayor Gordon and the owner Steve Rosenstein said tonight after their Chicago lovefest, I witnessed the rebirth of an old downtown scene by attending The Duce's opening night. They talked about a scene called the deuce, based in an area along Second Street that used to be a vibrant part of Phoenix. The vision is to bring that back to Phoenix by renovating the old produce warehouse district. The Duce™ (get the double reference now) is intended to be the seed of big change in the area. Time will tell if I witnessed history in the making, I certainly hope so, but I'm already seeing the typical backtalk about the owners and food (some of which I don't necessarily disagree with). Ryan C says this place is just cashing in on projected nostalgia. It's way too soon for me to be able to make that call.Wow, this is a tough one. I first heard of this spot a few weeks ago and have been dying to try it.Today I decided to take my Mom out for breakfast and we hit The Duce. Getting there early, we had the place to ourselves. As others have mentioned, there is a LOT going on here, it can be a bit tricky to navigate/comprehend what all is going on, but it's very well done.The Duce is housed in a beautiful old warehouse in downtown, and if you loathe strip malls like I do, you'll find The Duce a welcome change. Concrete floors, old brick, reclaimed wood, it's great.We were warmly greeted by a friendly woman who explained how things worked and gave us the lay of the land. The staff member told us about the great food and told us to either order at the bar or trailer.  We wandered around, taking it all in and then went to the food service/bar area of the business.Because we were having drinks with breakfast, we decided to order at the bar. After waiting seven minutes to get someone to come over, an angry looking guy ambled over (picture a chubby Amish guy with terrible prison quality tats)I say hello to the .bartender and tell him we wanted to order breakfast. He grunts, looks displeased and says that we're supposed to order at the trailer. I inform him that we were told we can order here, and since we want drinks we decided to take care of it all at the bar. Speaking of booze, I ordered two bloody mary's. The bartender made a face that would have made sense if I asked him for a kidney. He looked under the bar and said he would only be able to make ONE bloody mary. Keep in mind we are the FIRST customers on a Sunday morning. I was truly puzzled that they could not have the basic ingredients for a breakfast drink staple, much like how it would be if In-N-Out ran out of hamburger.I pay for our stuff and he mumbles something that could be Mandarin, or Pig Latin, I was unsure. I asked him to repeat himself and he was able to use his words and tell me to listen for my name to be called  when our food was ready. We found a seat and my Mom was asking what the guy's problem was, and I told her I wondered the same thing. Fellow Yelpers, please know- I am a really laid back guy, I don't get stressed, and can tolerate a lot! That ends when you're treating my Mom poorly, that is NOT okay, especially when we passed over 100 different breakfast spots just to try out The Duce( Matt's Big Breakfast anyone?).Moving on, sorry this is sooo long, but it was so shocking how shitty the service was, really! The place was really cool, the food was pretty good, and the other employee was SO sweet, but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender. He truly was a turd. Yikes.I will be giving this place another shot, and hopefully they find the bartender a personality transplant and/or the right combination of meds so he no longer a prick. If not, they will need to change the name of the place from The Duce, to The Douche.godi really really don't know what to give the duceas i am writing this spiel im still considering...okay okaypros and conseasy way to make up my mindpro:-favorite old timey domestic beers available for $3 a pop-great food-awesome concept-a real playground for adultscons:-bermuda triangle/wormhole/vortex/blackhole telephone booth-trying to be everything at oncewell despite being trapped in their vintage phone booth, abandoned by my carefree and ambivalent yelp friends and rescued by two chuckling meat head types who proceeded to deride my foolishness at getting locked inside a confined space and then panicking like a lost child separated from his overbearing jewish mother in a crowded wal-mart shopping center, i still happen to think that the pro's vastly outweigh any con you could dream up for the Duce. and ya know whatboom5 stars.ok. man. i'm on yelp pretty frequently, and although i usually just opt for posting photos of restaurants and their food instead of actually writing reviews, my experience of the duce just has to be told. so it's your average sunday. the weather outside was perfect and i wanted to get out and try something new for lunch and possibly get some day drinking in.  after looking over a few places downtown on yelp, the dude and i settled on the duce.  WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, MISTAKE. now don't get me wrong, i knew that the duce was going to be in an old warehouse downtown that someone had turned into a restaurant.  in fact, that's what drew me in in the first place.  that and the menu sounded like they had some choice lunch items. meatball sliders? yeah man, let's do this.  that and in addition to the restaurant, they also sell clothing and other accessories. it was all sounding pretty good. when we first entered the warehouse, we were in the area that sold clothing and other knick-knacks.  because the place is pretty huge, we weren't exactly sure where the restaurant was, and were hoping one of the MANY employees who were standing around might steer us in the correct direction. but no, not a single word from anyone. ok fine, whatever. so we locate the restaurant portion of the warehouse, and see many long bench style tables, a bar, and an outside portion with more seating.  we spot the bartender and say hello as we're walking up, hoping that she'll inform us of how this all works (do we just sit wherever and have a waiter take our order? do we order at the bar? etc.). the bartender shoots back a quick hello and then immediately begins to chat it up with another waitress, completely ignoring that we're even there. ooook, i guess we're just supposed to figure this out ourselves!  we see that they've got their menu posted on the wall, so we begin looking at it, trying to figure out what we're going to order since we're assuming at this point that we just order at the bar.  after deciding on what we wanted, we stood around for literally another five minutes while the bartender and the waitress continued to chat and totally ignore us while we were just standing around clearly looking confused. oh, and did i mention we're THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE? eventually we became so annoyed with this that we decided to go outside and have a seat at one of the tables hoping that would get the attention of someone.  so we have a seat and anticipate that maybe one of the ten or so people outside who clearly worked there would maybe attempt to help us or even acknowledge our presence at some point, but again, no! literally no one said anything to us! after a few minutes of discussing how severely uncomfortable this was and whether or not we should just leave, the bartender comes rushing out and says, "so did you guys want to order or what?".  uh, ok! whatever! let's order now that you've decided we exist!  she then tells us that we're going to have to actually get up and come back inside to the bar to order, and that they'll call our name when the food is ready.  the hell? you can't take our order here since we're already seated and were too busy having some chit-chat time when we were standing inside trying to order before? screw. this. place.  and i haven't even tried the food yet.  oh, and you would also assume that since we ordered the food at the bar, we would pick it up at the bar as well, but again, no. you pick it up at the trailer that's parked outside where they're cooking it.  and yanno, this would have been fine had the bartender taken five seconds to actually mention this. so the food was surprisingly quite good (shocking!), but honestly, who even cares at this point.  i was so angry at how annoyingly awful this experience was that it just didn't matter to me how the food tasted, and i really just wanted to get the hell out of there.  upon leaving, no one said goodbye to us or even acknowledged that we were exiting, but i was pretty much expecting that.  and just in case you forgot,  can i say again how we were THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE?  the concept of the duce may be a good one, but with such extremely rude employees that can't take five seconds to tell you how the restaurant works (oh hey! you order at the bar, we'll call you're name, you pick up the food at the trailer!) or even acknowledge that they have customers, i really can't understand how this place is going to survive.  i honestly do hate to be hard on a local restaurant, and wish i could say that maybe this could have been an isolated incident, but based on a lot of the other reviews, i can see that it's not. so in summary: i would never, ever, under any circumstance, go here again. this was truly the worst restaurant experience i've had in...uh, ever.The Duce is a disaster. As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.01/20/11A group of girlfriends and I met here for happy hour and really enjoyed ourselves!  I arrived first and so was able to secure a parking spot right at the entrance of the venue.  The shopping area of this establishment was an eclectic mix of "vintage" and contemporary items ranging from leather jackets that sell by the pound and tree-hugger organic tees to hand-painted glasses and nostalgic candies in old-fashioned wrappers.  There's even a boxing rink for those who suddenly feel the itch to go a few rounds!  (Back to those vintage jackets- I took this to mean that every jacket was weighed and charged a fixed price per pound, but this wasn't so... Each jacket I tried on had a different dollar amount per pound assigned.  A gimmick that initially piqued my curiosity suddenly made me want to leave the shopping area and just head over to the restaurant and check out the drink and food offerings.)  The indoor dining area was set up for community-style dining, w/ long rectangular tables and high benches.  Outdoors, there were picnic tables and chairs on one side and a silver streamliner at the other where all food orders are placed, w/ people lining up to order, pay, and then retrieve their orders when called.  Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside, but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends, a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't, away from cigarette smoke and the cold air...Two of the three girlfriends had arrived before the 6p HH cut-off, but one, Linda, had to take a call, and she was therefore left out of the "duce off" each drink deal.  This was the first time I ever had a grasshopper (cremes de menthe and cacao and cream over ice), and I enjoyed it very much!  So much, I bought my own supplies  to make my own version a few days later!  The friend who was not given the discount had originally wanted a light beer (@ 5:50p), but was told none were offered here.  We all liked our selections and agreed that we'd very much like to meet again for HH.One of us is allergic to gluten (no, not me!) AND a vegetarian, so after she had asked HER set of questions, she ordered the omelet skillet, first w/ ingredients that the kitchen was out of (asparagus?), so she settled w/ mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.  She enjoyed the dish, and stated that the veggies were very fresh!  I had the Brisket sliders and an order of house-made potato crisps, which I was told were coated w/ EVOO and baked, not fried (the streamliner kitchen was not equipped w/ a fryer).  I found the chips to be too greasy and overcooked (see photos), but my gluten-free vegetarian friend found them addictive!  I liked the brisket sliders ("the best you've ever tasted," said a co-owner) at the restaurant, although I did find some of the meat tough to chew so I put those aside, but found the leftovers fatty and sinewy- a chore to chew- the next day.  Not worth ordering again.  Linda decided to order dessert to share- the baked cinnamon-pecan French toast.  This sweet looked so enticing that I finally broke down and tried it, even though I have a pecan allergy.  I ate the caramelized toast pieces around the nuts (which doesn't prevent an allergic response since the oil is baked throughout the dessert) and found THIS delight addictive!  I hope the kitchen comes up w/ other versions that use other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, even hazelnuts...Those of us that sampled the food agreed that while we may not be in a hurry to come back for a meal, us meeting here for happy hour is certainly not out of the question!This is a long one but I think you will get some good info....I hope. I had a blast at the Duce on Saturday night. However I don't think the Duce had anything to do with it. I was there to see super happy fun time burlesque show. It was amazing! The only reason the Duce received 3 stars instead of 2 is because they allowed this show to go on. Lets start from the beginning. Parking - Free valet - Awe-some! I had read past reviews that said parking was an issue. I am not sure if the free valet is for show nights only or if it's just a fix based on past reviews. Either way it's good work!Entering the Duce- It is pretty cool to walk into the outside. You really can not tell you are still outside unless you look up. The decor is old school and I love it. You order your food in the first leg of the Duce race. It's a little streamline trailer that cooks the food. When we arrived we stood in quite a line. Everyone coming in or leaving were bumping into you in line because the douchy scottsdale people decided they would stand and fist bump each other right in the middle of the isle way. I really felt like I was in Scottsdale for a minute. I mean they had tons of seating in that area that wasn't in the direct path of EVERYONE. I guess they wouldn't have been noticed as much though. Uhhh this is why I stick to Phoenix. They shouldn't be allowed in our hood! ;)Food - We ordered our food and it suuuuuucked. We got the brisket sliders and the sweet potato chips. They put brown sugar on the sweet potato chips! They need salt to balance them....not more sugar. The sliders had a sauce that was not pleasant at all...even my partner in crime did not like them and he eats anything. * read below about the horrible employee who takes your food order. Saving Grace- Pudding Cake with banana, walnuts and whipped cream on top. Oh my .... it was one of the best deserts I have ever had. It wasn't too sweet but just the right yum a yum yum. That same partner in crime is not a fan of sweets but he helped me with it. I was bummed because I wanted to try the baked apple pancake but they said they didn't have it. So I got the pudding cake and I am happy I did. Next you enter the bar area. It's your typical bar area with an old B of a bartender. Thank goodness I got the nice guy. I was able to order my drinks really quick even though the place was pretty crowded. I decided to try something different and went with a Moscow Mule. It was really good! They do not skimp on the alcohol which is fantastic for all involved. They are all made in super cute mason jars and garnished to eye catching perfection. They also use a lot of fresh fruit etc. Awesome! One of the best I have experienced. Then you move into the boxing ring/ store area. They have vintage military items and old girly trinkets. It's very cool. They didn't have any of the lights on to buy anything which I thought was crazy. I would have spent a ton but oh well. Then the show went on in the boxing ring. The show was awesome!Later on in the night I wanted a strawberry lemonade so I went to where we ordered our food because that is where you get the fresh lemonade. The same two people were there and one had 5 people she was helping at her little mixed drink bar and the other was just standing by the lemonade. So I asked her can I get a drink from you? She said in a nasty tone "not a mixed drink". I said how about a strawberry lemonade? She said NOPE you need to get it from her. I was thinking how weird that was because she was standing by the lemonade and just needed to grab 2 strawberries. But I guess I was interrupting her doing nothing. So I slid back over to the line and the nice lady put 2 strawberries in my cup and that stupid younger girl with the blackish/reddish bob brought over a glass of lemonade! WTF?!? The only reason she did that is because the bartender supervisor/manager guy had come over to check on things. I was so pissed. Lazy! Avoid Her!!!Oh, and I am dying to know why the owner was interrupting the leader of the group at the end of the show. He looked mad so it was either he was mad it ran a bit over or it was too much. I think he was mad it ran late. I mean who wants to make a ton of money and only have to stay open until 12:00am?So to sum it all up - Service terribleFood- TerribleEnvironment - Good Parking - GoodThe Duce is a truly majestic place. If there's a place even remotely like The Duce in Los Angeles, then I need to know about it, RIGHT NOW. Please? Their whole set up is unconventional, which I love. Confusing, but wonderful. I'm rooting on their team for sure. Where else can you watch a guy practice boxing in a real boxing ring, shop for vintage goodies, sit on wooden bleachers your grandparents probably sat on in high school, buy a pie from a pie bar, get a soda pop from a soda bar, order your food from a trailer AND eat an out-of-this-world brunch, all in the same building. That's incomparable folks! Let's talk about their brunch. Fresh squeezed OJ? Divine. Cinnamon pecan french toast? Count me in! A bowl of fresh fruit? You'll never have to ask me twice. But the egg sliders? That's some crazy deliciousness goin' on right there. My sunnies are off to whoever came up with that idea. You did my stomach right and I wish I could shake your hand(s). I'll definitely be hanging out at The Duce when I'm in Phoenix again. Until then, I'll be recommending this place to every. single. person. I. know.I don't even know where to begin with my description of the Duce. I guess I will start with my first impression. I learned about the Duce about a year ago so decided to stop by and check it out. I drove to an industrial area of Downtown Phoenix behind the stadiums and found myself at an old warehouse claiming to be The Duce. I parked in a tiny parking lot and walked through what looked like use to be an old garage door entrance. As I entered, I didn't even know where to begin looking! It's filled with every fun and quirky element around. There are small pods owned by different vendors who sell things like vintage college attire, natural products like soap and lotions, locally made jewelery and yes, even items like vintage beach cruisers. They have a huge vintage boxing ring in the middle along with other antique workout gear that's still able to be used (and it is used!). To the left, they recently brought in the famous Rock Spring Pies! You've GOT to try one if you haven't yet. They melt in your mouth. Especially the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. Then to the right lives a garage-like restaurant with great drink specials, a picnic/backyard atmosphere with a large patio and they host a variety of special events and live music throughout the year. This spot is definitely cool and worth checking out many times over again.The Duce is fuckin' rad.  They make the best screwdriver.  Screwdrivers are typically boring, but I urge you to get one here.  So bomb.  So goddamn bomb.I've been here a few times and I've always had a great time.  Great desserts, great drinks.  Some of the reviews say they got shitty service.  Not I.  I've always had great service.  Ordered a shot one time with my girlfriend, there was a bunch left over and got quite a bit of free booze.Are you kidding me with this place! As a foodie who likes to try new places, I always keep an open mind going in.We went on a Wed night after work.We were never greeted by anyone. I finally got up to ask someone who I thought worked there. You can't tell because everyone that does looks like they just crawled out of bed! I was told that all orders are taken at the bar.So we head to the bar to order a drink and food.We placed order for the fod and waited for 10 minutes for a beer. The one and only person behind the bar was busy mixing two cocktails and had one speed, verrrrrry sllloooow. The only thing he had going for him was his looks.I continue... No one tells us that are food isn't going to be delivered to us from the diner /camper /car in the back. So it sat there for a while and finally someone came and asked if we ordered food, that it was "over there". Again, Are you kidding me? Two of us had meatballs sliders, OK tasting, but cold. One of us had the ribs. OMG, 5 ribs , nothing else came with them, mediocre at best and $14.00! Again, are you kidding me? No one asked us how anything was, picked up plates, nothing! We had no idea if we were to clean up after ourselves or what. We just left everything sitting there , in the rain outside. As far as leaving a tip..to who? and for what? Are you kidding me?I watched the video from the owners on their website. They say they are going for some kind of gritty , Chicago feel. Well I'm from the midwest and have been to Chicago many many times over the years and I can honestly say I have never been in place like this there or anywhere in the miswest! #1 in the midwest , service is key, here , not so much. If your are looking for grungy, no service, uncomfortable go ...if not , stay home, or go somewhere else. If I could have given this place a -10 stars I would have. You have been warned!On a side not: I always wonder if the Owners read the reviews? I would love to hear a response if so.......The Duce was the last stop for my last night of 39 and got their before the midnight hour forced me into the Fab & 40 club. I have never been to The Duce and had been looking forward to going.  As soon as I walked into The Duce, I was awe struck, I absolutely love this place! At the last stop my friends and I were at, I left a lil tipsy and was in need of some food, so when we 1st got to the Duce, 1st item of business that needed taken care of was order some food, after surveying the menu and debating on if I wanted something sweet or not, I went with the cheeseburger sliders.  Let me tell you, these were the best cheeseburger sliders I have had in a very very long time, the bread was soft, tender yet held the sliders together well, the cheese was perfectly melted over the burger, oh it was just delish!The Duce has plenty to offer everyone, corn hole, foosball, Ping-Pong, hula hooping, dancing, singing, drinking or just chilling, The Duce has space for it all!  Only down side I have is that it's hot, but that's the Phoenix summer weather, I am sure when it's no longer summer ticket, The Duce would be rocking! I am looking forward to coming back and playing some games for sure!Stopped in here once just to check it out. I asked the bar tender if he had anything on special. Immediately  he told me to "Get a job". Then he said he can understand some locals coming in and wanting cheap drinks but not someone with an ASU hat and an American Eagle shirt. I apologized to the guy because I didn't mean to come across as being cheap. Blew it off and he got me a drink.Other than that one incident, the place looks pretty fun. Perhaps I just had a stressed out bar tender. However, it's not okay to treat friendly customers that way. I don't plan on going back or recommending this place to anyone.Dinner and dancing, both are top notch. The pie crust is perfect, I had the chicken potpie.  Trust me, anything will taste great in that little pie crust lined mason jar.   My wife had the sliders wrapped in lettuce, between the grilled onions and seasoned beef there is a ton of flavor in those little guys.  On Tuesdays they East Cost Swing and Charleston.  When we were there the crowed was a great mix of 40-60 people of all types and skill levels.  It was a super cool sweaty celebration with more smiling and laughing then a comedy club.  Until you are inside this place is sketchy; the downtown location, parking and the building itself give off a vibe after dark somewhere between urban decay and warehouse district.  The payoff is inside and well worth the adventure.  See you there!
Golden Nugget Buffet=Nothing to write home about. It's your typical low budget buffet. I wasn't expecting to see an elaborate spread so I really didn't have high expectations. I should've lowered my "low" expectation. The reviews are mixed so we must've picked an off day to eat dinner here. Nothing really stood out expect for the pizza alfredo which the pizza guy hand tosses and makes from scratch. Everything else was just blah. The roast beef was dry and tasteless. When the guy served it me, he practically flung it on my plate and looked angry. When I asked for the au jour sauce, he acted like it was inconveniencing him. I was handing him the bowl to put the sauce in but he ignored the bowl, grabbed my plate and dumped the sauce all over my food! Literally. I mean he didn't just put it on the meat, he put it all over my whole plate. Sheesh, who does that? My plate and the rest of my food was drenched. The fried chicken which was now drenched in that sauce was also tasteless. The mashed potatoes were good, not fantastic but good and yes they were drenched in that dumb sauce too. Like I mentioned the pizza alfredo was really good. Even though it was drenched in that stupid sauce, I really liked it. In fact that's all I ate after that.As for deserts. it looked very good but looks can deceive. The pastry guy was putting out new deserts and me being one who likes to talk to anyone (annoying right) told him the deserts looked awesome and asked him if they were made in house. He said they weren't and that they were bought at a store! LOLOLOLOLOLZ! OEM! I would never admit that. I did have a good laugh though. The deserts were dry. Nothing special. Will I go back here? Probably not, oh wait, we did go back for breakfast which was pretty good. You can order your eggs how ever you want them. I ordered over medium and asked for 1 egg but the guy misunderstood me and made two. Not a biggie, but the funny thing is, he kept dumping the eggs and making new ones because he didn't like the way they had turned out. I kept telling him it was ok, but I guess he was a bit of a perfectionist...lol. Gotta love Vegas.No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Absolutely not. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You can't be charging Strip buffet prices for crap food. Well, I mean you CAN do that and the Golden Nugget DOES do that, but you can't expect it to go unnoticed.A dish of "steak" is filled with small cuts of very tough meat that are smothered with a sauce that is actually worse than the crappy gravies Heinz sells in a can.The carving station turkey managed to taste like fish. It's a miracle, because I saw the guy cut the meat off of a turkey carcass. But it didn't taste like turkey.Surely the pasta offerings would be better. Wrong. I think they fill their cheese ravioli with toe jam. It's terrible. Terrible.I have a standing rule: I never rave about a restaurant's mac'n'cheese or mashed potatoes. I believe that those two items are simply impossible to screw up and none is truly as AMAZING as people claim. However, I can honestly report that the Golden Nugget Buffet's mac'n'cheese could very possibly be the worst ever created by human hands. Mushy, awful, chemically-tasting artificial cheesy nastiness. It's truly crap-tastic.Do yourself a favor. Take the $25 per person that you would spend here and bet it all on black at the next roulette table you pass. It's a better value for your money.
China Wok=It si exactly what you would expect for a strip mall Chinese place, except for one thing, the people there are really nice and willing to talk to you about the food or anything really. For example, I noticed that there was a distinct "smoky" flavor to their fried rice. So I was thinking maybe it was the pork they were using, but after talking a while figured out that it was the oil they had. That combined with the 700 degree woks impart a very pleasant smoky aroma and taste to the fried rice.You can dine in (simple seating for about 16 people) or take out or have delivered. The dining room was clean and the restrooms were spotless as well.The prices were good, my wife and I got away for under $15.00 for the lunch special (which include egg-drop soup if you dine in) but the dinner prices were not much more. To me any time the wife and I can get away for under $20.00 for a meal we feel lucky. Heck, two people at McDonald's can easily pay more than $15.00 for a meal.If you are in the neighborhood and want lunch, give it a try.
The Blue Taj=Decided to go this place because it's very close to my house and I was in the mood for Indian food and didn't want to make the trek to Saffron.  OMG!  Most menus at Indian restaurants are the same--you won't find too many varying entrees to choose from, but still, the Paneer Tikka Masala (I think that's the name) was out of this world.  I've gone back a few times since and have nothing but positive things to say about the staff and the restaurant overall.This is a great place to get some solid Indian food at a pretty decent price.
Surang's Thai Kitchen=Oh what a wonderful find this joint was. After my disappointing visit to Benjarong, I gave up my quest for a great Thai restaurant within a 2 mile radius of my neighborhood. But literally a few days later, driving home from work famished, I noticed this unusually placed restaurant with a bright neon red sign as I was driving by. I almost shrugged it off, until I realized I didn't register the word "Thai Kitchen". I immediately crossed two lanes and busted a biznatch. When I went in, there was only a single party of two in the middle of their dinner. I took a peek and the food looked and smelled good. The waitress/host quickly and cheerfully greeted me and provided me with a menu after I told her I was taking-out. She was very genuine and even asked me if I needed anything to drink while I was waiting. Got home. W-o-w. I haven't had such a fine tasting Styrofoam-plated meal in my life. Everything I ordered (Which I'll list below, because I've been to this place about 5-6 times after my initial visit) was piping hot, vibrantly flavorful and most importantly, satisfyingly spicy. Which, on second thought, might be sweat-inducing for most other people. I usually get a 10.. hey, I was raised on Kimchi and Sriracha sauce.Must-haves: Beef Pad Kapow (Spicy Basil Dish), Chicken Pad Thai, Pork Pad Kea Mow, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang CurryOverall, this is a "cute" little place, that serves excellent Thai food, amongst the best I've had, at a reasonable price and served with a smile. Only downside that I can even think of is that the restaurant can fit 40 people at best. Dare I say it, when it comes strictly to the food alone, Surang is giving Archi a serious run for his money.I ended up at brunch and then spent the day with a few Yelpers until it was dinner time so we settled on grabbing something closeby. Anthony M, David S. and I did family style. Chicken tom yum - this was nice since it was cold outside! The base tamarind, lemongrass and keffir was bold which I appreciated. I don't like mild tom yums so this was happy indeed. Crispy pancake w/ mussels - I've never had a Thai pancake but love all forms of savory. The batter that holds it is chewy in like a mochi like texture and the outside is crispy and eggy. It's served with a sweet and sour type sauce which was good with it. Country curry with tofu - I've never had country curry and neither did they so we figured why not? It wasn't like any curry with sauce, it was a broth. It was plentiful with veggies and tofu but this dish wasn't memorable at all. We also already have a soup and it felt like we had two and this curry broth/sauce wasn't very strong at all. Pass on this. Crispy pork - oh noms! I love crispy pork and the garlicky sauce is great with it and zucchini slices. It's thin sliced and then fried so all the surface is crispy. It's great for fans of crispy pata, chicaron, or any other crispy pork bits. I like a tiny bit with vinegared chilis which kicks it up for me. Service was quiet, but decent and filled out waters and our hot tea. It's pretty obvious I love Thai food and am not normally in this area, but have been meaning to try it. I think it's rather solid and would say to give it a try.(Yelp 100 Challenge 21/100)
Lenny's Burger=This might be the biggest bang for your buck in the entire valley. Lenny's serves up good old fashioned burgers, shakes, and fries... The decor is cute-over-the-top 50's and it just works just fine - Well done you guys! They even have a drive-thru!*Again, I am astonished that reviewers would give this little family-run joint such a hard time - one star??? A freaking McDonald's in Iran doesn't deserve that. How would you rate the What-a-burger down the street?  Huh? Seriously, save the one-star reviews for food poisoning you drama queens. (I'm mostly kidding - no death threats this time)
Cuisine Szechuan=I love szechuan food. This place is very good for that. I can't quite remember what I had ordered because I only read the chinese name for it. I believe it was preserved pork with vegetables and rice. IT was pretty salty - but you're suppose to combine the flavors with the side dishes (rice and vegetables). Overall, it's flavors are indeed: authentic. I wished I had ordered something more spicy - but my friend had a sore throat. Next time for sure though! I only come during the winter though - because eating here gives me that cozy feeling of being surrounded in spicy aroma (if that makes sense). You don't need to wait for long either. Customer service is decent - but I didn't expect something extremely fancy or anything considering the decor.
The Lunch Box=Comedian Daniel Tosh once commented that people say money can't buy happiness...do you live in America?  Cause it buys you a waverunner...have you ever seen someone frowning on a waverunner? Seriously have you? Seriously...have you? Seriously.............have you?  I would say the same in regards to trying not to smile upon biting into the Belgian waffle ice cream sandwich at The Lunch BoxCan't comment on their international themed hot dogs just yet, since I was tweaking-out like a cocaine addict coming down from a bad high for this delectable treat.  Probably the only thing you will need to *waffle* over is in regards to which ice cream you want in your sandwich and whether you can handle the full (3.99) or the half order (2.50).  Being my first time, I went with mint chocolate chip and got the half order sandwich, which I promptly inhaled within a few minutes.  Your tongue will be delightfully confused by the interplay of hot and cold, crispy and creamy, crunchy and smooth.  It's safe to say the entire Bluth family (Arrested Development) would have a love affair with this ice cream sandwich....taste the happy for less than 5 bucks!2012 WSOP Day 30I arrive at the Rio; crumbs everywhere, drops of melted ice cream on what was my last clean t-shirt and jeans, a napkin stuck to my hand, and a huge smile on my face.It's all thanks to a fresh, lightly sweetened, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside,  chocolate chip waffle sandwiching ice cream.  So simple.  So seriously good.    To all the ice cream snobs, this is not gourmet ice cream or frozen custard.  There are no organic fruit toppings, jams, or sauces.  Don't mess with perfection.The lunchbox also serves authentic Chi town dogs and an excellent Milwaukee style brat.  Other types of meat in a tube and out there topping combinations complete the menu.Check their FB or Twitter feed for unexpected closures.Just one of those little unexpected pleasures.
Sambalatte Torrefazione=Sambalatte has become one of our favorite hang-out spots.  It's a large open space with plenty of tables, chairs, outlets for laptops, magazines, books, and board games.  There's also a small second story- loft style- with a tv and more seating.  When we were there, twice now, the background music was nice and upbeat- very W-hotel-esque. It's located in the back of Boca Park area, in the same plaza as Cheesecake Factory and Gordon Biersh, where it's a perfect area for just hanging out and people watching. The coffee and espressos are delicious.  The coffee is individually brewed and the latte/cappuccinos have designs in the foam.  Definitely a nice touch by the owners and staff.   They also have gelato, teas, sandwiches and an assortment of desserts and morning pastries.I would love to see them close a little later on the weekends because it'd be a nice place to get dessert after dinner.This is it. Ive been to many coffee shops around my neighborhood here in Summerlin, but allow me to say how so overwhelmed I am by the beauty of this place. Not just the looks but the culture and vibe.  This is by far the chillest and abundant place to catch up with a friend, read a paper in the corner, play board games with your nieces, or even study alone or with a group. Aesthetics of this place brings me at peace and drown in my relaxed thoughts. No bad vibes.The 2nd story has a big table, and small  love seats to hangout. The wall of shelves the holds an eclectic collection from books, to references, to magazines, and board games bring this distinguished old english architectural design. Theres a big flat screen that allows us to watch current events. Picture frames of a coffee motif bring warmth. And the lights that accentuates the place, makes this place overall breathtaking.Just one less star. This one star was my one true disappointment. Trust me I have been to many coffee joints, I always order a chai tea latte as I like to compare. Of course Sambalatte focus' on coffee. But they serve tea here but can't deliver it in latte form. Really heartbroken. But then I tried the caramel latte along with a chocolate coffee cake. Presentation is sweet and simple. But when I tried the latte, it was a little disappointing. Being a coffee connoisseur, I like my espresso strong with a hint of sweetness. It was weaker than brittle. the milk tasted watered down. Yikes.  hopefully it tastes better next time, as i will be back.P.s. Hopefully the business starts to incline so we can have this place open a little later. 10pm is standard. But sometimes people need late night study caves.A while back, I was living in SLC, UT for 6 years. I slowly became a coffee drinker since the winter in SLC was pretty long and chilly :) I was introduced to this great coffee shop called, 'Salt Lake Roasting Co.' which is located in downtown area. I loved this place because of their cozy atmosphere and the great taste of coffee. I am very happy to find out that Sambalatte is opened in town :)   My favorite aspect of Sambalatte is the atmosphere!!  Just like the one(SLRC) in SLC...The downstairs is a little bit bigger than the upstairs area (loft style, big wooden table with a plenty of comfy chairs & sofas, board games, books, magazines, & new papers are available to use). There are various sizes of tables you can set up on free wi-fi as well, awesome!! If you are a espresso drinker, I recommend a 'Affogato with Vanilla Gelato'-it's simply put, a shot of espresso with a scoop of your choice of gelato in it.  I usually get a regular coffee(Sumatra) and it is divine! When I order my coffee, the barista pours water over the coffee bean grounds, stirring them, and pouring the water (A hand drip coffee, yay :P)  But more importantly, the service was out of this world. All the staff were friendly, nice, and helpful. They also provide you a drink card (ask a barista before you pay). It is a great local coffee option if you want to do your work or hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  You don't get hassled or interrupted.Maybe they read their yelp reviews, because my service here was great.  After ordering the pear tree green tea, the clerk asked me to wait right there and the barista would bring it to the counter.   When I ordered an apple tart and a choco-cappuccino (c'mon, I was there for 3 hrs), a server brought everything up to our seats on the second floor....quickly.  No questions.   Thanks yelpers!  As others have said, great ambiance but could use more seating.  And bigger little tables.  I sat in fear of an overturned French press for the better part of an hour.   Excellent friendly clerk who answered questions warmly and recommended teas to our party.  Bonus points for the flatscreen, book collection and table games on the second floor.  Just wish I lived closer to Boca....GUESS WHO'S BACK! =DWHERE: Charleston & Rampart, inside the Boca Park area (right next to Kona Grill).WHEN: Sunday through Tuesday from 7am-8pm, Wednesday through Thursday from 7am-9pm, Saturday from 7am-10pmWHY: To drink tea/coffee, eat super yummy sweets, and most importantly... socialize and finally catch up with some of your friends that you haven't seen- just to have some sort of excuse to get up and go.! =)WHAT: Thank goodness for good past reviews and recommendations through word-of-mouth! If it weren't for those two, I wouldn't have stepped foot in such an amazing cafe! It reminds me of a cafe I went to in New York. The atmosphere is calming, you can even enjoy, plop down, and read a book while chewing on something yummy or drinking something caffeinated.I personally have this somewhat new addiction for macarons. So, that was my purpose when walking through the door. I noticed they had about 13 different flavors! My eyes lit up due to excitement! The macarons aren't as big though, they're bite size and almost 2 bucks for one, but you might as well "seize the day" and order all the flavors (which is exactly what I did)! haha, and from doing it I now know my favorites! Yes, I know you're waiting for it... so the "must-tries" have got to be: pistachio, mango, paradise, caramel, raspberry... ok, most all of them were really good! But those are some of my favorites. =DAside from the macaroons, I tried the carrot cake parfaitI It was a different way to prepare a carrot cake indeed, and the uniqueness made it perfect!These are the only things I have got the pleasure of trying so far, but it will be my goal to try everything on their menu! hahaha, which will probably turn into a LIFETIME GOAL on my bucket list. LolTake my recommendation now, and see for yourself! =DLove the great energy here, and a feeling of Europe.  Beautiful pastries and sandwiches.  Oh, and the coffee, fantastic.  Seriously, this has the just the right amount of distraction, perfect for writing the great American novel.  It has lots of outlets for plugging into, and a dozen outdoor tables.This beats a trip to that Bean place, or the Bucks...anyday.Hey Peeps - and they also have afgato (espresso with a scoop of ice cream, vanilla or chocolate).  Love, even more so.PS.  I'm pretty certain it's supposed to be spelled, "Affogato", but perhaps in Portuguese it's different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AffogatoI'm prepared for Yelpers to come to my house with pitchforks and giant logs threatening to tear down my door and have my head, but I'll admit that I was not blown away.I have been aching to try the Nutella latte forevs, and when I did today, it seemed like just a regular latte. Not hazelnutty, not chocolatey, just a latte. Meh. I wanted something so rich and thick that I couldn't guzzle it down, but I guzzled it like I could any other latte, and it was $4.50. Eep! I wanted to get the delicious looking fruit salad, too, but it was $7.75. Double eep! Not a budget-friendly coffee shop.The croissant was, I'll admit, a fairly good imitation of European croissants. However, it, too, was pricey, and not as delicious as I felt it could have been. I love macarons, and I do mean love, but they were also pretty meh. I want a combination of crispy AND chewy in my macarons, not just chewy. It gets major brownie points for the outlets, decor, and cool location. It's on the other side of the world for me, so I'm not sure I'd make a special trip. I'd be willing to give its sandwiches a try, and just stick with regular espresso.I wanted to like you, Sambalatte. Actually I wanted to LOVE YOU...but you just weren't worth the hype.Come on yelpers, you should've helped a girl out! I read many reviews prior to making the drive here. A lot of reviews were saying "good coffee." "omgosh best coffee i ever had!" "sure beats the hell outta starbucks" etc...etc... BUT WHAT DRINK DID YOU ORDER!?!? Besides the Nutella Latte I kept seeing, there wasn't any other drink that stood out in reviews.So what did I end up ordering???? What I normally order at unfamiliar coffee joints. A 12 oz. iced hazlenut latte. I played it safe. Yes, I know. (what else was I supposed to order!? send any suggestions over, please) At almost $5.00 for their SMALL SIZED drink....it was a total letdown. To me, it tasted like a waterdown generic iced hazlenut latte. I've had better lattes than this. =( I also got 3 maccarrons. Again, I read reviews warning that these are small in size. Ugh...these must be the smallest maccarrons I've seen. $1.50 isn't a bad price for these...they're about the same in LA. So with a large java chip iced blended drink for my boyfriend, a small iced hazlenut latte for myself as well as 3 maccarrons ran my bill up to $14.50! Oh lord have mercy. With that price...I could've gone to my one and only Starbucks 4 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There's two sides to Boca Park. You have what I call the Charleston side and Tivoli Village side. That's how I describe a location of a place when I'm meeting someone out here.  The Tivoli side houses the best of the best..REI, Cheesecake Factory, Kona, Embers, and Sambalatte.  You'll find a busy parking lot and even busier establishments. Smack in the middle of these establishments is Sambalatte. You can't miss it. Just look for a bunch of people outside enjoying their company and a cup of joe.Took me awhile for this review for a couple reasons.  First, I've never tried any of their food or treats. And second, I've never took advantage by hanging out long enough. Okay I lied. I once sat in here for about 3 hours while a friend did some shopping. I got tired watching her shop so I found myself at the Starbucks then migrated here.  This place has wifi and wished at the time that I had my iPad or laptop. I kept myself occupied with their iced mocha's, which is a good change from a the hot ones. Their iced drinks are perfect on a hot Las Vegas summer when caffeine is needed. Their mocha's are creamy and doesn't hit you all at once. I love a strong coffee, but not so much a strong tasting one. Their mocha's are exactly this. As for the my other choice, it's the good ol' Americano in the AM or an iced one in the afternoon.  The ambiance actually changes throughout the day and even the week. I'm almost always outside, but also look forward to take advantage of their desks and tables inside.  Service is a bit slow compared to a SB, but that's expected here. Their drinks are served in glasses, not disposable paper cups. This means you're meant to stay and hang out.  Until last night, it's been awhile since my last visit. This visit reminded me to come back.Ahhh Sambalatte where do I begin...This place is great if you enjoy a cliche vegas place trying too hard to be something it is not, trendy/local/hip... Its completely kitschTheir subpar coffee is prepared by uneducated (coffee-wise) and rude employees their latte art is cool but it adds to the already long wait to get some coffee.  #gagI don't frequent coffee establishments...in fact it takes a special place to make we want to go in for a visit.  Sambalatte is just that!  In fact it annoys me now when someone wants to meet somewhere else for coffee.  They are serving quality products here, work with local small businesses and have great customer service.  It is a little trendy, but not terribly pretentious.  The best part is they are carrying She Bakes products now...SO GOOD...they have summoned my taste buds twice in the last week!This place rips off customers! $4 large green tea, yet no refill hot water! Not even I offer to PAY for the hot water! Wanna drink more tea? Sure, buy a new one! I can't believe what I hear... The the so called "large" is about the size of medium than other cafe place around, and almost double in price. Don't waste your money here!PS: their cake is over priced & taste just like sugar...WARNING!! This place is super over priced! Low quality small cake cost $6+None Refillable Hot Tea for $4! You can't even BUY hot water for your tea, but only pay for a new order! lol~ funniest thing I have ever heard! No refill for hot tea? Really?? LMAO!It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup.  "Why is that?" Brenda asked.   "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.) "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.This location is a perfect spot to get work done. 1. There is a lot of space. 2. It's not too loud where you can't concentrate on work. 3. The staff is extremely friendly. 4. Bomb.com drinks!Currently, I am obsessed with their Iced chai latte. It reminds me of Christmas...but in the summer time. Sounds crazy, but Sambalatte has me returning every morning for the past week.I order this with almond milk and 2 shots...so it's actually an extra dirty almond chai latte. Opera cake is also amazing!!! Not too sweet and just enough to satiate that chocolate craving.In true, English Major/nerd fashion, I've taken it upon myself to start a book club, and I was searching for places to hold it.  Someone recommended Sambalatte to me, and I was hesitant...I had a less than great experience at another location, and felt that they were a little pricey for the quality.Well. This location was very different.  First of all they were PACKED, inside, outside and upstairs.  Luckily, it was only going to be me, my fella, and one other reader, so I found a cozy spot upstairs, got settled, and then went down for a drink.I ordered a chocolate cappuccino, and 2 almond macaroons.  It was about $7 with tax...still a little pricey, but when I got upstairs and took a sip and a bite, I was happy. The cappuccino had a great flavor, and while they could have mixed the chocolate a tiny bit better, I was really pleased.  The macaroons were light, airy, and amazing.  Fella got a ginger peach hot tea.  He enjoyed it, but the girl did not give him enough tea leaves in the press of hot water...it was REALLY weak.  Next time, we will have to be more vocal about needing more leaves, as he mentioned it, but was ignored.My service was friendly.  Fella's not so much, but I'll let him write his own review.The kid who rang me up was friendly, and curious about the book club.  I enjoyed my stay. They had a musician playing the lap steel guitar, which was awesome.  I will definitely come back.Chic coffee house that's great for getaways!This place is ultra cute. It has a little nook area upstairs and its the perfect spot to come for some quiet time or catching up with friends. They have a wide selection of drinks, coffee or teas and a lot of beautiful & delicious pastries. Indoor & outdoor seating is available and the little area upstairs is perfect for catching up on some work. Outdoor seating offers great views of Boca Park and is conveniently next to some great boutiques and restaurants.If you're a fan of Nutella I highly recommend the Nutella latte! The chocolate & hazelnut flavors are captured so well! I will be back for the hot stuff once we cool down...
Chick-fil-A=-Fast service! Drive-thru line moves quickly.-Consistantly friendly service.-Delicious for being fast food! The quality is way better than Taco Bell or McDonald's.-Dipping sauces are surprisingly very good for being fast food.-Love the cole slaw and the waffle fries!-This is located in the Lowe's Shopping Center at the SW CORNER of Dysart & McDowell. CLOSED on SUNDAYS.
Cabo Mexican Restaurant=We ordered the Cabo appetizer platter and taco salad. The food was very good and service was okay. The only issue I had was the wait to be seated. They had empty tables that were not open on a Friday night. They seemed to be shorthanded.I like Cabo but since they aren't consistent between the Station Casinos they are hit and miss. They were not busy and service was good. The decor is different depending on the Cabo you are at and I did like the blue lights they have at this one. Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to us. The chips and bean dip were decent but the salsa needs a lot of work. I always like to start with the "Con Queso Dip".  At this Cabo it is priced at $5.99 and was delicious. For my meal I ordered "Cheese Enchiladas" made with flour tortillas. I asked for very light sauce and when my meal was brought out the enchiladas were covered in sauce. I mentioned it to the server who said she told them to put very little. She then walked away and I figured I would see if I liked what was brought. Well, I didn't. The sauce tastes like it maybe comes from a can and is just nasty. The server must have seen I wasn't eating it I don't know but she brought me 2 more enchiladas with light sauce. I did appreciate the gesture. The food is just A-OK and nothing spectacular.  The rice is kinda dry. Hubby had "Beef Fajitas" and said they were good. There is a happy hour if you sit in the bar. They have tv's. Currently they don't open until 4 pm daily. With your players card they sometimes have monthly meal promotions.Came here with a group on a Friday night before our dinner reservation- the bar is rimmed with cocktail tables for couples or those grabbing a light bite. We were provided complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, and drinks came out quickly. Unfortunately, our server was a total Debbie Downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn't intend to order a full meal. Our waters stayed empty, a bill was slapped on our table, and she repeatedly walked by and said "thanks for coming" as if to shoo us out early. Considering we each bought $10+ margaritas (the mango-jalapeno is tasty!) and tipped well, her attitude was totally unwarranted.
Binion's Cafe=After many attempts to issue a complaint about the horrible service we received I have officially given up reaching Doug the Cafe Supervisor. They just don't care or give a shit is how I take it so Binion's Cafe can piss off!Alright so we were downtown Fremont enjoying a fun date night out and happened to smell the burgers a sizzling over at Binion's cafe. We were hungry and  remembered the yummy burger we had last time. Our service and experience from the previous visit was horrendous and we decided to give the Cafe another shot! We decided to stroll through and check out the wait and to our surprise there was no line and plenty of open seats.We grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by the main cook who is Awesome! He took really good care of us all of the way through, kept our drinks filled and even chatted with us for a bit.The burgers were delicious and our tab was low so you can't beat that with a stick!I am pleased to announce our visit was much better this time around so we will be back for burgers!Real food, real conversation, really standard cuisine. This review is long overdue, about a month and a half to be exact. This was my secret spot for peaceful meals and funny conversations after each night of the Life is Beautiful festival. I also parked my car here and would get it validated after each meal, which I'm assuming they will change this for next year. The last day of the festival, parking attendants were getting wise to the real use of their spaces, and trust me it wasn't for the nickel slots. This place is not fancy, not pretty, but it gets the job done. From Thursday to Sunday I was parked at the cafe counter, usually around 1am, ordering everything your fitness trainer yells at you for eating: chicken fried steak, chili cheese dogs, the lumberjack breakfast, chicken fingers, and for good measure some type of fried westernized version of an egg roll. The standard color scheme of each meal usually landing somewhere between gray and brown on the spectrum. Still, I savored each bite like it was my last. Yes, this food is terrible for you, but who wants to order a salad in the wee hours of the morning? The service was good. I ordered food and it promptly came. This no frills style of eating can be enjoyable especially with the right company. I was usually solo when eating here so I would chat with my fellow snackers. Mostly old school gentlemen who would complained about how Vegas has lost it's "class". Apparently this dude has never witnessed the people dressed up as cardboard Transformers and bootleg Pixar characters on Las Vegas Blvd. In-all seriousness the guy has a point. The Binions Cafe is by no means something to rave about, but like a blue collar worker, it's reliable and gets the job done no matter the situation.
Lucy's Bar & Grill=This past Saturday my mom was surprised when I insisted on taking her out for prime rib at lunch.  So we approach the smallish, dark, slightly smokey sign that says, "Please Seat Yourself. " She smirked when she saw the special Weekend Only price of $3.99 - it's normally 10 bucks, still a good deal.  Well,  mom you taught me the importance of good value for the buck, and this place is it.  The other awesome specials were Steak and Shrimp for $6.99 and steak and lobster for $9.99.  This place ain't no fancy rest-oo-rant, but if ya likes ya some grub fo' cheap, dis is da place, chile.  For less than the price of a Big Mac combo, you can haves ya self the Prime Rib special fo' fo'...well, ok -- fo' 3 nineteh nahn!  $3.99, not $13.99 like at second rate restaurants or $20 plus at the fancy tie and tail places.  On Fridays and Saturdays, this crazy price is the favored special.  Come early, and your prime rib cut will be large.  Mine was about a half pound.  And rumor is, as the day wears on and the place fills up, they start to run out. Well, guess what...your meat becomes smaller.  That's just awful when that happens.     I ordered my prime rib medium, and so did my mom.  It came out perfectly medium, warm with just a slight amount of red.  It comes with a baked potato and mixed veggies. You may get turned off by the excessive amount of black pepper the chef douses the prime rib and veggies with.  But scrape it off or tell them, ".Salt but no peppah here... please".  We also ordered sodas.  All told, the bill was about $12.50 plus tax and tip.  We each only finished half of the slab, neither of us wanted the flab.  So we took the rest home to eat later.This is basically the restaurant for Lucky Casino. This place is great if you love singing karaoke Sunday afternoons in Spanish, because that's what makes this place rock after the locals go to the noon Catholic mass. English is the second language, however. Speaking of tail, please don't be surprised if a few disheveled chica's de la noche, or Lady Marmalade shows up.  Hey business is down and even les girls get hungry and need to save money.
Caribbean Spice=Do you like tender, fall-off-the-bone stewed meats that are rich with flavorful spices and unique to the average palette?   If so, then you should pick a night you don't have much going on and head over to A Taste of the Caribbean.  My roomie and I have been here a handful of times and are always happy with our visit.  Things to try:Jerk ChickenGoat CurryBrown Stew ChickenBeef Patties (not sure why they call them that though)Yucca dessert - tastes coconutty!Notes:They are on their own clock so don't be in a hurry!I wish they'd have some music playing instead of the TV all the time.  That'd match the colorful design a bit more.  Sometimes the beef patties are too dry but I like them anyway! lolNow that I'm writing about it... I kinda wanna go again!  I wanna get their oxtail... they were in between batches when I tried to order it last time.  See ya there.Bruce Banner has to fight to keep the Hulk contained. I fight the same battle with Vanilla Heat. Born in Jamaica's Hedonism 3 resort I regularly feasted on jerk chicken, rice, and plantains. While I have managed well over the past couple of years to keep VH under control, I did have a hankering for Caribbean food this weekend and found A Taste of the Caribbean at Baseline & Mill. I could feel Vanilla Heat fighting to get out.From my table I could hear the sizzle from the chicken as it cooked and I began looking forward to its arrival. While waiting I looked at my mobile app and saw several Yelp reviews and the only negative thing I really saw was the level of spice. I am not sure if the owners made a change, but the jerk chicken was spicy on my visit. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and had an excellent flavor. It came with a side of red beans & rice, cabbage, and 3 plantains. The owner told me if I needed more rice, cabbage, or plantains to ask him.The restaurant is small and colorful with very pleasant decorations, and Pandora played nice reggae rhythms. This restaurant took me back to my trip to Jamaica and provided the best jerk chicken I have had since. Thankfully it didn't take me all the way back, else I would have ran naked through the parking lot yelling SHABBA! But any time I need a jerk chicken fix this will be the spot!You know when you get a huge plate of delicious looking food and all your dining companions comment that in no way could you ever finish all that food? A Taste of the Caribbean is like that. Only the food is just that good that you WILL finish your gigantor plate of grub!They have only a few drink options (your typical Coke products, some tea and juice options).  The spot is super cute and bright, and reminded me of some of the hole in the wall joints I've visited on my Central American and Caribbean travels. I don't know about you, but brightly colored walls just make me happy!My only complaint was some super Evangelical TV show was on. Sure, we probably could've asked for it to be turned off or volume down, but I didn't want to offend the adorable cook, "Mama."Will I be back?  Heck yes!When I heard that there was a place serving vegan Caribbean food, I was so excited to check it out. Caribbean Spice did not disappoint.They have a menu board, with a "Vegan Corner," where they list the most popular vegan options, like Vegan Jerk Chicken and Vegan Curry Chicken. Other vegan options on the board included, Jerk Tofu, Veggie Curry, Curry Tofu, and Vegetable Roti.I spoke with one of the owners and she went over their vegan menu with me:They have Tofu or soy chicken (Beyond Meat) available as a vegan protein; you choose which.Vegan curry comes in a tofu or veggie option. The veggie curry is made with chickpeas and curry potatoes.Beans & rice are made with coconut milk; no butter, animal milk or broth involved.Cabbage and plantains are vegan.She said that they have a veggie patty that is vegan too. She added that they cook everything fresh, so even if you don't see something on the board, just ask for vegan.They do not have any vegan desserts at this time.  Per owner, they don't use animal milk (they use coconut milk), but they do use eggs in their cakes. I ordered the Vegan Jerk Chicken for $9.95, which comes with 2 sides: beans & rice, cabbage, or fried plantains. I  ordered the beans & rice and cabbage, but with a side of fried plantains (@ $3.50).  That jerk "chicken" was beyond amazing, and they gave me a huge heaping!  I spooned some of the jerk sauce onto my beans & rice and the result was heavenly; deliciously divine. The cabbage was nicely seasoned, but it had more of a crunchy consistency than to what I am accustomed. It was good, nonetheless. I left not one morsel on that plate. My plantains never came, but it was ok because I was too full to eat anything else anyway.  I simply asked for a refund, which I was given without hesitation. My DD, who's non-veg, ordered the regular Jerk Chicken plate, and she loved it. For drinks, they had ice tea, canned sodas (Coke products) and some bottled drinks, which appeared to be from fellow Caribbean nations.  They have a juice bar and smoothies as well.Order and pay at the counter; they'll bring the food to your table.  I particularly liked that they brought me a straw with my ice water, so I didn't have to ask.  I went for lunch and arrived around 11:30am. There was only 1 other table at that time, and they were already eating, so my food didn't take long to arrive. Don't expect typical American friendly service. They're nice in their own way, just not the friendly-bob, perky, smiley faces that some people like and want. Cozy little inside. One wall is hand-painted with pictures of South America and the Caribbean Sea. The owners are from Guyana, so their flag is proudly displayed. There was an air-suspended TV,  playing some reality show, which kept me entertained. I really like the outside, which has a wraparound porch with tables. I'd love to eat out there once the weather cools down. Shares a parking lot with neighboring businesses.  Their sign is visible from Baseline, so it was easy to find.Delicious vegan Caribbean food at a reasonable price. I'll definitely go back; I want to try the curry too!For December's International Supper club, we headed off to Caribbean Spice to give them a try!It's a small place with a simple menu on the wall, but we were a party of 6 and there still was plenty of seating room for others.After checking out the menu I went with a small jerk chicken, it came with beans & rice, cabbage & carrots , thigh and drumstick. The flavoring of the jerk chicken was amazing, perfectly blended spices, the only complaint I could have is that there wasn't enough chicken to enjoy all those flavors, the thigh and drumstick where are on the tiny side. The rice and beans where plain in flavor but cooked perfectly, and the sautéed cabbage and carrots lacked in flavor as well. The jerk chicken was the star of that plate.Service was friendly and good. I'm going to have to come back and try them for lunch.
China Magic Noodle House=09/08 and 09/29On my first visit here, I ordered egg rolls and a stir-fried beef noodle dish.  It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.Really loved the egg rolls!  They're so good, I'm going to have to order them every time I visit.  The noodles were good, but the meat portion of this dish was pretty dismal-- the noodle to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1.  No exaggeration!  (I had hoped it was a fluke, but it wasn't-- more detail to come later.)  Once I'd exhausted the beef content (and there wasn't much), I wasn't satisfied enough w/ the noodle flavor to continue.  (If only the noodles were as tasty as those I'd tried at Saigon Bowl the night before...)  There was no doubt, however, that these noodles were freshly made--  I really enjoyed its texture!Took Mom w/ me on my second visit.  Decided to try the steamed gyoza and a noodle dish w/ ground pork.  Wished I'd ordered the eggrolls, instead :(  The gyoza dish was, without question, the worst WE'D ever tried!  Too heavy on the batter, and steamed was definitely not the way to go.  (Once you have a look at the photos, you'll agree!)  Same thing w/ the pork.  Too crumbly and unexciting flavor (salty and lemony), and again, the meat to noodle ratio was very low.  Two visits, and it's Hit-1, Miss-1.  At least I'll know that the app will be a hit (egg rolls), and if I remember to order a double- or a triple-serving of meat, maybe the noodle portion won't be a miss...If you want noodles, this is the place, they have them stir fried, steamed & in soups, the menu is simple, the prices are cheap, and the food AMAZING!I wanted to go check out China Magic Noodle House Friday night for dinner but was having a hard time getting someone to go with me, so finally I got my daughter & her best friend to say yes they will go. They both work and it was rare that they had a Friday night off and they wanted to head over to the Ostrich Festival and not hang out with a parent unit LOL .  Each one of us ordered a different dish, one ordered the noodles with minced pork sauce, another ordered the beef fried noodle dish (forget its name or number but it looks like chow main) and I ordered the beef with oyster sauce, Let me tell you, each dish was delish! The noodles are so fresh! The girls enjoyed watching the noodles being made through the window. I can't wait to try out other things on the menu.6 star food, 3 star ambiance, 4 star review.It is the real deal for Chinese food. I have pretty Americanized tastes, but even I could appreciate their menu watching them make the noodles right then and there is so cool for someone who does not know much about the process. The food itself is very darn tasty. The shredded noodles are thick, filling, and delicious especially with beef. I have gotten beef tripe stew here and it was awesome; it felt like I was eating Asian menudo and that's a great feeling.Service was good, but this place is just not special inside. It is not very nice inside to impress people which is a shame because the food is great and priced very well. One last thing the portions are also very large, a definite plus.I've been coming here for awhile and I love this place. It's all about the food and the freshens of the noodles. Don't come here thinking about great atmosphere, decor, or service. This place is all about the good. Fresh noodles. The place is very casual and either you pick  a table or they will pick a table for you. The table already has a bunch of chop sticks and soup spoons stack on each table with paper napkins for your liking. The servers there speak mostly Chinese but can speak English. Sometimes you have to repeat yourself to make sure they got the order right. I always order the seafood noodles with shrimp, squid, and fish balls. It has cabbage, carrots, onions. I have order the different noodle types. Usually order the normal or thick noodles but any noodles you order are always good. They have four or five different noodles you can choose from. Oh yes, the pan fried dumplings are huge. It comes with eight in an order. They are so juicy and always cooked perfectly. I always have to order their dumplings. I think they are probably the best that I've found in Arizona or California. It's that good. Overall, I love this noodle place and have no problem coming here all the time cause the noodles are so fresh. Yum yum. EnjoyThis place is really cool and has some of the freshest Noodles in town. Just happened to be in the neighborhood and had to check them out. After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.The menu here has a large assortment of different types of both noodle sizes and shapes. You can basically pick the type of noodle you want and they will make one of their tasty dishes to your specifications.Inside is very nice with all the condiments you need right at your table. Some of the tables are bigger and can suport those crazy noodle parties that can spontaneously erupt.Started with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Order the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.So many different things on the menu with several choices of flavors and textures. This place is really fun and a delicious treat. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items. Hear that the Spicy Pig Ear is also very good. No Pun intended.Located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee's. See ya there next time. MAGIC TAKES THE SHOT ... SCORES!4.5 STARSThis review comes long overdue but hey, it's better late than never, right?The entourage and I came in one rainy monsoon night to tuck into some delicious noodles.  I've been hearing about this place for a while --- about how their noodles are all hand-stretched and made with love.  I wanted to experience that for myself!  Walking to the restaurant was like walking into your typical cha chaan teng.  Service is speedy and not very personal and they do seem to treat people who speak Chinese a lot better from what I've observed.  Lucky me for being the table's representative, right? After ordering an assorted marinated meat combination plate with pig ears and other succulent pieces of cold-served meats, we all got our noodle dishes.  Honestly, I wasn't too wowed by my dish.  I had ordered something that they assured me was similar to dandan noodles, what I was really craving for on this rainy night but it didn't really taste like it.  I think it was more like zha jiang mian.  Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but it just took me by surprise. Anyways, this is a pretty solid place and it definitely makes you feel like you're eating in Chinatown, San Francisco or something.  Place gets packed around dinner time so unless you want to rub some elbows with strangers, come for a late lunch or early dinner!This place is kinda no-frills, but it deserves five stars because it is a tremendous value and a rare treat. I mean, it's all about the hand-pulled noodles, which makes any other pre-made pasta develop a severe inferiority complex. Enough anthropomorphizing the noodles though... the window into the kitchen to watch the noodles being made is such a cool feature! The dude I saw working the impossible noodle slinging had really impressive forearms... I'm sure he earned them from years and years of pasta wrangling.This is the kind of under-celebrated hidden spot that is worth showing off... and picking up the tab will not hurt you dearly. I blew my roommate's mind by trotting this one out, although I had only been once a couple of years prior. What reminded me about this place was another friend raving about the potstickers. The pan-fried dumplings are huge... and essentially pure meat inside. The only "filler" is a smidge of green onion. Share these as an appetizer and then pound your delicious entrée (I had #22 - noodles and minced pork). And then the Oompah-Loompahs can roll you out the door afterward, because my friend, you will be stuffed blissfully full with noodle goodness!Do yourself a favor and pool your couch change. Then come down here to see the Asian Popeye whip your noodles from fresh dough. Get the fried dumplings as big as your fist! Stuff an ungodly pile of steaming pasta down yer gullet! But you might want to wear a bib, if you're hesitant to cut your luxuriously long noodles. The need to slurp them up is very strong indeed... and you know it's just that good when you soil your shirt.My Dearest China Magic Noodle House, I have lived barely a mile away from you the past three years and have never given you the time of day.How wrong was I to neglect your heavenly cuisine and ambiance (suspect olfactory assault included) that brings me right back to the Bay! Dude and I dropped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Based on many of our friends' Yelp reviews, we knew going in that we were going try the XO Spicy Beef Noodles ($8.25) and the Pan Fried Dumplings ($4.95). Oh, those dumplings. Not your typical Chinese restaurant freezer dumplings; these babies are on 'roids! There's eight to an order and they're practically a meal on their own. We were pleased to find these weren't overcooked or greasy, a common mistake. My only complaint is I wish there were more vegetables. As for the noodles, you can pick the width (really thin, really wide,  somewhere in between, insert your dirty jokes here). We went with the standard C noodles. While they were fresh and delicious, the beef was just OK. I also wish the XO delivered a little more heat as promised, but nothing a little chili oil can't fix. Next time, I'll ask for them extra spicy! Can we also talk about the portion sizes here? Between a heaping plate of noodles and behemoth dumplings, we were able to take home leftovers that heated up perfectly the next day for lunch. Prices are similar to what those corporate Asian food establishments charge, but it's obviously so much better. Sit by the window and you're in for a real show. So much fun to watch all the noodles being hand stretched! Already plotting another trip to this little slice of home on Dobson and Warner to work my way through that extensive menu. Yay, I'm a fan indeed!
El Segundo Sol=Come here on el cinco dia del mes for all day happy hour specials! 2 frozen margaritas (the mango and Big Stick are so good), 2 carnitas burritos and 2 (free, given out by marketing girls) double Espolon tequila shots for $23. Say what?! Yes, it was cheaper than two drinks at the Encore pool.Top that off with a lively Mexican band and cool bartenders and servers and you've got the best pre-big night out deals on the strip!
India Garden=It was 8:30 in the evening, we are driving to Phoenix from San Diego and we are worried we are not going to find a place open for dinner.  I consulted Yelp and found that India Garden was in between where we were and my sister's house.We arrived on NYE's eve and were promptly greeted.  The restaurant is large and only had two or three tables.  A buffet was ready to go but we decided we wanted to order from the menu.The Lamb Vindaloo (44) was very good as was the Naan bread.  However, two dishes really stood out.  First, the Bhindi Masala (85) Okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices.  Wow.  Really fresh and great flavor.  Next, we ordered the Chicken Achari (40) Chicken cooked in "exotic Indian pickle masala".  This was the surprise of the evening as the pickle flavor mixed well with the chicken and masala to make a very fresh and pleasant tasting dish.Finally, the service was spectacular.  At least three different people constantly (but not in a bad way) checked on us to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed.  Reasonable prices for bottles of wine that matched very well with the food makes for an experience that is as good as it gets.Thank you.
Jimmy John's=I'm giving this a reluctant 4 stars.i am a fan of JJ's. Every location that I have ever been to has served up quality sandwiches....and everyone who knows me, knows that I love a good sandwich.This spot is no different. Great bread, meat and vegetables. Fresh, tasty and delightful. The motto for the chain is "Freaky Fast". Usually, when I make my purchase, my sandwich is ready by the time I put the lid on my cup. This time around, I waited for several minutes. There were no customers ahead of me. No new employees learning how to make sandwiches. Just very slow-paced employees.I'm not upset or angry. It's just not the "freaky fast" service that the other locations have provided. Not to worry. If I am in the area and want a sandwich, I will still come in.JJ, you rock my world.As I have mentioned in several reviews before, I have my own ATOS (Amber Terms of Service) in which my #1 rule is to never review a place that you have only been to once unless you know for certain you will not be back.As I sit here eating this giant pickle, I find myself IN a pickle... because while this is the first time I have eaten at Jimmy John's, they DID deliver free samples to the office yesterday... so is that technically 1+???Well, even if its not, I don't care. I am impressed beyond words at their incredible ability to serve their business clientele... Let me explain. Yesterday, out of nowhere, a nice delivery boy from JJ just drops by 10 or 12 mini subs for the office to sample. Super nice. Great marketing tool. Everyone was happy as a clam. Who doesn't love free food?So, today, I felt like it would be a good idea to return the favor and give them our business. We had 12 people order subs, and the entire ordering process was incredibly easy. You can order online, or call in the order. When everything was delivered, each sub had the correct name, they itemized the receipt by our names so that each person could have the correct amount deducted from their paycheck, and everything was 100% correct. No mixups. Aside from the incredible convenience of their ordering, their friendliness, and the awesome delivery, the subs were incredible tasting and at a fabulous price point. The bread (even though I'm not supposed to eat it - whoopppps) was fresh and delicious, the veggies were all fresh and piled on, and my pickle was huge and incredibly satisfying. (get your mind out of the gutter)You can choose 7 grain bread or a french roll, or for those who want the low-carb route, you can wrap your sub in lettuce! They have a great variety of subs, including two veggie options that can be made vegan, chips, pickles, drinks. Their website is really cool too - you can figure out the exact nutritional value of your entire meal, and the site is fun and easy to use. Anyway - incredible all around. I am very impressed and can't wait for our next group order!!
The King's Kitchen=King's Kitchen fills many voids in the Charlotte area. First it's a meat & three, which has been long missing since Gus Sir Beef left Latta Arcade years ago.  Second it's a GOOD, upscale meat & three which is part of the Noble family of restaurants (one that even I will enjoy going to). Third it is the most wonderful concept: it is a nonprofit conceived by all proceeds are leveraged to donate to soup kitchens, and other food charities. Beyond that, they employ the otherwise unemployable (formerly incarcerated, rehabilitated, etc.) and are integrating a 40-week job training program to teach life skills. They also hand out box lunches to homeless. There isn't a place like this anywhere around, so I wanted to support this nonprofit even if the food wasn't good. Maybe their motto should be "Do Good, Eat Well" because lucky for me, it was delicious.They said they have the best pan fried chicken in town, so that's what I tried along with some of the best grits I've had in Charlotte (Anson Mill stoneground grits with some corn kernels), stewed squash and fried green beans. The squash was absolutely delicious, and the beans weren't really what I expected- I thought they might be battered and crispy, but they were possibly stewed and then fried so they were definitely more crispy than stewed, but not crispy crispy. My chicken's breast was very tender inside and I would definitely get that again.  I will refrain from commenting on my husband's pot roast since I never like fatty meat. He said it was tender. He accompanied the roast with mac 'n cheese (good but not plentiful enough), collard greens which were tasty and not too vinegary, and creamed corn which weren't too creamy. He was very pleased as well.  Other meats included fried flounder, grilled chicken breasts and Eegads! chicken livers!! We are in the South, Jules, get over it.  There were several other things to choose from as well as some sandwiches.  Desserts included a banana pudding with a torched meringue top from the pastry chef from Johnson & Wales, a brown sugar pound cake, chocolate pie, coconut chess pie and others.  Service was very friendly, but we got the sense some of the staff was underemployable. Since they've been open only a few days they're still in training mode, but was very encouraged about the friendliness.Right now they are only open for lunch M-F, but they hope to open for breakfast and eventually dinner as well and are going to play with opening for breakfast/lunch on weekends.  Their spot on Church & Trade has a great spot for outdoor seating but I would understand why they would opt to have it be weekdays only.  My office is right next door, so I will definitely be going again. Probably not every week because I would need to change my nickname to Fat Jules, but definitely every other week, perhaps only with a veggie plate!The King's Kitchen moto speaks volumes....  "Where you FEAST TO FEED SOMEBODY.  We're a not for profit restaurant serving up southern cuisine made with fresh, local ingredients from right here in our community. And the proceeds go back to the community, helping to feed those in need. So, come on in. Because when you dine, the whole community thrives." This is what we had on our first visit....Pimiento Cheese with House Crackers, Deviled Eggs, Grandma Bennon's Pot Roast (falling off the bone good!), Mac & Cheese, Butter Beans, & Coconut Chess Pie!  YES, I LOVE TO EAT!!!  :)NEED I SAY MORE???  Go support this great restaurant!  Chef Jim Noble (Noble's and Rooster's) is the mastermind behind it!Anyone who says it's tough to screw up fried chicken obviously hasn't made much of it....or eaten any "bad" fried chicken. Thank goodness the fine folks at King's Kitchen have that dish down pat! I have been waiting to head over to this nonprofit phenom for quite some time and finally got a chance to grab some dinner here. I'll put it out there right now - I love the concept of a nonprofit restaurant. I love the idea of feeding those who are without and putting people to work who are in transition. Now that that's clear, let's focus on the food & experience. The restaurant hosts clean lines, bright walls and nice lighting. Hubs and I chose to sit out on the patio and enjoy a late dinner. Our waiter, Stuart, was incredibly friendly and led us through the menu with ease. A few glasses of wine later, we were ready to order. As mentioned, I chose the fried chicken with roasted carrots and mac & cheese. The bird was perfectly crispy and super juicy - honestly, it rivals my grandmother's fried chicken and that's say a whole lot. The carrots had the perfect amount of sweetness and were by no means overcooked. And lastly, the mac and cheese was heart attack worthy and delightful. Price wise, I think $13 was a completely fair (and affordable) price for this plate of food. The portions aren't gargantuan, but they are plenty large for the price! We finished off the evening with strawberry shortcake - made with biscuits, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. While the treat was refreshing and tasty, the biscuits were a bit stiff and the portion was on the smaller side. Thus, I need to come back and try the coconut chess or chocolate pie. Oh woe is me. I'm looking forward to coming back for another royal dinner at King's Kitchen...if I were to grab lunch here I may fall into an afternoon food coma!Overall, good food, noble mission... It's a place that you feel good about eating a meal at :) I absolutely love the concept behind King's Kitchen. They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! I had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections.I have waited three years to write this review ladies and gentlemen. The King's Kitchen is just a remarkable place all around. From the relativley modern and simple yet solemn interior design to the wonderful group of people who make our visit such a delightful event. The location is also super convenient from all sides of Uptown - for those of you who aren't in Charlotte, that's our downtown. Today I had the salmon for dinner and it was just great. I love salmon in many different forms and enjoy various sorts of recipes. Unfortunately, as we all know, not all places do it good enough. The King's Kitchen was on point. Not too mushy and not too dry inside covered with seasoned and (most importantly) crispy outer layer for an excellent experience. I cannot end today's review without mentioning the mushrooms. Yes, they were perfect. Last but not least, the lady who brought extra pimento cheese for our baguette, you rock. The manager was super quick and smart too. Keep it up!There is a unique story behind this place which I will save for all of you readers to go find out for yourselves. You will like it just for that, and love it for the tuna sandwiches, the salmon, and their amazing desserts.
Bosa Donuts=The Bavarian cream was mind-blowing!  Sexy and silky as sin, it was the best version of this donut variety I've tried thus far.  Embrace it and you won't (literally) be able to show your face in the morning.  Approach w/ caution!Ladies and Gentlemen,To the Tune of the Top Ten Hit from 1963 by that Round Mound of Sound, Miss Eydie Gorme!http://tinyurl.com/28jxx76I was drivin' by when it caught my eyeStandin' by itself lookin' sweet and shyI turned in to the lot, swaying' to and froAnd soon I knew I'd never let them goBlame it on the Bosa Donut with its tasty treatsBlame it on the Bosa Donut that I love to eatOh, it all began with a maple barNow it seems I can't fit in my carBlame it on the Bosa DonutThe food of loveNow was it the pie?No, no, the Bosa DonutsOr the stir fry?No, no, the Bosa DonutsNow was it the glazed?Yeah, yeah, the Bosa DonutsThe treats of loveNow I'm glad to say I'm in controlAnd I stop at just one jelly rollAnd when I try to grab a dozenMy shock collar starts a buzzin'Blame it on the Bosa Donuts with its cake and glazedBlame it on the Bosa Donuts that I'm lightly tasedOh, it all began with Bavarian CremeNow I know I can't fit in my jeansBlame it on the Bosa DonutThe fritters of love!When I was a kid I lived in this small neighborhood in the bay area. I used to grab money from my moms purse and then walk up the street and find ways to spend my money. There was a circle K, a hair salon, a video store complete with a beaded curtain section (of which my step brother was a fan. I know this bc I was a snoop), aaaaaand a donut shop. It as an oriental run donut shop and those always seemed to be the best in my experience of eating donuts while living in the bay. they had a mean maple bar. It wasn't overly sweet and had a perfect amount of saltiness and chewy-ness while remaining fluffy and moist. it was a great donut and what I consider a 'bay area style donut'  for no other reason except that i ate this kind of donut while i lived in the bay area. i didn't think anyone else made donuts like this.until I arrived at Bosa. it's run by orientals which is a good sign when it comes to donuts so I tried a maple bar. oh my gosh! the donut brought back all of those memories of tattling on my step brother when I found his naughty movies and regretting my choice to get a perm at the hair salon once while bored. this is a bay area style donut! it's not krispy kreme(which is also a delicious donut) and it's not dunkin (which isn't a delicious donut) it's a different donut class of its own.if you like them chewy and fluffy while a tad sweet and salty go here for your donut pleasure!I blame Bosa for resurfacing my donut obsession. I thought all donuts tasted the same. I thought they all tasted fluffy, sugary and heavenly, but the same. I have been a lover of the donut since my early childhood when my Dad would surprise me with a stop at our favorite donut store during a round of errands. The owner also happened to know my Dad so my one donut turned into a full bag of donuts and I felt as if I had just won the jackpot (even though my Dad still only let me pick one out to actually eat at that moment). But now let me fast forward many, many moons and I'll actually begin my review of Bosa. Bosa does not sell your ordinary donut. Well, actually they do sell some of the classics but the difference with Bosa is that they make their donuts truly holey (pun intended). Whatever they do to them makes the donut victim enter a world of pure oblivion as an sugar high hits instantly upon first delicious bite. So you go to Bosa for the first time, you walk into a very sparse shop that was definitely once a fast food restaurant and you see a counter of donuts staring at you. Like my Dad taught me all those years ago, sadly I can only have one, so what to do? The answer is easy, even for someone with major menu anxiety like myself: get the BUTTERMILK donut. Don't ask questions and just do it. Don't think to yourself..."that's way too big, I'll just get a donut hole." No. Order the buttermilk donut, have a serious talk with your will power, tell your will power to hold you back from eating the entire thing and get the buttermilk donut. Why? Because it will allow you to taste a donut you didn't know existed. It tastes like pure buttermilk immersed into a delicious fried sweet baked good. You'd think the bread inside would taste like normal donut bread, but it doesn't. It tastes like your eating donut bread infused with buttermilk cream and yet it's just the donut being that fluffy and moist. Now thanks to this donut, I will have to avoid driving on McDowell until I allow myself to have a donut again because I know that if I pass by Bosa (that has a DRIVE THROUGH by the way), there is no way I'll be able to drive by without stopping inside to say hello to my favorite donut.I am glad I do not live close to this donut shop.  With the 24 hour drive thru, excellent selection of donuts, boba drinks, and even shaved ice available all day it is a diet killer.I stopped by late, about 10pm  and they still had a large selection of donuts, I picked up a dozen to "sample" the flavors.  I enjoyed the old fashioned, Boston creme, chocolate filled, raspberry filled, and some classic sugar laden regular donuts.  Delicious and I was on a sugar high.To add to my sugar high I added a boba Thai coffee large.  Pretty of boba to enjoy my long drive back to the west valley.  I really enjoyed the coffee and it is a rare treat by my home.  I am still craving another excuse to drive here and get another.I also did sample some shaved ice in the unconventional rainbow fashion. The staff was not use to serving a rainbow shaved ice, but were very accommodating.  He noted they usually only do one flavor, but attempted a 4 flavor ice sample.  It is still great to have shaved ice at 10pm when its 50 degrees outside right?I also noted breakfast croissants and other breakfast treats, bagels and creme cheese, etc.  I could not really concentrate on that part of the menu, the donuts in the glass cases are mesmerizing.  I imagined sampling them all while I reduced my selection to only 12 donuts.  I can say that the 12 donuts did not last a day on the kitchen island and the donut box is now a empty box of memories.  I hope to visit Bosa again and enjoy another dozen and maybe sample some other items they provide.  I hope you have the opportunity to sample Bosa donuts as well.So, my childhood donut shop is still safe atop the donut throne.   I would never cheat on my favorite donut shop (except with Krispy Kreme a few times).  But I was drawn here after having their buttermilk donut.  I finally brought myself to stop in this donut shop after having had a Buttermilk Bosa donut a few months ago at work. What an amazingly good donut, when it is fresh.  I've had that donut 3 times and the first 2 times I had it, the donut was simply AMAZING.  Something that tastes that good scares me.  I was afraid I would be drawn to this place over and over for that donut.So, on a weak day, when I just wanted something sweet.... NOW.  I pulled into this shop at about 4 in the afternoon.  I see the yummy "specialty donut" in the display and quickly order it.  I get in my car and I don't immediately pull off as I whip out that donut to break off the first piece.  I take a bite and I'm suddenly shocked.... disappointed.  It was STALE.  I wondered how long that donut had been in the display.  It wasn't very good.  i have resolved to never return -- a lie!  I should stop lying to myself.   Nothing that good could possibly, truly be that good. Someone at work brought 3 dz of these donuts this week.  I resisted.  I resisted.  but I'm sure.. in that weak moment, I'm returning for that buttermilk yummy goodness.  But I've learned my lesson, I'm going first thing in the morning... I want a fresh one.Yumms!
Los Favoritos Taco Shop=Los Favoritos (Favorites)  no es mi favoritos.Mi favorito es: http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ranchero-chandlerI did find it to be perfectly serviceable, reasonable and quick.  I tried a breakfast burrito but also sampled the shrimp diablo and a chimichanga.I volvería.
Cucina by Wolfgang Puck=This is the only place inside Crystals at City Center that I can afford to indulge in. We took a break from window shopping (the only thing you can really do at the stores here), and had a really nice lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria. The ultra modern restaurant is open and airy, located in the middle of the mall. While no one in our group of four ladies was particularly starving, we just got three things to share. I guess the motivation behind that was the skin tight size XS dress that was waiting to be worn a few hours later. So, we ordered the fried calamari appetizer, one basil pesto grilled chicken panini and the calzone pizza which we had them make as an open faced flat pizza. They were kind enough to cut the panini into fours, and surprisingly, we still had leftover pizza! Loved the delicious panini, and the thin crust pizza was very tasty. The calamari was nicely fried and not oily at all.Service was top notch here. I'm really starting to notice the high level of hospitality in Vegas, which is pretty refreshing. Will definitely be back to do do some casual dining when I'm staying at Vdara. The bar area is also super swank with TVs projected onto a piece of glass. Nice job, Wolfie.We made a reservation for a party of 20, but when we arrived at the scheduled time, the staff was still "setting up our table" so we had to wait for nearly half an hour to be seated. As we got seated, we had to wait another who knows how long to get some service. Some people were getting impatient, so they went to gamble as we placed their orders in for them. As we all got our food after the others returned, they assumed their orders were still being prepared. 10-15 min later, we had to wave the server down to check on the orders as well as refill our glasses. He comes back to tell us that their orders were never placed and forgets to get us more water on top of that.The food was okay, but for the price we were paying for mediocre food, I wished their service was a bit more attentive. They also charged us a hefty cake cutting fee of $50. FIDDY! They didn't even cut the cake for us!Located at the CityCenter Crystals shopping complex, Cucina by Wolfgang Puck caters to your drinking and food needs.When I arrived, I wanted to cry.I had myVegas loyalty points I could have used up here...... :'(Got the white wine sangria. It turned out to be the best drink I had all vacation. It has fruit slices. It brings white wine and makes it sweet. Omg it tastes REALLY good and it still has the alcohol taste in there. I think it was during happy hour, so I got a dollar or two knocked off its price. I don't think I would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though.Friendly service and friendly bar service as well :D
San Salvador Restaurant=The pupusas revueltas here are so freaking good. Like, so good that I don't order anything else. Grab two for under $5 and that's a meal. Try to have the patience to let them cool so you can consume them without burning your fingertips and tongue, but if you can't, I understand.Tiny restaurant is situated in a busy lot, but the cozy interior and friendly staff more than make up for any minor parking inconveniences. Prices are low, food is fresh. Fellow diners recommend the soups and grilled meats (specifically the steak/shrimp plates?), similar to other centro-Americo style spots.But the pupusas are the best thing here, and the revueltas are the best of them. A tiny bit greasy, but thick with filling and such great flavor. I'm tempted to go get some right now...
Marco's Pizza=Marco's Pizza is amazing. If it were more affordable, I'd order pizza at Marco's more often. This is exactly why you should only order when you have a coupon or order on a Monday, when you can get a large 1-topping pizza with delicious cheesy bread for $13.99 (online offer). Yup, I pretty much bide my time like an evil genius until a glorious coupon opportunity arises. The pizza here is irresistibly cheesy and the ingredients are fresh. You can pick a crust topper flavor for free. I usually go with garlic parmesan. The cheesy bread is the bomb diggity! Love it! The cheesy bread is the size of a small pizza, seriously. One (or maybe two) sauces are included with the bread. I'd recommend the marinara or garlic sauce.  I usually order carry-out from here. Customer service is great. They have four locations in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try!YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #145
Argentos Pizza=I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about- I'm wondering if that review wasn't written under a bogus ID that is a front for a competitor of Argentos. The fact that he reviewed three pizza places in one day, and then reviewed two others on the same day 34 days later seems fishy to me- who orders pizza from two or three places in the same day or even the same week? Anyway,  Believe me, if you've read my review of Landini's Pizza in San Diego, then you understand that "I know from pizza" as the saying goes in  NY.  Pizza is one of the trinity foods of the greater NYC area, the other two being bagels and authentic deli.  All three are frequently imitated but seldom duplicated accurately outside of a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.I moved to AZ for a variety of reasons, and specifically to Buckeye in order to be in proximity to family plus for a great deal on a house.  Why else would I subject myself to the hinterlands of Maricopa County, the epicenter of AZ?  Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that in a sleepy town best known for farms and rodeo (as well as the only way to LA prior to the completion of I-10) a pizza man from NYC would decide to relocate his family and business. The owner, who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian (a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy) cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs, dinners, and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years.  There are no conveyor belt ovens, no round pizza grates or pans, just pumice lined pizza ovens fired up over five hundred degrees. Relatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza, a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best. Not only could I recommend Argentos, but I encouraged them to order.  The Jerseyites were not disappointed, and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious.What better validation could a pizza shop get?
Kazu=I had been looking forward to trying out Kazu after reading a positive review in Montreal Mirror last week, but unfortunately they were closed for renovations the first time I popped by. Thankfully they're back in business and it was definitely worth the second trip out.Upon entering the restaurant my friend and I were greeted with a friendly round of "irasshaimase", which means welcome in Japanese (and is something you will hear every time you enter a restaurant or store in Japan). Off to a good start!I already knew I wanted to try the salmon and tuna bowl based on reviews I'd read and my friend settled on a bowl of ramen (I believe this is only on the lunch menu). The salmon and tuna bowl was delicious and I'm pretty sure this will be my standby meal at Kazu, because yes, I will be returning. It was composed of rice, a good sized serving of tuna and salmon sashimi, and salad all topped with a sesame dressing and some crunchy noodles. My friend enjoyed her ramen and we both agreed that the broth wasn't too salty at all. All in all, with the traditional decor, friendly staff and tasty food I'm sure this is a restaurant I'll return to again and again, which is encouraged by the owner who will shout out "see you tomorrow!" as you leave.NB: They only accept cash.Update: I've been here twice now and there was a lineup the last time I went, around dinner time. It's a pretty tiny restaurant so it fills up quick, and you may end up seated at the bar. But despite the extra heat from the open kitchen, I like being able to see all the food prep. Just be prepared to wait a bit to get in, looks like word's gotten out!Just go there. Order some sake. Order any appetizer. Order the Tuna Bowl. Order the ice cream (I prefer sake or matcha flavour). Have one of life's culinary fantasies fulfilled.I'm not kidding. This place is amazing. Sure. you'll wait over an hour to get in because they don't take reservations. Sure, you will be squished while you eat, but it won't matter because everything is so delicious, the staff is so friendly, and you are in one of the most fun places in town.Seriously.So delicious and fresh and friendly, the reviews here say it all, this is a really special place. Come early or do take out if you're not into lines. We did a take out picnic from Kazu the other day in the sculpture garden at the Canadian Centre for Architecture which is just down the street, and the incredible food combined with the illuminated art across the skyline on a warm summer night made me awful thankful to be alive. Ribs! Tuna and Salmon skin bowl! Starlight! Beers in a park! Hey thanks, universe!So many reviews for this place. Why do we need another one? Good question...... I asked myself the same question when they announced another Star Wars movie. Anyways, after 2 failed attempts to get in Kazu (Due to long lineups) I decided to give it another try. And boy I'm glad I did. One of the best Izakaya's in the city. You have to wait in line until everyone from your group arrives. Its a tiny place cramped with tables and bar stools. The service is great. They churn out dishes really fast. We ordered the 48 hour pork (Buta-Don), Beef bibimbap, shrimp burger & the tuna belly.  The Buta-Don is stewed tender pork sliced with onions on rice. The Bibimbap was awesome. Perfectly cooked tasty beef with homemade pickles & eggs sunny side up. The shrimp burgers were good. The spicy mayo adds the zing. The Tuna belly is ginormous. Enough for two people.  The fish here is really fresh and yummy too. All the dishes are  full of flavor. The only thing that bothered me is that they don't serve Ramen for dinner. But all in all a great place. Definitely worth waiting in line for this food.Food -  Awesome Service - Friendly  Ambiance - Casual / CozyWorth the money - YesIf this is the best Japanese yakitori of Montreal or Eastern Canada... has some low standards for Japanese food. Granted, I did not have high expectations coming in. I came in hungry, tired, & wanting some food. Also came in with the understanding that it wont be nyc level or la or even chicago.  got to experience kazu from the bar.The good: -Food comes out fast. Less than five minute wait from ordering. -Nice enough workers. The bad: -Long lines in cold, rainy weather.-Sat at the bar and found that NO food was really grilled or made on the spot. In fact, all of the food was premade and essentially assembled (hence fast turnaround time from your order). The shrimp burger was a premade patty heated on the grill but it didn't sizzle sizzle like all burgers should!! And the pork for their ramen was precooked and heated under the stove.... Pretty disappointing that they don't even sear it at any point. -The 48 hour pork was essentially pork over rice. It was much like the food at Yoshinoya (Japanese fast food) but definitely underwhelming and not that warm. -Salmon and Tuna bowl was more rice than anything with small bite-size pieces of salmon and tuna. It was not bad but it fell short of anything standout.All in all, having any sort of Asian cuisine is a break from the heavy (albeit delicious) food of Montreal. Would I come back? And have to wait?? Not really. This place is packed and does well on its own so people must not be too demanding. However, I will just bring a nice shin ramen cup and be sated the next time I am i. the city hankering for something Asian.Visited on a Monday night with a crowd of 10 people waiting in line outside at around 8:30 p.m. The small restaurant with open air kitchen seats 8 at the bar and another 8 to 10 at the few tables. They give you menus outside while you're waiting in line. The food was unbelievable! Really enjoyed the octopus leg,  eggplant dip, shrimp pancake the beef plate. This deserves being my first 5 star rating.Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!
Primebar=I would love to be able to review the food / drinks for this 'Hot' Spot, however I can't! I called around 1pm on a Friday to reserve a table that night for a friend's birthday celebration. I reserved a table for 10 people at 10pm; and told the host that answered the phone I would call back around 8:30 to let them know if the number of guests would be significantly less than 10 (he had said it is hard to hold a spot for 10 people that late... I thought I was being helpful by offering to do so...)I called that night around 8:50pm (20 minutes late, I know....) to let them know it would only be 8 people, not 10. I was told by a different hostess that answered the phone that my reservation was at 8:30, and I had missed it. I explained to the hostess there must be a mistake, and that my reservation was at 10pm, not 8:30. She said that NO, my reservation was at 8:30, and the table was gone, and there really wasn't anything that I could do. I asked to speak to a manager, as now we would be scrambling to find a new spot, should the reservation not go through. (**Note, you do not need a table to go to Primebar, however it was the birthday girl wanted, so I wanted to make that happen.)The manager, Sean, got on the phone, and told me that I had missed my reservation, and that they had called me two times to see if we'd be coming, but I never answered. Now, seeing as that my phone hadn't rung at all that night, I asked Sean if he had me confused with someone else. (Hey, mix-ups happen!)Sean then told me that he is sure they had called me, yet wouldn't confirm the number dialed, and continued to speak over me and not answer my questions about if there was anything we could do to get a table set aside for us. Due to his 'jerkiness' I said he was being a real Jacka$$, as I was trying bring him business. He then got REALLY mad, and said "Listen, Deary, this is how this is going to work" and "This is what we are going to do" and other ridiculous comments (during this time, I wasn't getting a word in edgewise, he just kept repeating how I messed up and that we couldn't have a table, etc etc). It was really shocking how nasty and vile his attitude was. He wasn't interested in all in problem solving, but rather a power-trip and scolding me was all he focused on.I then was forwarded to speak to his General Manager, Matt, who was nicer, but didn't apologize for the mix-up or for Sean's ridiculous behavior. He offered to buy a round of drinks for us, should we go there at a later date.. but I politely declined. I am shocked and appalled at what Primebar considers to be 'customer service'. To the management's credit, I did speak to the Marketing Director of the Scottsdale Quarter today, and she was very nice and apologetic; however she doesn't run the day-to-day operations of Primebar. Based on the other reviews it looks like the food is pretty good - but I can say that the management team they have in there is horrible... which can't bode well for the rest of the staff.
Angelina's Pizzeria=So I've ordered from here a few times and I must say i have never been disappointed with any of the items Ive tried from here.Ive tried several different items from there huge menu the funny part is Ive never tried there pizza but here are a few items I have tried...The 1st thing I ever was the Fettuccine Alfredo it was generous portions of saucy creamy goodness I was surprised at how tasty it was being that most pizza places don't have the best tasting pastas.Next time I ordered from here I tried the wings i got half Garlic Parmesan and half Hot wings bone in and they were very tasty and delicious, not to mention I must say they have the best ranch dressing Ive ever had in my life so i really enjoyed dipping these tasty critters into there wonderful ranch dressing. next time i tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which was very yummy how can you go wrong with a good quality chicken patty hot sauce and mayo hmm hmm good.Last but probably my favorite item Ive tried at this place was their Philly Cheese steak OMG juicy, flavorful, cheesy goodness this by far is one of the best cheese steaks Ive ever had I could of sucked down 2 of these tasty things my mouth is watering just writing about it. This is definitely a must try if you go to this place.I absolutely love this place Ive never found a place where everything Ive tried on the menu is truly delicious and i must say they are reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when I order from here I do delivery and it takes about an hour for me to get my food, other then that there is no going wrong with Angelina's.Ordered from here for lunch today at work form Eat24, and our reviews were kind of mixed about the whole experience.I got a Chicken Ceaser Wrap with Cross Cut Fries, And my co-workers ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger with Fries and a "Build-Your-Own Calzone." We all got an order of Garlic Balls to share.The food got here on time, and thats where the experience started to go down hill for me...My Chicken Caeser Wrap was hot...? I don't know who in the world though hot lettuce and caeser dressing would be a good idea but they were terribly terribly wrong. I can feel my gag reflex creeping up on me just reliving the experience on here.The burger was decent, and so was the Calzone. The only bad thing about the Calzone is it came out to $20.00!! That Calzone better have been made out of Truffle Oil and Gold!The Garlic KNots were definitely the best thing we ordered but looking at all the grease/oil/butter? At the bottom of the container they came in instantly made me sick to my stomach. I felt my face trying to break out mid bite and I had to put the Garlic Knot down!I can honestly say that I will probably not be ordering here in the future unfortuantly.
The Grind=As the Camelback Corridor Burger Wars escalate it is becoming more and more difficult to stand out from the pack.  Grind makes a great claim for originality by putting water cress, candied jalapenos, and ratatouille on one of their burgers.  Is this originality a good fit (think Mick Jagger) or is it just weird? (think Lady Gaga) I'm not sure.  I liked my burger although I don't think that the water cress added much other than being a new garnish to flout.  The sweet potato fritters were decent, but not enough to make me want them over their cousins, the sweet potato fry.Good vibe and probably a good place to catch sports....especially if you are into following five games simultaneously.3.5 - but I'm rounding up because I obviously liked it since I tried to subscribe to their text message specials distro advertised on the receipt while still at the table! Alas, either the instructions on the receipt are incorrect or the marketing strategy has been discontinued -- my attempt was unsuccessful. Maybe the email version on their website will work. :) Here are some highlights: * $5 wine at happy hour which runs until 6 p.m. * The rosemary roasted cheese with strawberry relish & croutons - relying on the menu description what type of cheese is a mystery. It's brie. Standard brie. But it's roasted in the coal fired oven resulting in a smoky black char on the rind. And, the "croutons" are thinly sliced, crisp bread toasts. I felt like the rosemary flavor really transferred onto the cheese and preferred it without the strawberry relish which was very sweet and citrusy (lots of orange rind). * I had the crisp pork sandwich, which I'm assuming is not hormone free or organic because the menu only proclaims "hormone free and organic beef & chicken"; still, it was quite tasty. A thick slab of pork marinated and roasted in such a way that it easily pulled apart. BBQ sauce was decent, not spectacular and someone in the kitchen forgot my "house pickle" so I'm not sure if it would ordinarily be served on top or on the side. (When I pointed it out to the waitress, she brought me a plate with several pickle sliced - whatdaya know... tasted just like a homemade pickle!) Had a side of the scalloped potatoes which were awfully black peppery and not too creamy. And finished with the donuts and salted butterscotch. The salt part was missing. Perhaps a more obvious use of fleur de sel as a garnish or something would give it that missing magic touch. Overall, I was full. It was yummy. I would go back. P.S. - There may have been salt in something, though, because I woke up in the middle of the night PARCHED! I can't say for sure it was a result of that evening's meal because my food didn't taste "salty" but I'll keep an eye on it and see if it happens next time. And, there WILL be a next time...!The Grind isn't so much a grind as a pretty nice looking bar with solid burgers.  They are huge-I shared one with my wife.  We also had onion rings which are tempura battered.  It was a nice, light batter but they were a little underdone.If Yelp had the old half star I would have rated The Grind 3.5 stars.I like the decor here, especially the appearance of the front from the inside/outside.  Also upside but not downside.  I'm looking for more upside than downside in general...I like to think of myself as a very fair-minded person...almost the embodiment of the word...not "person", "fair"!I am like a living "Spirit of Justice"...right down to the blindfold, the scales and the toga (exposing  one manly boob).No one is going to put the peek-a-boo brassiere of prejudice on me (like the Bushies tried to do to the actual Spirit of justice a few years ago)...no siree!So it was with love for all burgers and objectivity in my heart that I rolled in to The Grind on a couple of warm afternoons, not so very long ago.And I just wasn't very impressed...the burger wasn't bad by any means...but it wasn't great either...esp. at the price point...unfortunately.I expected more!* More burger choices...only three choices on the menu...it's called The Grind...do they only "grind" enough beef for three burger choices? Maybe they will cobble up something else, if you want, but frankly...I'm paying for them to figure the menu out and prepare the food for me...if I want to figure it out myself, I'll stay home and make my own.* More flavor...I've tried the place twice, burgers both times and the peppercorn burger and the Sweet and Starchy burger (I may have that wrong)...both were...what's the word I'm groping for here...adequate...completely...adequate. I kind of expect a place like this to knock my socks off (if, of course, I were to ever wear socks), but it just doesn't.* More for my money...it's $16 - $17 for a burger and beverage, by the time I tip...I'm not complaining about the price...I'm complaining about what I get for the price!* More better service...OK, I know...bad grammar...I should say "better more" service...the joint wasn't exactly jumpin' either time I dropped in and yet getting a beverage and lunch took a long time...a really long time...a 90 minute long time one of the times I was there...How long does it take to undercook a burger on a super duper unique and special "One Million Degree" grill? The burgers should have vaporized in the time it took to get them to the table!But in fairness to the Grind (always the hallmark of my little Yelp stories), I made sure that I re-tried some of my other favorite burgers...you know...WCG, FEZ, Daily Dose, Modern Burger, Davids, Zinburger, Lucky Boy, even In-n-Out!OK, you caught me...it was really more of an excuse to go on a burger binge...I do love them so!At any rate, all of them still measure up quite nicely...and all of them make better burgers than The Grind!The Grind is certainly nowhere near the bottom of the barrel...the décor is very nice on the inside (although the little old mall at 40th and Camelback is where restaurants go to die...not pleasant from the outside).The wait staff seem nice enough whenever you get a chance to see them and interact with them (which isn't that often during the course of a lunch, as it turns out)...I don't know if it's a kitchen issue or that the wait staff is "slower than ass end of hard times" (a saying from the depression era...no, the other depression era...although it certainly seems apropos enough these days).res ipsa loquitur...So, as I stand in judgment...the very physical embodiment of the Spirit of Justice...my judgment is that The Grind is a 2.75 star experience, and as everyone knows, Justice is blind, favors no one (except the wealthy) and never rounds up...so 2 stars it is.Holy mother of huge burgers! This weekend, I entered the dark and mysterious restaurant hidden on 40th and Camelback. I immediately noticed staff walking to tables with burgers so popular, they deserved their own plate. I sat down, opened the menu and let my burger adventure begin. Thanks to the Yelp iPhone app, I browsed the quick tips and reviews. Spicy burger with jalapenos, a peppercorn burger, sweet potato fritters... so much to choose from! But, the spicy factor scared me just a little so I went with the Peppercorn burger. Out comes this massive burger that looked like it was nearly half a foot high. It was dripping with a sauce equipped with a kick, watercress, charred onions and matchstick fries. I'm pretty sure it had a mind of it's own and was too huge to mess with! But, I didn't let it scare me and dug right in. I pushed myself to eat as much as possible but there was no way I could finish it. I did get pretty far though. The burger was decent -- not the best I've ever had but not the worst either. I asked for cheddar cheese and my friend asked for blue cheese but sadly, they switched the orders and there's a big taste bud difference between cheddar and blue cheese! The service was quick, the staff friendly and the drink refills plentiful. Not a huge fan of the sweet potato fritters. I couldn't tell if they had any flavor or not because the burger taste was pretty overwhelming, so if you are looking for some tasty fries to go with your burger, the sweet potato fries aren't it. So that's concludes my burger adventure. I left full and beef satisfied.You know that Groucho Marx quote: "I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member."Well here's my version: "I wouldn't want to dine in any establishment that would have a fucking GINORMOUS photograph of Sheriff Joe Arpio taking up half of the wall as though his presence there is a good thing."The only thing that could have made me more uneasy would have been if they superimposed good ol' Joe onto a giant 'last supper' painting, stuck tooth pics in my eyes and forced me to recite the ten commandments while force feeding myself mediocre sweet potato fritters and a ridiculous burger the size of my head, man vs. food style. The burger itself was......good. Not fantastic, just good. The sweet potato fritters were a joke. When something is that boring and uninspired it really needs to come with something like, oh...I dunno...25 dipping sauces. I'm sure I've seen deep fried boring remedied by flavored lard in the past. Get on the ball Grind. The service was okay. The whisky tango flavored waitstaff, all brunette with a similar 'look'  was interesting. Like if you took all of the servers at The Vig and secretly replaced them with Famous Sams waitresses; that kind of interesting. The beer and wine selection was clearly lacking and again, uninspired. I suppose the focus is supposed to be on the specialty drinks which actually seemed well thought out though none seemed to appeal to me in the moment. Also, if you're going to name one of your signature cocktails after a classic James Bond martini it should be made with the proper ingredients, or at least as close as possible. I think they sell Lillet Blanc at Total Wine, hell, the bf has some in his fridge, I'm sure he'll let you borrow it. All in all, an odd experience that kind of failed my expectations. In closing, I'll leave you with another Marx quote that kind of sums it all up: "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening. But this wasn't it."This is based on my first visit to The Grind. I am surprised at some of the low ratings because I had such a good experience. I met Chrissy P for an early dinner at The Grind one evening. I was struck by how narrow this place was. The booths were small and kind of uncomfortable in my opinion. We had arrived at the tail end of happy hour and our waitress was nice to put a couple of glasses of wine and bubbly in for us before the happy hour cutoff. We started with the baked cheese with strawberry relish. I thought it was very tasty. The saltiness of the cheese was really good with sweet relish. For my entree I chose the special of the day which was the tenderloin sandwich with cream cheese. It was SO YUMMY. The tenderloin was well cooked and tender and the schmear of cream cheese was fantastic. We got talked in to dessert. We chose the salted caramel w/mini donuts. That's where they fell short for me. I was wondering where the salt was in the salted caramel. I think if they topped the caramel with a little Fleur de sel, it would have been fantastic. I plan to visit The Grind again. I hope my good luck with the good food and service doesn't run out!Let me start by saying that I was a VERY good Yelper regarding the Grind. After my first visit, I thought it deserved 2 stars but waited it out to see if it was an acquired taste. After heading there to watch the BCS National Championship Game Monday Night (which, by the way, was possibly the most BORING game I'd ever had the displeasure of watching. The most interesting thing about that game was Oregon's footwear.), I now feel confident that the Grind falls squarely on "A-OK". You know how sometimes you get so used to associating one thing with another thing, you start to mentally associate them even if the second thing is missing? Like Affliction shirts and being a huge douchebag. You could be a very nice person. A gentleman and a scholar. But if you talk to me with a shirt that has holographic angel wings on the back, it will be absolutely impossible for me to get the thought of you being a huge douchebag out of my head long enough to give you a fair chance. Maybe that's me being judgmental, but I prefer to think of it as excellent time management. Who has time to get to know everyone?This is kind of how I felt about the burgers at the Grind the first time I visited. Their whole shtick is they grill them in a bajillion degree oven, which gives the patty a charred finish. I tend to associate this charred taste with "dry, overcooked burger", and it was hard to get over that association the first time I visited.  However, on my last visit I came to the conclusion that just because the outside has that interesting almost-burnt flavor, the inside is still actually quite juicy and delicious.  Not to mention, the toppings for this particular burger (I had the Sweet and Spicy both times) are spectacular. So, yes, even though it took two visits, I finally did acquire a taste for the Grind's burgers and now I can say I'm a fan.However, it bothers the shit out of me when restaurants serve $10 burgers that don't come with a side of fries. Considering that potatoes are like the cheapest thing on the planet and french fries are possibly one of the most delicious food groups to ever exist, this should be standard practice. We did order a side of fries (a la cart), and they were good (not as crispy as I would have liked, but fair), but come on, nothing on the side of a $10 burger? At least Fez gives you a salad. I would have probably given the Grind 4 stars if it wasn't for this, but this review only comes with 3. The other one is a la cart, on the second page of the menu.Cool name + Cool Sports Bar + Cool burger + OBSCURE Location = 3.5 StarsHaving them bookmarked for awhile now, I decided it was time.  I had asked the bartender what was the most frequently ordered burger on the menu.  Without hesitation, I got a response of: the Sweet and Spicy.My bubble thoughts went to work: "Sweet + Beef = Potentially Disastrous"So, I probed the bartender on her take of the taste and assured me that the sweetness was going to be A-okay! Alas, I went for it!For sides I went with regular fries plus a cold, refreshing ice tea.  As time elapsed, the moment of truth arrived, the burger that made them famous on Bon Appetit Magazine.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=y2GXX-6hg6cZ67E5lbLIcABefore taking down this delicious work of art, I couldn't help but to admire the contrasting layers that was well put together.  Snap, snap, I tried to capture the best angle:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=aGGO64eLJtYt4ch4TVTnRABack to business, first bite into the burger, I was sold.  My worries of sweetness went away.  In fact, it was kind of faint but still bold enough to call it Sweet.  The Spicy aka Candied Jalapenos was just as light and noticeable.  If I was to order this again, I probably would prefer a little bit more heat! The other two ingredients that worked superbly well were the tempura fried ratatouille and fresh, green watercress!  The buns also played a critical role in its overall taste.  It was lightly buttered, toasted and slightly burnt to give it texture and that smoky taste.The only negative that stood out was in the patty.  While parts of it was semi-moist with some pink, the outer layer was evidently dry.  And actually, the fries was a bust, it was just too crispy and anti-fluffy.  No love on that.  Hence, a deduction of .5 stars!If there's one gourmet burger that I could have a craving for, it would have to be this Sweet and Spicy.  The bar has a stylish, contemporary finish to draw the sporty, trendy crowds with plenty of alcoholic options on tap.  The setup is well designed as patrons sitting in both the bar and booths can enjoy watching content on all the LCDs.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w?select=vhZuCNn94Cmq_PzpOvle7wAll their burgers run $10-11 exception of the Kobe which will cost you a little arm and leg of $17.  I love Kobe meat, so I may be tempted the next time.Happy Hour runs M-F, 4-6PM.The Grind is a strong contender in the burger wars. I had to try the Sweet and Spicy burger after hearing about the candied jalapeños, and it was so good I ordered it during a return visit. My only problem with the burger is that it is, in the words of Tiny Elvis, "huge". In order to feel halfway human after eating here, I really ought to split one with my dining partner. That will leave room for their incredible buffalo wings, which I've noticed have escaped mention in most Yelpers' reviews.Simply put, the wings here are exceptional. Although they only offer one flavor of hot wing, their take on the classic buffalo wing is a keeper. The sauce is bright and tangy (and I recommend ordering some of the wing sauce on the side as it would even make a flip-flop dipped in it taste AWESOME). What really completes the wings here is the char. I guess that bajillion-degree-oven really adds the finishing touch, as the burnt and smoky flavor that comes through is pure wing bliss.So I recommend if you go to The Grind, do try the burgers. But split the behemoth and save room for the wings. That way you won't need the Oompah-Loompahs to roll your bloated ass back to your car and you will have a dining experience to remember (and to salivate about, in retrospect).The Grind has grown into a nice little neighborhood bar.  Often, the wife and I will walk over there for a burger, fries and a tasty microbrew.  It's never too crowded, service is great and the food is pretty darn good.  They've expanded the menu over the years and perhaps next time I will try the wings.
Benedict's=After walking in, I wanted to be able to give more than 3 stars, I really did - it's a cute, clean but TINY place that completely belies the strip mall location.The good: My fresh berry crepes were wonderful!  Two crepes, stuffed full and topped with a night light crème fraîche - and the berries truly were fresh - delectable!  My wife enjoyed the pancakes, though they were not especially notable beyond that - good size, and done as expected.The cramped: I did mention this place was tiny, right?  Yeah, we were squeezed in to a table next to a hutch that had the silent radio and cookbooks and a little display.  The radio was turned on a little after we got there, which did warm up the place a bit, but couldn't cover that we were literally twisting to stay in our seats and not bump our neighbors while eating.  It will likely get better if they can get a couple tables outside as the temps drop, but for now, I'll skip if there's not elbow room.The place does have some charm, and I'll be back to see how it matures, and to try the eponymous dish.
Pomegranate Cafe=Quite a while back I found out Pomegranate Cafe was coming to Ahwatukee and I was pretty stoked being that there really isn't much in the way of vegetarian fare around here. I joined the mailing list and anxiously anticipated their opening.Well, I never got any kind of notification that they opened, which seems weird, but whatevs. I ended up stumbling across PC on the way to Star of India for lunch the other day and I was stoked! Finally! I popped in asking for a to-go menu.. but they didn't have one. Oh, okay, well.. is your menu online? "nope, everything is seasonal so we don't update." hmmmm.... Okay, maybe I'll check back after lunch.So we pop back in to grab a coffee after some Indian grub. The menu looks good and they have vegan pastries. Right on. I'll go with the soy coconut latte and Dally G. went with some iced spicy chai tea thing. Well, we waited 12 minutes to get our drinks, even though there were only two other customers there, and what a disappointment. My latte was so bland and his tea was just... wrong.I wasn't pleased with the actual place (weird setup... and incredibly uninviting), neither of our drinks tasted good, the wait was excessive, and it was definitely up there cost wise.PC - I unfortunately think you are striking out. Hopefully there are enough self conscious soccer mom's in Ahwatukee to keep you going because I love the idea, it just falls flat.Sorry!This review is a two with a burning desire for five...I want this place to succeed like I want a million bucks. I have never operated a food-providing establishment but I suspect it's quite difficult. But I've consumed a lot of food and beverage. My recommendation to this sweet little Pomegranate Cafe is don't skimp on the ingredients. I haven't eaten there but I had a spicy chai. One of my favorite places in town is called Sens and they have a drink called the Hot and Dirty. This drink takes a sledge hammer and hits you in the chest. Then it spits on you and its friends are dragging him away because they hear cop sirens in the distance. I don't even know if I like the taste or not but the experience is so powerful it is literally "an experience" to drink it. The way you described your drink and the way it came to me was abortive. I mean that in a "trying to be helpful way." Sincerely. Punch me in the face with this supposed spicy cayenne. I know, you said it's a hint. But I'm a man. Subtly is dust in the wind. Be better. I'll be back. Please try this place. I want it to win. One final thing. Get new lids IMMEDIATELY. First sip soaked me and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt.I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!Had lunch here for the first time and was pleased to know that everything is organic and vegan unless you choose to add dairy or eggs to the meal. I ordered the Smokey Tempeh B.L. T. (see pics) First of all the portion was HUGE! Generous helping of Exotic Veggie Chips and a side salad along with a sprinkling of cherries Plus this Amazing Sandwich. I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!! Seriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds. My salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking. I'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home. 4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....Here's my take on the burger:The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a "traditional" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef.Unfortunately I have to do a review update that is not good for Pom Cafe. I really, really wanted to enjoy this place the second time around and give them another shot, but I'm totally disappointed.First off, they got my order wrong and only sent one sandwich instead of the two I ordered. They just combined the two together. It didn't even make sense.Second, when my receptionist got there, they left out two items and had to call her back to come pick them up. By the time she went back and got the food they forgot to give her, everything arrived back at the office cold and the bread was soggy. The side of "crispy tofu" we ordered was not crispy at all. Overall everyone at the office thought their food was okay, but not great...  probably because everything arrived cold and limp... and for an $8.50 egg mc-muffin sandwich, I'm certainly hoping for better than okay.  I don't plan on going back. :-(Hi everybody!This is a tough review for me because I shop at trader joes almost exclusively and my wife and I watched and waited for this restaurant to open. Granted it has been open for awhile it took us some time to get to it. I am not really sure it was open many times as we passed and were hungry. Finally we checked the menu and CHACHING!So we moved it to the top of the list for trying and we were excited to come. As we only eat out on shopping day. Maybe too much. As usual whenever we eat at any restaurant we asked our "vegan" questions. We were told that someone there was a vegan nazi and if it says vegan it is, and this is very good. I will say that i do trust that Pomegranate Cafe serves what they say they serve and the food was very high quality and very delicious. We shared the lentil burger ($12) that was on the menu board behind the counter. I really wanted to try the desserts but decided to wait till next time.Everything was going great and we waited patiently for our food. Granted it was busy so it took a little time and this also is ok. Here is where my problems begin. Bellieve me I do not want to give ANY business ANY time only 2 stars.  Trust me i just don't and i feel bad for doing so however, I did say on my profile that the reviews i do are very important to me. I am the kind of person who does not mince words and you will know where you stand with me. If i see something i do not like i will say so.  That being saidNow I will say that I have worked in the restaurant industry since i was 16. I have done every side job known to everyone who has set foot into a kitchen. (explained later) I have helped build business for many. Though I do not have any degrees or anything I have seen many meals being sent to customers in many differents ways, and styles. Some were good, some were bad, some were happy, some were mad. But they all ate and they either came back or they didn't. Currently I work in not one but two very popular digs. I work very hard to make sure my customers are happy, and i know how hard it is to work in a small family place. I worked at a local chinese restaurant for 6 years and barely got  a day off.Do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the food here. my issue is with one small thing or two. Why does a new business in the realm of Pomegranate (a higher class cafe which serves vegan food) charge a plate splitting fee which i believe was $2.00. Then give us our food on a paper plate. Please, this is ridiculous. We always split our food no matter where we go. It is pratically the only way you can stay healthy these days. Not to mention we believe that there was no more food for this charge. (for example: if there were more chips or pickles or fruit, then i do not have a problem with this fee. however I would say when asked to split. " OK, no problem, however there will be a $?.?? charge, and for that you will recieve ....) if i would have known this i would have gotten it to go and this review would be totally different. And in my humble opinion it is not a good idea to charge this fee in an uber difficult restaurant "genre".  Believe me there are lots of people like me who want food like this. Do not make it harder on yourself by adding on fees which really are not necessary! Are you not making enough money off of $0.25 worth of lentils?I also have to say that I had trouble choosing something to eat from the menu, because many things were scratched off. ???? Were they out of that item? I think the thing that bothered me about this was there were so many that i wanted to try but could not. I saw many that had promise, as I am a vegan nazi and i really was stoked to eat here. It is my kind of place almost to a t. Too bad that did not work out.Now for the side job part. While we waited for our food i noticed that this restaurants dining room was not very clean. the floor looked as if it had not been cleaned for a few days, the windows were very dirty, and the window sills were covered, and i mean covered in dust. Complete with cobwebs. From what i could tell the kitchen was clean. Here is how I see it. Please do not serve a $14.50 burger on a paper plate EVER! To me this says that the staff does not want to do dishes, If something is on your menu keep it there, when people find something they like they will come back no matter how much it costs if they know it will be there. Clean your dining room! it is uber, uber ,uber important that your customers see a clean dining room. it does not take that long and it will go very far impressing your customers, especially when you are first getting started. When a restaurant does not take the time to clean thier dining room they most likely are not cleaning thier kitchen as well. I hope this is not the case with Pomegranate because I really would like to try more food here. I only will know by stopping by again. Thank for reading. Late,GregWe were really happy with our first visit to Pomegranate.We went in for Sunday breakfast, and were very piqued by the menu and everything else this place has to offer. It's almost too much to take in at first--as you glance around, you see lots of interesting stuff that could take a while to explore. The unique menu aside, they have many types of tea and a great selection of coffee. The best part of the menu is that everything is fresh, and most things are configurable with different options depending on whether you're vegan.I got the breakfast burrito, which is available with egg or tofu. I got tofu and the vegan cheese. I had a little moment with the cashier when I ordered coffee with cream. See, I'm not a vegan but I was trying the whole vegan experience to see how everything tastes. As soon as I said I wanted cream in my coffee, I realized the paradox and my folly. He kindly offered me vegan options and I chose soy cream after putting his mind at ease and letting him know I was just a vegan poseur. My wife got the french toast.Hey, at least I don't claim to be vegan and go around sneaking bacon whenever it suits me.Everything came out within a reasonable amount of time and was absolutely a home run. The burrito was so damned good that I considered eating the three beans I had dropped on the table. It came with fruit and a fresh pico de gallo type thing whose ingredients remain a mystery, but it was delicious.Some criticisms I've read in here are understandable, and in the end this place isn't for everyone. If it gets busy, I could see the food taking a while, but this is a place where everything is made from fresh ingredients. It would take me an hour at home to make the burrito I had this morning. All in all, I don't give out 5-star ratings often, but this place is deserving. If you want a fresh, delicious meal, whether you are vegan or not, and like a friendly, casual, non-pretentious atmosphere, check it out.The Pomegranate Café was recently named "Best New Restaurant" by Phoenix Magazine, which is a lifestyle rag for urbanites with dollars to burn.  The restaurant in question is in Chandler, home to many of these people.However, Pomegranate Café is family-owned and vegan-friendly, so I had to check it out.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian and can be made vegan.  There are also gluten-free and raw options, so there's something for everybody.  The restaurant serves breakfast foods like tofu scrambles, French toast, and breakfast burritos, but when I went, I chose a vegan BLT from their lunch menu.  It was made with delicious smoky tempeh "bacon," and the addition of avocado was nice.  My hot date ordered a pesto sandwich, which he declared pasty but tasty.  Neither sandwich was huge, but they come with a spinach-pomegranate salad and some veggie chips.  You get a full plate of food, and everything is extremely fresh, but I wasn't too stoked on the salad, though my hot date liked it.  It would have been nice to have a choice of sides, like some fries or potato salad or something, but that was not the case.We also split a berry smoothie, which was pretty tasty.  It was no tsoynami, but...what is?  They also had a good selection of vegan desserts, such as cookies, donut holes, cakes and even cheesecake.  We got a slice of chocolate cake topped with pomegranate seeds to go, and it was delicious.  It's so rare to find dairy- and egg-free desserts.The atmosphere was bright, clean and cheerful.  It was an enjoyable meal for sure.  My main gripe about the place brings me right back to my first paragraph: everything was sooo damn expensive.  Sandwiches are $8-$12, the smoothie was friggin' $7, and the slice of cake was $6.  So, if you wanna splurge and try a new vegan place on the far east side of town, it's definitely worth a try.  But unless you're one of those rich people that can afford things, you might want to bring a friend and split some stuff.  The food is tasty, but I don't think I'll go back because I wouldn't dream of spending that kind of money on a meal these days.12/15/10Cool bright, happy colors w/ a hippy-chic atmosphere.  Enticing-looking natural "treats" everywhere you look- cupcakes, brownies, cookies, energy bars, and fruits.  There seemed to be only one cook and one cashier/helper that day of my first and only visit (so far!), both eager to be of help w/ my questions on the ingredients of their fare.  The coffee, though expensive (or so I thought, at $3 a cup, no refills), was very good, and came w/ a tiny bit of homemade cranberry-pistachio biscotti- delicious!  I enjoyed the Berry Pepita French toast, which consisted of bread made w/ a house seed mix, and loaded w/ raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, plus slices of kiwi, apple, and garnishes of grapefruit!  I believe PC offered blue agave syrup as their pancake syrup, but I didn't need it, as the fruit provided most of the sweetness I needed.  (I did whip out reserve bottle of 100% maple syrup from my bag...)  This gratifying breakfast kept me full, w/out feeling bloated, for more than seven hours!Why I haven't returned, which I promised myself I would the next couple of days, I don't know... Perhaps on my next "weekend" off!4.5 Stars.Over the past few months I have given Pomegranate Cafe another try, or two, or three... and I have been very pleased with the improvement in their menu, the service, the speed, and the food itself. Everything in the restaurant is vegan and can be made vegetarian which means I can eat anything there... heck yes! They even have a wide variety of raw items including desserts.They have all-day breakfast and are always posting delicious looking brunch items on the weekend (Facebook). I haven't made it for a weekend brunch, but it is on my list.My favorite items have to be the Lumberjack sandwich, the southwest mac n cheese, the hibiscus cooler, and the cowgirl cookies. They are in the middle of a remodel right now, doubling their space, and the past two times I have been in there the place has been absolutely packed... so I'm not the only one taking notice of this great spot :-)Keep up the good work, PC!So... I think Pomegranate and I might have more than a spring fling. I don't want to jinx it, but this could be really serious. I introduced Pomegranate to my mom, my best friends, and even my current boyfriend, but everyone agrees, they can see me spending the rest of my life with Pomegranate. Here's my recount of our classic love story, one dish at a time.I knew I'd fallen after tasting the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast (griddle-dipped banana bread, drizzled in rhubarb sauce, strawberries, and topped with cream) Then, the Tiramisu (coconut-based espresso, cream, and date-nut crust layers) sent me head over heels. The Breakfast Burrito left me satisfied, but didn't create that same spark that the flavorful Ranchero Skillet once did. Luckily, the hemp milk latte and famous cowgirl cookie quickly helped me remember why I committed to Pomegranate in the first place.Our relationship moved to a new level - raw - a few months ago. The rainbow wrap was ridiculously huge and filling (much more so than the basic, but tasty, Mediterranean wrap). It was almost more than I could handle. I tossed the bland Indian sweet potato hummus it came with and focused on what really mattered... finishing the wrap. I cared too much not to. After stuffing myself into oblivion, Pomegranate surprised me with a coffee-choco-nana & coconut milk ice cream shake afterward... topped with crushed chocolate-almond pillows. Within seconds of my first spoonful, the fire was back, and burning hotter than ever.Shortly afterwards, I fell into a confused rut, messing around with vegan meats and cheeses of all varieties. The southwestern mac 'n' cheese, much like the Philly cheese steak, tantalized me with its decadence, but left me feeling sick and low afterwards. Even the delicious, nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl, brimming with sprouts, veggies and quinoa, was only posing as Mr. Right. Tainted by the presence of faux-chicken, I shied away after only two rendezvouses. Not even dessert could lure me back, for both the chocolate cake (dry) and almond butter square (boring) were a disappointment.It was all my fault. What was I thinking? A few weeks later, I rushed back, determined to mend the gaping hole in my heart. I downed the mushroom bisque and half a pesto presto sandwich (Kamut baguette, fresh avocado, pesto, fresh veggies) in under five minutes. Oh, how I missed the fresh ingredients, the whole foods, the homemade flavor in every bite. Still, I needed some sugar after being away. Lucky for me, the Cannoli (brûlée'd sugar shell, cashew cream filling, dark chocolate chips, and berry sauce), not only provided that, but was better than any Cannoli I'd ever had. And I've had a fair share of Cannolis in my day. What more can a girl ask for? Pomegranate, I do.10/06/12Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a "female hormonal concoction" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was "grape seed oil extract."  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to "flavor" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!I'll be back!I got a lemonade and a burger.It was $26.No thank you.WAYYYYYYYYYYY too $$ for what I got.Local, Fresh, Organic, Vegan, Raw. Healthy indulgence at its finest. Finally . . . A little slice of Unprocessed Heaven in Ahwatukee! My favorite? The Sizzlin' Sesame Salad! Mixed greens, vibrant purple cabbage, tofu, brown rice, broccoli and carrot, topped off with chili almonds and orange miso dressing. Very unique. Southwestern Mac and Cheese and the Bountiful Bowls were great too, just a little heavy for a work day. Raw Almond Joy bars are delicious; even better than the original. OMG!!!!! So good.   Adorable décor! Nice remodel and expansion.   Staff is always super friendly, and the owner(s) will come around and chat with you personally which is always nice to see. Just don't be a jackass and bring in food from Los Dos Molinos (or anywhere else)! Don't let the vegan / vegetarian labels scare you - there's something for everyone at Pomegranate!First and foremost, I am not a vegan or vegetarian (I did have a little stint back in high school during my XXX hardcore days, but that's another  story). I enjoy eating meat. However, I do enjoy Vegan/vegetarian food as well which drew me to Pomegranate Cafe when I lived on the east side. To be honest, Pomegranate Cafe is an acquired taste.  It's not for everyone as with most restaurants similar. The food is organic and non processed and most dishes I have tried has an "earthy" taste.  The juices are freshly made and is exactly that JUICE. No additives, sugars necessary.  You get the full nutrients from the food you're eating/drinking. Whenever I come here (2-3 times/mo), I usually get the Lumberjack, hearty and delicious. I get it vegan even though a non vegan is available (when in Rome).  I also order the Abundance, a mean unpleasant looking green juice that is beyond delicious.  If I have room, as the portions are generous, I'll share dessert with friends.   As I've stated earlier, this place is not for everyone.  The prices are on the higher side, but for what you get, it's well worth it. Can you spend the same amount of money and get 25 cheeseburgers from McDonalds? Sure. If that's the case, then you have wasted your time reading this review. If you want a different culinary experience with healthy food, knowledgable staff, and relaxed ambiance, then give Pomegranate a try!My husband and I are just a joy to cook for. He's gluten and dairy intolerant, and I'm a vegetarian. Pomegranate Cafe has us both covered with numerous menu choices plus a great dessert case.I first tried this place with Laura L., and I was delighted with the lumberjack sandwich (tofu and regular cheese) and sweet potato hash . The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30. Perhaps Pomegranate Cafe isn't a great value, but all the food is delicious. It's an excellent choice for those of us with special diets.I love pomegranate seeds so why would Pomegranate Cafe be any different? This little mix matched spot is adorable, it's what my Pinterest boards dream to look like. Wooden tables, chairs with fresh words on them, mason jars EVERYWHERE and all fresh ingredients to boot.    I've had a sun warrior smoothie and the Raw! Tacos which were to die for. The walnut meat was spicy and delicious wrapped up in cabbage leaves. I'm hooked on their food pairings and the vibe they give off. P. S. Their dessert selection is to die for. Lemon bars? Gluten free goodness.Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the "order here" sign. I got up and asked, "is this where I order?". They responded, "wherever....". It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink. Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.I've never seen a place with such confused employees. I mean, who can't say whether its seat yourself or not? Who can't say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter? Ridiculous.Let me explain something to you: I am a man. I like to eat MEAT, and I don't want some fru-fru ingredients that I've never heard about. Don't try to serve me brocolini - just give me broccoli. Or better yet, just give me a small tree because I am a man and when I eat, I mean business.Due to this, I avoided the Pomegranate Cafe for a long time, because what am I going to do with a tofu burrito? That's not real food. And a taco made with walnut meat? Walnuts aren't meat - they're wood. I don't want that.Anyway, my wife talked me into coming here, and I have to take everything back. This place has serious flavor - flavor that would scare lesser men. I had a burrito without any meat in it - not even eggs, and it was both filling, and really, really delicious. Also, they have some pretty wild deserts here, so even if you're not willing to try bread made of cauliflower, try the chocolate cake, or even better - the banana cake.Do know that they are slow - like... extremely slow. If you have the time, it's worth it, but don't come here if you've got somewhere to be afterwards.Also, they have fake bacon, which is nothing like real bacon. I'm not saying it's bad - just don't order it if you're like me and expect what you're used to.Other than that, enjoy! And I recommend sitting outside - they've got a lovely patio and a basket full of squirt bottles to ward off any adventurous birds.FINALLY, The Funk has come back to South Phoenix.Have you ever done something one day and was more upset the next day about what you did? Well that's how I feel about dropping $45 on Pomegranate cafe for a late veggie lunch - solo. (I can imagine the heads shaking from all the carnivores. That's steak money, right?) Yeah, I feel ya'. My support for veggie eateries is quickly waning. They are over-priced and can be quite pretentious with the creativity.So, I was down south on a hot afternoon and really worked up a sweat. I remembered reading that Pomegranate Cafe sold fresh juice and was located somewhere near 40th St and Chandler Blvd. Had I known to look for the shopping center with Safeway and two doors down from Trader Joes....Landmarks, folks! Very important when giving directions.... PC's white and pink sign is a tad dull against the building. If I wasn't specifically looking for the cafe, I probably would have missed it and gone somewhere else to eat. But anyway, I walked in, grabbed all the menus (regular, HH, and juice bar), and had a seat. (Only order at the counter if you want take-away). Asked for a juice right away and despite the "slow service" comments that other reviewers have posted, I wasn't too bothered by the several minutes it took for juice to make its way to my table. I pushed aside water and guzzled it down. Aahhh. I could feel, see, hear, smell, sense, taste, perceive the essence of life coursing through my veins. That must be the feeling Popeye gets  after eating spinach (mmmm, love those greens).Why only three stars for PC?One for just being veggie +One for being freshly made +One for serving fresh juice Fresh juice was the best part of my afternoon. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered off the regular menu like an idiot and hit myself later for not giving the happy hour menu a chance. Could've saved myself half the price. Truth be told - I should've stopped with the juice, paid the bill, and walked away. But, ooh, I spied with my little eye jackfruit tacos and jackfruit sliders. - BBQ jackfruit sliders (3) for $12: jackfruit, peppers, onions, jalapeno cabbage slaw, chimichurri on bun. Even though I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side, the jackfruit itself had a sickly sweetness that cancelled my enjoyment. What I really liked, though, were the silver dollar-sized buns. - Jamaican jerk street tacos (3) for $12: jerk seasoned jackfruit, cabbage slaw, pico, baja sauce, chimichurri on corn tortillas. Did that say jamaican? Show me the jerk who thought of that because wurnt no part of those tacos Jamaican. Spicy? Nope. All I could taste was that sickly sweet jackfruit. Created and tasted exactly like the sliders.  The jackfruit wasn't prepared the way I'm used to having it. In fact I couldn't even tell that it was jackfruit by sight because it was mixed with other stuff and only one spoonful of it was buried under the mounds of cabbage slaw and sauce.When I mentioned the sweetness to the two staff members who checked on me they blamed the jackfruit. Really? I know what jackfruit tastes like. Even when fresh it's not overly sweet. Either this jackfruit was sweetened and then packaged, or one of PC's sauces used in the dishes was too sweet. Won't order it again. - For dezzert, a slice of tropical cake. Good cake, real cake, but could have used more tropics and less sugary lemon frosting. AGAIN with the sweetness.Overall, PC's dishes are very colourful and look beautiful. I'll try a wrap and/or salad next time, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again any time soon.  Four items averaged to about $10 apiece, then tax and probably a surcharge for a take out box.  You would think that would have filled me up, but actually I stopped somewhere else on the way back to central Phoenix.I've been here a bunch and the food is always delicious. It's a bit on the pricey side for veggie fare, but I just tell myself I'm back in Los Angeles and get to enjoying my iced Pom milk latte with my $14 breakfast bowl. The coffee is really great, especially when it includes their house blended non-dairy milk. I tend to like the breakfast options more than lunch, the Pom Muffin, bowls, and scrambles always well cooked and tasty. For lunch, the nachos....are not good so avoid those, and get one of the salads, bowls, or sandwiches instead. Service can be a tad spastic, and you do have the sense that the regulars get way better service post-yoga class than any newbies in town. They have a lovely pastry/dessert case up front, too, so grab a gluten free power bar, a cup of coffee, and get prepared to eavesdrop on people extolling the virtues of hot yoga and wheat grass.
Bachi Burger=This is in my 'hood and I came in really wanting to be WOW'd by the place. But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.Service 101 memory lane.1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out "Hello" or "Goodbye" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something.BUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.What's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, "Hello! We'll be right with you!"2) Bus the tables, immediately.It's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables.Again... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, "Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!"Great.But just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables. When I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.What really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs.Hey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you.Better yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.3) Know the menu.I've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating.We're not at McDonald's. 5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.Finally... for the food.....I had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.The truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try. Pork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.What was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.The potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.If I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.I know these guys are new and working out the kinks. I really want to love this place so I'll come back in a month or so to see if the service has changed and when I do, I'll update this review.NEVER AGAIN. I would end the review there because I refuse to spend more time on this place (and hope that no one else wastes their time either) but I guess this deserves some explanation. Got here a little before 1 PM and was seated with the boyfriend. We were handed menus by a girl who said, "Uhhh I'll let you have a minute to look this over and then send someone over." Uh oh. Already knew that no one had any clue what they were doing and could already tell this was not going to be a good indication of what was to come. 5-10 minutes go by and we haven't even gotten drinks yet - or have been able to order them for that matter. We push our menus to the side and gaze at the workers behind the counter to see if someone is going to wait on us. A guy finally comes by and takes our order after explaining that there was some issue with the computer. Rule #1: The customer doesn't care what is wrong. We are just hungry. Let us order and just apologize quickly for the wait. When I ordered my edamame I physically had to point to the item on the menu since he wasn't sure which of the three I ordered. No, I'm not kidding. 5 minutes after ordering we finally get our drinks - water. Yes it took about 20 minutes to get water. About 5 minutes after that we get our edamame. It doesn't look like the truffle oil and garlic oil edamame I ordered and I ask him if this is the correct one. He says yes and walks off. Well guess what? It wasn't. It was the chili one. I physically pointed to the menu which one I wanted, then ask as it is set down if it is the correct one, and it's not? It's not like there are 100 different edamames on the menu - there are three. Had to get his attention to get us a new batch which came out a lot quicker this time. It was good, but had too much garlic oil that overpowered the truffle oil, and it was way too oily. Each piece was dripping - not too appetizing. The waiter comes by a couple minutes later to give us the sweet potato fries (which were very very good, although I didn't like the sauce too much) to tell us our food is ready but they're waiting on the pickles. WTF? Then he tells us he is going on break and someone else will be covering our table. Right. Food comes out a couple minutes later. The grilled cheese I got was okay, but totally not worth $7. Matt got a Ronin burger which he thought was alright as well but didn't like some of the mix of flavors. The same waiter who I guess didn't go on break comes by and asks us if we want dessert which we say no, and then asks us if we want the check and hands it to us. We walk up to the counter to pay and I hand it to the girl there and say I am going to be paying cash. SHE WALKS OFF. SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF WITH NO EXPLANATION TO GET FOOD AT THE COUNTER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Our waiter comes by a minute later, my mouth agape and I pay and get out of there. I said in a previous review that Macaroni Grill was the worst service I have ever had, but this takes the cake. I would rather exclusively eat at the Macaroni Grill for the rest of my life than return to Bachi Burger. All in all it took us over an HOUR to have what at other places would be a quick 30-40 minute lunch. No one knows what the hell they are doing and they also seem like they don't care either. The food was alright, but not enough to make me ever come back with that kind of service or lack thereof. Jesus Tap-dancing Christ on a cracker, if you hold your sanity dear to your heart do not go to this place because the service is absolutely appalling and I refuse to return to this establishment because of it.With all these glowing reviews, we finally hauled our bootays over to the other side of town to try it.  Boy, were we satisfied!-Apple Lychee Soda - way too sweet for my taste.  however, for those sweet drink lovers, this had plenty of lychee flavor.-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Didn't care much for the sundried tomato aioli on the side, but these truffle fries are the best I've had outside of a gourmet restaurant.  They stayed crispy and salty with just enough of the truffle parm aroma and taste.-Garlic Salt & Pepper French Fries - I didn't enjoy this as much.  I've had really bomb diggity salt & pepper flavor at other Asian restaurants on various other accompaniments.  So in comparison,it could have used more flavor blast.-Kalbi Burger - This was great!  The flavors of a kalbi short rib in a burger patty made it super flavorful and the patty was juicy.  The kimchi inside gave it that extra tangy and spicy kick.  The pickled cucumber panchan on the side was good.-The Crusty Crab -  I enjoyed the crab cake inside, but I did not enjoy the mango chutney paired with it.  That's probably me just being biased because I generally don't like salty + super sweet together.-The Lonely Bird - This was actually really enjoyable also.  Chicken and Turkey usually scream "i'm-too-healthy-don't-eat-me," but the Herb Pesto sauce made it moist and flavorful.-BBQ Bachi Burger 5 oz American Wagyu - This was just a regular burger combination, but what made it stand out was the wonderful bbq flavor char and juicy burger patty.  Bravo, Bachi burger.  Bravo.Vietnamese Coffee - I quote my friend, "nasty," and she's the queen of drinking Vietnamese coffeeConclusion:  Fun, flavorful and juicy burgers with above average fries.  Tip:  If you can help it, go before lunch time rush because I can see how it can get to be a little touch and go with the service.  We came right before the lunch time rush, so service was decent right up until the lunch time rush started and we were waiting forever for one Vietnamese coffee.Big ups to my ninja, Reid.  I'd be down to donate blood to you, you iron deficient sumbitch.  I promise it'll make you smarter, faster, stronger, but won't increase the length or girth of your.....sentences?If you're a strict cheeseburger purist, I got one thing to say to you, put an egg in your shoe and beat it.  This place puts an asian touch on burgers (I use the term 'touch' because the term 'fusion' should only be used when speaking about coitus).Ok, so I'm only going to talk (type up) about the burgers only.  It's Friday and I don't feel like doing anything and I'm sure you don't feel like reading any more than you have to.  I'm glad we have agreed upon this arrangement.  Let's shake on it to make it official.The Ronin Burger is aptly named.  The Ronin were samurai with no lord back in the day.  In this case, think of the patty as the Samurai.  Even with all the ingredients used in describing this burger, it stood alone.  No master, or in this case, ingredient to follow.  Not a bad thing.  The burger was still good.  Though description of it would lead you to think it was going to be layered with different flavors and whatnot.The Kalbi burger is like eating Korean BBQ in burger form.  And much like eating the actual Korean BBQ, you'll be burping this up all the way home on that picturesque drive on the 15 southbound.  I would've never have thought about putting kimchee in a burger.  This was better executed than Sadam Hussein was.  You know, with his head all on the ground rolling around and whatnot.I'll take a couple of those Portuguese donuts for the road. Thanks.Met up with a couple of friends that live nearby here and had a great dinner.  Started with 3 orders of fries for the appetizer (not my idea but hey..sure!).  All of them were tasty and went well with Asahi..garlic salt and pepper, truffle parmesan and sweet potato fries.  On a sidenote...has any restaurant truly found a good dipping sauce for sweet potato fries??  I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..it's all just chemicals isn't it?  I got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread. Will definitely be back!Celebrating the Husband's birthday (two months ago), we were looking for somewhere new that was children-friendly and had a variety of things to order.  Bachi Burger was his place of choice.  I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there.  Once everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit.  Since the Ronin Burger "Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma,  Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger "Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share.  The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite.  Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different.  One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger.  He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).I started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean "Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food.  It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy!  It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!You can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries "Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli" ($4).  It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.Another thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries "Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli" ($4).  They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.The kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken "Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce." ($6) that they ordered a second round.To close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts "Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato" ($5) with a birthday candle in it.  (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.)  They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it.  The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.Service - we got the waiter that everyone talks about.  He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong.  You can't blame the guy for trying, right?  They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter.  Overall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.  3.5 starsThis is one of the best burger places in town! I have been here about ten times in the past couple months probably, and I am still satisfied and trying everything on the menu!  If you like the whole Asian-style burgers, you will have to try this! Oh, and don't forget to try the Oxtail chili-cheese fries! To die for!!After reading numerous reviews on Yelp about Bachi Burger I was finally in the area around lunch time so I stopped in for a to-go order. The reviews on Yelp made it clear that Bachi Burger had two areas they could improve in: Service and speed. Since I was on my lunch break I didn't have all day to wait for my order, so I asked how long it would take before I even looked at the menu. 10-15 minutes is what I was told by a pretty friendly employee.I decided to get Kiki's Burger, sweet potato fries and a cantaloupe milk tea with boba... Total was a little under $20, isn't Micky D's that's for damn sure! My drink was made immediately and it was so tasty, my first cantaloupe milk tea definitely will not be my last! My food really did take 10-15 minutes. No complaints at all on the service, I was treated respectfully and they got me on my way pretty quickly.Kiki's Burger comes with cheese, two types of mushrooms, bacon, an onion marmalade that was nice and sweet and a sauce on the side that I did not bother with. It was cooked perfectly, medium as I was told they recommended it. What a great combination of flavors! I would absolutely order this again. The real standout was the sweet potato fries though. I shared some with my co-worker because I know how much she likes sweet potato fries and she told me that these were "Off the hook, best she ever had". I agree with her. So I'm not sure about some of these negative reviews. Has Bachi Burger stepped their game up in recent months? Did I happen to go at the right day and time? Or were people just too critical? Not sure, I think I will need to go back to Bachi Burger again to find out.Freaking A!  What a place, what a place!  I just can't get over how exotic and flavorful everything is here so far!  A friend from out of town came in and first on our list was Bachi Burger!  Like the last time, the place was pretty empty, not too busy, but the one thing my gf and I spotted was a new burger!*The Shogun Burger* (not on the website) $23Features the Wagyu beef, eel, poached pear, and foie gras! Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.We also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.Another great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!i don't even know where to begin. 3 hours later i am still, happily, in a food coma. a turkey burger hangover.After Jesse B.'s review with the awesome sweet potato fries, bachi burger has been on Dan T.'s and my list to eat. We lucked out and even convinced his parents to venture out and try this place with us. Melissa was our server tonight. She was very nice and helpful. went over everything with us and even told us a little background on bachi burger. We started with some chicken karaage, oxtail chili cheese fries (complete with a fried egg on top,) and edamame. out of all three i highly recommend the chicken karaage. so crispy and tasteful. and that sauce. i don't even know what it was but i was loving it. the oxtail chili cheese fries had jalapenos all over them, but they were not spicy whatsoever. more sweet actually. they were still good and i enjoyed them.moving onto our actual meals i ordered the lonely bird burger protein style. a chicken and turkey patty combined? I'll take it! the pesto sauce on it was quite lovely and i won't deny that i wiped that little saucer clean of it. i tried a bite of Dan's cheeseburger with bacon and was quite pleased but i will stick with my lonely bird personally. we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. my choice was to order the truffle parmesan and i wasn't TOO impressed with them for the mere fact that about only 6 or 7 fries actually had the truffle sauce on them. all the others were pretty basic but still good to dip in the sun dried tomato sauce. I'd go for the sweet potato fries over those. the sweet potato's were crispy and packed with sweet potato flavor. i didn't feel the need to dip those in any of the fancy sauces.needless to say, after all that yummy food we were all too stuffed to order dessert. I will be back though to try some of those little donuts with some ice cream and maybe sneak in a coffee. I was pleased. thank you bachi burger for filling my little stomach and putting me in this food coma.After a day of slingin cookies for Rise Up Japan, I needed some fuel. I am rarely on this side of town and this has been on the list of curiosities for a while.The BF and I shared:Ronin ($8,Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli) - from the description, you can clearly see there was a lot going on. Somehow it worked for me but I think it's because those are familiar flavors I would find in a bento lunch but I know for some folks this won't work. It was very rich  specially when you're biting through the egg yolk area. You didn't need the yuzu aioli sauce served on the side (I ended up dipping fries in it). Both the BF and I were glad we split since neither of us can really eat a whole of that flavor. KiKi ($8, Sautéed Shiitake & Eryngi mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Ciabatta Bun, Garlic Chili Aioli on the side ) I love me mushroom and onion burgers and happy that they were generous on the onions and mushrooms in it. I did use the chili aioli to add a bit of zing to it to balance the rich earthiness and sweetness of the toppings.Truffle Fries ($4)- they drizzle a bit of truffle gravy on the fries but I wish they just give you that on the side. The fries were crisp and light and well seasoned. They had a bunch of different drinks and I respect their nicely selected craft beers, but I was just feeling on a simple and refreshing matcha ice green tea. Overall, service was friendly and decent with keeping up on the drinks. I liked the sweet bun on the burger. I thought the meat was good quality, juicy and cooked right. I think the concept is good and I am curious to try more of their offerings. However, I don't think I would drive all the way from the NW to come down to eat here. If we're in Town Square I think this will be something I'd much rather go to instead of eating in the mall.Forget everything you knew or thought you knew about the burger when you go to Bachi. These burgers are gourmet creations deserving of the high praise that has been bestowed upon this little restaurant since it opened. Maybe for those who like their burgers with the standard mayo and ketchup, Bachi burgers may be too intense, have too many exotic ingredients or may be on the pricey side. But for those who want to tickle their tastebuds with explosive flavors, Bachi is the place for you. Reading over the menu, a couple of the signature burgers called out to me, but in the end, I ordered the Bachi Fish- Furikake-sprinkled Marinated Seared Cod, Tartar Sauce, Lettuce, Onion, Tomato, Bubu Arare Rice Crackers in between a pillow-soft bun. The fish size was nice and meaty, and I loved the sweet soy-sauce marinade (a cross between Teriyaki/Kalbi) that gave the cod wonderful flavor. The tomato, onion and lettuce were fresh, and the mini rice cracker balls were fun to eat. Pretty to look at, but even better when eaten. I also enjoyed the Iced Barley Tea (unlimited refills). The waiter made frequent trips to make sure my glass was never empty. Speaking of the waiter, the service here was good. I have no complaints. I only have one question: When can I go again?As the flavors of my Green and Blue burger flavors burst into my mouth I secretly thought this was most definitely the best burger I have eaten. But, I should clarify that this isn't the best burger-tasting burger. It's just an amazing cornucopia of flavors that all seem to come together as one to create a complete sense of food satisfaction.The Green and Black burger was made with grass fed beef and topped with bacon, blue cheese, mushrooms and spinach I believe. As I said before it was simply awesome. We also shared an order of Parmesan Truffle fries and the pickle appetizer. The pickle sample was really good - only one was hot and the pickled garlic was one of the most interesting on the plate.Besides food, Bachi Burger makes some really interesting drinks like the strawberry jasmine lemonade I had with my dinner. The atmosphere is quite simple, almost the opposite of the complexity of the burgers. And if I lived in the area I would definitely come back again and again to try everything from the "Banh-Mi" Burger to the Crusty Crab.I heard and read a lot of good things about this place however my first experience with them wasn't a good one. I ordered the Ronnin burger $8? and parmesan truffle fries $4?. Let's just say the pictures I've seen were a lot better looking and larger. My fries were terrible they were all shriveled and over cooked, super salty. it was as if they got some left over fries from the fridge nuked them in the microwave and dumped a pill of parmesan and  garlic salt on it, no lesser in size than a medium fries from McDonald's. The burger was pretty tasty, but under cooked and sloppy made, buns was completely soggy and ingredients falling out before the first bite. there was also some nasty after taste from the slaw. I just expected more and wonder if I just caught them on a wrong day. They do have a unique menu that looks delicious which I'd like to try. So until then I'm fine with saying that this place is just an ok burger place.The decor and eating environment is nice.  Friendly service.**UPDATE**Just spent the last week suffering from wat couldve been food poisoning hence the 2 star now. Only out of the ordinary food i've eaten was this place maybe it was the under cooked burger. I usually have a strong stomach and can eat just about anything. I probably won't be coming here anytime soon.Nooooommmmmmers! Bachi Burger is delicious with extra delicious on top. We ordered: -The kids meal (of course) which includes a grilled cheese, fries and fruit. - The Crusty Crab ala Misti Y.'s recommendation, (Pan Roasted Crab Cake, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, Onion, Mango Chutney, Tarragon Remoulade, Butter Glazed Sweet Bread Bun). - The Kalbi burger (Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo )- The Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Portuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato      - Iced Passion Milk Tea with BobaEverything was equally mindbogglingly delicious. My fav was definitely the Steamed Buns and Passion Milk Tea. The Boba was a little mushy, but the tea was outstanding. The Crusty Crab was the best crab cake creation I have ever had. Mr. R adored his Kalbi Burger. The Portuguese Donuts melted in my mouth and the coffee gelato took the dessert to another level altogether. I will return just as quickly as I can return to Vegas. The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is the shotty service. Our server was fantastic, but we hardly saw him. It was extremely busy, but most of the servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They were literally bumping into each other. The manager came over to our table at the end of the meal and apologized for the bad service, she said she felt bad and that they are working on it. I will update my review after another visit.*I don't usually write reviews.  But for this place I had to.**Good (albeit extremely over-priced) food vastly offset by TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE that runs on Filipino time.First thing I did when I moved to Vegas was check out all the burger reviews/joints/best-of-lists.  You'll see In N' Out, Burger Brassiere, LBS, Burger Bar...  and Bachi Burger.  So I had to check it out.When I arrived there, there was a wait and I was hungry so I figured I'd just order To-Go.  I ordered two burgers (Kiki Burger & their Special at the time w/ blue cheese) and two fries (sweet potato & parmesan truffle).  Simple order?  I thought so.Like the reasonable prudent person, I asked how long it would take.  Melissa let me know that it would be 15 minutes.  15 minutes sounds reasonable, right?  That is if it were really 15 minutes.So after waiting for more than 30 minutes (I timed it) and giving a dozen different looks into the kitchen/Melissa, I asked politely how much longer would I have to stay hungry.  "Three minutes", she replied.  "What a completely arbitrary number?" I thought.  But I'll trust her.  So 10 minutes later, wondering if I was high because it didn't feel like three minutes, I asked again how long it would take.  I think she finally started to feel guilty, so she said it was coming right up.  I'm so gullible.So five minutes later, magically as I approached they started bagging my food.  It took another five minutes to finish bagging me up (they forgot my sauce) and ring me up.  Because I was far beyond annoyed after waiting for so long when I was told 15 minutes, I asked if I could express my unpleasant experience and offer constructive  criticism to the owner/manager/person-in-charge.  Melissa told me he's not there and she's in charge.  Great.  She told me to just call later and the owner would talk to me.So I called later...  In fact, I called later multiple times and on multiple days.  I left messages.  Nothing.  He never talked to me. Don't get me wrong, food was good.  But spending $32.43 and waiting more than 50 minutes for 2 burgers & 2 fries is not justifiable in any sense unless I was told from the get-go what to expect.  Instead I was lied to repeatedly, never apologized to or compensated, and was not even able to express my displeasure to those who count.  Arrghh... Just thinking about it makes me so angry.  Like a big emo tornado of emotion.  Thank God for In N' Out. Peace Bachi Burger.Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I wish I could return for a do over but as I live in another state I'll just have to lay out my experience for what it was. A-OK. When in Vegas on vacation I scoured Yelp to find a truly "local" eatery that we could visit for lunch with our friends. All the Vegas yelpers and some Honolulu yelpers I know were all wowed by Bachi Burger so I insisted we drive off the strip to eat there.First off the decor is not the greatest, just a dimly lit space with tables and chairs. I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it's clean and the food is great. We were seated quickly and our waiter gave us the run down on popular dishes. I ended up ordering the kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries and a peanut butter chocolate shake. Our food took awhile to come out but as we were catching up with our friends we didn't really care. My Kalbi burger had less flavor than I expected. I think I had it in my head that it was going to be sweeter but the size of the burger was good. With all the ingredients in and on the burger I think I expected it to be a small miracle of flavor bursting into my mouth. Talk about high expectations huh? The sweet potato fries were overcooked and too stringy so I only ate three of them and didn't finish the rest. My peanut butter chocolate shake was $4 and much too sweet. I'm a sweets fiend so if a place offers a peanut butter chocolate shake I am guaranteed going to order it. I think there was too much syrup added to my shake so there wasn't a good balance in the flavors. Sad panda.Our waiter was a really nice guy but one thing which was very odd was that in the middle of our meal he asked us a question from behind the countertop that adjoined our table. It just felt a bit rude, almost like your neighbor listening in on a private conversation and chiming in from behind a fence. I don't think he understood why that was rude, but it's something that could be fixed for future diners. Overall very good service and smiley service.I'm sure many will disagree with me about Bachi Burger, but I really, really wanted to like it! After reading all the stellar reviews I think that I just didn't order the right items for my particular palate. Maybe on my next trip to Vegas we will meet again Bachi Burger and we'll have a redo. I always believe in second chances. Yelpers obviously love you so there's got to be something that I missed during my visit!Yelp 365 Challenge: #45/365 (The High Expectations)My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.I placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!I have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.In addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.  I was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.Perhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed.The word bachi means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.                                                                                            That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye"...GOOD GOD!Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg                Mr. Ho's Burger- Angus beef & pork patty, green onions, cilantro ginger, garlic, Hoisin Mayo, Lup Cheong, sautéed mushrooms, mizuna & a TARO Bun  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=aMy63-xKofPONtJqkZTVqg  Ronin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw       Truffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0ADipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kwPortuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcgWatermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkAWe started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUSTListen up folks, yelp exists for a reason.  See all those 3.5 star reviews for all the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  You know the ones that don't live up to and are more expensive than the original locations in New York and Los Angeles.  The ones that don't really care about how good the food is, because the celebrity chef whose name is on the marquee is at least an entire desert and mountain range away.  Those famous name places in the hotels, they care as much about return customers as those slot machines do.  They both know that as soon as they take your money, the next stooge is going to sit down in that same seat.Bachi Burger belongs on the strip.  It so good and different that it should be featured in the Bellagio or the Wynn, but you aren't going to find it there.  You are going to find it tucked away in a hard to see corner of a strip mall south of the airport.  This gem who MUST expand to other locations, is a concept from Chef Lorin Watada, who has worked for Roy's for many years.  The fusion of Asian flavors and burgers are so perfect together, I have no idea why nobody else has really come up with an entire menu of it before.  Sure you sometimes see a Teriyaki burger on a menu, but this is a completely different level.We started off with Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns.  While not listed as an appetizer, they are like 3 mini sliders, so good for sharing.  The buns were nice and sticky and folded taco style around a slice of sweet duck breast, cilantro, slice of egg, thin slice of radish, scallions, black Chinese vinaigrette, and hosin BBQ sauce.  While they were a good starting point, never order them in place of a Burger! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#3zjM4SbAXTNr8cRrcyHDegI split two burgers with my brother.  Both were so good, we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  First was the Ronin Burger.  7oz of Angus beef topped with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, miso goma dressing, and katsu BBQ sauce.  On the side was yuzu citrus aioli.  I also had them add Gruyere cheese.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was nice and pink.  The juices of the burger and the katsu BBQ sauce went so perfectly together I couldn't distinguish them as separate entities anymore.  The Japanese cabbage slaw had a nice crunchy sweet vinegar flavor to offset the texture of the burger.  I'm usually not a huge fan of a fried egg on my burger, but this just seemed so right.  So many times, burger joints throw on a fried egg for "shock value".  Somehow on this burger it was tastefully done to enhance the burger.  The miso goma sauce was on the slaw side of the bun.  The sweet rice wine/ sesame flavor worked perfectly with the slaw.  At this point my taste buds were just singing.  How could you need more flavor?  What was this yuzu citrus aioli about?   I added some of it just on one bite, and  found that the burger really didn't need it at all.  In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#8s5ab8tv_OI9keGxjmPErwThe second burger may have been even better!  More unique in flavor for sure.  The Banh-Mi Burger.  Ok, brace yourselves.  The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices.   It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce.  The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side.  Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl.  But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger.  Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere.  For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!!  I actually thought the bun held up well.  A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#ETcasvkOZaGaNUM3ZVIoQAA burger isn't complete without some fries.  We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share.  This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream.  WOW it was great, but not very much of it.  I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more.  The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin.  Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese.  Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone!   We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#z7-52AroniBC5F63yI0D4ANothing left to say other than GO NOW!This is NOT the place to go if you have anywhere to head to afterwards.  Went in during the work week, it is right around the corner from my office.   Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).  We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.  At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.   12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..  I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.  I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.  He asked what I wanted him to do about it.    I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.   If it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.  Give them the opportunity to walk out.  Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!  This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!  Will never go back, I don't care how great their burgers are.I liked it.  There's no doubt about that, but I guess it just wasn't what I was looking for.  I love Japanese cuisine, and I enjoy pursuing the elusive, better-than-In-N-Out, perfect burger.  I only tried the Ronin Burger and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, but I wasn't left with the idea that I would be back.  (My bill came to about $25 without tip.)  The novelty wore off very quickly.You'll enjoy your experience, however.  The restaurant itself was very busy--Los Angeles will have one of it's own this Fall, 2012--and the staff was very personable and all smiles.  The food is a new and refreshing twist on the sometimes commonplace hamburger, and the presentations are eye-catching, as you would expect with a Japanese influence.  Myself, I thought what I had ordered, which was highly recommended by our server and host, was too sweet.  I was expecting to bite into something that was much more robust.  Again, I hadn't tried everything; but for now, it's "been there, done that."I have read many reviews and have seen the episode of Triple D of Bachi Burger.Knowing that I would be in LV I made it a point to stop and try out this place that is reviewed so highly! I ordered :* Miyagi-San Burger which is a Grass Fed Wagyu Beef Burger. Topped off with a Fried Egg,Bacon,Crispy Onion Rings,Chili Mayo and Furikake..OMG! Holy Cow! This burger cooked perfectly medium as ordered, I must say  that this is the best burger I have ever eaten to date. The fried egg and ingredients work harmoniously to make it taste (In Hawaiian terms "SO Fricken ONO!!) . One more thing I judge my burger on is the drip test and yes it passed!. I could not put the burger back down on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g#egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g*Caesar Salad: Good size portion, Baby Romaine,Slices of Avacado,Tomato and Chicken Breast was good and refreshing.

After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :DI wasn't planning on eating a "dirty" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can't go in lookin' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.I didn't have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!Now onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!**The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**Appetizers: 1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There's really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries.2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.Burger:I went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I'm a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!I also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here. You get free refills with their teas and it was delicious. Service is top notch here. They are very attentive and efficient. I'm definitely returning to Bachi the next time we're in Vegas. It's a f*ckin must I tell ya!Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJwYou must first journey to the East.

Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!Update and upgrade alert. I finally made my way back to Bachi after nearly two years and I was pleasantly surprised. We came here for lunch and they were extremely busy. We waited for about twenty minutes before we were finally seated. I decided to order the Kalbi burger this time around. I was enticed by the kim chi and it definitely delivered. The meat was perfect flavor and was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the pickled cucumbers quite a bit on the side as well. The bun, which is usually my biggest sticking point for finding a great burger was soft and delicious. My friend's burger was a little on the undercooked side, but still looked good.Service was a little lackluster and that's the only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars. We waited quite a while to order, then another agonizing wait for our food and then when they finally brought our check, it was incorrect. Another long wait for them to rectify that and we were finally out the door. I wish they came by with refills a little more often as well. Service was friendly, however. I'll definitely be back, but I'll make sure I'm not in a hurry when I do.I use to live a few blocks from here and when it came to burgers, I had choices from the strip, In-N-Out, and Steiner's.  I wasn't aware of Yelp at the time, so I took the advice from a friend to eat at Bachi and became a fan ever since.One thing about Bachi is the presentation.  Bachi goes out of the way to make a burger look so beautiful.  I have to admit that I've been here 5+ times and the Sahara location 10+ times in the last 2 years and have yet to try any of their actual burgers. I know, what's wrong with me right?  I guess it's because I love their Bachi Fish (Alaskan Cod), the Lonely Bird (Chicken/Turkey), the Oxtail Fries, and their Bachi Dog.  All are good, very rich due to their sauces, flavorful, and a little messy.  Out of everything I've tried here, their Bachi Fish has to be my favorite.Couple of side notes about Bachi in general.  Sometimes there's a wait to get your order and served.  Because of this, I rarely hit up Bachi on a weekend.  The Sahara location is bigger and faster in my opinion.  Also, the burgers are little pricey (most over $10). Overall, I am still giving Bachi 5 Stars even though I have not tried any of their actual burgers.  Based on the other reviews, they're good so don't let my review discourage you from trying them. However, allow my review to encourage you to try the Bachi Fish.  Both restaurants are clean, service always great, and I have never been disappointed with a Bachi visit.Such a disappointment!!!!!!I've had Bachi burger bookmarked for the longest and even had friends who went and loved it! So, today, while choosing a place to eat, I chose Bachi over Max Brenner. Yep. Big mistake. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries and salt and pepper fries.For our burgers we ordered the ronin burger and spicy miso.We waited 30 minutes for our fries and after complaining, our waitress said she didn't know we wanted the fries to come out first. Wthh.... . She gave us the sauces free of charge which was nice of her. Even though ALL the sauces tasted weird and citrusy. I thought the pineaple ketchup would taste like the special ketchup at Umami but it didn't. As matter a fact it tasted like regular ketchup.Our fries finally came out and I was disappointed with my truffle parmesan fries. The truffle sauce were drizzled lightly and only got on the first layer of fries.Our burgers came out looking so delicious! We both ordered rare. Taking the first bite of my miso burger, I could taste a slight miso taste and then just like that, it went away. And that was it. No other taste! From that point on it tasted like i was eating tasteless meat. The meat were tender but not juicy. I didn't even bother trying boyfriend's burger because he said the same thing about his.Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!After hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.Upon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...hahaMost of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.I think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:I got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...KIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQMy BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!MIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtgWe also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.SWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUgService was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...Bottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!I figured someone should do a write up on this small, unknown local burger joint. They have been flying under the radar for  a number of years and I just wish more people knew about them.....I kid. This place is very popular for a very simple reason. It's putting out delicious food. I finally made it there last week and I was moved. I don't need to be blown away by a meal to appreciate it, but I love it when I have an experience. And Bachi Burger is serving up a unique burger experience.I'd seen a number of of the over 1,000 photos posted on Yelp, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order before we stepped in the door. FOOD:Between three of us, we ordered Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Kiki's Burger, and a Black and Green burger. All three were excellent. The high quality meat was cooked properly and was sandwiched in a a slightly greasy bun.  The star here is the flavor combinations they create with their burgers. Wow. You will pay for it (our bill came to around $65), but these were thoughtful, creative, and flavorful burgers. I see now that I should have gone for the more adventurous burgers. I can get blue cheese on a burger anywhere. Where else can I get Lup Cheong Sausage or Japanese eggplant on a burger?  Other places might have some of the same ingredients on their burgers, but I cannot imagine them doing it with as much style and creativity as the folks at BB are. I had a well crafted burger. If I'm going to pay more than $7 for a burger, I need something beyond what a Bobby flay recipe can offer me. I need an experience!They prepare their onion rings they way I like them: sliced thin with a light batter. I didn't dare ask for ranch and betray my lack of sophistication whilst eating my $14 burger. But that is the only thing that would have made the onion rings better.We also had fries, a house made soda (the Lychee was entirely too sweet), and the red velvet shake. Hubby fell in love with the creamy shake. SERVICE: Our server was a professional. This was a busy night and he (like all of the wait staff) was taking orders, serving, and busing. With all of that, he never let our drinks get too low and he checked on us a number of times during the meal. There was a gentlemen there who seemed to be a manager who was keeping an eye on the speed of service and the table turnover. I like seeing that level of care given to providing efficient service. AMBIANCE: Meh. The decor was nice, but there was a large party hanging out a the bar area and they created  tremendous amount of noise. But it's a burger joint. A little noise isn't the end of the world. OVERALL: The food was outstanding. I feel like I am ruined for other burgers. I cannot wait to return. Service: 5Food: 5REVIEW #50!WOW. Just wow. I don't remember the last time I was so impressed and happy with a burger. I opted for the Ronin burger, my friend got the Miyagi burger and we split it so I can have the best of both worlds. I would get the Miyagi burger! Burgers are similar because they both have a fried egg, onion but the Miyagi burger's crispy onion rings and furikake compliments the burger well giving it more of a Japanese flavor. Also tried their house made sodas. SO good. Omg. I have never had something like that. It was a little fizzy and tasted so fresh. I got the Apple & Lychee. Refreshing, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. There's nothing like that here in LA :'( Oxtail fries, on the other hand, didn't really win me over. Yeah they were good but you honestly can't really tell it's oxtail. Just tasted like shredded meat to me. Truffle fries are good though and the sun dried tomato aioli is really yummy. Truffle fries are half the cost of oxtail so I'd say skip the oxtail and just get the truffle fries. Truly wowed by this place. I will most definitely come back next time I come to Vegas.I can't tell you how many times Guy Frieri has let me down.  Almost every Triple D location I've been to has been less than ordinary.  However, Bachi surprised me with their delicious flavors and Asian influenced burgers!  They use high quality ingredients, but everything is entirely affordable...especially n Vegas! I went twice on the same trip.---The Food-----I tried the Ronin Burger (medium rare---$10) which had 30 day aged Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing!!! (dipping sauce regularly found in Shabu shabu), fried egg, katsu bbq, and a citrus aioli.)  The meat which is super tender, thanks to their "bachi" style of grilling and the combination of flavors are sensational.Another item you MUST get is their ox tail chili cheese fries ($12) which is in a different class all by itself.  Supreme layering of tastes that is indescribable.  I'm a lover of chili cheese fries too, and don't hand out these recommendations willy nilly.  I would not mind ordering this as my meal one of these days.Their oxtail chili cheese Bachi dog is delicious as well! But the size could be better for ($10)My burger quest to find the best has stopped at Standing Room in Redondo Beach, but this place comes a close second...which is why it gets 4 stars.Bachi has three different locations in Vegas and the next time I go to Sin City, I'll be sinful and order more of their burgers! I encourage you to do the same! Extra NotesTakes Credit CardLong Wait...expect a 20-25 minute wait every timeBeautiful oriental decorGreat ServiceClean restaurant and restroomsMany TVs Small parking lotBachi, in Japanese has two meanings:           1) its short for Hibachi which is a Japanese style of grilling.            2) Its a word which means to treat others the way you want to be treated.I FINALLY got the opportunity to check this place out!!!  As a passionate Yelper, I don't know why it took me sooo long to visit a place with over 1000 reviews with an overall rating of 4 stars.  To me, that sounds like a GREAT place.  A good friend called me to go to dinner and this place was a great choice.  I was stoked!When we arrived, I found out the wait was 35-40 minutes which didn't bother me because it told me this place was popular.  The waiting area was a little small with not a lot of seating.  I was relieved to see that the employees were really quick about cleaning off tables once diners left so we weren't waiting very long.  Our party saw an area at the bar and decided to just sit there.  Total wait time, around 15 minutes :)The place is a nice, quaint venue.  You have the exposed air ducts and lighting.  The walls were painted grey to look like concrete walls.  The overall feeling was a warehouse/loft look which ultimately made for a modern feel.  I love it!  The bar top was filled with very comfy stools, dark top with an opaque glass wall with different colors illuminating the bar:  purples, greens and blues.  When we first sat down, the bar top was not clean had a fishy egg smell to it. We ended up asking the hostess to wipe it off. BTW, the hostess, was soo sweet!  From the greeting to the dinner service, she was super attentive and really helped her servers out.  Top notch!  The bar server was also a cool guy.  I think he was definitely in a managerial role, he just had that aura about him.  I felt like he was from Hawaii.  He kept using "brah" when he talked to me, which made it feel like a family place!  Alright, onto the food!We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries for 11.50. I saw this dish featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and NEEDED to try it!  First of all, what an amazing and beautiful dish.  Start off with crispy shoe string fries, chili filled with shredded oxtail meat, topped with a garlic aioli, cilantro, sliced jalapeños and a  fried sunny-side egg. WOW, I'm in heaven.  This dish is savory, little spicy from the chili and jalapeños, packed with flavor. When you get this dish, you must first take a photo for Facebook, then break the egg yolk and mix everything together.  The yolk coats the chili and fries and brings the dish to a whole new level!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish :)For our main course, we decided to get two different burgers, cut them in half and share them, so we could asses more than just one!  The first burger was the Ronin burger for $11. This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli.  This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight.  The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there's that.  The sauces really brought the dish together.  SOOO Good!  The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11.  This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef.  What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms:  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii.  The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli.  What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!!  Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade.  This burger is packed with different textures:  crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms.  The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it!  All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy.  Soo good!So I know my review was super long.  If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I'm hoping that you're mouth is watering like a faucet.  You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food.  This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it.  So what are you waiting for??  They're open late!!Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.Unique. Fantastic! Loved it!  We had a great lunch here after trying it for the first time.  It was around 2pm when we walked in and there was about a 10 minute wait.  I thought it would be an off time coming in but they were busy!  It must be a winner!We decided to try a few different burgers and split them so we could taste a couple different things on the menu.  Our choices were the Kiki Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. ~ the Kiki Burger had a fabulous blend of sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon and garlic chili aioli.  The flavorful bacon really stood out.  The buttery soft bun complimented this so perfect. The angus beef was absolutely cooked to perfection.  This burger is an A+!~the Spicy Miso burger was also such a delectable, mouth watering treat for my taste buds!  The unique combination of pepper mayo, onion, cheese and apple vinaigrette sent my world spinning!  Not to mention that they inserted a fried egg in between all of the other yummy ingredients.  WOW!! On the side we went with the Truffle Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries.  OH YEAH! They were crispy, full of flavor and served with a delicious dipping sauce.  This was great to change it up from the usual ketchup.   The truffle sauce gave the fries a different yet fabulous flavor with a hint of garlic taste.  Score!  The Sweet potato fries were just as delicious.  They were crispy and perfect with their chosen dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what this was but I was in heaven! I can't write this review without mentioning the phenomenal service they provided!  Our waitress was attentive, so friendly and courteous! She even asked us if we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me this!  That's amazing to me!  Plus they had others walking around with water pitchers to refill our glasses even when they weren't even half gone!  All restaurants should do this! Why did I wait to long to try Bachi Burger? Now that I know how delicious their food is, I hope not to wait so long for my second visit.  If you want a different flare of a burger flavor...  this is definitely the place to go!   Can you tell I loved it?Disappointed seeing grown men argue and the mistreatment of employees!I was initially excited to watch the 3D episode talking about this spot and the same feeling followed me as I was on my way to the spot too but after I parked the car and was seated within 4 minutes flat it all came to a screeching halt! - I visited the spot with 2 others in which they also saw what I saw and felt awkward for being our first visit and after viewing the same episode on TV. together and venturing from Los Angeles.Here is the stressed out drama that we encountered.We arrived, greeted, seated, handed the menu, offered choices all going smooth with a smile from our server. Our server was "Lisa" she was very nice, very intoned with us and very affected by the experience we and many others were forced to watch while sitting in front of the kitchen/podium area, after placing our order for the same dishes that Guy Fieri featured on 3D we had our beer served up and then boom! "The Stressed Out Drama" - While sipping on our beer we encountered a tall Caucasian cook yelling at another gentlemen on the opposite side about doing their job right but what struck us as weird was watching one of them being handled to a back room because it started to get loud and some cuss words. We later found out that the people involved were the actual owners/partners of the spot, very disappointing to experience for being our first time.After the experience we all decided to leave but your waitress, Lisa talked us down and asked us to stay and apologized for the experience and in seconds brought over our order, and although she seemed bothered about what had happened with them she still gave a wonderful smile.I gave your location a two stars and these are the reasons why:Yes, you have a wonderful The "Banh-Mi" Burger, wonderful Truffle Parmesan Fries w/ Sundried Tomato Aioli & Drizzled Porcini Cream Sauce and a knock out Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Hoisin BBQ Sauce, would've been better with a Blue Moon beer but you were out that day but all in all, the food was phenomenal, hands down!I gave you the second star because of your server Lisa, she shined like a star 100% when you couldn't.NOTE: to the Owners/Managersmy tiny group and I agree that although you have problems no matter how big, never! bring them to the spot and especially never! demonstrate to your patrons how negative, ignorant and disrespectful you can be towards one another and your employees not to mention the children present. You guys have wonderful food, don't taint it by your actions.I hate doing reviews like this because I know you work hard to be top restaurant in your genre - I attempted to speak with you face to face but that went unanswered. Good Luck in your future ventures.I guess I don't get it?Everything was wholly average. Burgers, service, prices--average. I ordered Kiki's burger--average. Some bites were overly sweet, but the mushrooms added a good savory touch. I had the garlic fries--average. They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.Also, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.I'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit.We went twice in two days, so...yeah. Somehow, my mom conned me into sharing with her both nights so that she could order wimpy non-burgers and feel cute and semi-virtuous while chomping down on half of my tasty meat creations.Visit #1 Miyagi-san Burger - Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Onion Rings - I love all these things, especially egg, on my burgers. Yes, I love egg even more than bacon. Everything together was...well, it's turning my mouth on just thinking about it. So good. So very, very good.Peking Duck Buns - Ordered without cilantro - The egg was a nice touch, but  eh, give me real peking duck at a Chinese restaurant.Truffle Parmesan Fries - Love the black truffle porcini cream. I could do without the sun dried tomato aioli, though. Just give my heathen self regular ketchup.Going again the next night was actually not my idea, but I had no objections.Visit #2Kiki's Burger - Shiitake, Enoki, & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere, Garlic Chili Aioli - I love mushrooms and cheese, so I thought I might like this more than the Miyagi-san. It was fantastic, but the Miyagi-san was way better.Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Again, ordered without cilantro - Honestly, I know it's trendy, but I am just not into ordering these Chinese bun items at restaurants. I can slap this together at home in about 30 seconds. Exactly like the duck buns but with pork (duh). If you live in a place where you can't get Chinese pork belly I guess this would be exciting.Salted Caramel Shake - I had sort of wanted to have this the night before and decided the second visit was a sign for me to get it. It was very good but unsurprisingly very heavy. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered this. It was overkill.More Truffle Parmesan Fries!Because we went pretty late at night, there was no wait. Service was okay. In my crosshairs for future visits are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (several eaters needed) and Shogun Burger (Foie Gras my love!). Highly recommended.I've been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I've been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it's anti-climactic. Not today, Not here. You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. Here's the rundown:Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call "Umami" if not I have a word for it "Delicious!!" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a Béarnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that béarnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good. Usually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal. 5 Star PlusI'll definitely be back.The wait can be ridiculous but  I always get VIP treatment and not have to wait EVER. Unlimited iced matcha green tea and cherry yuzu soda, FTW! They have specials: crab dip and manga burger. Some make it to the regular menu, some don't. My faves include: shogun burger, miyagi san burger, Kiki's burger, steamed buns (pork belly or duck), sausage and truffle parmesan fries.Shogun Burger:Wagyu Beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear,  miso butter  and Yamamomo peach on the side. It's very rich and fatty but oh, so delicious! It's worth the $26! 5/5Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns/ Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Duck Breast, cilantro, scallions,  radish,  boiled egg, Hoisin BBQ sauce. The buns are fluffy and the duck skin is nice and crisp, the duck meat is tender and juicy. Pork Belly is fatty good. 5/5Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage:Sausages with a side of honey mustard. A great appetizer. 5/5Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:With garlic aioli  and fried egg on top. The chili itself is a bit sweet for my taste. Not my favorite thing on their menu but it's still good and worth a try. 4/5Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries:Sprinkled with Maui onion sea salt  and garlic chili aioli on the side. The dipping sauce is good, the fries are ok. 3/5Truffle Parmesan Fries:Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. This is one of my favorite fries in Vegas/Henderson. Very tasty! 5/5Ronin Burger:Angus beef with caramelized onions, coleslaw,  miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and  yuzu aioli. Refreshing because of the yuzu and rich beacause of the egg. 5/5Kiki's Burger:Angus Beef  with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade,  Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger:Wagyu beef with chili mayo,  fried egg,  furikake, caramelized bacon,  fried onion rings. This and the Shogun burger are the best burgers on their menu. It's a thich burger so you have to cut it in half and press it down just so it would fit in your mouth. 5/5Beware of the service here on weekends. Yes, you drove your asses all the way over here and now there's a 45-75 min wait. But you know what? The food is amazing and they know it. And they will use that to their advantage.The hostess really knows how to make your experience a shitty one. No smiles, very stern voice, and absolutely no common sense. We had to wait next to an empty table for 4 for about 30 min while she was "building a table" for a bigger party. There was no, "Sorry for the wait" or "Thanks for your patience". But once you get past her incompetence, it's smooth sailing from there.Food is great, you MUST order the oxtail chili fries. That is the only reason I will put up with the crappy hostess. I've tried most of the burgers and they have all been mouth watering. The best part is that each burger will come with their own little surprise that will have you asking, "Excuse me, what is this, and what is it for?" You'll understand when you see it.Gourmet burgers? Heck yes! Thanks Smitcha B. for this recommendation on our weekend trip to Las Vegas. First off, you will have to wait for a table. They're always packed here but for very good reasons: Asian fusion gourmet $10 burgers. Worth it when you're visiting Las Vegas or live out there. Plentiful appetizers: Oxtail chili fries (delish), roasted duck Chinese rolls (Bao), yes please. Gourmet burgers? I don't remember the name of my burger but I think I scarfed it down in a matter of minutes (it was that good). They also have good beers and service here. This location off of Windmill is about 5-10 south of the Strip (I-15S).Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.  We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g  - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the décor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?I have a confession to make....I ended up here because of Guy Fieri...I think that automatically makes me a douchebag and I ask your forgiveness.Finished off our quick 2 days in vegas with a trip to Bachi burger before driving back to my beloved city of angels.  45 minute wait on a Friday afternoon...could have been worse.  In terms of service...they must have been having a bad day...because it was gawdawful...I was mildly annoyed when I saw other diners getting ALL of their food even though we were seated before them..and we sat there with nothing...the wife was furious..staff was semi apologetic at least.  Anywho, on to the food.OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIEShttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtgQuite simply amazing.  These are 5 star chili cheese fries...ridiculously over the top oxtail chili topped with cheese, jalapenos, cilantro and chopped scallions, garlic aioli and a fried egg.  Delicious Insanity.MR. MIYAGI BURGERhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Y6ftK1iLFQuSN5gC0VF2-wIncredible burger!  Chili Mayo Fried Egg FurikakeCaramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings...I made the wife uncomfortable with the moans of pleasure emanating from my food hole.CLOSEUPhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Dnd1xg9xjuwD5C2MD6xG_Ayes.I don't care how big of a douchebag Guy Fieri is....if the food is this damn good....consider me an honorary douchebag for life.One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!It was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.Service was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,The menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.For starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!Onion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!Kids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!I had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy Not a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno.Much better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime VinaigretteBasically 3 veggie burgers in one.The breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!There was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!My husband had the The "Banh-Mi" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. Portions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.Can't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!Admittedly being a newbie to fancy schmancy fusion burger spots Bachi really blew my mind.  It was packed but we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  The service was very friendly and the place looks cool.  As far as the burgers, they were a knock out for me!  I had the Bahn Mi.  It was a straight out phó style burger with pickled carrot, veggies, jalapeno and fresh lush basil.  You dip this one in sweet phó sauce.  Very good.  4/5There was the KiKi which had mushrooms bacon and looked good.  This was lil'bro's so I didn't try it.The best one was the Miyagi burger.  With fried onions, fried egg a chimichuri/dijon sauce and a wagyu burger.  My it was a masterpiece of a burger. 5/5The Truffle Fries had a Vietnamese type of truffle peanut butter drizzle and a straight garlic truffle drizzle between.  With a special aioli. It could only be better with actual truffle specks. 4.5/5All the burgers were on a bun similar to a larger soft sticky bun.  Service and food make this worthy of 5 stars for me.Thanks mucho to Careline V. an awesome friend and amazing Yelpie for recommending I try Bachi while I'm in LV. Place was packed although my friend and I were able to be seated straight away. Nice comfortable atmosphere with one TV. Place is clean and to my eyes looks pretty new. Somewhat hidden in an unassuming strip mall. Food is anything but. The flavors in the burger I had which was the Kiki smack you right in the face. So juicy and tender. Bun is very soft and warm. Although a good size did not feel stuffed or sluggish after I was done. Ordered a side of fries. Although I wanted to try the Ox tail which Jennifer C. mentioned to me. Next time ;-) To drink I got the Burton Baton by my favorite Brewery Dogfish Head. Service was excellent! A must stop off the Vegas strip!OMG!!! When is the LA/Sawtelle location going to open!?!?!?!?! I can't just conveniently drive to Las Vegas whenever I'm craving The Miyagi every week. You guys are my top 3 for burgers. For Asian foodies or foodies that like Asian food and/or burgers, then Bachi is a must try!! The hype doesn't die down here. Everything is good, every burger is a different flavor profile, and you can even create your own burger!The Miyagi is my favorite. I love fried egg anything, furikake has amazing sweet & salty flavors, and the crunchy texture from the onion rings makes it a winner every single time! Plus the wagyu beef patty. ooooooooooomahgaaaaaaaawd!!!! drooling & FEIGNING FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Paired with truffle fries, or ox tail fries, or plain fries...perfectly crispy every time. I'm hungry.One of the BEST burger joints I've been to! Shoutout to Guy Fieri and Triple D for the recommendation! Service was really good and our waiter was really helpful. I already knew what to order coming to this restaurant after seeing their episode on the Food Network, but our waiter told us his recommendations. Ordered the bahn mi burger, truffle fries, and red velvet milkshake. It didn't take that long for the food to comeout and once it did everything looked absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was on point and very creative. The burger was super good! It had the whole bahn mi aspect to it with the flavors/ingredients and the burger was really juicy.  The truffle fries were piping hot, crispy, and the truffle sauce took the fries to another level. Lastly, the red velvet milkshake was the BOMB and it was literally a red velvet cake in a milkshake form.I highly recommend this place whenever you're in Vegas and a heads up, they have two locations out there. They're opening one in the West Los Angeles area and I certainly can't wait for that!After seeing this place featured in Food Network's Triple D, it's been something I've always wanted to try in Vegas. There's never enough time when visiting Sin City but we made sure this time Bachi Burger was on our itinerary. Hopping on over here after a show off the strip, their closing time at 1am was perfectly convenient. OXTAIL CHILI FRIES ($11.50) is a must-order. Most poutine fries I've had other than in Montreal tend to get soggy from all the gravy, but not here. I also love that it's not thick-cut resulting to a most-welcomed crunch on each bite. With beans and shreds of oxtail meat in the chili sauce, topped with garlic aioli, plus cheese and jalapenos, each component delivered its purpose. Let's not forget the cilantro which is my favorite part as it added a clean and distinct finish to the flavor profile. This was the bomb.com!  RONIN WAGYU BURGER ($16) normally comes with Angus beef patty but you can request for Wagyu meat for extra $$. I suggest you go this route because I tell you, it makes a huuuuuge difference. One bite and the unmistakable taste I got instantly was from the high grade beef. It had a nice smoky char-grilled flavor that was oozing with all its juicy splendor! WOW! The caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, and katsu bbq all fused well together into this phenomenal finished product. I really love everything about this burger including the bun! Not sure if you need the yuzu citrus aioli on the side because it's already flavorful as it is. KIKIS BURGER ($12) is Angus beef patty with sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. After having the wagyu beef patty with my Ronin burger, it was hard not to spot the difference between the two. The former was definitely more delicious however, let's not forget this burger had bacon and everyone knows anything with bacon is good. When in doubt, stick with the Ronin. CHILI FRIED CHICKEN ($7) was good but just not the flavor I was looking for. I was hoping it was more like a Korean chili chicken with a sweet glaze, instead, this was more tangy and on the citrusy side. Packed most of it home and ate it the next day. Surprisingly, it tasted better.Our server was on top of things and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I mean who doesn't like talking to people who knows what they're talking about? The rest of the staff was friendly and in a genuine way. Can't complain! So happy Bachi Burger has now opened its doors in LA. Soon OC, I hope!4 1/2 Stars. I was pressed for time since I needed to return a rental car and catch a plane. This southeast Bachi Burger location worked out conveniently and parking was easy to find since it's located at a strip center that  provided plenty of parking.Since I had a late breakfast, I wasn't real hungry and opted for just the Kiki's burger - Angus beef, shiitake & eryngii mushrooms, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese and garlic chili aioli. The burger was perfection - cooked medium but still juicy. The bacon along with the mushrooms and aioli on the side was unusual but absolutely yummy. Service from my waitress was friendy and spot on!Overall, I was impressed with my experience with Bachi Burger and I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other items on the menu!My friend from Vegas said, "If you only eat at one place in Vegas, it's got to be Bachi Burger!"Kalbi burger - nice moist meat. The flavor was reminiscent of Korean BBQ especially with the kimchi. Nice touch. Oxtail fries - yum! What a great idea.  I especially love the over easy egg on top. Truffle fries - if you don't order this, you're not missing much. It was just ok.Garlic fries - a lot better than the truffle fries, but alas, not that great.Red velvet milkshake - if you like red velvet cake, this is a must try.  Vietnamese iced coffee - umm...this was just regular iced coffee. This was not strong coffee from a French press with condensed milk. Nope. Nope. Nope!Service - ever time I've gone, the service has been friendly and they've Bon on top of soda/water refills.I've come here twice, and loved both visits! I'm so happy that we have Bachi Burger in So Cal now, although I haven't had a chance to visit the new locations yet. I really enjoy Asian fushion bar food, so I had this place on my food wish list for a long time before my first visit here. Since this place is super popular, try to come for an early lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd. You must order the oxtail chili cheese fries, this dish is perfect to share and is absolute perfection. I love oxtail, cheese, fries and fried eggs so this dish has my name written all over it! Get this, or you'll definitely regret it! For burgers, I've tried the Ronin, Miyagi-San, and Spicy Miso. My fave was the Spicy Miso. I enjoyed the others but found the Miyagi-San to be a bit too dry. I usually order my burgers well done, but I get them med well here so it won't be so dry. Don't forget to order a delicious beer to wash all this yummy goodness down, they have a nice selection. Awesome place, and I always try to come here when I'm in Vegas! Can't wait to visit the new locations in So Cal! :)Ok it's about time I update my 2 star rating I gave them years ago. Being that I've been here and to the other locations a bunch of times.Bachi Burger oh yeah I'm a fan of their burgers, not all of them, but enjoy most of them. Their kalbi burger is right now my #1 favorite at Bachi Burger. It's a little messy to eat, with sauce can go running down your arms while eating it if your not paying attention but I can never turn it down. Kalbi in a burger how awesome tasting does that sound. Well its more like a burger with kalbi sauce and kim chi but if it was kalbi short ribs it would be really awesome. Hope someone makes that somewhere soon. Always the kalbi is delicious. Sometime I eat it so fast, cause its messy, that I'm done before everyone else and I'm like do I order another one.As always they have their oxtail chilli cheese fries which are excellent to share in a group. Their various burgers, spicy miso not spicy but tasty you should ask for some hot sauce. Not a fan of their truffle fries. You can also order their ramens, was gonna try it but again can never turn down an opportunity to eat the kalbi burger. Customers service at most times are good but sometimes when their too busy it seems like their overwhelmed, you no the usual. Definitely be back I'll try not to order the kalbi or spicy miso burger cause need to try something else but no guarantees.I have now been to all 3 Bachi Burger locations.  This one is my favorite.  Seemed much more roomier they the other 2 locations.  The Summerlin location is always too busy and the wait can be atrocious so I avoid it.  What I have found during my Bachi Burger tour is that they are very consistent.  I am a big fan of the Ronin and Miyagisan Burgers and no matter which location I have had them they are always the treat I expect them to be.      I usually end up at Bachi Burger due to friends being in town and hearing about this Vegas treat form Triple D or from Yahoo's beat burgers in the US by state.  I am never upset when asked to meet up at Bachi's.  My friends quickly become jealous of the fact I can have Bachi anytime I want.     The service at this location was better then the other 2.  The Summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed.  The Burger was exceptional and unlike any other Burger I have had.  Unique and delicious.  The Ox Tail fries were a treat as always and one order was shared by 3 of us.  it was plenty and we were glad we only ordered one.     Their prices are on the high side but considering the quality and the uniqueness of their burgers it is well worth splurging on.  I am looking forward to another visit soon :)This was my first visit and will definitely not be last. Came out here for the weekend and I yelped this place at the last min. Reviews do not lie! This place is delicious and unique. The asian fusion that the burger had left a memorable taste. I ordered the Miyagi-San's Burger...was totally blown away by the flavors. I didn't really know what furikake or wagyu beef was but damn...I'm sure those were the main flavors. They gave it an asian fusion twist to it. The patty was so juicy...perfect! It was a bit pricey but I didn't mind that. I would pay that price again. I'm coming back here when I visit Vegas again to try their specialty fries!Bachi is short for Hibachi - Japanese type of grill. Bachi itself means karma.Ordered:- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11- Kalbi Burger $11- Miyagi-San's Burger $15Tina's Treasures and Tribulations- We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened and the place was pretty packed with people waiting and tables full - Only waited a good 6-7 minutes to be seated- This place is definitely an Asian fusion of foods and burgers- So of course my friend and I yelped this place before we ordered to see what was the MUST order items- The oxtail chili cheese fries were good, but a con would be that it has to be eaten right away or the fries get super soggy. It was really good and I'm not even into beans as much as a normal person would love it. Garlic aioli sauce was on point!- The Kalbi burger was taste and different with the kimchi and ko chu jang mayo that was in it. The angus beef was on point so freaking good. For the price, I would say it's worth it. - We went to Shake Shack the day before and I don't think they compare at all. This place definitely takes the lead for creativity- The Miyagi-San's wagyu burger wasn't as great as the kalbi. I think the wagyu beef seemed a little undercooked, but we did ask for it to be medium rare - it fell apart as soon as we cut it in half. It wasn't melt in your mouth good. It was flavorful and juicy & the onion rings gave it a crunch that I loved. That egg though!- Friend and I decided to order two burgers and share that. Obviously, we are like two little girls who cannot eat as much as a guy can so there were left overs. If you're hungry, I suggest get your own, but I think if you get fries and one burger - you can become full or content- We ended up putting the bread/burger buns aside and ate the meat :)- Will have to come back to try the other options!What a bummer for a burger place - I guess my taste buds weren't in a good mood or something.Came around noon on Sunday and it was about a 20 min wait. Ordered the oxtail fries and shogun burger. So..... The oxtail fries were really good when you break up the yolk and mix it all around the fries and meat. Fries were fresh and crispy, egg and meat was good, jalapeños were non pickled and spicy. Ended up finishing this big plate of yumminess.The shogun burger on the other hand... basically just sucked.. So much that I took 2 bites and pushed it aside. When I picked up my burger, my patty literally fell apart in pieces so I ended up eating a couple pieces with my fork. The ratio to my bun was really off too. I had this decently sized (but not as huge of a patty like other folks) patty and not a lot of the other ingredients. The pear was a nice touch to the burger but there was so little of it that it was gone within my 2 bites. The pickled plum on the side didn't help the burger at all so what was the point of that?Another thing that turned me off was when I asked my server what he'd recommend and his response was "well, we have to push the shogun because of the price...." Wow thanks pal! All together it was ~ $40. Disappointed to say the least.This should have been an update from a previous review that I did, like 4 years ago. I don't know where that review went, for some unknown reason, it was deleted. I think it was about the chicken wings, and that I only gave them 3 stars or something. I've been back here many times since then, and this place is steadily a very good place to munch on a burger. Or anything else that comes to mind.I recently came back here, after a couple of years, on a whim. I don't know why but for some reason, I feel like I should come back here once in a while. They say that Bachi was inspired by Umami Burger in LA. That could be true or not. But, Bachi is one of those few follow-ups which is better than the original.I've tried pretty much the entire menu here. Burger-wise, I am one of the few that believe that their Angus is better than their Wagyu. If both meats are temp'd at medium rare, I think their Angus is much more juicier and tender then the Wagyu. Call me crazy. Or call me, maybe.Still, to this day, I haven't tried their oxtail fries. Or maybe I did. If I did, then I think it tasted pretty good. If I haven't, then I couldn't tell you. Also, they are now connected to Shoku Ramen, so you can get ramen if you don't want a burger. Which is fine, I guess.I'll probably be back. For some reason, I still get a little irked when I see that I've paid $25 (including tax and tip) for a burger, fries, and Coke. But, i'll get over it. Maybe.
Hsin Cafe=Clean and stylish decor, attentive and eager staff, and tasty and affordable food.  All important hallmarks in the Quick Casual category.  The orange chicken was a noticeable step up from the Panda offering with the chicken being well balanced in terms of sweet and savory.If I was an ASU student living downtown this would be a regular in my dining rotation.  Well done.Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food.I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu. From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean. Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing)It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings. My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P                 |                 |  /                 | /   . .~^(,&|/o.

Terra Java=The wifi password says it all. "thankyou". They mean it with all their heart. Every time I've walked in the door they are just so kind. Amazingly sweet. Coffee, smoothies await you. As do a short list of sandwiches and paninis. I'm pleased to report the wifi is lightning quick. There are copious amounts of outlets. And super comfortable couch (dare I say it? :) take a nap on. The walls are lined with that is for sale.If you need a cup of coffee at 6am - this is the place to be![Update}Reporting live from this joint. The owners clearly have thought this out. A regular cup of joe comes with a free re-fill. So you can pop-in, get your to-go cup, get your nails done and then (!) get another cup of coffee. So I moved from a mango smoothie (which you should try) to a vanilla latte. The Phoenix weather is a tad chilly for my sandal clad feet. (I was enticed by the $1 off check-in deal on Yelp.)My God. They know how to do it here. I think the biggest challenge the owners might encounter would be folks like me. I'd never leave :) Stacks of magazines, newspapers and music fill the space. It is easy to have a meeting here. Eye balling the dog treat jar labeled "Woof!" they must be dog friendly too.  Love it.*sigh*
Wingstop=Called in our order at 12:35 for pick up. They told us it'll be ready in 18 minutes. We arrived at 1:08 & paid for the food. We waited and waited and still no food. We never really had an issue with Wing Stop before. Usually when we call in our order, we arrive & everything is ready to go. At 1:24 we asked why we don't have our food yet & it's been almost an hour since it was called in. The lady went in the back and got our food order. Apparently it was sitting there the whole time. WOW. No apologies or anything. Didn't give them 1 star because the food never disappoints. Wish I could say the same for the staff today.I don't care for too many chain places however, when it comes to my niece and nephew, I'd eat fast food for them. Or in this case, Wingstop. During my annual trek to Las Vegas to be with family during the holidays last year (last month), the kids chose Wingstop for dinner. So, I place the phone order and I have to repeat myself a few times. I really don't understand why places that take phone orders don't assign someone who has better than average communication skills. This doesn't mean just speaking, but listening too. Anyway, I arrive and of course, my order is wrong but I'm told not to worry, because they'll be able to correct it right away. Well, I'm sure you know what that really meant. After a while of waiting, I'm off with the to go order back to eat. I'm actually enjoying the smell of the hot sauce in my car on the drive back to the house and for the several days afterwards. Whoever packaged the wings, did a piss poor job. I'm glad it was at least an odor I can live with however, it took a little bit of work to get the stains out of my front passenger seat. As for the food - I didn't get sick however, the wings were dry and without sauce, void of flavor. I ordered a forty piece however, the fry order was enough for maybe two people. Same for the veggies. And for the amount of wings and veggies, two little cups of dipping sauce! So, the food wasn't disgusting, just not very good. Just didn't care for the service and the lack of taste with the wings. But, at least the niece and nephew were happy.
Blue Coyote Cafe=12/21/10Came in w/ Mom and a coworker, and we sat at the counter.  We've heard that select sushi rolls were 1/2 off during happy hour (3p-7p) Mondays through Fridays, but we saw nothing on the short menu that we wanted to try.  I decided to order the BBQ bacon burger and a seaweed salad, while Mom and coworker ordered seaweed salads and a rainbow roll to share.Have you ever tried a seaweed salad before?  We have, and we've had them from many Japanese/sushi restaurants, but never have we seen them served w/ carrots and cucumbers before.  Until now.  We've also never seen them WITHOUT sesame seeds.  Let's hope that this was a fluke, or else I'd question the quality of sushi that this kitchen produces.  Needless to say, the seaweed salads weren't good- I took one bite and decided to pass on the salad and waited for my burger to arrive.  The other two removed the non-authentic items and ate the seaweed, even though they also didn't particularly care for them.  The rainbow sushi that came after looked very dry, so I didn't even sample it.  Mom and coworker both remarked that it was tasteless and dry.Thank goodness that the burger entree was delicious!  I ordered it with BBQ sauce on the side, and to be honest, I didn't miss it.  The patty was thick and juicy, and I appreciated the crispy thick-sliced applewood-smoked bacon.  I don't know which I liked better, the burger or the seasoned wedge fries.  These reminded me sour cream & onion potato chips- yum!I may go back and give happy hour sushi another try, but I wouldn't mind having more of those fries!Was at Talking Stick Casino and Resort and had some time to waste so I headed on over the Blue Coyote Café to catch some Happy Hour deals.  Was greeted right away and showed to my table, I also was asked if I would like to sit outside or inside, I preferred inside. Service was great and friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.So after checking out the H H menu I went ahead and ordered an glass of sparkling wine, edamane, spicy salmon & spicy tuna rolls.  Now I don't want to brag, but everything together was under 15 bucks! Hello!!! That's a great deal! The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were fresh and delish! The edamane perfectly steamed and salted.  It was just what I was craving and it didn't damage the pocket book. Maybe next time I'll gather some friends and HH with them.
Satisfied Frog On Bell=Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.Blue moon @ happy hour is $2.50. Sold!!! Funny, that coming from a woman who drinks wine alot and is not a true beer lover, but I do love me some blue moon. When I found how cheap it was on happy hour as well as looking over the menu I was sold. Well I must credit the boyfriend as he was the one that said, I want to go there. So off we went. It is a cute little place and I must say I was a little concerned when I pulled up because there were no cars in the parking lot. Hmmm not a good sign I thought. When we walked in, there were a few tables occupied and I was like eh, who cares, we came for the food. Our fabulous and friendly waitress (who's name I cannot remember) :( came over to greet us and take our order. Again I was bouncing off the walls because of the blue moon happy hour special. I mean anywhere else and it is $5 a glass unless you find a rare place that also has it on happy hour. They came served in small mason jar and the BF was like hmmm what the? I can't hold this, its too dainty for me. I swear lol. So on to the food. I ordered the stuffed burger that was essentially two big ass patties stuffed with peppers, mushrooms and bacon. Just greedy!!! BF order the bbq platter that came with brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs and beef ribs. Good lord that was alot of food. I am still amazed that I ate my burger as you really can't take it home to eat it as leftovers and there was no way I was leaving any. BF on the other hand ate all the pulled pork and brisket but couldn't eat any more as the portion was huge so needless to say, I have ribs to eat for dinner later. Score for me. Oh and kicker to this, I happened to check in on YELP and ding, ding, ding, we ended up getting a free dessert! I truly had no room for it and yes I should have saved it but alas we got the strawberry shortcake to top off our gluttony for the night and it was delicious as well. So if you happen to be in North Phx, check out this place. It is cute and small, the waitresses are great, the portions are big. Win-win in my book.
Le Beaver Club=First, a disclaimer.  I haven't dined at Le Beaver Club in many years.  I had heard that the grandeur and glory which was Le Beaver Club had been dismantled in the '80's, but restored in recent years.  The restaurant holds far too significant a place in my personal progression of understanding and appreciating a fine dining experience to go without a review.  Now that things are again right, I'll write my piece.Having just graduated high school, Montreal was where I most wanted to visit for a few days of get away.  The "fancy" dinner for this trip was Le Beaver Club.  An evening which began with some griping about getting dressed up for dinner, ended with my first appreciation of how a truly extraordinary meal had the power to excite my senses, to transport them to places I had never known to exist.  The elegance was apparent in everything which caught my eye, and yet remained approachable to this eighteen year old on his best behavior.  The differences between "eating" and "dining" were suddenly neither semantic nor subtle.  I can't honestly recall what I had for dinner that evening, only that it was an important cog in my first true dining experience.Le Beaver Club was revisited several years later, while on our honeymoon, with the recollection that what was great on the first visit was even better on the second.  A fresh visit will be needed to assess this gem of a restaurant among my adult dining experiences, thus a star is withheld-- for the moment.
China One=It's my first time ordering from the China One near my house.  I ordered delivery from them last night,  Mu Shu Chicken... Not my usual dish from Chinese restaurants,  but I was feeling adventurous. Rice-good, cookie-good, Mu Shu chicken-makes my entire body cringe and convulse! Big ass bug in my meal... Made it to my mouth! I crunched down on this wing thing and it was hard! Big beastly bug!!  Disgusted!!
Niki's Kitchen- Fry Bread=Okay, so I use to live on a reservation in Washington state. The tribe could smoke a mean salmon, but the local frybread joint left me not a big fan. However, thanks to Groupon and other Yelp reviewers, I got a taste for some. I'm glad I did because this place changed my overall opinion. Pros: For being frybread, it was not greasy at all. There is a variety of choices from vegetarian to desserts. Here is what members of our group had - BBQ beef and cheese frybread, two red chile frybread tacos, a side salad, and sweet frybread with honey and powdered sugar. YUM!Cons: The new location is in a rundown area and located next to a liquor store. Plastic utensils just don't cut it here. I ended up tearing my food apart.  Also, nobody acknowledged us when we came in and sat down. We weren't sure if someone would take our order or if we had to go to the counter because we hadn't been there before.  As long as you go in not expecting anything fancy and over the top, you won't be disappointed. It's a family owned restaurant with faithful customers (we were greeted by one when we accidentally went to their old location). All four of us left full and satisfied with our meals.Scrum diddly! 2 of us ate for $21I had the red chile w cheese-- added the lettuce, sour cream, onion and tomatoes. We split the honey/powdered sugar fry bread. Tons of food! Friendly and quick service. Hard to find, literally right off Stapley in an odd shopping plaza. Don't let that deter you!It is nothing fancy, just yummy food!!
Sandwich Club=I was headed to Taco Tuesday, after my workout this morning...the traditional Tuesday retox after the detox:)Instead...I ended up "crepe'd" :-)I sprained my ankle playing squash a week or two ago, so unfortunately, no running this morning (or for the past week or two for that matter:(But, I was able to get on the bike and grind it out today, and I was getting "peckish" by the time noon rolled around:)I head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for my rendezvous with a platter of good-'n-greasy tacos, when I remembered that Gabi had mentioned that a new sandwich shop had gone into the space once occupied by the Ice Tango yogurt shop I may have inadvertently killed...(BTW, The Beautiful Carin and I read the article in Inc. and we both agree...Gabi's not a day over 25 and not just compact and bubbly...she's frikkin' adorable:)I decided to give SWC a whirl:)I made a u-turn (which for some reason, seriously confused a covey of cotton topped and henna red-crested snowbirds following me down the street...I was walking and it shouldn't have caused much confusion, but they all scattered like frightened barn swallows when I changed course:)At any rate, SWC is open for business and has been since Saturday:)Terri and her BF have partnered to bring this little space to life and I think they might just make a go of it...not just for the sandwiches (which look good enough to be sure)...but for another feature of the place...crepes:)I was just looking for a sandwich when the crepes reached out and grabbed me and said "sit here and eat hearty"...they said it in French, so it sounded much classier, but that was what they said:)The French was appropriate, because Terri's BF is very French (and not "snooty Parisian, look down his nose" French...He's more "en province', everyone is his friend, can't do enough for you" French:)I was looking at the sandwiches and then at the salads and then at the crepe irons and I said "can you do crepes for lunch?"Terri said "Sure" and I was suddenly very happy:)I was even happier after my egg, goat cheese, basil and tomato crepes...a genuine value for $7.99 and a delightful lunch...warm, soft, savory and filling:)I'll be keeping SWC in the rotation...I may even try a sandwich now and then:-)
Phat Phrank's=Phat Phrank's has been on my 'To Do List' for a very long time.  I had a meeting on the other side of town and had to pass by the Decatur & 215 exit on the way home around lunchtime, so I decided to finally give Phat Phrank's a try.Since I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3NgI went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvngHe chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.After a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.I went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.I'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.Return Factor - 97%Phat Phrank's has quickly become my go-to place to tasty Mexican here in Vegas. It's a family owned place where the food is made with a lot of care and I love that! "Phrank" is always around and smiling and his staff will do all that they can to ensure your satisfaction. At this point I've tried quite a few things... my favorites:*Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, but his are done the way nachos should be! Tons of delicious shredded pork... an order is definitely a meal for 2 people!*Breakfast Burrito - the best breakfast burrito I've had in Vegas, by far! It comes with eggs, yummy crispy potatoes, cheese, and your choice of meat. He mixes everything to ensure every bite is perfect. When I'm having a bad day, I call ahead and pick one up on my way to work!*Fajitas - I have FINALLY found delicious fajitas in Vegas! I had the chicken ones for lunch today and really enjoyed them. The chicken was shredded (as opposed to the creepy pre-cut strips with faux-grill marks you find at say Chili's) and had 3 colors of peppers and onions mixed in. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but this had an amazing amount of flavor. *Churros - caramel and chocolate sauce.. mmmmmmmI can also highly recommend their catering services ! "Phrank" helped us pick out a freaking feast for well under $10 a person. We had platters of enchiladas and tacos, guacamole, and ceviche. Everything was delicious and was ready right on time. We picked it up ourselves, but it was well packaged and transport -ready. Overall, don't let the strip mall exterior fool you - this is Mexican (albeit heavily Americanized) at its best ! It's affordable, fast, and delicious. It's basically like  Roberto's that isn't a chain that serves food that tastes good! The only sad thing is they aren't open on weekends...There's only one word I can think of when it comes to Phat Phrank's. AMAZING.I could leave it as that and have you all wonder or I can let you all know why it's so AMAZING.I've had their fish taco plate, other than the beans and rice sides the fish tacos were AMAZING. By far the best fish tacos I've had anywhere.  The fish were large crispy on the outside tender on the inside pieces, light and not greasy. The combination of all the fish with cabbage, green onion, cilantro, tartar sauce, and in my case lime and their hot sauce was AMAZING. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. I'll be back for you fish tacos.Their carne asada torta was...  Oops sorry for the drool.  Their Carne asada torta was very delicious too. Well I might have reached my quota for using the word amazing but don't worry the carne asada tortas are equally as amazing as the fish tacos. I've seen other tortas that are bulky, bready, and just look good because of the huge size not flavor. Size isn't gigantic and not bready, so every bite was just of everything I wanted, something very tasty. There's probably even more ingredients than bread. I'll be back for you too LOL.I didn't have this but a friend had their enchiladas because it was mentioned in the lvrj as Phat Phrank's signature dish. Now that looked like meal right there. I'm sure it has to be really good too just from what I've already had.  Plus it had a fried egg on it.  Anytime you throw a fried egg on anything it's instantly good.Location is perfect for me, I'm always in the area though honestly I never knew they were there until a UYE. I like the musical instrument on the walls and how it's clean. Seats maybe 20-30 people.Service was very good, friendly. Phrank and the lady that was there often checked on us, refilling drinks, bring food out quickly, conversing with us and making it an experience not like here is your food and now get out when your done. lol. They no longer have raspberry ice tea. Can't wait to go there tomorrow. Wait their not open on the weekends!? This has to be a typo and they close at 6 PM. MAN I can't win.  All good, fresh and delicious food need a break too. AMAZING.Late weekday takeout lunch at 2:30 brought me here after having this place bookmarked for a good 5 months.I was sooo on the fence about getting a breakfast burrito based on Blair B's terrific review and since it was my first meal of the day.  In the end, I went with the carne asada and a couple of carnita tacos.  The carne asada was pretty good but the pork carnitas blew my mind.  Maybe it was due to my hangover that day I was ready to drive back and have a couple of more.  The pork was so juicy and well seasoned that, like a good movie, I didn't want it to end.  Phrank took my order and as everyone else mentions in their reviews was very hospitable.  He was also patient as I was the only one in the restaurant at the time looking at the menu for a while.  So many other things on the menu to try!  I would definitely frequent this place more if not for their hours but that's just the nature of their location.  I will be back for sure.Oh Phrank, I've got the hots for you!My hubby tried Phat Phrank's last week with some coworkers and has been raving about the fish tacos every day since then.  I wanted in on the action, so when he had the opportunity to go out for lunch again, I met him there and had a great lunch.The restaurant itself is in a small strip mall with a couple of other food places.  It is kind of hard to see from the street, so keep that in mind when you venture over here.  Once you find Phrank's, your happy tummy time begins!  You walk in the door and can smell the lovely Tex-Mex aromas swirling around the place.  Your mouth starts watering immediately and you get excited for the food to come.  Yummmm.  Phat Phrank's is a small place though, with about 6 tables.  We got there and there was only 1 table open.  My hubby grabbed it while I waited in the really long line.  Within 2 minutes, the line was actually out of the door with people waiting.  Luckily the line moves pretty fast.  The food also comes out pretty quickly too, so there is a nice flow to the place.After looking at the menu, I was torn between the carne asada and the pork chili verde plates.  I asked the one and only Phrank, who was working the counter, and he told me to go for the chili verde.  I trusted him and went with the verde.  Boy, was I happy with my choice!  The pork chili verde was so tender and tasty.  It had so many layers of flavor that it made you eat slowly to savor each bite.  Delish!My hubby went for the fish tacos again.  He is addicted to fish tacos and gets them everywhere we go.  He says these are the best in town, hands down.  He really has tried dozens and dozens, so I trust him on fish tacos.  I was going to try a bite, but by the time I asked for one, he had already devoured them.  You snooze you lose, I guess.The hot sauce here is really great good too.  I recommend the hot hot sauce.  It is super flavorful without being completely mouth burning.  It has some great depth to it and I had to ask for a second serving because it was that good!The plates came with the main entree, as well as refried beans, Mexican rice, and homemade tortillas.  Now no one tell my Grandma, but the beans and tortillas were better than hers!  I have NEVER said that before because hers are the best of the best!  The beans from Phrank's were simply perfect and I could have eaten a whole pot of them them.  The flour tortillas tasted just like my grandma's homemade ones.    The tortillas were just AWESOME.  If you have never had a homemade tortilla, you are missing out.  Luckily you can go to Phrank's and get some right now!
Saddle Ranch Chop House=This is Westgate, so ample security is to be expected. But when I approached the entrance on a happenin' Saturday night, this was taken to new heights. The guy was nice enough when scrutinizing my ID, but then he said "Hey...look up and to your right". It was pretty confusing, until I spied a little camera that took my mugshot before I could ask what the point was."We have to photograph anyone who's under 25", he said. Not his fault, and he wasn't being a douche, but this is some 1984 shit that made me feel unwelcome.OK, done ranting, this bar is tons of fun once you make it inside. Huge tables to chill out and get sloshed with large groups. Drinks are the usual Westgate price, but unlike a couple of other bars, they are made RIGHT. I guess they didn't just hire their bartenders for their boob jobs and bleached hair. My 'chocolate cake' shot was the most delicious $8 I've ever spent.The crowd is nice, and who could forget the mechanical bull? It's the main attraction of this bar; you can come watch all the sluts from Scottsdale show how they ride. Win.The most innovative part of this bar is what happens after last call. The blaring music stops, and the kitchen reopens, reverting back to a restaurant until 3:30. I'm wary of all Westgate food, but I have to admit it's a pretty badass idea.3.5 stars rounded down for that mugshot. I'll become a true fan if their food turns out tasty.Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review... Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKEDPro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them. If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.
Roberto's Taco Shop=My last visit I decided to stay in and eat. While I was eating my nachos, the girl starts sweeping the floors, started in the bathroom and is headed towards me. I see stuff start flying in the air, I'm thinking "she's not gonna come sweep that towards me" well she did. I see fuzz, dirt and whatever else fly in the air around my food. I glared at her, got up and threw my nachos in the trash. Thanks for crop dusting my nachos with dirt you idiot.Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a "Chicken Taco" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The "Rolled Tacos" and "Carne Asada Fries" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff! They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays.It's Roberto's. They have locations all over in different states and most people know Roberto's is the place to eat when it's late at night and you are desperate for food. Each location is hot or miss as far as consistency goes. This location is apart of a gas station but you walk up to the window from outside. The portion size here is great. A lot of the menu items can easily be shared. The Carne Asada Burrito is what I order with just meat and cheese. The tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzly. I saw a huge block of cheese just sitting out on the counter instead of being in a refrigerated space that didn't look right. I realized after this last visit that with all the other food trucks that offer great Mexican food at affordable prices, I really have no need to come to Roberto's as much.Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. 9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager.
Liquid Pool Lounge=LV Yelpers! Lookin' for a pool party?! Liquid @ Aria... is a must do if you're in the area.I came here this past weekend, both Saturday and Sunday (I stayed at Vdara, so it was easy for me to just walk over without catching a taxi).Saturday was great came around 1pm stayed till 6... weather was nice, packed with people and good music. That day, they charged $40 for guys and free for girls... with a $200 minimum per chair... which we wanted 2 chairs... but they could only offer us 1. On a good note, music was great! I danced for 5 hours straight and entertained all of liquid. Left with a lot of fans, lol. On an off note but not surprising, a couple was caught having sex in the pool and got kicked out.Sunday came around 1230pm left at 330pm... weather wasn't great... windy... clouds over sun... there was a little sunshine here and there... but due to the weather, it wasn't as crowded as Saturday. People actually remembered me from the day before... guess I stood out with all that dancin I was doin. That day, they didn't charge cover for guys... but they wanted a $50 minimum per chair and there was 4 of us, so we spent another $200. It was so windy that day that one the lounge beds flew up in the air and almost landed on me! =( Yummm! I don't drink alcohol, so I was all about the food! Good stuff!I had alot of food on their menu:- ahi- shrimp cocktail- club sandwich- coconut shrimp- virgin pina colada- virgin mango daiquiri - they even got us coffee, which wasn't on the menu.$25 for liquid shirts. I love mines!Bathroom is clean.Except to wait 20-30 mins. for your bill.Come here if you don't have a problem dropping $200 (food/drinks) for fun in the sun. Not super packed, so there's room to breath and dance!-1 star for $200 for 1 chair... and not being able to accommodate us with 2 chairs. Paying that much $, they should make it happen!I hope to return one day! Worth checkin out. Mixed crowd.Don't forget your ID!Enjoy my photos =0)Lots of X&O to LIQUID! I miss U!One of the worst experiences of my life. My wife and I were treated like second class citizens. As a guest of the Aria hotel, I expect a little civility when asking a question of a member of the staff. Four bouncers were standing around and when I tried to ask what time the pool opens, is there a charge, is there a waiting list and then I was ignored, and the people behind me were ushered in. It is very simple if someone asks a question answer it. All other experiences I have had at this hotel have been wonderful, the rooms, casino, and food service have all exceeded my expectation. The Liquid Pool Lounge is owned by the Light group who I assume pay a concession to the Aria Hotel (MGM International) in order maintain this facility. Aria, the Liquid Pool Lounge is dimming your stars.As a professor of Hospitality Management in Florida, I will be using this as an example of what not to do.NathanI would have to completely disagree with Nicole B.'s review of Liquid.  Liquid is NOT a wannabe Wet Republic.  The two have very different objectives, and its very apparent.  Wet Republic is 100 times larger than Liquid and is more of that Rowdy, Crazy Party environment.  Liquid is much more relaxed and low-key.  As for the no seating comment, Uhhhh RESERVE A CABANA OR A DAYBED OR A CHAIR, DUH! They are actually quite reasonably priced.On a Saturday, the Lounge chair at Liquid is only $100 and it includes food and drink for up to $100.  The Daybeds were $300 and could comfortably fit 3 people.  What I love about reserving this is that they have little storage containers where you can put all of your belongings, as well as a bucket to keep your champagne, or beers or whatever you drink cool.  The food they serve here is pretty good as well, for poolside.If You are looking for a REHAB, TAO BEACH, or WET REPUBLIC type of atmosphere, this is NOT the place for you!!!  LIQUID is much smaller, but still has a great DJ and relaxed vibe, but still very fun! I will most certainly return and reserve a Daybed because it is WORTH it!  The only negative is that the hours vary and sometimes they close early so make sure you check the hours before coming here.For what it is, Liquid really excels. The problem this "exclusive" pool faces is that there are so many others in Las Vegas to compare it to, and thus people wind up making poor comparisons to things which aren't really alike. If you're planning to come to Liquid because you think it might be similar to the atmosphere at TAO Beach, Encore, Wet Republic, or other similar mega pool parties, then save yourself the money and the subsequent public whining, and just go to those places. I wouldn't quite call this space intimate, because there are still a couple hundred people here on a busy day, but it's definitely smaller in scale and goes for a more luxury appeal (appropriately situated at the high class Aria resort).The main Aria pool complex is pretty huge, so it's no wonder that more people don't try to get into Liquid, but it also explains why the promo ladies are constantly out patrolling with more free passes to get people in. Despite what some of the other reviews might say about "being cute getting you nowhere" here, I saw several ladies getting in for free. We personally got in free along with quite a lot of additional stuff thanks to a friend of ours who works for the company, but I would have rated Liquid the same without all the complimentary stuff.For the particular day I visited Liquid was exactly what I needed, a smaller spot to hang out with my friends on our day bed (which has a nice storage compartment for your belongings as well as multiple ice buckets for champagne, liquor bottles, mixers, and bottled water), listen to some pretty good DJ tunes, quickly add to the lingering buzz from the night before (with extra help from the super expedient service staff), and get a lot of bonus eye candy from the podium dancers. There are several points during the day where the DJ encourages everyone to splash the hell out of the pool though, so just be warned you might get your precious hair wet.While our immediate waitress and pool boy (or whatever these guys are called) were superb in their execution, the door staff did leave most of us with a bitter memory of Liquid. They are completely unnecessarily dickish here and definitely do not offer an inviting atmosphere. At one point Vidal left to get money from the ATM and come right back to tip the employees, only to get flack from one of the bouncers who quizzed him repeatedly before finally allowing him to return. I had the same thing happen to me when I went upstairs to the room to get my sunglasses and returned without my ID (which was poolside). My arm was clearly stamped for re-entry, but he felt the need to give me the cold stare down and accompanying inquiries... sorry mate, I don't budge for anyone, let alone Pool Patrol.Being a girl in Vegas definitely has its perks, one of them being freebies galore.  We (four girls) were let into Liquid free of charge, had free unlimited champagne until 1 p.m., and we were given a daybed.  I'm surprised we got the daybed because it was Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  However, there weren't a bunch of daybed rentals.  There was great music playing, the water was refreshing, and everyone was super friendly.  Naturally we made friends with guys who also had a daybed and were buying drinks, so that amped up the fun.  I went up to the room earlier than the others, but for one girl, it was her favorite part of the whole trip.  T.I. showed up for a little while too!Tip:  If you're a girl, don't get the VIP entry/champagne to Liquid as part of your package when you book at Aria.  We changed our reservation so we got entry instead of two buffets.  Entry was free anyway, as was the champagne.  Get the buffets.One negative: my friend came to the front of the line to get me and she got reprimanded for swearing, which is ridiculous considering everyone had to be 21+ to get in.Stay away!!!They took my credit card and loosed it, they requiring to have it taken when you order more then one drink, later i found out someone actually used it, i won't be surprise if its one of their employees, just worst shady bad experience i have ever had!You got that?? they taking your credit card, it required for getting drinks to you, but they have it somewhere unsecured. When I asked to get it back they didn't find it.When I started to get upset was worst experience ever, just shady answers, made me feel like I did something wrong ***they*** loosed my credit card.they don't care about their customers at all, we asked to speak to a supervisor, when he finally showed up he was so rude we regret we even bother.The biggest problem was they didn't let us go anywhere because we had open check of over $2000, but I wasn't able to pay it because they didn't find my card!!my friends had to figure the check out.Later I found someone charged my card, I bet one of their employees, so I had to contact the credit card company and deal with all this mess after Vegas trip.They don't belong to Aria Resort, when we complained about them to the Aria we been told they are independently owned.We spent there over $2000, it was 6 of us.accept that we had good time before all that happened, but its not worth it, go somewhere who appreciate your business, somewhere who will not try to steal your money .They just don't deserves anyone's business, i will never go back!I had fun here.  I really did.  But the staff is so annoying.We got yelled at three times in a row for having our belongings by the pool.  I understand that they don't want to have liability issues, but I need my sunscreen and I'm not going to be devastated if someone steals it.  Plus, how do you expect me to pay for my drinks if I'm expected to tip the (incredibly rude) bag- guy every time I have to get my money?  He actually said to us "You know, the expected tip is $10".  Umm...no.  And he wants that every time we have to get it?Basically, everyone here needs to chill out.On the other hand, I did have a great time and it's much more laid back than the other pools, but it still has a party vibe.  The pool is a small, but decent size in comparison to some of the others and everyone gets inside to splash and just have fun.
101 Asian Buffet=found this new buffet to be average at best.sure it's pretty clean....NOW, but it's new; just give it a few years and i'm sure it'll fall right into line with it's peers.the food had way too many items designed to please the picky american 4 year old.  there was a high greasiness factor to many dishes, and despite what seemed at first glance to be a large selection, all of it was just  blah.There are so many of these boofays popping up, that instead of seeing them as all the same, the differences - both subtle and glaring - will be all the more evident.101 is nowhere near the top of the list of chinese buffet choices in the valley, or even in the immediate area (unless maybe you are within walking distance, then maybe it's the best in the IMMEDIATE area!)
El Panzon Tacos Y Tortas=DOS MAMACITASPanzon translates to "potbelly" in Spanish. Don't worry the two ladies behind the counter could care less how you look.  Prices are open range cheap.Carnitas tacos would make Pancho Villa's lay down his pistolas. As for the menudo, a reminder of a never ending slow and dreamy cattle drive. An aroma you can't forget. No doubt this taqueria is for the hombres whose wives are still asleep at home.
Todd English P.U.B.=A yelp and the thinly veiled link to food porn. Look at any number of the pictures that people take of their meal. It's, for all intent and purpose, food porn. We go on and on about how we ate here and what we had like we're bragging about our latest conquest in the bed room. "Oh man, you should have seen that plate, man. It was easily a 10 and I tore it a new one!" Yes, you can pretty easily make smut novels if you replace whatever food items in a typical review with gender names and you have yourself a grocery store check-out romance novel with Fabio on the cover. So with that, let's talk Dirty.. Dirty Chips that is. These things.. Oh man, if I had a camera I would tell them nothing as they would already be making love to the camera. Any more dirty and this review would be X-rated. But let's go with trying to make the FCC blow up. Let's talk real dirty now.. I mean, how can you top this nasty-kitten! It's a huge pile of Kettle chips with bacon bits, scallions, blue cheese dressing and deep fried chicken liver pate. If your mouth isn't watering already, I would have to question your manhood. Then you can get really raw.. with their extensive raw bar, that is. Though let's be Frank (Sinatra) here. If you are in Vegas, there's a cheaper way to get Shrimp and Crab than getting it at an oyster bar. Stick to those and you should be fine.So what about the lubricant of love, the back bone of any good pub, The beer? It was what I consider a pretty extensive list of beers on tap. Any place that has Fat Tire is a place I will eat in. But they went above and beyond. Blueberry beer. Yes, the Snozberries may taste like snozberries but I do love me the taste of Blueberries. This beer.. tasted like Blueberries. The whole joint looks like it could be in some old English novel as the town tavern, but with a slightly more updated way to dimly light an establishment. The bathroom is very dark. They really nailed the whole dingy pub look there better than, say, New York New York did with its squeaky clean NY City streets. Brick stones line the walls and create a look and along with the many hand crank beer handles on the walls and the "flare" of old taverns and pubs, this place has a look that just makes me want to drink some more and enjoy the sights. I didn't even touch on the burger. Now I'm not much of a turkey fan. Just doesn't have the same food porn feel, no matter how much you stuff it, that beef does. But the turkey burger with turkey bacon wrapped around it was something out of this world. Oh man, would I like to put that in my mouth over and over again. And with that vivid and oddly perverted description of my food, I'll bid you farewell.Most times when you go to bars that serve peanuts in shells, there are at least a few nuts that are kinda...retarded.  They taste off, look a little strange and are just throwaways.  How is it possible that every peanut this bar has is perfect??  Is there a guy in the back inspecting each and every peanut? Aside from the fact that most beers start at $8 here..the food is certainly worth coming for.  We had a 1/2 lb of the pastrami and it was pure heaven.  I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the carved meats.  It would be a bit pricey to get drunk at this place...perhaps just show up drunk already??Fish and Chips awesome!  Service was really bad! Really really bad.  Oh, and the hostess was rude, bitchy and one of those girl who thinks she's really hot, but in all actuality has a butter face (you know who you are!) I know I shouldn't expect much of Vegas, and I generally don't, but say hello in the first fifteen minutes of me being here and I will be fine.  Everything took forever, and the server was a vacant retard (not trying to offend anyone, but seriously, this dude was an idiot).  I don't know what it was, maybe I was pissed off because my family was irritating, but the only thing that is worth coming for is the fish and chips, if they didn't have these I might have burnt the place down...5 stars for the fish and chips-2 stars for the hostess-2 stars for the service+1 star because I don't like having too many 1 star reviews on my Yelp..I am not a hater, I just tell it like it is!Bottom line - 2 stars!If it wasn't for Mr. P we would have never come across this nice little pub. You start off with popcorn drizzled with salt and paprika this is free for all.  Followed by homemade different pickles paired with an assortment of mustards. I love pickles! My expectations were not to high, but oh man when those lobster rolls came out I was in heaven. They were so toasty and tons of butter with huge fresh chunks of lobster. Btw... this was my first lobster roll. I have been watching the food network and seeing all these lobster rolls places but they are all in the east coast. FINALLY, I found a lobster roll right here in Las Vegas at Todd English PUB and it was delicious. To go along with these awesome little rolls I had a wheat beer named T.O.D.D. the lemon and crispy light wheat flavors went great with the lobster. The chicken pot pie was pretty tasty too. Huge chunks of chicken with a light fluffy, crispy crust. It had a "real" intense chicken flavor. Great beer selection, great true pub food even if little pricey but I thought it was worth it. Very enjoyable. :)This place rocks!Here's the short list after eight separate visits with multiple guest and trying almost the entire menu:1.  For starters - the clams or P.E.I's. Perfectly cooked with a bit of spice.2.  The pot pie and Shepard's pie are incredible.3.  Carvery is the winner.  Brisket is top choice.  Salmon is perfect choice for the fish lover.  Perfect crispy skin and moist in the middle.4.  Beer - make it the TUB.  Locally brewed in LV.  Very well balanced with the food at the PUB.All around fun and cool place to enjoy lunch.  Try the beer challenge and enjoy tossing the peanut shells on the ground at the bar while you wait for your food.Must try!OH. MY. FREAKIN. LORD. THIS. PLACE. FELT. LIKE. AN. OVEN.right when i sat down, i was dyyyiinnggg for  a cold brewski....and when i got it, it got warm within 5 minutes.the food is alrrriiggghht, a little overpriced for bar food, but its vegas. the fish and chips were pretty good, but it had too much batter. Their shoe string fries were the best thing i ate!they also have a little dispenser thingy by the bar for ping pong balls! BAD ASS. but where are the beer pong tables? not so bad ass.We came here because I heard they served a mean lobster roll... Let's put it this way. I'd never order the lobster roll again. It was more like a roll with a bit of lobster. You are served 3 of them on a thick Hawaiian type roll.The duck buns to start were great, as was the complimentary popcorn that lasted about 2 seconds. The atmosphere is open and large but overall I'd didn't love this restaurant and highly preferred Todd English Olives at Bellagio for lunch.HEFTYLike eating a mimosa brunch buffet wasn't enough. Girlfriends and I opted for something low-key and near the City Center in LV. We hauled out 4-5 boxes full of left over food outta Todd's. Todd English P.U.B is unique for a gastropub being divided up into three categories: The Carvery (meats), The Grill (house specialties), and the Raw Bar (all seafood).Do get: - Dirty Chips - A mountain of potato chip nachos, drenched in melted bleu cheese, bacon, and little balls of fried chicken liver. Tasty, but OH MY GAW.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A?select=MVU5PL5K_-K0Da1uDjUJnw- Raw Oysters - $2 each. Simple, delicious, no complaints here- Lobster Roll - Another delicious dish - luscious pieces of mayo-ed lobster piled on 3 mini hawaiian bread-type rolls Do not get:(Sadly, my dish of) the 1/2 serving of the lamb: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A?select=hZ9a-iO3R_ssTZHELPDO0wAlthough still noticeably huge, it was chewy and pretty bland. I had a choice of choosing the black truffle mayo [there wasn't enough (synthetic) truffle oil, I tasted no truffle] and apple butter sauce. Also, DO NOT take those dirty chips home. Ever bit into a soggy bleu cheese chip? Not the smartest to decision to take this to-go, but if an after-club inebriated snack still tastes bad -- it's really freakin' bad.We all synchronized the nasty-what-the-eff-did-i-eat face.Don't be greedy and share your food here.***Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants, but the food was mediocre; I will probably seek out Todd English's Olives (The Bellagio) instead on my next Vegas trip***We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).All the walking in Vegas got me pooped!!! My friends and I came in for an early dinner and to rest our feet. LoL The decor is very casual and of course has a pub like atmosphere with beer in the air and sports on the tubes. The waiter was really chill and nice. He checked up on us a few times and did not let us feel neglected at all. My friends ordered a chicken pot pie and the Amsterdam Burger. We ordered a big plate of beer battered onion rings to share. Out of all the beer battered onion rings I have ever tried, these have the most beer flavor. The only problem is the giant onion ring inside the batter does not rip apart so I'm basically pulling the whole thing out and not enjoying the outside. As for me, I ordered the lobster roll that came with not just one, not just two, but THREE lobster rolls!!! It also came with coleslaw and chips, but I substituted the chips with criss cut fries. The lobster rolls were melt in your mouth... MHMMMMMMMM SO GOOD!!! I ate TWO of them! The lobster rolls are jam packed with BIG CHUNKS OF LOBSTER MEAT. They are so warm, buttery, comforting, and oOoOoh hit the spot DELICIOUS! The coleslaw was okay and the fries were pretty good, but I would come back just for the lobster rolls over and over again! =DHappy Happy Happy Hour! From 3-6 M-F half price pints and wine by the glass you cant go wrong! With a wide rang of beer on tap here are my favorites-Anchor Stream-  A San Fran Beer with a toasted malt flavor and a hop finish, you will love itGuinness- You can never go wrong with this stout on tapPyramid Audacious Apricot Ale- I'm usually not one for fruity beers but this is an exception. Amazing Ale with a burst of Apricot and hints of lemon and wheat.Delirium Tremens, Belgium- This hoppy beer that sits at a 8.5% alcohol content is amazing. crisp yet yeasty you will love this beer. But be careful, its strong :)Now for the food...You can never go wrong with starting out with the Beer Battered Onion Rings. they come with this spicy ranch dipping sauce that truly makes the dish.Ive always wanted to try the dirty chips too. kettle chips with bacon bits scallions and chicken livers... ill def try that next time!I had the West Coast Burger for my entree. Its a turkey burger, with sunflower sprouts, bacon, slaw, avocado and dressed with honey mustard. It also came with huge fries. So yum!My friend ordered the New England Fish & Chips. They were truly authentic and amazing. We also shared a side of Mac & Cheese... don't judge us it was worth the calories hahaThe decor is beautiful as well. Surrounded by windows and natural light It was a nice escape from most pubs that are dark and dim. I also noticed they had beer pong pool and darts. How fun! The bartender told us about the drinking contest they had. Drink a pint in under 7 seconds and its free. Now i would never try this but I'm sure it would be fun to watch. All in all this place is a fun change of pace from the typical Strip Restaurant. I suggest it highly!What a totally cool and hip place with excellent food we found when we tried the Todd English PUB! We were able to secure a booth in the back of the restaurant where we could take in all of the sights and we had a great time and meal. The decor is what you might expect in a pub- complete with dart boards and rich wood furniture. The ceilings are very high so the noise level gets a bit loud, but this is not the romantic dinner spot you were looking for anyway. Yelpers-- check in and get a free beer!!! Even though I was having a martini, I couldn't help but snag this deal up. To be honest, I wasn't expecting as good a meal as we had- the duck rolls appetizer was simply out of this world (see pics attached) and the mad Russian swears that this was the single best Tuna dish she has ever had. That is saying something indeed- It was a perfectly prepared "burger" that she wishes she could have another bite of even as I write this. I had fish and chips that was good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good portion of battered fish. For a bit of fun, in the back they have available some tables for playing various drinking games- we watched several games of "flip cup" and the usual antics of those who have never played.... An overall great place to eat drink and hang loose.Pretty decent happy hour twice a day with $2 oysters and $3 sliders! I liked the decor and vibe of the place and didn't feel completely ripped off like I do at so many Las Vegas joints these days (I'm looking at you, Nobu!). It's very casual in here with a sports-pub kind of feel, but it wasn't all bro-y or too loud. A pleasant place to park it for a while with a drink and some snacks. I did indeed partake of the happy hour oysters and sliders and they were delish! When my friend and I saw their dessert specialty Stephanie's Bread Pudding we had to try it--I mean, it had to be good with that name, right? :P Well it was pretty damn good, even if it had the Cap'n Crunch cereal on top (see photo). I'm not a huge fan of that cereal but in this case I didn't mind it. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back if in the area again.Pub not.  Museum feel, open, patio dining, woodsy, with the feeling of it's the place to be.  With over 70 draft beers, and a menu as wide as it is deep = awesomeness.  A bit overpriced for the beers ($9+) and food is my guess for its overall low ratings.I got a free pint of bud light (Yelp check-in offer), and a half pound of beef brisket carvery ($19).   Super tender, and super good.  Came with choice of bread, and 2 sauces of choice (creamy horseradish and the mustard trio).Sports on the TVs, cool music, and a barrel of peanuts which I went ape for.The girls working here would be rated "normal", are wearing Daisy Duke type outfits.  At the bar, professional yet fun bartenders steal the roost.  Especially when double happy hours are promoted: 3p-6p, 10p-1a.All in all, a great outing. Thumbs up.We love the relaxed yet energetic atmosphere that Todd English's P.U.B. resonates with us. You feel like you're really in a British pub...huge selections of cold draught beers pair well with Chef Todd English's flavorful takes on some English "classics". British classics such as Bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, pot pies and expertly roasted until tender meats and poultry. Our waitress, Diane V., was friendly, effervescent, and attentive. Our water glasses were routinely filled and beer refills were offered. We're "fans" of Chef English's carvery so this time, it was no different than previous visits. Today, I ordered the 8 ounce portion of roasted beef brisket that was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. It was seasoned well and you could taste its "beefiness", in a good way. At my urging, my husband ordered the lobster rolls. Oh boy, these lobster rolls were kicked up a version from those that you'd find at Bar Harbor, Maine! First of all, the rolls are brioche-dough based and secondly, the lobster claw meat is sautéed in browned butter, mixed with seasoned mayonnaise and STUFFED into the rolls. The lobster rolls were complemented with a bag of fresh house made potato chips. As we finished our lunches, we promised ourselves that we will return, again, to this restaurant to try other menu items like the Grichebactom and more beer!This place is a joke!I will be very specific about the issues that I had during my lunch at Mr Todd English's ill attempt at a restaurant:We arrived at the restaurant around 2:00pm for lunch. There was no host at the host stand; just a busser standing up front twirling a drink tray on his finger saying "she's gunna be right back."  The hostess known as "she" didn't return to the host stand for several minutes. We were eventually sat at a table when she arrived back at her post.We were greeted quickly by our server, Samantha. She was plenty friendly. The issue that I had with her is that she was sitting at a table next to us doing nothing but showing pictures of who knows what to other servers while they neglected their tables, and she neglected hers. I had no refill on my soda.  She didn't check on us after food was received.  The manager did nothing but stand next to the heat lamps and lean the whole time that we were there.The $19 hamburger that I received had no seasoning on it and the bun was very dry and stale...huge disappointment. Theb $20 sandwich my wife had was good, but really I could have had it for $7 at togo's. In conclusion:Service: terrible.Food: mediocre at best. I know that my words will fall on deaf ears, as far as Mr English is concerned, but hopefully the management will try to improve the staff so that people don't continue to leave as pissed off as I did.  Don't spend your hard earned money here. You will regret it, as I do!4 stars for the happy hour and cool ambiance.The $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders during happy hour brought us here whilest cruising the strip.The outside seating is open and airy with modern decor and a view of the classy Aria to supplement your experience.  Indoors, the vibe is more cool and hipster, with massive (yes, much larger than normal) dart boards to entertain.  Choose your poison; they're both great!All the happy hour food was delicious and paired well with the huge selection of craft and domestic beers.  Keep the men facing away from the TV screens, as their eyes will be glued there otherwise...It is a pub, I suppose.+1 Free Bud Light with Yelp check-in!Get stuffed!  Literally.Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.Cheeers!I am always in serious need of some solid comfort food in large portions before leaving Las Vegas, this was the perfect place for me after an entire weekend of excessive drinking! Had to get a really good spicy Bloody Mary with Goose vodka first, it was more than a great pour, very spicy and salty, not to mention strong too, loved the cheese in it! Looked through the extensive menu, lots of items looked very comforting and appetizing. I had lobster roll, it came with three small lobster rolls, kettle chips and housemade slaw, OhMY, just how amazingly flavorful and delicious they were, definitely one of the best lobster rolls I have ever had! Hubby had a hot dog with skinny fries. He loved the very well seasoned oversized all-beef hot dog, I loved the fries of course. Thought we just ordered some snack food, but the portions were so big! Wish we had time for beer, the selections were huge. Think I have just found the perfect spot for comfort food and Bloody Marys!We got a complimentary Corona lite thanks to the Yelp! Check-in.  Score!! Our server was really nice and made me laugh which is always a bonus.  The food here was just ok.  The pretzel sticks were warm and buttery, but old and slightly stale on the inside. I wasn't blown away with by sliders (the buns were burnt) and the Lobster Cobb came with raw onions after we requested no onions.  Still ok, but we weren't blown away.  A good casual option at Aria since there aren't many casual options there.  My advice? Go for the beer and/or happy hour and stick with fish/chips.
Hanshiktaco=I was set to try a burrito and all the flavored fries....uh yeah they don't make them anymore. They restructured their menu and it now includes only:Tacos: beef, chicken, pork or tofu&egg,-  1- $2.78 or 2-$4.63(not so) Fries- seasoned fries $1.16 so no more flavor optionsCrazy Dough $1.16Jumbo "Nate" Dog $2.7812 oz Drinks $1We got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. I'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some "Seoul" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, "bahn mi" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). Even if I didn't have "experience" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the "expert" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a "bowl" instead of a taco. I think it needs a "heavier" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying "I'm soo hungry" in the car after we decided to skip "lunch" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. Fries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). I think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an "event" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed. I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.Seriously now.... Has no one ever tasted korean food? This taste nothing like korean food. Please try kogi taco truck then you will understand. I'm pretty sure that's where this guy got the idea from. Worst korean tacos ever... F-Loved it!!!  I came w/ my sister & we had the beef taco,  tofu & egg taco, the nate dog, & fries. I love Korean food & love tacos so I really enjoyed eating the dishes. I'm also a texture eater & I thought the texture & taste was perfect w/ each dish I ate.  Everything tasted so good! The fries were really addicting. Not your typical french fry.  After I ate the nate dog, I had to order another one because it was so good. For dessert the crazy fried dough was sooo good!  Very good service, clean & fast. The prices were right. It's on the same parking lot as Lee's Liquour so I'm definitely coming again! The location is kind of far from where I live, but I was on that side out town so I decided to try it. Luckily I have friends & relatives in that side of town so when I come visit them, I can stop by the truck & get my grub on. I'm actually craving Hanshiktaco as I'm typing this.I was driving down Lake Mead with my Sister and Nephew and did a double take on this shiny Red Truck in front of Lee's Discount Liquor.  Well, I'm a sucker for trying new things and I was on a food truck high just having recently discovered Fuku Burger that past week....so, even though I was on my way to lunch I busted a U-ee and decided to have a taste. The operation is a one man show and the guy was nice enough.  So kudos to the humble service.  However, I can't speak too much about the food.  I was pretty disappointed.  Granted I had high hopes from the look of the truck and the overall concept of "Fusion Food," the Korean and Mexican flavors didn't quite well...fuse.   I ordered the pork taco and well it tasted under seasoned and the tortilla was just tasteless.  I was hoping for more flavor from the meat and maybe even just a warm tortilla would've have done wonders to add something to this very sad cold taco.  I really didn't even finish it.I feel bad giving such a bad review, but hey...it's my honest opinion and I wish Hanshik Taco all the best and perhaps he'll try and put some more pizzaz in his food.The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the seasoning on the fries were pretty yummy.Happened to try this place during their Challenge with "Slidin' Thru" Slider Truck this afternoon or more like yesterday afternoon. Pretty Cool Themed Truck/Trailer and Owner was delightful and Convincing as he briefly explained his inspirations for his creations of Korean Fusion Tacos and such..Here is what I got roughly an HOUR after I placed my order:Pork Taco & Beef TacoBoth the tacos had their version of korean inspired kimchee/saurkraut spiced with a twist. UUmmm.... Okay, I'm always up for new takes on food. First off, there wasn't much meat in either of the tacos and the tortilla made them look even more skimpy (especially for the price). Secondly, the beef was very bland, pretty chewy (not in a good way) and all I could really taste was spicy/heat?! Where's the flavor? Pretty much the same with the pork.. except it was a little juicier with a bit of flavor?! I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to accomplish here..El Korean "Nate" DogThis looked interesting but wasn't much different in regards to its flavor profile compared to the Tacos. The hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog and bun was no different. The only slight upside to this was the texture from the same kimchee/saurkraut thing that accompanied the tacos.  Disregarding the horrendous wait (which was the dagger), the bang for the buck, and the slight edge the hot dog had over the tacos, I cannot give this place much justice. SorryWe tried Hanshiktaco this summer. It's close to where I live and as soon as I saw it I was really excited to try it. I love trying new things and the food sounded really interesting. I've had L.A.'s famous Kogi tacos and was hoping for something similar from this truck. However, it was only okay. The flavors just weren't there. Good concept but more work is needed on the execution.Hanshiktaco has quite a few good reviews, so I may need to try it again as they may have improved. However, I'm reluctant to do so based on my first experience.Disclaimer: I used to work in LA where my lunch options were a line of lunch trucks everyday. I ate from the famous Kogi truck and the other copycats at least once a week. So this review might be a bit skewed because I already have a set expectation of what I want it to taste like. I ordered the pork taco and tofu & egg taco, along with a side of fries. I didn't see an option to order the famous garlic fries that everyone was raving about though. But, it's all good- I was there for the tacos. There were quite a few people in front of me but I didn't mind because I just made my way over to the Snow Ono truck parked next door. Plus, they had some great oldies playing- kriss kross (jump, jump) and sublime. Okay- onto the food.  2.5 stars.*The seasoning on the fries was nice, but the fries themselves didn't taste fresh.  *The pork taco had a nice flavor, as did the egg & tofu, but I was disappointed with the kimchi.  I appreciated the texture, but was hoping for more of that kimchi kick.*I am also used to a soft corn tortilla- and these were enveloped by a hard, chewy flour tortilla. Regardless, I ate the entire thing and will probably return because it is definitely tastier than any fast food joint.  It is right around the corner from where I live so if I see a short line- I will definitely give the Nate dog and Sweet dough a try, with hopes to update this review.So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!
Pisces Sushi Bar & Lounge=I thought it was time for an update for Pisces. Last time I came here I understood why I loved this place so much. And since the beginning of their sushi bar, they have grown to the space next door! My place to be...the lounge.So these are the reasons why I love Pisces:1. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking of a drink you want, you can definitely leave it up to the bartender here. They can make something random and it will be awesome! 2. Awesome service. I've never had a bad experience in this department.3. Want to eat in the lounge? You sure can! 4. They have a jelly fish tank. Yeah, A jelly fish tank.5. Live music on Saturday nights in the lounge. 6. TV's are always on the sports channels. (Even when Bobcats are playing against the Heats)7. Good beers on draft.8. (But honestly in the end it always comes back to alcohol/mixed drinks.)9. And this place well, is the place to go for a mixed drinks with friends. That's probably the only reason I come out to bars is to try their creation and specialty drinks. Or else, I would be home drinking scotch.So, yes. Check this place out. Anthony Hamilton did the other night, so be like a celeb (or just have fun) and watch the jellyfish go round and around the tank and get yo drink on!After reading the discussions in Talk and seeing some recommendations for Pisces, I thought we would give it a try. Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly.
Rigatony's=Let's talk about failure, baby.Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.This is a really good place to eat. It is right at the top for me.The last time I went I felt runshed and uneasy, not the fault of the place though.So this time I was able to truly relax and enjoy it.The endless Salad is fantastic! Just like a true Italian Salad should be, great dressing and dark lettuce.Pasta is really good, cooked just right. Along with the Eggplant, (my girlfriends favorite.)Stuffed Sea Shells are a thing of  beauty. Really authentic!You can even get complete Dinners to go. Which is really good for those days when you have worked all day and are just Burnt out.Clean restrooms and lots of parking. Nice staff, they are very attentive as well.RigaTonys why do I keep forgetting about you!!A friend that I hadn't seen in about 22 years was driving though and hit me up on FB and said Hey lets have dinner, find somewhere off the I-10 and make it Italian and RigaTony's was the perfect place to pick! We meet up around 5pm on a Wednesday night, the place was busy, but not packed, I was loving how they decorated for Christmas, made me feel like I was going to a party :) Our server was Michelle and she was very helpful answering whatever questions my friends had, and she was excellent at making sure we had everything we needed, love great serviceAfter we checked out the menu I decided I wanted the lasagna & spaghetti combo. My friend ordered the chicken with lemon & artichoke and her husband ordered the spaghetti deluxe.Then the antipasto salad & freshly baked ciabatta bread came out, OMG this salad is to die for, I love love love it!! Stop going to the Olive Garden people, this is the salad you should be having!! And the bread!! I love me some fresh baked bread, so much better than sticks! My lasagna was delish baby! It was so flavorful too, the cheese, the noodles the sauce, omg I can't believe I ate it all, I ordered it with the intention of having some for lunch the next day, nope that didn't happen!  So good!!  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect amount and great in flavor! Loved the combo! My friends, they too loved their dishes and were happy we picked RiggaTonys for dinner!! It was great seeing her and sharing a great meal too! A fun tip I did learn about RiggaTonys is once a month on Monday night they have a Wine dinner, where you dine on 5 course dinner that the Chef prepares for just that night; I will have to check that out soon!What can you say that has not been said? This place is good, it is great actually!Came in the other night to get an order to go. It was ready when I got there as promised.They even carried it to my car. Food was great, sausage, manocotti, salad, bread, all of it wonderful.I used the restroom while there and it was clean and plesant.Lots of parking and a friendly staff.If my tongue could do a happy dance, it would totally do it for the food at Rigatony's! Everything from the salad, to the bread, to the appetizers, to the main dishes, it all was fantastic! I had the zucchini for an appetizer, these were delicious, nice and crispy and the batter actually had seasoning so it was quite tasty. For my main dish I split the chicken parmesan and the chicken fettuccini alfredo with my friend. Both dishes were great! Each one cooked to perfection, with very tasty seasoned sauces and nice juicy chicken! The portions at this restaurant are huge, definitely enough to take home for later! I cant wait to go back and try a few other dishes! I had to flip a coin to decide what I wanted to eat this night because I wanted to try so many different things. The only reason this didn't get a 5 star was because the wait time. Waiting to eat here is a little ridiculous. We had a reservation for 7:15 and didn't end up getting seated until 7:45 because we had a party of 9. To me that is not a huge party, but a decent size. To have to wait an extra 30 minutes for a table to eat is no fun. Especially when you have a very active and very hungry 3 year old with you. I am hoping the next time we go without reservations, the wait time isn't as long. Other than that, the staff was very friendly, our waitress was very nice and quick, great décor and kind of a "homey" vibe, great place to try!!! Good for a date, night out with friends or a family time meal!!If you're going to eat your feelings, you're not going for Chinese... you'll just be depressed an hour later.I came here on a whim, wanting to carb load before an early Camelback hike.  Being my first time, I was surprised at the crowd waiting for a table.  When the hostess informed me of a 20 minute wait time, I spied a lonely seat at the bar and made a break for it.I asked the enthusiastic bartender for a hefe and orange, but the unfiltered wheat beer was not on the menu.  He convinced me to go with a Peroni, and it was sheer perfection, and balanced perfectly with my meal.  The $4.50 a bottle seemed steep... I must be conditioned for the dollar PBRs.Starting out with the fried ravioli appetizer, which consisted of four large puffs of ricotta in a pasta shell, swimming in a delightful marinara.  This dish was smooth and cheesy, each bite eliciting the next.  I should have stopped here, but I hadnt eaten all day, choosing instead to brood in a bed with sweat stained sheets.For round #2, I decided on the chicken parm, due to Ashlie's review.  To me, the red sauce on this dish tasted strange, unlike the savory sauce from the appetizer.  Of course, that didnt stop me from eating 72.8% of it.The entree also came with two thick slices of toasted french loaf and a chopped anti-pasto salad.This place rocked!  And the bar aint a bad place to saddle up to.  It's like the single-riders line at DCA's Radiator Springs Racers
Nu Sanctuary Lounge=Wow.  Going a 2nd time a few weeks after the opening.  Talk about loss of credibility fo' shizzle!  The service really sucked big time.  Waited approx 15 minutes unti we could even wave someone down to order drinks.I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews about the service. Really sub standard. Our server was actually very cocky. Really close to annoying and rude.The Food. Pierogis - OK had some caviar on it. Flatbread pizza (with Truffle Oil) - decent -thin crust -had a great crustScallops - It was borderline BAD!! Chicken wings (Thai curry) - The best dish of the night - chicken wings lollipop style covered in curry Thai sauce. Very flavorfulTuna Tartare-OK Chocolate Ravioli - Horrible Toffe cake with ice cream - Recommended to us  - i did not think it was that good. We did have a great bottle of Pinot  Noir. !!!Hookah- OK Close to three stars but the service was just not up to PAR. I doubt if I would be back..
Rubio's=Rubio's are a dime a dozen in California, especially in San Diego where it originated from.  Lived there most of my life and I got sick of Rubio's.  Well, now I rediscovered them here.  I was recently in the area for something quick.  It was going either be Aloha's Kitchen, Thelma's, or Rubio's.  Aloha's Kitchen wasn't open, even though it was after 10 AM.  I wasn't in the mood for Flip food at Thelma's.  So, I settled for Rubio's. I wasn't disappointed with my eats.  I ended up getting 4 Chicken Street Tacos and for good measure, an extra side of chopped chicken breast.  Let's start with the tacos, these were good.  I was a little disappointed with how small they are.  Real street tacos aren't even this small.  But at least they aren't as small as Nacho Daddy's street tacos.  Because they were small, 4 was needed.  It's cheap so I'm not complaining.  I was actually satisfied with my 4 chicken street tacos, but needed that additional protein so I got an side of extra chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry when you have nothing with it, but it's all about the macros at this point. I tend to frequent chicken grills like T-Boy, Samurai Sam's, and TMAD lately.  But discovered that Rubio's sells chopped chicken breast on it's own too.  You know what that means, I'm adding them to my list fast food healthy eats.Pro Tip:-Best fish tacos for a fast food joint-Their nachos with chicken, cheese, and sour cream is a must try-Addicting Chipotle sauce here-Their steak street tacos are my favorite-Great service at this location.
Wild Vines=This place is exactly what Anthem needs as an alternative to endless beer-pizza-wings joints on every corner. Nice, clean, quaint place with excellent wine list, great beer selection and now top shelf liquor. Food is a basic menu but nicely done and tasty. It's not the place for a full-blown five course meal, but the fare is certainly paired well with wine and you can get a great pasta dish, gourmet flatbreads, etc to fill up on.My wife and I will hit this place on our way to a movie night or the theatre downtown. Prices are very fair - especially during happy hour. Then we sometimes hit it on the way back too. Or a great, classy place to sneak away from the rugrats for an hour without blowing fifty bucks. Management changed for the better about six months ago and the clientele is fun, hip and not snobby at all. Just an all around good neighborhood hangout place, maybe even worth a trip from outside Anthem.My boyfriend and I went here with friends on a Friday night.  We were anticipating a fun evening out and a yummy meal.  Well, three of the four entrees came out at once and the server told us the other would be here shortly.  Well, fifteen minutes later and it still wasn't here, so we flagged down the server and she said there were problems in the kitchen.  She said they had sent one of the chefs home early (???? it's Friday night at 7:00 PM).  By this time, our three entrees were cold as ice as none of us had touched them as we were waiting for my boyfriend's Ahi tuna entree.  The server told us she would comp us another round of drinks - just what we needed on an empty stomach.  :-(  So, the three of us began eating our cold food.After at least 30 minutes - it could have been longer - my boyfriend's ahi tuna  finally came out.  It was supposed to be grilled ahi, but had barely been run over a grill.  It wasn't even warm.  My boyfriend told the male server who brought it to the table (a different server than the female we'd had all night) that the ahi wasn't done.  It needed to be grilled more.  The waiter got snippy and said "This is the way we do it at Wild Vines."  I looked at him and said, "Are you really arguing with a customer?"  This guy knew my boyfriend had already been waiting at least 30 minutes PAST the time our entrees had been served.  What a jerk.  He backed off and said he wasn't arguing - he offered to take it back to the kitchen to cook it more.  My boyfriend declined since we were all done with our cold food by this time.Sometime during this time, an unkempt-looking man with a sleeveless T-shirt, discheveled hair, and a grungy-looking backpack which he slung on the bar arrived.  He didn't look clean at all and we came to understand that he was one of the "chefs."When our server learned from the male server that there were problems with the ahi, she came over and offered to comp us dessert.  We really didn't want dessert.  We just wanted to leave.Unbelievably, we had now been there for well over an hour and the only thing they comped us were one round of drinks.  All of our cold meals were full price.  She did point out that she comped the ahi salad - at which point I busted up laughing since it wasn't touched and was sent back to the kitchen immediately.Wild Vines has potential, for sure.  The cold food we ate would have probably been excellent had it been eaten hot.  What this place lacks most is experienced restaurant management.  If they're going to cater to the wine crowd, then they really need to do an overhaul in how to treat customers, how to expedite food properly, and most importantly, what to do when things turn into a cluster f*$#.  There were any number of ways they could have saved the night (and their reputation) if there had been anyone there who understood the value of the customer experience.We ended up leaving and going over to Ocho (a Mexican restaurant) where we had excellent margaritas and my boyfriend got a wonderful quesadilla - as he was starving by this time.
Timbers - Durango=The bar food was good so we tolerated getting to-go items. Even then it sometimes was spotty service and it was always from the same server. Black hair, really bubbly and friendly which makes her scattered with no priorities except to chat and have fun. She's the reason why we always check sauces as it normally isn't always there. I've gotten salad without a dressing or fries without ranch sauce. If we deal with someone else, there's usually not as much issue. After last night, screw this place. Called in the order and it usually takes 10-15 minutes. The BF gets there soon after to pick it up and lets that server know he's here for a pick up. She goes to the back and says it's a few minutes. He tries to get her several times. It took forever to get the food and when the BF pays and she brings him the food, he asks for sauces that wasn't given. The girl goes off then to drop off a drink, but then goes to chat with some people, and off elsewhere, gets people their checks, etc. before going to just grab the BF some ranch, malt vinegar and tartar sauce. At this point the BF has already been waiting 30minutes plus on a order that was called in 50 minutes ago so he was quite miffed that this lady has no concept of priorities. When a customer is needing to leave, then don't hold them hostage! He sat for a few minutes too many for some sauce.58 minutes for food. When we open the food- it was cold and soggy. I didn't get tartar sauce for my fish and chips. I live two blocks from this place so it didn't get cold on a travel home. It's the reason why we pick up here- the proximity should get us hot food. The food was done probably the timeframe they said, but that lady didn't go get the food and wandered around chatting up people. One server can ruin repeat business.
Grimaldi's Pizzeria=Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.I didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.Anyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!The restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  The flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.Will I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.I have been eyeing Grimaldi's for a while. Feeling like pizza I was glad that Grimaldi's came to mind. Parking was bit of a chore but it usually is in this parking lot. The wait for our table was a short 5 minutes. The dining area inside is smaller then I expected so I can't even imagine trying to come here on a Friday or Saturday night and not experience a long wait. We started off with a small "Antipasto". It was $9. I really liked the fresh mozzarella and the whole thing in general. It can easily be shared between 2 people. For pizza we decided to go custom. It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all! They have a dining area outside. They offer a banquet room and catering.There isn't much to be said about this particular location except that I really liked it. I stopped by here at around 5 pm on a Sunday and ordered a cheese pizza with mushrooms, basil and anchovies (not my ideal toppings but I went along with it). The pizza turned out to be delicious; the ambience was great and it wasn't too noisy. I don't care what anyone says, Grimaldi pizza is great!I hadn't been to Grimaldi's in a couple years. I received a e-mail saying that I could get a free pizza up to $18 for free to celebrate my birthday. That's pretty generous! This locations is near Cheesecake Factory and other hot spots so the parking lot is often full but I got lucky this last time and grabbed a close spot as someone was pulling out. Walking in we were greeted and the inside was packed. We had to wait just a short couple of minutes before being seated. To get things started I ordered the Antipasto which I have have each visit and liked it just as much this time too, It's simple yet tasty. I picked a pizza with pepperoni and sausage and let me tell you this pizza was bomb! I don't like it when a pizza has too much sauce and this pizza was just right. The toppings had great flavor and it was just a good and satisfying meal. Our server was cool and he checked on us often and took great care of us. I will definitely be back in the future.
Tara Thai=Pink Pepper has undergone an ownership change & been renamed to Tara Thai. The food remains very similar and the staff is still very friendly.I popped in for lunch the other day with fellow Yelpers Daren C. & Ryan C. and we indulged ourselves on their boofay.The first part about the $8.XX lunch buffet that made me happy was that it includes an Iced Tea. Score!The buffet offers a wide selection of options, from soup, rice, noodles, spring rolls, egg-rolls, tofu, vegetable dishes to many meat options (which my dining buddies appreciated). For me, I was happy to find a good amount of vegetarian dishes. One of the workers happily gave me a tour of the buffet area to show me what was veggie-friendly and what wasn't. Awesome service!I really enjoyed the food and I'll be back. Especially for lunch!A few other tid-bits: They will not accept Entertainment book coupons for Pink Pepper. When chatting with one of the staff members, they informed me that the owner also has a Tara Thai restaurant in Sedona & Prescott, so the empire is expanding.They tell me the large Pink Pepper sign on the exterior of the building will soon be changed.So far, the Pink Pepper 5 stars have carried over, but I'm nervous...I asked the server, "So, even though there's new ownership, you won't be changing the recipes, right?"To which she replied, "Oh, NO! No, no, no.  We won't change anything; we'll just make it more AUTHENTIC."Wes, Daren, and I glanced at each other, exchanging a telepathic,  "Uh huh.  What the hell does that mean?  Are you changing or not?!", but we all just smiled back.   We'd just enjoyed a tasty and satisfying lunch boofay with a smorgasbord of choices for under $9, after all.Tons of dishes full of exotic flavored veggies, meats, seafood, and sides -- even a few desserts.   I enjoyed Thai custard with apple slices quite a lot.  MMMMMM I want another piece.Having seen more of the team than most yelpers, I can confirm that the super friendly and attentive staff seems to remain the same so far.  I didn't see any new faces, but there were several new dishes added to the usual weekday lunch boofay.  Thai toast was weird but good, with its syrupy, cucumber and red onion dipping sauce.As long as they know enough to not change everything that already works so well, the new ownership should enjoy success, including a hefty lunch crowd, with me in it a few days a month, at least!
Vino's Ristorante & Deli=I most recently had an up to now rare five-star dining experience here, where everything I ate was delicious, and service was exemplary, with the bringing of extra Alfredo Sauce, snappy unbidden filling of water glasses, and even quick and professional boxing of leftovers.by our diligent server.Hot and super cheesy Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms were simply great dipped in their own melted bliss.  And the same was true of Mozzarella Marinara, with excellent plugs of Fried Cheese dipped in a warm, creamy, and slightly sweet Marinara Sauce.  A bowl of rustic Country Bean Soup with Pancetta was thick and hearty, with a spiced up broth teeming with potatoes, Cannellini Beans, carrots, tomatoes, and celery.   And an almost endless House Salad with olives, pepperoncini, artichoke hearts, and a  very tasty Italian Dressing was quite filling.  Home-baked breadsticks were good, too, but rather superfluous.Then, rounding out this fine Italian dinner spread was an entree of Veal Scallopini with lean and nicely pounded medallions of veal that were smothered with mushrooms and well covered by a sumptuous White Wine Sauce.  Magnificent golden Parmesan Roasted Potatoes offered a welcome accompaniment to close out the meal.  There was simply no room left to seriously entertain ordering a dessert!
Big Daddy's BBQ=We've been very excited to try out Big Daddy's BBQ AZ since we saw the banners go up the other week and tonight were able to do that.  My family is tired (not sure why since I am doing all the work) of me spending 10-20 hours on our smoker cooking up good BBQ meats so when a BBQ place opens around the corner from our house everyone is happy.The Mastro's group behind this concept could not have made us happier.  I expected the BBQ to be great but not the service since they just officially opened yesterday.  Everything exceed my expectations so can't wait to go back.  I started out with a Big Daddy's BBQ Honey Ale very cold beer which hit the spot perfect hanging out on the sort of outdoor patio.  Before I get into the food I have to say the layout of this place is really cool.  If you have been to Maloney's (prior bar here) it was fun to see how much the layout was changed.  There is a large indoor dining area but then along the parking lot street is a large patio indoor/outdoor area.  Hard to describe so check it out yourself before it gets too hot here in a few weeks.Anyway, back to the food since that is the reason we went right?  Big Daddy's features all the classic BBQ items such as baby back ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, and beef ribs. It would have been nice if I had a 2nd stomach to try it all so when the bartender recommended I try out the 3-to-an-order combo sliders with the option of different meats per slider I was sold.  I ordered up the sliced brisket, pulled pork, and pulled beef.  I am a huge fan of sweet potato fries so took that for my side.  With the beer all that came to about $11.If you are in the Scottsdale area or interested in trying out great smoked BBQ definitely give Big Daddy's BBQ a try.  I know you won't be disappointed (well my smoker might since it sure was easier eating there).
Calico Jack's=I went here for Cinco de Mayo, hearing a lot about it in advertisements. Bad idea!! There was a good crowd and limited seating. My group took a seat next to a couple of other groups and we struck up a conversation. We all ordered food and drinks separately. By the time the waitress brought us our one bottled beer, I had already gone up to the bar, got a drink and drank it. We also ordered all you can eat tacos since she suggested it to us. She returned 40 min. later to tell us they weren't doing it anymore, so we ordered nachos with no tomatoes. It ended up having tomatoes on it, but she couldn't be found, so we scrapped them off. It turns out that the couple next to use had a the same $10 off coupon as us. When we got our separate bills, the waitress said she couldn't use the coupons because we were at the same table. We weren't even at a table. We were on random benches and didn't even know the other group originally. The waitress took our coupons before we got our food and never said anything about not being able to use them then. She brought back her manager who could care less and was extremely RUDE and wouldn't listen. They ended up calling over security and the cops and kicked us out over a coupon that they couldn't apply?!? They then took our barely eaten food that we paid for and threw it all out without asking, when we were waiting to get a box! This place will not last. The group across from us said they were never coming back and it was the WORST service they've ever had. Poor management and rude waitstaff, especially Christina. DO NOT GO HERE!
Big Hurt's Snack Shack=The way I'm drawn to corndogs is magnetic. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Perhaps just a thing? I don't know, but since I think a corn dog is just a hot dog wrapped in a delicious sweater it makes me happy.Big Hurt's happens to sell corndogs very late into the evening, which is good for late night munchies. They also sell fries that are too salty, unless you really like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good. And, wait for it, cheeseburgers on donuts instead of buns. So, in case all the gambling and drinking doesn't kill you, they've got you covered.
Cameron Chinese Seafood Restaurant=I love dim sum, and this place just took dim sum to a whole other level for me. While I have always been nervous to go to dim sum restaurants that require you to order your food from a list, rather than a cart, I went here with my family and we managed to navigate our way through the menu and what a delicious meal we had!The portion sizes here are huge, so while the prices may appear to be higher than other dim sum places you might be used to, keep in mind that you are getting more food for the price you are paying! Because we did not realize this at the time, we ended up ordering more food than we could finish, so we ended up taking home some leftovers!Like many dim sum places around town, this place gets very busy, very quickly. If you want to be sure to get a table, make sure you get there by 11:30. During this meal, the big hits were:1. Crispy fried squid2. Rice noodle rolls with shrimp and sweet soy sauce3. Baked eggplant 4. Shrimp shumai5. Shrimp rolls6. Lotus leaf sticky rice (lo mai gai). 7. Sesame ballsService at this place is very quick and the food comes out tasting VERY fresh. I definitely suggest checking this place out.
Jacqueline's Cafe="If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."  I think that's how the saying goes... and I usually stick to this saying but since I'm a yelper, I have to be honest about my experience at Jacqueline's Cafe.I admit, I read the reviews prior, many of them not so positive, but I was still optimistic that I would like Jacqueline's.  It's in a convenient location in the Hilton Village shopping center and it looks bright, colorful, and fun from the outside.  There's also a ton of option on the menu.  So I dragged Lindsey F with me to lunch earlier this week.  We were greeted and seated in a timely manner... and our server was sweet.  We ordered ice water with lemon and a hummus appetizer to start.  The water tasted like it wasn't filtered and the hummus had a tang to it that wasn't a good tang.  (I think I've tasted hummus with a tang when it's sat too long in my refrigerator in the past).  I will say the pita that came with it was warm and tasty though.We each ordered salads, and they were huge portions.  They looked good but a few bites in and we both agreed that they looked much better than they tasted.  The egg, chicken, and avocado that came in my Cobb Salad tasted processed, and the dressing was really thick.  Needless to say, I barely made a dent in it.So there you have it, my honest review of Jacqueline's Cafe.  The two star rating says it all: "Meh. I've experienced better." Sorry Jacqueline's - I wish you luck but I will probably not be back for another mediocre meal.
808 Hawaii Mixed Plate=I've been coming here twice a week for lunch the past few weeks. The food is awesome and affordable. It's way better than going to a fast food chain. I rotate between these:Loco Moco mini $5.50Hula Pack w/BBQ chicken $4.50Shoyu Chicken mini $4.95All the employees are nice. I call in my order so I don't have to wait. I don't even need to tell them my name anymore!Aloha North Vegas Yelpers!This is the closest place to me that offers local food.I had a late lunch here last week with my guy. We both come from Hawaii and love local food.I had the kaukau pack which is their version of a bento. I choose garlic ahi and sesame chicken. It comes with white rice and fried noodles. Great taste and reasonable price costing $8My guy loves the korean chicken plate and Portuguese sausage here.To me their version of Korean chicken is OKAY... I would suggest something else... like their garlic ahi!Why -1 star?super long wait... really long wait... did I mention there's a wait? and the menu is limited but I'm ok with quality, not quantity. I guess I wish there was more HAWAIIAN food on the menu, I say this is more of local food from Hawaii. I guess I had my share of other Hawaiian spots in the city, so I've been to places that has more variety.This place reminds me of a place you would find in Hawaii. Very friendly staff! I love Hawaii people! One lady there reminds me of my grandma back home. Gotta love the aloha spirit!Will I come back?YES!I'll probably call in my order a head of time to cut out the wait, now that I have their menu.+ military drinks free! Indoor seating. Super Casual. Lots of free parking.Mahalo 808 MP!-Miss Yelp 2011Yummy, cheap, a thousand times better than Panda Express or any other main-stream place (such as L&L). This is a very non-assuming joint in a big shopping center off of Craig in North Las Vegas, but if you find it, you have found a gem!I went here on a lunch date with a friend of mine and we arrived just around 11:40 AM on a Friday. There were open booths/tables and a small line. We both took our time checking out the menu and decided to get one of their daily specials, the "808" special. You get two choices of entrees (however it is limited to certain ones), and your choice of slaw, rice, or a mixed green salad. My friend and I like to share so we thought this would be the best way for us to try a bunch of different things, so here's what we got:Chicken KatsuShoyu ChickenGrilled SalmonGarlic AhiSpam Musubi (2)My favorites were definitely the grilled salmon and the garlic ahi. The chicken was so-so. So I would absolutely reccomened the fish dishes over anything else here. The salmon seriously had this amazing flavoring in it that made it so yummy. My friend doesn't even like salmon and she said she liked this one. The musubi was good too and it had just come out fresh when we ordered ours.I love that you can get a green salad here as a side. This one they had was great too - leafy greens, very fresh and with a nice side of dressing as well. If you live in the NLV area you should definitely make it a habit to come here. I know I'm going to be coming back.This has got to be the best Hawaiian restaurant that I've been to.  The food is very tasty and it's close to home.  It's in the same shopping complex as Poke Express.  Hawaiian goodness in one area!We got there to place a to-go order.  I'm not sure why I didn't call to place my order but oh well.  The kalbi takes 20 minutes but it was soooo worth the wait.  It was juicy, tender, a bit fatty and the flavor was great.  The Spam musubi was alright - it had a bit too much rice though.  The garlic chicken was also good, lightly breaded but it wasn't as garlicky as I would have liked.  Good thing I also got the GARLIC AHI - it was sooooo good.  The fish was fresh and the flavor was AMAZING.  It was topped with toasted garlic.  Easily, the best item on their menu!  Their portions are generous.  I wanted to finish my food but it was just too much.  I'll keep coming back for more garlic ahi though.  Yes, it's THAT good!After eating here several times I am finally getting around to this review. Why, you might ask? I dont know why either. Maybe its because I am so full and satisfied after each visit that I just got too relaxed which equals to laziness on my part. Well I feel that I need to do this now so all you peeps out there looking for a decent Hawaiian place to eat can get the info you need. First of all, they are closed on mondays.  To help you find this place easier, look for the nicely sized Big Lots sign in the same complex. Since the building itself is kind of back a ways, their sign looks dinky from the street. They are to the right of Ella Em's Soul Food which I kind of dont recommend eating at. Refer to my review on them and you will know what I mean.Since my first visit here I kept telling myself that I will try other dishes but always end up getting the same items. Mainly Kalbi Short Ribs, Garlic Chicken, and Grilled Mahi Mahi accompanied by a rotation of the Mac Salad and Green Salad.First and foremost, if you are coming here for the first time, get the Kalbi Short Ribs! It is nothing like what you have had at other places. It's literally a bone in steak because the cut they give you is like about 4 actual short ribs stacked on top of each other but cut up into strips for you enjoy it much easier than having to manually pull the meat apart or cut it. If you dont believe me, please refer to the numerous mouth watering pics and mine will be there as well! I recommend you order it medium rare for best taste and tenderness. Also give them a little more time to cook it especially if the place is packed.For you garlic lovers like me, the Garlic Chicken is what always gets me kind of like how that one really cute nephew or niece of yours that you just cant say no to when they tilt their head and give you the puppy dog eyes look. Its basically chicken katsu cut up but with a different version of breading with a garlic mayo type of sauce on it.The grilled Mahi Mahi always hits the spot for me when it comes to my fish craving. Its tender flakiness falls apart oh so easily with your fork. Only thing that may have caught my attention is that the portion was just a tad small. These three items I get are part of the their name sake combo, the 808 Mixed Plate in which you choose two items accompanied with two scoops of steamed white rice and your choice of mac salad or green salad. Im glad I dont come here alone and bring my family instead so I can sample all the goodness! The total price for all three large orders plus 2 drinks came to about 31 bucks and change. FYI, most orders you can get a mini or large depending on your appetite. The 808 mixed plates are guaranteed to be large sizes. So I would say an average meal here would be around 10 bucks a person. Not bad at all for really good food and good service.Speaking of service, they take your order at the counter, you pay, sit down,  and they bring it out to you once its done. The drinks are self serve so you dont have to wait for them to refill your drinks. Once you are done eating, try to at least clean up a bit after yourself so that they dont spend too much time cleaning after you and for Pete's sake, leave a decent tip if you havnt already when you paid up front.Next time I will try to order other stuff but no promises. Also dont forget to check out Poke Express down a few suites for some excellent Poke and yes, I have a review for that place too! So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this while driving and go straight there. Then you can send me a compliment after reading this. Lol. Enjoy!Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #105 "Da Kine!"
Griffintown Café=This place used to be quite the thing in the neighborhood, but completely lost it recently. I heard that the former owners sold it to accountants and went on to open Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun.I went recently, maybe mid october, and ordered the eggs benedict, as I always do, because they are amazing. Instead of the usual yumz, i was served two cold eggs drowned in a thick, cold lump of yellow sauce, along with cold potatoes and partially cooked bacon.I sent the plate back, which I never do, mentionning that it was the first time I saw something like that at Griffintown Café, and that I would happily wait a bit longer for the real thing, and hot. What came back from the kitchen was the exact same plate, provably microwaved, with even more of the thick, disgusting sauce, and what appeared to be melted butter on the salad. Puzzled, I decided not to eat anything because it was honestly disgusting. I politely complained about the quality of my meal, and was offered a groundbreaking 10% discount ("the best we can do for you sir"), for a meal I didn't even eat 10% of. Needless to say, I won't be visiting again soon. Anybody else has experienced a sharp decline in quality at GC?I hope it was an exceptionally terrible day for Griffintown Cafe, as the experience we had here was definitely exceptionally terrible. I usually get very excited for brunch, so I'm much more forgiving of mishaps. The cafe is cute enough for a brunch place with a kind of rustic, bright ambiance with an open kitchen, high ceilings and a back porch. The service was satisfactory to begin with; orders given, they ran out of some dishes.    A pregnant member of our party requested her eggs be 'well done'. Two hours later, we received our orders. 1-2 requests for water went unfulfilled. My eggs benedict was terrible. The hollandaise sauce tasted of mayonnaise. The toast was burned and the request for 'well done' eggs came back over easy. How do you mess up eggs? Griffintown knows the answer. No apologies were given for our LOTR-esque epic-length wait and moreover the service was brusque.I went to this café last week for an afternoon coffee. The atmosphere was lovely. There were few people since it was about 4:30 pm. My friend and I sat on the terrace. It was sunny, but the sun did not bother us; the seating outside was surrounded by trees serving as a natural parasol. I ordered a cappuccino with soya milk with a chocolate mousse. The two were delicious. If you are looking for a place to meet with friends in intimacy, this should definitely figure high on your list of options.
Bistro La Bon=Bistro La Bon rates a solid four stars for service, food, presentation, and ambience... Don't let the location fool you. Just lock your car doors and hurry on in. They're not open on Mondays, so, since my twins are at camp this week, we came in on Tuesday.This place has tablecloths, cloth napkins, nice china, and relatively comfortable surroundings. They have four or five outdoor tables, and a surprisingly large indoor seating area, with a bar/lounge area near the entrance that looks pretty posh and comfy. Waiters are polished and polite, attentive without being smothering. They're also very enthusiastic, to the point of almost gushing about the food and how good it is. They're trying hard. The food IS good. Check out the menus in the photo section here. My wife and daughter and I sampled two small plates as appetizers, and devoured our three entrees. Entree portion sizes are just about right.The hummus is good, although we are hummus lovers, so we've had better (but not often). The olive, pickle, edamame sampler was yummy!They did a good job on everything else, too (see my photos). My wife thought the bok choy was a little salty, but my daughter liked it that way. I didn't try it.The dill potatoes were very tasty. The Salmon was great, according to my wife. Pan Seared Branzino (European Sea Bass) was excellent. I have no idea what's in that sauce, but it's decadent!The veggie sandwich looked great. I wish I had ordered that. My daughter could live to 100 if she keeps eating that stuff.The few suggestions I have for these folks are to put some art on the walls and to put some interesting treatments on the (rest of the) windows. The views of the industrial neighborhood and the power lines outside aren't that attractive. A bit of carpet, or sound-deadening material on the floors, ceiling, or walls, is in order, too, if possible. The place was pretty loud, and there were only six or seven other occupied tables there when we were.Those complaints are minor. All in all, this is a very nice restaurant. My daughter paid them her highest compliment: "I want my next boyfriend to bring me here." She's pretty picky, being a vegetarian AND lactose intolerant, and she found really satisfying choices here. I concluded I need an excuse to come back here and hang with friends in the bar for a while. It just looked relaxing.  Take $20 to $35 per person, depending upon hunger and thirst for alcohol. I think it's worth it.I came here for their raved about Sunday brunch. And sadly for my taste, it was a very big let down. While walking inside and enjoying their decor was very eye popping and intriguing, their food was "meh."They serve about 12 dishes (7 hot dishes) and they also have chocolate waffles and french toast. The waffles, toast, and eggs with bacon have to be ordered so the waiter brings them out. (No worries, they're part of the buffet)So why 2 stars? Here are the problems I felt uncomfortable with...1. $18 a pop?! I mean come on the variety of food isn't that extensive at the same time I felt as if none of the dishes popped out to me as absolutely amazing. I believe that 18 for brunch I paid for was presentation of food...2. The service - it was okay, I mean I did expect a little more. The cups I drank water out of was lets say, a little smelly? The waiters use rags to wipe the glass cups down, and well I think that's what makes glasses smelly.3. The food - as mentioned before, the food was okay. But the price of the brunch and the materials of the food didn't make sense. Think about it, Swedish meatballs one of their raved about dishes... Everyone compares it to Ikea, yes it's better but the price of it doesn't make sense. Probably the most expensive plate is the "smoked" salmon. To me, I didn't feel like that salmon was really smoked at the same time there was no taste in it (maybe because I didn't add the extra flavors to the salmon?)However, even these reasons are some of the reasons why this restaurant turn me off off..others can see why this restaurant is good. One thing I did notice is that all their food is really healthy. Their dishes didn't have that much oil, their most unhealthy dish is probably the brisket because of the fat. That, to me could probably make their prices a little more, but still I don't still quite believe it would be that much.Anyways, for me I rather go eat a vietnamese brunch on a Sunday spending a lot less for more variety and at the same time the healthy option is there for me to choose. Overall, I had a positive experience, but sadly this restaurant isn't quite my scene and brunch wise wasn't so great.
El Pollo Correteado=Grill it and They Will ComeAs long as chickens and mesquite trees continue sacrificing their lives for humankind, you might as well visit a place honoring both, plus your tastebuds. Pollo Correteado does one thing, mesquite grilling chicken, adding standard sides. They offer macaroni salad, mashed potatoes, and frijoles de olla - Mexican pork and beans. Pollo Correteado honors all three, giving your palate a Cinco de Mayo or Fourth of July (take your choice) explosion of delicious excellence. Chicken can easily be grilled into jerky. The day I ate here, the bird was tender and juicy.The salsa is mild, onions marinated down to tasty side elements, jalapenos warm and good, sliced lemons full of puckery, sweet condiment de Mexico. The frijols de olla that smoky traditional Mexican excellence that's not easy to find. Tear the meat from the bones and build your tacos as you wish. Supplement with a Mexican Coca-Cola over ice and it is feast time.I'm coming back. And I'll make sure some Saturday night our family tries Pollo Correteado.
Straight Up Gaming & Martini Lounge=Since the takeover of Red Stone Grill, we've been meaning to visit Straight Up Gaming and Martini Lounge.  A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.I remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.Happy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.After walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:* Potato Pancakes "Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream." ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.* Crab Cakes "Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish." ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.* Chicken Wings "Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style." (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! * Queso Cammarones "Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips." ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! Service - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! Other appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!Overall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! They also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!Mondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate KaraokeTuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 MargaritasWednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pmThursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnightFridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pmSaturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% AppetizersSundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!Update!  We returned the following week...* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus "Served with crispy tortilla chips." ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.We also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their "Spicy Garlic" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done. Oh well.
Taqueria Guadalajara=We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best.    David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there.   I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.
Arizona Sandwich Company=A co-worker introduced me to this nice little sandwich shop a few months ago.  I have been back several times since.  It's close to my work and the service is fast and friendly!  Every time I have been in it is the same dark haired women at the counter taking orders and it's just her.  She welcomes you with a smile and takes your order.  She has a small set up with a phone and a laptop and does triple duty.  They have a daily special usually a half sandwich and soup or salad combo with a drink and it's resonably priced.  You can get a decent lunch for under $10.  On a recent visit I had a 1/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of chicken chili.  The sandwich was fresh and the bread was soft and absorbed some of the condiments well.  I thought the flavor of the chili was nice with just a tiny bit of heat.  On another occasion I got a sandwich, chips and a drink for under $9. Nice!!  This is a small, cozy place.  There are several tables available but if you get there while they are super busy you might not get a table.  I've noticed they do a lot of to go business too.  No tables outside but if you work in that area, there are plently of grassy spots for a little picnic.  You can call in your order for pick up too.  Thanks Arizona Sandwich Company!
STK Las Vegas=Cosmopolitan Hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We gamed a little to kill time before our dinner time at 6:00pm. Once we got there, it looked a little empty, just around the bar were full. We were seated right away, we had a nice view of the whole restaurant. We had two orders of Fois gras french toast $22., tuna tartare $18., tuna sashimi $18., half a dozen oyster $18., and a caesars salad. For dinner we had the sea bass - no good because it's not Chilean sea bass. , bone in ribeye - prepared great, seared big eye tuna - tasty, beef short rib - my friend said very tender and good. strawberry cobbler $16 - fruity flavor with cracker crusted rim dirty pearls $17 - vodka & blue cheese stuffed olives. It's different! White orchid $16. - not a sweet drink, smooth, vodka & slight gin We weren't going to have any dessert but was talked into ( in a good way) so we ordered the Warm Tres leches cake; Dulce de leche - coconut sorbet - crispy macaroon. It was so sweet.!!High energy and a good vibe with the food to match.The food at STK is very inventive, pairing ingredients that you wouldn't usually think work.  Its presented all prettied up.To start, the foie gras French toast is a must try.  It is served with the traditional green apple and sherry grastrique but with an almond brioche French toast? Sounds strange but I really works. The Beef tartare is also excellent with loads of black truffle and the delicious soy caramel.The Dover sole is very good but very traditionally prepared.  Can't mess with a classic I guess.  Its moist and works with the baked lemon and brown butter.   The seared tuna with wasabi potato, maitake mushrooms, and sweet miso is incredible.  All classic Japanese flavors fused successfully together.The steaks are good, well prepared, and tender but once again, this is not a steak lover's paradise.  You do not get to pick your cut and grade of meat.  I like my steak naked so I cannot speak to the sauces or toppings.Service is very good.Prices are in line with restaurants of this caliber (aps $15-$20, mains $30-$45).The wine list is good with prices on the high side.Sunday night we decided to have dinner with a couple friends at STK located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Let me tell you, it was probably the strangest dinner I have ever been to. I felt like I was in some type of music video or commercial. The patrons and servers were so over saturated with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yelling "action" from the top of his lungs! I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a "world-class DJ." There were girls fist-pumping, servers dancing while pouring wine, and people grinding between tables. I think I actually rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming! I grew up in Vegas, by way of the military (my dad was in the Air Force). I don't know if Las Vegas has always been like this or I can now see how semi-cheesy it is... Whatever the case, people were having fun and that was nice. More pics on my blogThis is the place to go to if you're looking for a steakhouse that isn't stuffy, conservative, or quiet. Other places around town try to pull off the same "cool kid" vibe but, unlike those spots, STK has some great food. I've heard from others how loud it can get, but we dined on a Tuesday night and, while it was busy, the music was at a decent volume -- low enough that we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. I was hoping to sit in the main dining area where they have nothing but booths, but we were seated in front of the bar in a loungey-type area with mostly 2- and 4-tops.The bleu butter bread that they start you out with was warm, fresh, and delicious. The half-dozen Kusshi oysters ($18) we had next were mild, meaty, and excellent. The pea agnolotti ($15) had an overpowering pea taste and, unfortunately, not enough of the goat cheese or pistachios that accompanied it. The final appetizer we had was their tuna tartare ($19). Sure, it's a common dish found in almost every restaurant these days, but their version is very good. Fresh chunks of tuna were sitting in a corn tuille, which added a bit of sweetness to the dish and a crunchy texture. The avocado cream under the tuille had cayenne pepper (I think?) that added a kick.My wife has been eating less and less lately, so we split the 14 oz. bone-in filet ($52). Wow! You had me at "bone-in"... drool-worthy, nom-worthy... hell, it's even sponge-worthy. One of the most tender and amazing filets I've had. We got the blue butter sauce with it, but really there was no need to put anything else on the steak.We got a side of haricot vert ($10) -- or green beans as ordinary folk like me call it -- that was tasty and firm. Not the slightest bit overcooked or soggy. The portions are large, so plan on sharing among three or four.Service was a bit spotty. Our waiter was nice enough, but he had at least six tables and was constantly running around. Meaning we didn't see him often. We sat around for almost half an hour before ordering our food. A little help for the wait staff might not be a bad idea.For all you Top Chef fans, Stephen Hopcraft (formerly of Michael Mina's Seablue) is the executive chef. But, whether you're a fan of the show or not, the bone-in filet is reason enough to stop by.4.5 StarsI took my company/party of 7 here for our holiday dinner. I had a previous experience at this restaurant where our waitor added an item to our bill which we did not know we ordered. They will confuse you about what you are actually ordering since it is ala carte. When it happened for the second time it was apparent as their common practice. Long story short, my secretary, a very young woman, asked the waitor to suggest a steak for her entre. The waitor suggested a steak to my secretary by name only and my secretary agreed. When we got the bill I found out it was a $180 special steak that was off the menu and no price had been quoted. Upon calling the manager she argued with me and was very defensive. Who wants to get ripped off at dinner?Hey Management! When someone calls in with a concern, you should not argue with them without first at least looking into the situation. We basically got scammed as if we were tourists in a foreign country. The manager who called me back was so defensive, never apologized and offered to buy me only drinks next time?? Wtf My bill was $1080.00???Never have I've been so ignored in a fine dining restaurant. I had high hopes for this place but so RUDE! Music was way too loud for a normal volume conversation. Practically had to scream to talk. As I'm reading other yelp reviews looks like STK DOES NOT HONOR RESERVATIONS, like they didn't honor mine.Food: 5/5 Skirt Steak 7oz.- Surprisingly my girls think I'm weird because I actually really skirt steak, if its cut right. Medium rare with a nice sear. Super juicy and flavorful. Yummy1/5 Bone in Rib Steak 20oz.- I didn't really care for this, It was delicious but a little tough. A lot tougher than the skirt steak which is surprising. Sides:1/5 Asparagus- not sure if this was cooked properly but It tasted a little cold. 2/5 Parmesan Truffle Fries- Very Fluffy and yummy but it had a strong over powering taste of garlic powder. Totally ruined it. Service:HORRIBLE!!! 0/5We had reservations at 11pm, I understand they close at 12am so you would think they would want to seat us right away and take our order, NO. The hostess kept us waiting telling us our table wasn't ready. Finally seated at 11:30pm, I wasn't going to rush for them but wow no server no introductions, no water or drinks offered. We had to ask our busser who our waiter was. I've never been so ignored.Nouveau riche 20 or 30 something or just wanna be a baller for a night?  STK has all the tools needed to make it happen.  An excess of foie, truffles, and caviar to golden bottles of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne; heck, there's even a live DJ to negate conversation (except for yelling or hand gestures) giving the excuse to text or checkup on one's social network fame.Oh, the food is good.Starters are upend takes on classics. The beef tartare packs a flavor punch, mixed with black truffle and served with peppery, sliced, crisp radish and a sweet and earthy soy caramel.  The flavors blend well.The foie, indulgent.  Large slice, pan seared, served with almond brioche French toast and a sweet, woodsy, sherry gastrique brightened by tart apples.Finally, one of the most decadent sliders (lil' BRGRs); American wagyu burger topped with foie and black truffles.  Pure decadence.  I'll leave the flavor to your imagination.Good selection of steaks in different sizes and cuts.  Servers claim the beef is USDA prime.  Seems correct.  Good texture, marbling, well trimmed, good sear and properly cooked to temperature.  The Bone in rib steak, bone in fillet, and porterhouse excellent.  There is a selection Wagyu cuts.  Never tried them since their country of origin unknown.  Maybe the word "Wagyu" is baller enough?Do not pass on the foie or truffle butter.  Both add a great flavor boost.  Tuck the compound butters under the steak so the heat releases the aromas trapped within.  Excellent.  Add a slab of foie and / or shaved truffles to kick up the flavors even more and increase the baller status.Steakhouse standard sides.  All meant to be shared.Very good wine list.  Passable service (it's difficult to communicate with the servers thanks to the music).Simply put, it's Vegas baby.I've found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas!  I made reservations way in advance for a friend's bachelorette party.  We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!  All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.Another reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner. The only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!I realize that STK is some hyper-cool, vowel-free play on the word "steak", but I also hoped that it might also be an acronym for something.  Perhaps "Sexy Trendy K____", but I couldn't think of an appropriate K-word.  Oh well.Linguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.I had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)I ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  ** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!Service was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect "Vanderpump Rules"-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.I was definitely impressed by STK.  The whole experience was PRFCT.This has become my favorite steak house in Las Vegas. It is a nice departure from the traditional steak house. The decor is modern. The music is a little louder and a lot more fun. There is even a DJ on weekends. This is a steak house where you can have a great meal and have some fun.Our server was excellent. She was attentive, friendly and very helpful. She did a good job holding a real conversation with us through out the evening.For our meal we started with the Pork Belly. It was great. It is a small portion that can only be shared by two or three people. The flavors were on point though. For my meal I ordered a Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese Crust and Bearnaise Sauce on the side. The steak was prepared perfectly. The flavors of the steak, crust and sauce combined for a great taste.For our sides we chose the Sweet Corn Pudding and the Mac & Cheese. The mac & cheese was creamy, rich and had good flavor. It is a solid side. The corn pudding, though, is fantastic. This was a great surprise. It sounds kind of boring and plain, but it had great flavor and textures. Definitely give it a try. You will not be disappointed.Dark, sexy and fun with awesome music! I should have mentioned the food above but in all honesty it's good but not amazing. This place should have amazing food because it's pricey and they have everything else going on. The vibe is a lot of fun, eye candy everywhere, some are even interesting which is a bonus, it's dark & sexy, the seating is perfect for groups, the music is great, the food is good but in my opinion needs some work. The issues - my steak was pricey and was very salty & had too many grisly parts. My goddess salad lacked in flavor & creativity. I also tasted my friends Caesar and it was pretty boring. As I mentioned I expect more when paying prices like these. The good - my friends seared tuna which was perfectly cooked & very flavorful. My friends skirt steak which was more tender then my sirloin and less salty. Our sides were very good, the perfectly cooked asparagus, decadent mac & cheese and the really great jalapeño cheddar grits that were super rich & creamy with just a hint of kick. Dessert was good but nothing amazing. I definitely didn't have any magical moments and I really wish I had. I also need to give a shout out to the complimentary hot buns that come out of the oven in an iron skillet with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The best part was the company with a large fun group and just having a good time together before the weekend begins! This place is great for larger parties and the service was good too.Review on the food to follow. Management addressed my issue within two seconds of voicing concern online and I appreciate that so much. Yelp really works.staying at the Cosmo so decided to try this placeI always try Kobe at steak places and there was no price on the menu.  I remember the server saying something about the steak being $60-100.  kind of forgot.  all I remember was she said minimum 4oz so I got 6oz.Chilean sea bass - was very good!  the texture was great and the mushrooms and veggies was good.  I didn't get the truffles on top so that saves about $20.lobster mashed potatoes - IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THIG I'VE EVER HAD.  it didn't even taste like potatoes.  we didn't even eat it. I should have asked to return it but my friend said it was weird.  and when I saw the bill it was $30!  ughhhh waste of money.I also looked at the bill and the Kobe was $240!!!!! OMGGGG DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT MUCH.  it was so tiny (as you can see from the pic).  good though but Mastro's has their kobe $125 for 10oz.  I think that's wayyyy more worth it than STK kobe.First, my wife is from a family of cattle ranchers so she knows beef and she loved this STK! From the oysters to the bread to the main dish, this is one fun, loud, happy place. The burrata salad was fantastic, the potatoes were great as was the wine list...I don't a single bad word to say. Ambiance=5Food=8Service=12Drinks=8It's off the charts good!Glad I went. Btw, not as pricy as people say. And worth every penny!!!I came to Las Vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like "Sex and the City!" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. Everyone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie "Oceans 11" with George Clooney..I came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.Appetizers:They give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.Salad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.Entrees:I ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.My colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. We ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:Creamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.Jalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.Mushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms sautéed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.The wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.DESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.This is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!
Pepe's Tacos 3=I love three things in life:  My mom, my bulldog and Mexican food...perhaps not even in that order (sorry mom!)  Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's "best of" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. Well to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare "It was much adoo about nothing."  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).  Some of the other reviews of this place seem a bit harsh as the place does it what it needs to do for being a hole in the wall Mexican taco shop.  Award worthy?  Probably not.  Lunch worthy?  Anytime...especially if my mom is paying (sorry again Mom!)
Soyo Korean Barstaurant=On a big stretched popular street in a big city of Korea, there are great number of neon glow of theme cafes, pubs, bars, or restaurants are located side by side. It's always lively and fun! In the past, I've been to lots of late night eatery places just like 'Soyo Barstaurant' back in my home town and the other night, I was hoping that this might be the place I can have a great time with a small group of friends on typical Friday or Saturday nights in Las Vegas. Yup! I think I found one :p Soyo is a great place to grab a bite to eat & a drink. These are the things that I like to share with you after tasting their foods and drinks:) 1. Atmosphere-comfortable booth, simple color of decoration and design, music is mixed & fun(the most recent K-pop music plus some American pop songs were playing, no signs of smoking inside of restaurant 2.Food Selections- The menu is extensively focusing on traditional favorites(Korean-style appetizers) & dinner for 2-4 cooked on the plate of steel(ex: I had a bean sprouts, pork ,squid, & vegetables with spicy sauce cooked on the table. All dinner comes with small dishes such as kimchi, radish kimchi, cucumber pickles, stir fried fish cake w/ onion, spinach , & etc.) 3.Drink- Domestic or Korea beer, Soju of choice, Soju with flavors(ex: I tried their pineapple & lychee this time,, sweet, fruity, & yogurt taste :p) I remember my friend used to joke with me~ a liquor, Soju, is a elixir of life?!  A Soju is the best cure for a Soju hangover??? LOL I Love SOJU!!! 4. Service-Attentive & very friendly :) The server was smiling all times and brought over things to my table whatever I needed. Never run out with my free roasted barley tea with ice. I wish we have more fun places for the locals in town..Soyo is a good local combined BAR & RESTAURANT spot you can hang out with your buddies until late at night! I think I will be visiting Soyo again real soon~~~A decent Korean restaurant in the southwest area without breaking the bank!We've been meaning to hit up Soyo Barstaurant for awhile, so was pretty happy when one of our friends suggested that place for her birthday dinner.We had a pretty huge group - at least twenty people.  We easily took over the two long tables in the middle, although there was still plenty of room in the booth-like tables, and in the little loft area on the right when you enter.One thing I definitely appreciate are the bottles of iced Korean tea readily available on the tables.  This makes life (for customers and employees) so much easier because then you don't have to wave the staff down for refills every few minutes.  The unusual thing (for most of us) were the gold bowls on the tables.  We could only assume they were cups for drinking, but were a bit unsure.They started off with three different kinds of banchan that evening - cabbage kim chee, string beans, and fish cake.  A bit skimpy on the banchan side of things, but was overlooked.Four of us decided to share a few items:* Kim Chee Fried Rice ($7) - This was topped with a fried egg.  It was REALLY good, surprisingly tasty and really enjoyable.  Something I don't usually order, but would definitely order again at Soyo.* Beef Short Ribs with Korean BBQ Sauce ($12) - A bit tough to eat, but had a good flavoring and the right amount of time on the grill.  We couldn't complain about the price either.* Spicy Pork Ribs ($10) - Another dish that the boys devoured and enjoyed.  The price wasn't too bad for this dish as well.* Spicy Soft Tofu with Seafood, Beef or Pork Soup ($8) - I was pretty stuffed by the time this dish arrived.  It was pretty standard for a soft tofu soup, and I chose the seafood option for it.They also have quite a few things they describe as "Korean tapas" and lots more entree options.The only real complaint was the service.  It was a bit understaffed with only two people working.  They should have had another person, especially with our large party that took over.  We had to remind them about certain items - rice, for example.Overall, everyone was surprised with how the bill turned out.  Even with alcohol, it was a lot less expensive that most people thought it was going to be.  Soyo Barstaurant is a welcome addition to the area and we hope they stick around.  They're open late too!Maybe it's because it's dipped nearly 20 degrees in the last week in Vegas, but I seriously think it's brrrrrr cold!!  When it's cold, I think of any food that's warm and cozy (ramen, chicken noodle soups, jigae, beef stews, pho, cinnamon rolls).  Soyo sure fits right into the warm and cozy because they offer all kinds of Korean comfort food.  We enjoyed...1.  starchy potato pancakes - Might I say even more enjoyable than the kimchi pancakes?2.  seafood soondubu - It's got a combination of tangy, spicy and warm your belly goodness!3.  chicken wings in special sauce - these are some mutant wings!  they are gi-normous!  delicious.4.  dolsot bi bim bap - this totally hit the spot for the windy days this past weekend.  it was hot.  not spicy hot, but HOT in a stone pot!  i love how this dish is always presented in a hot stone pot, but soyo really does it right.  The mix of rice, veggies, and beef comes out seriously sizzling, so when you go to toss it with the sauce, you have to really dig in to scrape the now crispy rice membrane at the bottom.  for those crispy rice lovers, that is certainly not a bad thing!  chewy, crispy, tasty rice!Conclusion:  Korean comfort food at it's best.p.s.  bomb panchan.I am a frequent visitor at Soyo and love this place a lot. This time, I would like to share several menu items while drinking alcohol beverages such as Soju or Macju(Beer) :P The service has been truly excellent by the friendly staffs.. They seem to always be on the move, efficient, and very polite people. **Corn Cheese-basically corn baked with a cheese sauce in a sizzling hot pan that makes it gooey, crunchy, sweet, and salty. Seems like they added some chopped onion, scallion, carrots, jalapenos(all kinds of veges), & panko bread crumbs(crunchy) for more flavors. It's a MUST-HAVE in the appetizer! **Starchy Potato Pancakes 'Kamja Jun'-It's under the special menu(written in Korean on the wall)and their Potato Pancakes were really tasty! This pancake is made out of fresh potatoes, instead of flour (it's more healthier). Because of this, the consistency and appearance of the pancake is quite unique, slightly chewy and almost translucent. The Potato Pancakes are the best served fresh off the pan so when it comes to your table, go ahead and enjoy it right away. Me and my friends really liked this dish the most out of any appetizers :) **Steamed Pork, Napa cabbage, & Oyster 'Bossam'-It's a cooked pork belly, you wrapped with nicely salted napa cabbage and tasty Bossam Kimchi. Bossam Kimchi is specially made for 'Bossam' and it's more sweeter and more vegetables(radish & fresh oysters) in there compare to regular Kimchi. For Bossam, Kimchi is not an option. It's one of main component to complete this dish. It also comes with Ssamjang sauce (bean paste with sesame oil & garlic) and Saeujeot (pickled fermented shrimp) that you can create you own style of Ssam!!! It really depends on your preference and this is how I like to eat my Bossam :) It can be really spicy so stay out of this dish if you can't handle the spiciness. **Fried Dumpling 'Kun mandu'-The server told us that they make their own version of dumplings at Soyo. The filling were clear noodles, ground beef, cabbage, scallion, onion, & firm tofu..It is best to eat immediately with vinegar-soy dipping sauce.I went to Soyo with the Yelp Elites after an Elite Event. I have driven past this place a couple hundred times and never would have thought about stopping in if it hadn't the official after Event dinner spot.Soyo isn't very large, but they were able to handle our group of around 20 without much trouble. The place is much different than the other korean places I've dined (most have been AYCE). The meal started with some cold Roasted Barley Tea, which wasn't really too great IMO (a little too smokey), but I'm always open to try something new, and the waiter later brought me water with a pitcher to refill my glass.The menu isn't the biggest in town (around 50 items), but everything I tried was really really good.I am a Korean Food rookie and stick with what I know, The Bulgogi, and I can say it was without a doubt the best bulgogi I've had in vegas. The meat was tender, the veggies were crisp, the sauce was flavorful but not overbearing, and the hot clay pot it was served in was a nice touch. I will be going back for this dish alone, however that was not the crowning jewel of the evening.One part of the Korean eating experience (and it goes double when you are with yelpers) is sharing. I got to try a bunch of items I would never had ordered on my own.Their Dumplings were amazing, I am slowly trying my best to eat vegas out of dumplings, and these were nothing short of yummy!  I also tried the Fish Cake Soup, and while it wasn't what I had in mind (how do ribbons of fish count as cake?), it was surprisingly good.But the Dish that stole the night was Budae Jjigae, I am going to be honest I have never heard of Budae Jjigae before, and without this trip and the brave souls who ordered it, I may never have. It's a stew that consists of random meats married with ramen noodles, and served boiling hot in a spicy (but not too hot) sauce. The meats in the Budae Jjigae served last night appeared to be Spam, Hot Dogs, Vienna Sausages, and possibly more. I have a feeling after my diet is completed I will be doing my best to finish an order or two of Budae Jjigae!The Ban Chan were all pretty good, the rice was your standard white rice, the raddish was really good, and the Kim Chi was nice (I prefer mine cooked rather than cold however).One thing I did learn, when they say Spicy on the menu at a Korean Resturant they mean SPICY!!! One Yelper ordered the Spicy Pork Ribs, I tried a piece of cabbage with the Spicy Sauce and think I burnt a layer of taste buds off my tounge!I really like the set up at Soyo, the service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty fun, and after a while the Kpop music grows on you.Oh and they have 2 tiny arcade consoles that looked pretty fun, but I was afraid to play as they looked like I could break them by just looking at them funny, yet alone playing them.Kudos Soyo I will be backSOYO = #1 Vegas Korean hot spot!!!My boys... supercr3w/ jabbawockeez  love coming here. I came here last month with the boys... and I was super excited since I've been wanting to try Soyo after reading their rave on yelp.I had the Kalbi and bulgogi! 2 solid choices!I can't wait to come back for more kalbi & bulgogi!!I don't do spicy/hot  nor do I drink alcohol so my korean choices are limited but the kalbi and bulgogi is more then enough to make me come back to Soyo!Love the indoor seating. cool drinking cups.Casual dining. stress free parking. no wait (when I went that night).If you're visiting Vegas or a local and looking to get your korean on... make it SOYO!I'll be back SOYO!-Miss Yelp 2011 :DHeard a lot of great things from Yelpers at past events so we finally stopped here after looking at houses around this area.  Really cool atmosphere inside and everything on the menu conveniently goes great with BEER!!Hite beer is great.  I feel like I could guzzle a gallon of this and feel good enough to operate heavy machinery or at least finish second on Jeopardy.  3 dishes is MORE than enough for 2 people.  I will definitely bring a group next time to try all the other great looking dishes we saw being served to others.  We got the kalbi, kimchi pancake and the kimchi and pork soup.  All of them were great and we left totally stuffed.Soyo now gets the five star treatment from me.  Service is always excellent and is able to cater to my party, whether it's two people or twelve people.  They have no problem pushing together several tables to accomodate large parties.  The staff here is extremely friendly and very open about their menu.  Not only will they tell you what is good, they'll also tell you what is not so good.  I think one big thing that Soyo has going for them is that the staff speaks English pretty well, which makes things a bit more convenient for us non-Koreans.I can safely say that food here has remained consistent, since my friends and I have ordered the same dishes many times over several visits.  The Budae Jjigae is still delicious, and if you ask them for more broth/soup they will bring it!  We asked for enough refills on soup last time that they even gave us more ramen noodles.  They know we enjoy their jjigae.We're now on a mission to try the whole menu, and everything we've tried has been good.  Recently I've tried the Blood Sausage and the Very Spicy Chicken.  The blood sausage was tasty, and came with some vegetables and clear noodles.  The Very Spicy Chicken is very spicy (spicy in, spicy out).  Order it mild or medium, and you have a delicious chicken dish with some spice and mozarella cheese on top.There are also special nights throughout the week now.  Tuesday nights are ladies night, where you can get drink specials if your party has 3 or more girls; no guys allowed in your party though!  I believe the drink special was 2 for 1 drinks, but I'm not positive (I'm not a lady, so it doesn't apply to me!)  On Wednesday through Sunday nights, if your party spends around $75 you get to spin their wheel.  Prizes range from nothing, to free cocktails/beer, to a $50 credit for food.  Lucky for me, the group I go with will almost always spend $75!It is safe to say that Soyo is easily one of my top Repeat Eats!  Enough so that now there's a new Yelp Las Vegas acronym: SUYE (Soyo UYE)!Soyo is a popular dinner and late night hangout spot that attracts mainly the younger Asian clienteles. Although I have seen much older patrons having a late supper here as well.  Soyo which called itself a "barstaurant" has a menu that is dominated by Korean tapas, and rounded out by some items in the soup, entrees and casseroles categories, and of course beers, ales and "cocktails", which in Soyo-speak for flavored soju.It is an establishment that is best visited with a decent size group of friends, as ordering food and sharing it family style is the best way and arguably the more cost-effective approach to enjoy Soyo's menu.  And having a Korean speaking friend is most helpful when ordering, as most items do not have English names, just descriptions or list of ingredients for each menu items. Below are menu highlights that our group have enjoyed in past visits.Marbled Beef - Thinly sliced sautéed beef with onions with a slightly sweet flavor, served with Korean salads and dipping sauces.Grilled Squid and Garlic  - Highly recommended for garlic lovers, as there are a lot of garlic in this appetizer presented in a foiled parcel.  The slightly sweet sauce is perfect with a side of rice.Smelt Roe with Seaweed over Rice - served in hot stone bowl.  It is best to let the rice gets crispy by the super hot stone bowl, before mixing everything together and diving in.Very Spicy Grilled Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese On Top - The two chilies warns you to avoid it if you can't handle the heat, because even at 'mild' it will still burn you at least once.  But it is a perfectly delicious dish for those that enjoy walks on the spicy side of life. Gop Chang Soup/Casserole - served with beef intestine, tripe, vegetables and noodles in a spicy broth.  This is best shared with 2 or more.Boo Dae Soup/Casseroles - This became famous around US Army base in Korea, as it is an American fusion spicy broth made with ingredients (hot dogs, ham, cheese) that are available to US military personnel. Adding a side order of instant ramen noodles completes the authenticness of this item.Anchovy Hot Noodle - noodle served in a mild anchovy broth, it was a surprisingly good and simple bowl hot noodle soup.Decor:  3.5/5Food:  4/5  A lot to select from, best enjoyed with a decent size group of friends.Service:  4/5  They are always friendly.Soyooooooooo was off the chain.  Come on, if you've been there already, admit you wanted to bob your head a little while you were eating.  Stop lying to yourself.  I even heard a new melodic rendition of Hit em Up.  I was sold when I walked in.   Between the elevated, tall, secret table on your right as your walk in, the tin bowls to drink tea in, and the music taking me back to the Source Awards in the early 90's, I was in a special moment.Onto the food.......We ordered the Marbled Beef which was alright.  The Buhdaejjigae was comforting and for only $2 more, you can get extra noodles.The Grilled Squid and garlic was awesome, but I wish I could have paid more for more squid or bigger pieces.   The star of the show was the Korean Beef Short Ribs with Vegetable Stew.  I wouldn't be suprised to see this on a future episode of Best Things I Ever Ate in Vegas, because like one of my friends says, it's like candy......or short rib crack.  If you haven't been to Soyoooooo, Hit em Up!Soyo is a fun neighborhood spot that has successfully created a fun bar atmosphere whilst serving great korean food.I've never been to Korea so what I'm about to say makes no sense.  Soyo makes me feel Korean the moment I walk in. I've always wanted to be Korean so it's like a dream come true. I'm partially joking... I went through high school listening to K-pop so the fact they play nothing but K-pop is enough of a reason for me to come back time and time again. Lucky for me, their food is fantastic also. They serve all the typical Korean dishes that most of  us are familiar with and some + American favorites such as french fries and chicken wings. My favorite dishes to order;Kalbi(short ribs)Soon Dubu Jjigae (tofu soup)Dduk Bokki( spicy rice cakes)both the spicy and fried chicken wings bibimnaengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles)I'm here a few times a month since it's so close to my house and open late. I have yet to have a terribly bad experience. Service is a hit or miss...Miss most of the time...This is probably because I'm not actually Korean :( But that's ok...I am not needy. Keep feeding me delicious food and continue to play the awesome tunes that you do... I will be a loyal fan.With all due respect to my local pub(in Vegas)sometimes I just needto kick it with some sojuand Korean Fried Chicken.Thank goodnessSoyo Korean Barstaurantfits that bill during those times of need.The placeis alive with the sounds of K-pop, accented with cool lighting,and houses some super old school video games(we're talking Super NES quality gaming here).Yet it's still surprisingly chillthanks to strategically placed boothsalong with super friendly patrons and staff.The foodsupplies me that comforting combination deep fried and spicewhich not only entices the palatebut also opens up the senses.But what really sets this bar / restaurantapart from other Korean spotsis their Soju.Imagine a perfectly blendedsmoothie.It is neither too sweet nor too wateryand is cool and refreshing and very relaxing.Now imagine that same drinkgetting you completely blato.Good stuff.Overall,it's a great place.My experience with Soyo was disappointing.  I ordered two items from the tapas section of the menu--chicken gizzards with garlic and onion and son doo boo.  The chicken gizzards were good, chewy but that's the nature of the meat.  The son doo boo is supposed to be in beef broth.  The water the two pieces of tofu rested in shouldn't be referred to as broth.  Broth connotes some type of meat/fish flavor.  This had none.  It was merely a watery dish with a side of hot dipping sauce.It was the wrong day to go to Soyo.  The place is very small.  The tables are such that it's not a good place for a person eating alone.  I was there a little after 5:30 and there were only a few people in the restaurant.  Within a very short time, young people getting dinner before going to EDC came in and I was taking up a table that could seat four or even six.  There was an error with my order and rather than have them bring the correct item ordered, I hurriedly finished and paid the bill so someone else could have the table.There are too many good choices out there.  Soyo won't be a do over for me.I have been dining at this restaurant for many years. Generally speaking, I think 4 stars is right on the money.First of all, this may be the best Korean dining room in Vegas. And, it would be hard to argue against that. Upon entering, one could be forgiven if they thought they were mistakenly transported to a hole in the wall joint in Seoul. The year round Christmas lights emphasizes that fact.The service here is also pretty good. The servers are very attentive as well. They will constantly refill the water and ask to refill the banchan side dishes if needed.Food wise, I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's good. They give great "bang for your buck" value. Don't be fooled by the "tapas" menu, these are entree sized portions! My favorite item to get here is the soondae bokeum (pork blood sausage that is spicy stir fried with veggies). That's a hard dish to find in this town, and they do it pretty well except that it's a bit too spicy for me, and that the veggies aren't as crisp as I would have liked.I will continue to come here. Great value, ambiance, and a great place for something that's definitely a little bit different, but very good all around!Light, fluffy pillows of tofu soup!!!...Spicy, elastic buckwheat noodles!!!...Flavorful slices of marbled beef!!!...There are so many great things to enjoy at Soyo!It took far too many years for me to include Korean food as one of the mainstays when eating out. I think it was because I was so dreadfully afraid of receiving a KOREAN KIMCHI SLAP...and if you're not familiar with that, you should google that now and rest assured that you are in no danger of such a horrible experience happening at Soyo. I know this because my Asian wife told me it's more dramatic if it happens at home.The bibimnaengmyeon is my favorite.  It is cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with some fresh root veggies for a little texture. It is a little on the spicy side, but an ancillary benefit is that it helps to clean you out the morning after. Another Soyo favorite is their Soondubu Jjigae (Spicy Tofu Soup). I don't mind tofu, but I rarely looked forward to ordering tofu until I came across this dish. Korean heat is one of my favorite styles for spicy foods.  This dish balances that heat, with rich and full flavors. A final go-to is Soyos Chaa Dol Baak E Boo Choo Moo Chim Salad. This dish is certainly light on the salad and plentiful with thin slices of marbled beef. What the salad brings is a nice bit of acid to cut the fattiness of the savory beef.Soyo is a "Barstaurant" which, best as I can tell, means it's a restaurant that can at times have a fun, slightly lively, feeling going on when the Soju is flowing freely. Still the name is a bit vexing. In general, it is just a cool Korean restaurant...so stop by and check it out if you're looking for good Korean eats!My fave Korean bar in Cali/Vegas!! Very clean, but still retains that modern "grungy" Korean Bar feel...food is very decently priced, especially since everything is so darn yummy!! Only weird thing was that we literally got checked up on by EVERY employee and manager and cleaning people...meaning we got asked if we needed anything every 5 minutes or so, and people watched our dishes like a hawk and took it away once empty, which made me feel like i had to eat faster so they could stop looking and take it away. Never really thought that would be an issue, but it was a bit awkward after a while. The food that we got were all delicious--its rare to find a place that has decent gochujang (most in Cali are watered down and way too sugary)--but this has it! The fried rice cake is yum, as was the galbijjim. To be honest, I've had better cheese corn, but I'm not complaining! The cold noodle (nangmyun) was also a favorite of ours...soondae was only so-so, but once again, good enough to make me happy so whatevs!We are DEFINITELY coming back here on our next trip to Vegas...I'll be missing it til then!I feel that I'm often the last one to try a lot of popular restaurants in Vegas, and I'm glad that I've finally checked this one off my list.Soyo is a Korean restaurant in Southwest Las Vegas. I had trouble seeing the name on the facade at first, but it's on the southern corner of a building that it shares with a few other businesses, perhaps most notably Oyshi Sushi. Not many people were utilizing the outside seating area, which is expected in the summer. I didn't actually find out where the "bar" of the "barstaurant" is, but I'm sure it has to exist.Anyway, the main indoor dining area has a pleasant ambiance. It has an interesting feel with the concrete flooring, largely pale wooden walls, bookshelves, and rather dated appliances including a television set and some arcade games. There are some rather charming booths that are elevated slightly above the ground, but our large group took up a table or two on the floor. The largely K-pop music wasn't stifling in loudness, but it's noticeable during conversation. I really liked the cushions that they provide because it never came to mind even once during the meal that I was sitting on a wooden bench.You'll definitely want to drink something here, even if it's non-alcoholic. The complimentary barley tea is my favorite rendition of this drink so far. The barley flavor is cleaner than what most places serve, but it doesn't taste watered down. I probably could have finished the entire pitcher by myself. By the way, they didn't serve it in bowls, which I'm sure would have been awkward.I also had a couple shots of the yuzu soju. It's not very alcohol-heavy, but it's sweet and clear with a wonderful yuzu flavor. If you haven't enjoyed this particular type of citrus before, this is as good a chance as any.The food was good overall. The Japchae ($10) with bulgogi (+$2) was really delicious. Really smooth noodles with egg, beef, and thinly sliced veggies. I would order it again. The soondubu ($8) with my choice of seafood is a bargain compared to most other places and tastes delicious even without the egg, which is either an add-on or was misplaced somewhere by the wait staff. Loved the broth, which came out mild per my request, as well as the silky tofu and the various seafood bits (shrimp, mussel, clams, octopus). It's my favorite soondubu in Vegas so far.The LA-style galbi ($15) was good too, but I typically prefer a sweeter marinade on the meat. There may also be some small inconsistencies with the cooking temperature due to wide variations in how they cut apart the meat, not that the texture was at all tough or that I've gotten sick or anything. I kinda wish that I'd opted for the seemingly popular garlic chicken wings now instead, but at least there's always next time.The complimentary banchan (side dishes) were a bit of a mixed bag. I really liked the kimchi and I enjoyed the broccoli, but I disliked the surprising crunch of one of the items that looked to me like sliced skin-on tofu. Also, the crunchy chunks of some juicy radish-like root vegetable seemed atypical and out of place, and nobody ever asked if we wanted seconds.I also managed to sample a few other items from around the table. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon, or however they anglicized it here) was delicious, with prominent octopus pieces in at least my chunk of the pancake. The dduk bok e (from the first page of the menu) tasted pretty good and wasn't too spicy for me, but I'm just not a fan of the rice dumplings. I'd describe their texture as a "mushy" chewy, which I'm sure is intentional but just isn't my favorite thing to have in my mouth. I also enjoyed a sample of the beef from what appeared to be a bulgogi with dressed chopped lettuce.I'd love to return to Soyo to try more of their dishes. There's not much competition in terms of Korean food in this particular part of town, but they're doing a great job regardless.Staycation, Vegas edition continues...  Wife was sick at beginning of vacation and Monkey coming down with something(hopefully just allergies) during second half, so now our great outing turned into a stay-away-from-work/visit parentals staycation...  I know Phillip say 3 dishes is more than enough for two people...  But does that include tapas?  Long, lopsided day and Soyo open til 3am on Thursday, so here we are.  Pigging out.  Monkey do:26 COLD BUCKWHEAT NOODLES w/beef- Good and icy cold35 GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS- Taste great, better than most places we've been, but bloody at the bone on 3 out of 6 wings. Skip the salmonella next time38 GRILLED SQUID- Snippets of squid legs, garlic, jalapeños wrapped in foil, then heated on grill. Weak 55 HANDMADE FLAT DUMPLINGS- Tasty ufo-shaped potstickersSame great service, friendly and not too loud atmosphere.  Monkey shall definitely return to try other dishes and hope to bump up another star for consistency.When I'm craving for spicy Korean soup, Soyo is where I want to be! Enjoy now and suffer later :) Their spicy ramen soup with different sausages reminds me of my college years eating cheap instant noodle soup to get through exam week! Who said spam is only for emergency food?!? Haha! This soup is my ultimate food for zombie apocalypse! LOL!Their amazing garlic chicken is cooked perfectly and blended with their special sauce...making this a winning entree for me rather than an appetizer. The crispiness of the chicken with the garlic seasoning surely makes this my favorite choice! Then there is the bibimbap with bulgogi served in a hot stone plate...you can never go wrong with this dish! The crispy rice on the bottom is an added treat. The protein, veggies and rice served in one is definitely one to order when in doubt. The restaurant is not that big to handle a large group. However, they do offer outside seating, but the ambience and the nice decor is not comparable. The service for me is hit or miss. Overall, this is a great place to dine in and prices are not over priced compare to other Korean restaurants around town.
Georges Brasserie=Date night, my lovely wife requested that we find a place that offered French Onion Soup. Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of "compact" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.I kid you not, my wife said "That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States." So it has that going for it.George's will likely be our "go to" spot for romantic evenings.My first experience at Georges Brasserie came down to this simple mathematic equation.$25 Brunch Bar + all you can eat Oysters on the half shell +$12 bottomless Mimosas = extreme happiness and gluttony!Picture yourself, Sunday morning, seated across from you friends. Shades on, fresh coffee and hot Beignets served on a fresh, white snap tablecloth. The patio oozes European flair. Slicked back hair waiters twirl platters of Oysters and Mignonette, followed by Grilled Shrimp daydreaming on Gruyere Polenta. Carafes of high grade Mimosas magically refill themselves. Now Chilled Shrimp dance the Cancan around eggs and prime rib as they push perfectly Carmalized Crème Brulees closer and closer to tempt you. Georges Brasserie truly is brunch Fantasia! Tout est merveilleux!!!
Jac's Pizzeria & Pub="Just a spoonful of sugar, helps the pizza go down"I think that little ditty was the kitchen's motto when this place was Nello's, in Old Town...not any more:)I never really cared for Nello's all that much...just too sweet in the sauce department for my taste...not just the pizza, but pretty much everything they made that used red sauce of any kind.I'm happy to say that Jac bought this place last week, changed the name and threw away the bags of sugar that must have been littering the kitchen:)The result is a very much improved, pizza centric, Italian dining experience:)The Beautiful Carin and I met another couple for dinner at Jac's last evening...a double date...we're feeling social again:)None of us knew that Nello's had changed hands...we went back and forth with texts to make sure that we were in the right spot...very entertaining:)But once we were in, it was clear that things had changed...and for the better:)Carin and I each had a well made vodka martini...for $3.00 a pop...made with decent vodka, too!We had appetizers...including a very well done bowl of mussels in a vodka sauce that was "lick the bowl" good (although I didn't actually lick the bowl...much like when I was actually dating, Carin tells me that I should be on my best behavior when we are double dating...I don't know why...it's not like we're going home with them...but I was good:)The new pizza menu at Jac's offers new and interesting artisan options, including the well done "Margherita" and a "Bela Dela Meat" something or other that was wonderful!These pizza's were savory, well made, smokey from the wood oven and they were huge! :-)We had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizza:)A great value at under $80 US money for four of us, including multiple cocktails, two big pizza's and two appetizers:)Finally, while the décor hasn't changed, the atmosphere has...the cherry on top of the whipped cream was the delightful little jazz combo playing in the corner...at a level that gave us a great background music for our date, yet still let us carry on a conversation (Carin tells me that's a rule of dating...getting to know someone...so many dating rules...I thought I was done with all that...now I find that the rules are doubled for double dates:)If you still need the sweet red sauce hit, ask them to bring the sugar bowl to the table...otherwise, drop by Jac's and enjoy the marti's and the pizza...oh, and get yourself a bowl of the mussel's...you can thank me when you see me:)
Steak 'n Shake=11/25/11After checking out a movie at AMC and a bit of shopping at Northlake, the rest of the family wanted to grab a bite.  On our way to Friday's, a nephew mentioned Steak 'n Shake, which went over well w/ the adults, since it was cheaper than the original choice of Friday's, and me, since I felt like having something sweet!  The wait was moderate, but it was Black Friday, after all...Manager asked if we minded getting two tables pulled together, and we said "no problem."  We ended up sitting in two booths, across a foot path and adjacent from each other...  Two of the children ordered a steak burger and chicken fingers, both w/ fries.  Mom had a cup of chili w/ onions and cheese, and I ordered a strawberry milkshake to share.  Kids enjoyed their meals, Mom thought the chili http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=hbKt52iPDQduRiz1huRszQ was mediocre ("the chili at the Sam Adams bar in that airport was much better!"), and I thought that the milkshake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was too sweet.  We stopped halfway, and I decided I'd order my original choice of Hershey Special Dark.  This was much better-- not very sweet!  Nice that this also came w/ a few chocolate chips sprinkled on top... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=Jj17ry6dfdmjRpa3eh2OggHad to remind our server of the kids' forgotten mini-shakes.  An order of onion fries arrived that no one ordered-- very cool of the manager to offer it to us, anyway!  (That's how it should be, btw... rather than serving up soggy fries to the intended guest or throwing them away.)  Seems like everyone deemed the meal satisfactory.Maybe next time I can check out other menu items...
McDonald's=This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal.My most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!)Overall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas.What can I say about McDonald's??? Picking up food for my mother in law and wifey, mom specifically requested a Big Mac so up I go for a 5 minute drive. I ordered nuggets, fries and a Big Mac. Guy took my order accurately. I pulled up and told him I'd be paying with Apple Pay, he put the scanner out the window and a second later my order is payed for. Apple Pay is soooo convenient. Since I ordered like 30 nuggets I asked for extra ketchup which the girl in the second window was nice enough to include. The whole process was probably less than 4 minutes. Fast food was fast. The nuggets were spicy which was weird but I like spicy so it's all good in the hood. Wifey and mom enjoyed their food, will be coming here again in the near future due to working in the area.Eff you McDonalds, eff you! You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....I cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as McDonald's. Their food is not fresh, but frozen so really the only rating, aside from food, is the cleanliness, staff etc.This place is packed and understaffed. It was about midnight and I could see 2 people working behind the counter making the food. The manager was doing her best to keep the food coming out of the kitchen, but clearly was short handed. Napkins were empty, and floors were sticky.The food even tasted worse by McDonald's standards. Just not a good experience.I come to McDonald's for emergencies only.
Omelet House=Time for possibly the fastest turnaround ever on a review.Just got home from Omelet House, the Boulder and Russell location. It's just a few minutes from my house, and I was a bit apprehensive because of the mixed reviews. However, when I saw that it was doing brisk business at Sunday brunch hour (11:30), my fears were allayed.It's the Omelet House, so of course I went straight to the omelet menu. I was almost gonna order the Lobster Fest, but I figured it couldn't have that much authentic lobster if it wasn't $15+. I decided on the Bugsy Siegel (#16) instead, which they say is roast beef  in an Italian red sauce, sour cream, and jack cheese. Within a couple of minutes, our server had brought out my pumpkin bread. While the texture is moist, the flavor is good, not great. When I got to the second half of the bread, I had to use a little bit of butter to offset the growing blandness. I slightly preferred my friend's banana nut bread, which I'm definitely going to have next time I'm here.My omelet was just good. It was little overdone and a little bland, which are safe things to do at a diner, but you can't excel if you don't take risks. I might ask them to "undercook" it by half a minute or something next time and see if they'll consent. Oh, and the omelet really is as huge as they say. I might've been able to finish it had I tried harder, but I spared my belly and took about a third of it to-go. Be ready to do the same, or consider sharing the omelet with a friend.The fried potato slices (they're all a little too thick and some are not crunchy enough to be called "chips") were the real star of the show. They come with some dried parsley (?) flakes and some pepper, and they go well with a little bit of Heinz ketchup. They also add a bit of saltiness to the omelet. I also tried some of the Mexi-Chicken, which killed my sensitive taste buds with jalapeno, and the cinnamon apple stuffed french toast, which was yummy and not at all dwarfed by the syrup.This is definitely a nice breakfast joint, and for about $9, it's a very good value. Check it out when you're on this side of town!Omelet House puts together a strong Midwestern style breakfast experience.I stopped for a meal while in Vegas by direction of a colleague recently and was immediately transported to the Midwest by the feel of the menu and interior, even the friendly server made me wonder if I was in Minneapolis or Kansas City. The menu is enormous and offers just about any breakfast staple that you could imagine. It took considerable time to decide upon the Chili Verda Skillet Breakfast, something I figured I could not find at home in OC. This Southwestern number combines Chili Verda served over home fried potatoes, onions, peppers, and Ortega chilies which is then topped with two eggs and Jack cheese. All killer, no filler and with a $9.49 price of admission, I would try it again happily. The downers include a less that sterile environment in the dining area and disgusting bathrooms. Considering the locale, I am sure this isn't a deal killer locally but it drops a 4 star meal down a notch for this Yelper.So I tried this place a long time ago when they first opened and it was very ehh, cold, overcooked food but my dad was craving breakfast so we decided to give them a try since it's near my parent's house. What a complete turnover! I got the Lobster Benedict, and my dad got the Chicken Fried Steak and both were loaded with flavor. It's funny because I really don't like omelets but even though they have a bunch of omelet options they also have a lot of other choices for breakfast as well as sandwiches and hamburgers!So if you've never been here, there they don't have hashbrowns, they have spuds. Basically homemade thick potato chips. I was kind of iffy about these but our server told us we could have them soft so they're closer to the textures of potatoes in potato gratin or we could have them crispy. My dad and I went with the soft spuds and they were just as good as hashbrowns in my opinion.Now I was really surprised with my Lobster Benedict. There was probably about  5 inch thick pieces of lobster on each english muffin! (came with two) And it was really fresh tasting as well! The Hollandaise sauce was also really creamy and seasoned well. Yum! I had to steal a bite of my dad's Chicken Fried Steak and it was pretty good as well. I really liked their sausage gravy but their Fried Steak made me sad when some of the breading slid off but the flavor made up for it. As for service, our server was really friendly and made sure our waters were kept full. Their hours are really good as well open everyday from 7am-3pm. Can't wait to come again and maybe try their Pumpkin Bread I've been hearing a lot about as well as Stuffed French Toast.
Treehouse Bakery=Writing a review because some of the negative ones had me laughing my ass off. For the people so bothered by the fact that the owners are not "vegan or even vegetarian," let it go! That hardly qualifies as "unethical." It's not like the awesome sister act behind Treehouse is using the equipment in their kitchen to make their treacherous carnivorous meals or they are eating BLTs as crumbled bacon falls into the cake batter. And as for the complaints about the price, $2.50 is beyond reasonable. As someone who has visited every bakery in central Phoenix at one time or another, their prices for the quality and the presentation are absolutely fair. And if you think their cupcakes can't match up to your own wonderful vegan baking skills, then you should...I don't know...go bake yourself!! And taking your review down a notch because you didn't realize they were vegan and you don't eat vegan, well I think that's more on you than them.Now, on to what matters: the product itself. Treehouse Bakery has an awesome range of flavors and they made me fall in love with their churro cake. Two years ago, I ordered one for my birthday and they decorated it to fit my request to a tee. Angry Asian Girl cake, YES!! They bend over backwards to fulfill customers' orders and believe me, they have had some doozy of requests. They are more than qualified to run a bakery, vegan or not.Cori and Amanda are also just genuinely awesome individuals who care about the community. They have helped me out more than once when I needed cupcakes for an event. If you become even a semi-regular, they make you feel like an old friend. The Grand Avenue and Phoenix in general should feel lucky that Treehouse is there and hope that it stays around for the next gajillion years.
Which Wich=Disclaimer: Your first visit you will be completely overwhelmed when you walk through the door. Don't worry. They are prepared for that. Someone will hold your hand (figuratively) and baby step you through the process. If you dislike your sandwich here, you don't really have anyone to blame but yourself. Pick your bag and start crafting your masterpiece. 10 bag options. Once you agonize over that, vessel decisions. White, wheat, wrapped in lettuce or in a bowl. Hot or cold. Toppings galore. The combinations and possibilities are endless. Well not endless, but I'm not going to sit here and do that math. Numbers. Hard. Oh and a very important note... THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE HERE. You know what I'm talking about.This location is clean. The workers are ridiculously nice. They pretty much have to be to walk customers through How to Order a Sandwich 101. Parking can be a problem here. You may have to walk a mile... that is if you can even find a spot. Would you describe yourself as someone who has trouble making decisions? This may not be your best option to grab a sandwich.Wanted to search for a new restaurant in the neighborhood that I haven't tried yet and stumbled across this joint on Yelp.  Stopped by at 10:45 am and they were slow, so I could take my time figuring out what i wanted to order.This is an unusual Sandwich Shop.  Unusual because you place an order by:1 - Selecting a Sandwich Bag, which is a brown paper bag that your Sandwich gets placed into.  Each bag corresponds to a specific type of Sandwich, ie Italian, Turkey, Veggie, etc.2 - On the bag, there are several options for you to check off.....toppings, dressing, sauce, cheese, extras, etc.  You mark off the items you want with a Sharpie Pen.3 - You had the bag over to the cashier, who charges you for the meal and then hands the bag to a crew of people who make the Sandwich per your specifications.4 - After a short wait, you get your customized Sandwich.I decided to order the #7 Italian Grinder (Salami, Pepperoni, Cappicola), on a White Roll topped with Provolone, Mayo, Mustard, Fat Free Italian Dressing, Red Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepperoncini, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper, Oregano.....(see pics for full options on bag).  I got a combo meal which includes Chips & a Soda for $7.75, not a bad deal!  I grabbed a bag of Jalapeno Chips and for the drink I mixed Mello Yellow with low calorie Lemonade.....that was a mistake.  It was nasty, so I dumped it and just filled it with Mello Yellow.After a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  It was nice and hot....I didn't expect it to be heated, but I guess that's how it comes.  The Sandwich is wrapped in butcher paper and tin foil and cut in half for you.  I took one bite and instantly became a Fan!  It was soo good!  The Bread was awesome and the proportion of ingredients was just right.  The Meat was full of flavor and the combination of Spices, Dressing, and Mayo/Mustard added to the Sandwich.This is a 4 Star place for me because the Value you get for the money is ridiculously good....the Sandwich by itself would have only been $5.50!  Plus there are tons of other Sandwich options ie Veggie, Bacon & Ham, Meatloaf, Spam, Caprese, and much more.  The employees were great and very helpful.  I asked them what I had to do because of their unique ordering process and they took the time to explain it to me.Side Note - While I was there, I noticed that the Duke of the Joint checked-in.....but I didn't see him anywhere.  He's either an employee who was hiding in the back or works nearby and ghost check-ins to maintain his Dukedom.....that's the 1st time I've noticed that.Will I return?  There's no doubt about it!Ok, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:I stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.After a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14" bad boy in this 'Wich!They deserve the 1 Star bump.Will I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!I have been to Which Wich several times and I always enjoy their delicious sandwiches.  They have your normal sandwiches that you find at all of the sandwich shops, as well as some fun one like the Monte Cristo that comes with grape jelly.  Yummy! I find the quality of these sandwiches are quite high and I am always delightfully full after having lunch here.  Each sandwich is made to your specifications right when you order.  If you want fun options like flavored mayo, interesting toppings, sauces, and even onion choices (though is there really a choice when crispy onions are available) this is your spot!I also like the ordering system here.  You pick a bag that corresponds to your sandwich and you mark exactly what you want on said sandwich.  This way there is no mistakes or nastiness like a yucky olive sneaking in if you didn't ask for them.  You put your name on the bag and turn it in to the cashier.  When you get your bag back, it is filled with delightfulness!The prices are great too.  You can get a full combo meal of a regular sandwich, chips, and a drink for $8.  I am always stuffed with this size, but there are bigger ones too for larger appetites.  They have an email club as well that you can sign up for.  They will email all sorts of coupons pretty regularly to save you even more $$$.  They also have a Yelp check in freebie too, so go check them out and get a great sandwich!My first time here I was just standing there staring at the wall. Even though the guys behind the counter explained everything to me, I still had to take a couple minutes just to decide what I wanted.Finally I decided to go with the original Philly, which was the #8 bag. Apparently this was their designated product development bag in which they come up with experimental sandwiches. The other bags are other things like chicken, pork, beef, etc.So you grab a designated numbered bag, check off all your choices on that bag whether its extra or nothing of something. Lastly, don't forget to put your name before you hand it off to the guys behind the counter. Pay and then wait. They put the bags up on a clothes line while they make it. Nice concept. They read what you checked off so there is no mistake. As soon as its done, they put it in your bag and call your name.Back to my Philly. It was decent. Two things though. It was kind of small with only the one size choice (7 inches) and thought it need some kind of sauce. I asked the guys if they had anything spicy to put in my sandwich. They gave me a small cup of spicy ranch sauce which I should of had them put in my sandwich in the first place.Overall, I had a good experience. I just thought the sandwich was a bit small. I think next time I will get the "The Wicked" sandwich. Based on the pic, it does look pretty wicked with all the different meats up in there.Yelp 2014 Review Challenge #38
Sweet Tomatoes=It's a newer location, but smaller and less variety.  All Sweet Tomatoes (aka "Souplantation") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.  You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.  Pssst...but here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait.  Then again, this is Vegas -- the land of excess.Everything is well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat (AYCE) salad bar that's kept just like this, fresh and clean!  While this location is just more than a year or so old, it has about 2/3 the salad bar, and about 1/2 the amount of variety of soups, breads, muffins, etc., compared to most other ST's that I've been to.Q:  Is less more?A: Nahh.One extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla and the chocolate are AWESOME!
Panda Express=Tried to pick up a quick meal on the way from the Railway and have a picnic at the park.  Sadly the honey walnut shrimp was soggy and the shrimp meat was tough and chewy especially at the tail ends.  They served us the brown fried rice (yeck!) instead of white fried rice.  Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.  Never realized how to appreciate the Las Vegas fast food until I ordered shrimp in a small town where they probably don't like seafood in general or they just can't fathom spending another buck on it.  Still love you Boulder City but fcuk this Panda yo.I like Panda Express and believe they can be as healthy as you want your food to be. Some of their dishes have 500 to 700 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative with 150 to 210 calories. I usually substitute all or half of my rice for steamed veggies. The veggies fill you up without the calories. It's up to you how healthy or not you want to be.The service at this particular location was quick. We were greeted right away with a warm smile. I was out the door in about 5 minutes. I can say that the tables and floor were clean here. Cup lids, straws, napkins and utensils were all stocked.Panda Express is another 'fast food' organization I would like to see start moving away from GMOs and into Organic ingredients.Got my lunch here (to go), beef brocolli & chicken teriyaki my all-time fave, this time it is so tender and perfect for my sensitive teeth, satisfied with the food but not really with the cashier who was nice at first but after I said "next time" on her offer to donate on a charity they've chosen, she started frowning and didn't smile at all (not knowing I'm donating regulary every quarter for the charity directly)ofcourse I won't say that.Just paid my order and went home to eat.
Moon China Restaurant=O.k. Once again, I have to say "Support your local business."For the most part, Chinese food is about the same.  Not too much difference. The names on the menu may be different, but you can usually find what you like under some other name. So I am not going to tell you that Moon China is any different..  I get what I expect. A good meal, for a fairly good price. But this place has chosen to open a business in the "no where land" of Queen Creek/San Tan Valley. The NE corner of Ironwood and Ocotillo.  Not much else is around there. They have a very good menu, good prices and their food is good.  Take out is quick. I live 5 minutes away.  By the time I place my order, put on my shoes, and drive around the corner, the food is ready.  Tonight, same thing...  Order, put on shoes, drive around corner and pick up.  Food ready. They are always very nice. Have offered me complimentary drink while waiting if food was not ready.  My favorite--- Honey Crispy Chicken... Good flavor, nice little tang/spice.  Let's not overlook the fact that they are open on Sunday.  That is huge for this area.  Most places are closed...  So it a bonus when you look up and find it is 6 p.m. and have not figured anything for dinner.  This place is always a good fall back!!!We have so few options.  Support your local business.
Aloha Kitchen=We stopped here for a quick lunch after doing some errands and shopping. The restaurants was pretty empty with two other patrons there besides us. The restaurant was clean and well kept, and the decor was much more subdued and classier than some of the other Hawaiian restaurants in town. We ordered two different combination plates with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was thin and dry, and unfortunately the highlight of the meal. I couldn't stomach the beef as it had a very distinct, off putting, odor to it. The pork was also dry and had an off putting smell. I did not want to chance a food poisoning so I just ate the chicken and rice. The macaroni salad tasted like it had been marinaded in a cleaning solution. The price is fair for the amount of food you get, but in this case I would opt for quality over quantity. I don't plan on coming back.808 FIXAcross the street from the Galleria Mall, walking distance to The Home Depot plus within minutes of Costco, Super Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom Rack. We can safely say with confidence, we have driven by Aloha Kitchen thousands of times  This afternoon is our first drop in.Here's what we ordered: Appetizers: Lumpia Shanghai, mini egg rolls filled with ground pork, chopped onions and chopped carrots, served with sweet chili sauce.... surprisingly Ono yummySoup: Momo has to try the Saimin Soup, served with chasiu pork, eggs and green onions... slurp up noodles like no tomorrow. Dab of yellow mustard pushed the  taste over the speed limit.Specials: Kalbi Combo, Kalbi (beef shortribs), Chicken katsu and Chicken teriyaki served with rice and   macaroni salad.... fav was chicken katsu,  then Kalbi and Teri chicken. FRESH rice for a wet dunk into Saimin broth. MAC salad devoured in a flash.Great prices and portions. Mahalo !
Sin City Sushi=We had quite a nice AYCE experience last night.  3 of us ravenously dined on all the tasty offerings.  Service was quirky but very attentive.  Much friendlier and more helpful than your average sushi place.  AYCE was $26 and included everything you would want and expect with a ton of specialty rolls, and dessert.We had miso soup, seaweed salad, baby tako, 7 or 8 rolls, sushi, gyoza, baked green mussels, soft shell crab, and so on.  The miso soup was very flavorful, the baby tako was a lovely, tender sesame flavored surprise, and the baked green mussels were extra caramelized and delicious.  The hamachi and garlic tuna was fresh and delightful.We were very pleased with most of the rolls.  Our food came out very slowly, and was well paced.  Normally, you are bombarded with everything your ordered within minutes and you can hardly discern what is what.  All the items we ordered came out individually, 5 - 10 minutes apart.  It gave us plenty of time to chat and enjoy each item.  I would definitely return and add sin city sushi to the list of my to go places for AYCE.We came here on a Saturday evening for AYCE 25.95/ea for dinner and ordered 1. Softshell crab, 2 orders*2. Hamachi nigiri, 2 orders3. Salmon nigiri, 2 orders4. Salmon skin hand roll, 2 orders5. Oyster shooters, 2 orders**6. Moon roll7. Salmon kama, 2 orders*8. Tuna poke, 1 order*9. Green Mussels, 3 orders10. Sin City roll11. Lychee ice cream, 1 order*12. Fried banana with vanilla ice cream, 1 order*for $66 (*limit one per person, **limit 2 per person)- Sat in right away. Bar was open around 7pm. no one there at bar. Booths full. Chef of our own!  - Great soft-shell crab. less tempura, better and more soft-shell. - Ordinary nigiri. - Excellent Salmon skin. Crispy. Best AYCE by far in Vegas. Lots of avocado. - Nice presentation for oyster shooter. Tangy. -  Their special rolls collectively have a bit too much sauce for my liking, but overall, good. Sin City roll is a definite must-try. It's the name of their restaurant for tarnation! haha. - Green mussels taste like it's from a Chinese buffet. - Must get Salmon Kama! - Poor Ice cream selection. Fried banana fail. Don't get it. Lychee ice cream had some lychee jelly pieces inside that were very satisfying. - Great price!  Friendly service.I was thoroughly surprised at the quality of sushi here. My sister and I were in the area and on a whim decided to take a gamble and try Sin City sushi. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who was also our server. She quickly seated us and took our drink order. The inside was spacious and clean. We opted for the a la carte menu (lately I have been steering away from the AYCE, even at places that do offer it). We had an order of baked green mussels which were spectacular and rank among my favorite out of all of the other sushi joints. We also shared two rolls which were both delicious and packed with fresh fish, minimal rice and were rolled tight. I believe they were the Vampire roll and Something Wrong roll. Our lunch was very reasonably priced for the quality of the fish and rolls themselves. The server was friendly and we chatted for a but as it was not terribly busy. I would recommend this as one of the sushi spots if you are on the south side of town.
Al's Beef=Allrighty then...It's time to poke the pig I like to call "Controversy"!I know it's going to sound like heresy, but I'm just going to come out with it...I like Italian Beef Sandwiches better than Philly Cheesesteaks!I'll give you a minute to clean up the spit on your screen...there you go...there's still a little to your right...no, right...good, all bright and shiny again!It's true, I really do!Not that I don't like cheesesteaks, I just like the full dip Italian Beef (made the right way...the Chicago, stand up at the counter and lean over to keep from getting the drippings on your shoes way), better!And Al's delivers on the better Italian Beef!Huge sandwiches, made in every conceivable manner (maybe too many options on the menu, but I suppose someone likes some the of the more esoteric choices), but really, there is only one way to make this sandwich for me...Full Dip, Provolone and hot Giardiniera...chock full of beefy, cheesy, spicy, peppery goodness!The kind of goodness that mere napkins can't remove...oh sure, they can soak up some of the greasy drips...smear things around on your hands and face a little bit, that sort of thing...but you're going to need a shower after lunch at Al's Beef.And that's how it should be!My buddy and I met for lunch last week and we tried the new Al's franchise for the first time. For first time franchisers (from Chicago, BTW, so they know how these things are supposed to look and taste), they do a nice job...And I should note how nice everyone is at Al's...so...noted!The service was reasonably good, and while they did forget to put Giardiniera on my sandwich, they were quick to give me a couple of cups of their house blend to fork over onto my sandwich...you just aren't getting the entire experience without the pickled peppers!My buddy and I sat and talked and the sandwiches quickly disappeared, along with a pretty decently made, tasty side of fries...I know, I know...I can't eat that way every day (or really, every week) if I want to live to a ripe old age of 149...but I'm not sure that I want to live that long if I can't get my Italian Beef sandwich from time to time!So my new strategy is to extend my life by forgoing  the cheesesteaks and replacing them with Italian Beef, now that we have a couple of decent places in town (sorry DeFalco's...you know I love you, but, for the love of Jebus, dip my sandwich...don't just give me a little plastic "sample cup" of au jus).Of course, that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak!There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit. Like Al's Beef. Those words together conjure up fantastical images of hunky blue collared workers. You know the ones; they work hard and play harder, each one starving, looking to get his fill of Al's thick juicy Italian Beef sandwiches.In 1938, Al's Beef opened as a food stand in Chicago's Little Italy. The idea for the Italian Beef sandwich came during the Depression when meat was scarce. So, in order to help stretch the meat to feed more people, the roasted beef was shaved extremely thin, then made into sandwiches.Over the years, Al's flourished, earning accolades such as Best Sandwich in America from Esquire, Playboy and others. They were even featured earlier this year on one of my favorite TV shows, Man vs. Food, in an episode titled "Da Italian Stance."In Chicago, there's an art to eating an Al's Italian Beef sandwich. In the "Italian Stance," the diner's knees are slightly bent, posterior slightly up and out and elbows on the counter. This technique helps to avoid getting Al's gravy on your shoes. It's not the traditional gravy you might think of putting on mashed potatoes, but more like the pan drippings from the roasted beef they dunk the entire sandwich in, bread and all.Unfortunately, all of this amazing history and media attention doesn't seem to matter to the new franchised location in North Scottsdale. The concept here is fast casual, order from the counter, then getting your number called a few minutes later to pick up your food.The interior was spotlessly clean, the staff relatively friendly and the concept easy, what's not to like? Unfortunately, the food.I started with the Big Al ($7.45), the 8-inch version of their Italian Beef sandwiches. I want to eat it like Chicagoans do, so I ordered the sandwich dipped, then covered with hot giardiniera, a relish of pickled peppers and vegetables. Taking my position, with my butt in the air and my elbows on the counter top, I took the first bite. First I was amazed just how juicy the sandwich was. Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless.I was so disappointed that after a few bites I decided to try a Chicago Dog ($3.10). But the hot dog was so small and shriveled I wasn't sure you could call it a hot dog; more like a hot mess.There were a few highlights, including the delicious Bleu Cheese Fries ($4.50), perfectly cooked French fries covered with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing. Another treat was the Tamale Boat ($5.80), two Chicago-style tamales covered with chili, cheddar cheese and onions.When one of the employees decided that it was time for Headbangers Ball, playing thrash metal over the restaurant's loudspeakers, I took it as my cue to leave.Maybe this place should be renamed Al's French Fried Tamale Mosh Pit? Rock on man, rock on.
Lafitte's=Bonjour Mes Amis Dit mon la verite'! 5 stars?!? Ca c'est bon Lafitte's seems to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area, and still quite affordable, considering what you get for your money. (and this from a bonifide cheapskate) It was also nearly empty for Sunday dinner, but I'm sure that is something that varies greatly seasonally. Lafitte's is hidden inside of the Embassy Fountain Suites Hotel s.e. corner of I-17 and Greenway Rd, and is a little cajun/creole restaurant that really is a Lagniappe! The menu was quite large and much more varied than I thought it would be. (not all seafood) Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. Gumbo, Jambalaya, soup, Po'Boy and a bunch of other sandwiches, salads, pizza, entrees from pasta and veggies to fillet, ribs, prime rib, and more scrimps than you, Capt. Dan (and Bubba, en spirit) could ever get from a night out on the Jenny in the bayou. The baby back ribs had both a dry rub and a sauce glazed on while grilling ~sweet, spicy (could've been a tad hotter), tender and meaty and moist. The prime rib came in a slab worthy of Fred Flintstones dinner plate. The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room. The beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness. Let us return to that jambalaya. WHEW BOYEE, it was a delicious dark gravy stew over rice that easily could be a satisfying meal on its own! C'est magnifique, I gau-RUN-tee! There were two different scrimps dishes at the table as well, which both must have been really good, because neither the saucy one or the pasta-ey one got shared with anyone! There is a tasty although probably over-hyped ice cream dish on the desert menu that seems like some sort of cake but is really just a big slab of Neapolitan ice cream with a tiny bit of meringue on the outside. Service was superb! Our server was lively, attentive, funny, and really nice. She was knowledgeable about the dishes, offered recommendations when asked (even a bit of a Miracle on 34th Street-ish: "I'd get one of the other sides, not because the sweet potato fries are bad, they're just average, and so many of the other sides you'd be missing are so good"), and was also familiar with the details (and made sure we were, too) of the restaurant.com coupon. The restaurant.com coupon was what really made this a smokin' deal, and I heard from a coworker that they have a BOGO in the Entertainment book ,too. Even without the deals, the menu is really not very expensive considering the quality and portion size that you get at Lafitte's. 4 out of 5 dinner entrees were all $16, with many choices on either side of that average. Lunch sammies complete with side of fries or ? are around $8-9. The ice cream conglomeration fed all 5 of us for $8. Not bad 'tall, mon cheri. Laisser les bons temps rouler !How to make an impression: When picking up your date for the evening (2nd date) and she asks where you are going, tell her you decided to check out a local hotel...... with her daughter and her family in the room.  I got some strange looks and her  SIL made a point of stating we most likely would not be back in time to watch a movie.Lafitte's is most definitely a hotel restaurant.  In place are the omelet station and self serve stations for breakfast/brunch.Although we thought we had arrived early for dinner (6PM) the place was slammed with two large dining parties and a large gathering in the lounge area and the banquet room full too.  The dining room/lounge area appeared to have only one waitress and she was frazzled but holding up pretty well.  She mentioned this was A) abnormal and B) the second night in a row like this.  When my dining partner was in the restroom another diner mentioned her and her husband had come for a quiet dinner as this place was always deserted.  When she did get to us to take our drink order she advised us to order everything before 2 large parties got their dinner order in or it would be a while.  Turned out it was a while anyway, our total dinner stay was right at 2 hours.I had printed out a menu and on the way over we discussed what we might get and it turns out the actual menu is just enough different we changed our minds.  We ended up with an appetizer of 2 crab cakes and she got a shrimp Po'boy which came with fries and I got the chicken Florentine which came with a salad, garlic mashed potatoes and some sauteed vegetables.  We both decided the crab cakes had a nice ratio of crab to filler but we were not used to the seasonings.  Why a salad of mixed greens needs to have some bitter stuff in itI don't know but this was another one I have come across that did.  The blue cheese dressing was heavy on vinegar.  Neither of us had had a shrimp Po'boy before and we both decided we liked it.  We also both liked the chicken and I liked the mashed potatoes and vegetables although there was nothing spectacular about them.  The house Merlot I had made Franzia look like a $40 a bottle wine.Of note, although I think it was because they were slammed.  My salad came out before the appetizer and the crab cakes, although we made it well known we were sharing, did not come with a plate to share with.As we were getting up to leave the manager caught up with us and apologized for the less than stellar service.  That was nice of her but we really didn't  notice it that much because we were in a mood to sit and chat anyway. At no time did we feel rushed.   We both decided it would be a place worth returning to.It's probably more a 3.5 but the evening was a pleasant one so I don't mind rounding up.Ryan C told me they make a real burger here. Well I had to se for myself. The burger is a hand Pattied Sirloin burger cooked to order over a flame...yep a flame...chared beef, like a burger is supposed to be. It was perfect, the price was right, the building is great, I loved it. I cannot wait to try more food. FYI.. it is a chain ohhhhh.
Buffet of Buffets=24 hours of all you can eat meals for $50?   GREAT!  So so so not.Even the most high end hotels participating in this deal serve essentially the same foods with a few differences. (I went to Imperial Palace, Harrahs, and Paris)This is also an example of where quality suffers due to quantity.  I felt forced to eat meal after meal of cafeteria food. After the new-ness of crab legs, dessert bars, and infinite selection wore off, eating at buffet of buffets seemed more like an obligation than a pleasure.By the end I was really really sad I had to eat at one of these buffets...again... But if you are looking for volume of sustenance at a low cost, this is the deal for you!  As someone who would rather have less, more high quality food, this made me sorta sad...Yes, we hit all 7 buffets within a 24-hour period!  We can't say we ate full meals at each, and we can't say we really enjoyed the last few buffets.  But we did it, and we brag about it on a regular basis.First, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.#1 - Caesar'sWe started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.#2 - Harrah'sWe were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.#3 - Imperial PalaceIt's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.#4 - FlamingoI did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.#5 - ParisWe had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.#6 - RioWe didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....# 7 - Planet HollywoodIn retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.A final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.200th review!  And the Buffet of Buffets (all 7 buffets!) was a once in a lifetime experience worth the honor of being number 200.  Meaning I won't do it again but it was a lot of fun!Here is a list the buffets in order of my preference with links to my separate reviews:Flamingo - Paradise Garden Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:URS8MJEkdC8KsB_jVsjo3gHarrah's - Flavors Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:_OUWBMRElcOZecknmMLJngRio - Carnival World Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:KDdi-yKhtMJCZ3g4H5yS6APlanet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:breS3dflMWORJXruiwyi5wParis - Le Village Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:KGu5BCvuu9jrx7O0ciO68QCaesars Palace - Lago Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:BeCacBAleUgaGAtZLcxD1gImperial Palace - Emperor's Buffet http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t4rFdqWGvZqSxbb6ciwgKw If you are thinking about taking on this feat, you may need alcohol.  Do it on the weekend and check to see which buffets include champagne and bloody marys with brunch.  Lago is your best bet early in the morning and some of the other buffets after 10:30am.  I think each buffet (except for IP) sells line passes at the VIP lines.  If the lines get long, buy the passes so you don't go crazy.  See the pics or the event link for Ken M.'s great schedule.http://www.yelp.com/events/las-vegas-uye-buffet-of-vegas-buffets-bobIt's a good time with a bunch of friends and definitely an experience.When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:Breakfast9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0wLunch12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_wDinner5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffethttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4AI had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.Return Factor - 80%Once upon a time there were 3 bunnies... very hungry bunnies. Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uAI write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   * SATURDAY *Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crème brûlée, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! * SUNDAY *Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  *****Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us    $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) + $48 (1 extra BofB pass)----------   $261  Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!Mom visits me from Korea every year and as usual, we went to Vegas.  I don't know why we decided to do this but we did.  I kept questioning our decision...really? Buffet for the next 24 hours?  Holy moly!  Yes, you heard me right; unlimited buffet for 24 hours for $44.99 for Total Rewards members (just go sign up at the total rewards booth) and $49.99 for non-members.   Ugh.Given my reservations, this was not a bad idea.  It's definitely worth the money given that one buffet meal would have cost us about $18-$30.  So how many times could we squeeze in buffet trips in the given time without wanting to puke?  I'd say about 4 times MAX.-Meal 1: Spice Market Buffet @PH.  This was where we started.  We had dinner here.  Overall, this was my favorite buffet of the trip.  They have different themed sections marked clearly with bold white lettering...ie. Mexican, Seafood, Mid-Easter, dessert, etc.  I gorged myself on pre-halved crab legs and pre-peeled shrimp cocktail.  My husband loved the cotton candy and the crème brulee was yummy too.  4 stars-Meal 2 : Spice Market Buffet.  Since we were staying at PH we decided to come here for a quick breakfast before we set out for the day.  Breakfast was simple and standard.  The eggs were good and the OJ refreshing...and the coffee saved my life.-Meal 3 : Le Village Buffet @ Paris.  The line was short here but for some reason we had to wait for 45 minutes!  The food was French-ish and quite mediocre.  I must say that I do like the ambiance.  It succeeds in taking me away to some sort of quaint rustic town.  3 stars-Meal 4 : Lago Buffet @ Caesars Palace.  Once again, the line was ridiculously slow.  We had tickets to the Cirque Du Soleil LOVE show and we almost had to skip dinner after waiting in line for an hour!  Fortunately, we spoke to one of the managers and she let us slide up front.  Thank you! Thank you!  Lago had the smallest selection of them all.  It was teeny tiny with minimum seating!  The saving factor of this place is the quality of the food.  It was the best of the three I visited, however limited.  The prime rib was restaurant quality and delicious.  I would come back just for that.  3 starsI enjoyed my Buffet of Buffets experience.  I don't think I'll do it again but it was definitely worth its while.  Besides, we had a good time hopping from buffet to buffet as if we were on a little mission.   But please factor in the lines when you're visiting these buffets.  They are no joke.When Sarah A told me about this $44.99 for as much of 7 buffets as you want within a 24 hour period, I was all in!The AYCE plan includes:Lago Buffet at Caesar's PalaceParadise Garden Buffet at FlamingoFlavors Buffet at Harrah'sVillage Seafood Buffet at RioLe Village Buffet at ParisEmperor's Buffet at Imperial PalaceSpice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodCarnival World Buffet at RioBetween me, David G, Sarah A and Minh D, we went through a LOT of food on this pass!We started at the Rio hotel, at the Carnival World Buffet (where we bought our passes) and even though we only made it to one more - the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood - I still felt like it was a good deal.My only beef about this plan is that the buffets all close at 10pm, which is kinda early for the hours that most people keep when they're in the town that never sleeps.Still, that likely won't stop me from doing this the next time I come back!When i found out Lucy Y, David G, Minh D and i were all going to Vegas, i just knew we had to do that Buffet Of Buffets challange!! With some quick research i found out that you can save a little bit of money. All you have to do is sign up for a Total Rewards card available at any Harrah's casino. Without the card your paying $ 49.99 with the Total Rewards card its $44.99 so your saving $5.00 which can come in handy later on for a drink or something!! Another tip since it is within a 24 hour period, i suggest starting as late as possible because it Vegas and no one is up at the crack of dawn, heck we were lucky to stumple into the second buffet at around 2:45pm!! Come hungry is all i can say, other wise this isnt the place for you to be if a one time trip fills you up!! The buffets are not open 24hours most of them close between 9:00pm and 10:00pm.Buffet of Buffets, I OWN YOU! 7 buffets in 24 hours, seriously...is that all you've got? Please. You are going to have to up your game BoB, because you have been PWND by this glutton!Here is the damage: Day one: Purchased BoB pass at 4:35pm.Buffet 1 - Spice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodBuffet 2 - Le Village Buffet at ParisBuffet 3 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoDay two: Began at 9amBuffet 4 - Flavors Buffet at Harrah'sBuffet 5 - Emperor's Buffet at Imperial PalaceBuffet 6 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoBuffet 7 - Lago Buffet at Caesar's PalaceBuffet 8 - Flavors Buffet at Harrah'sBuffet 9 - Paradise Garden Buffet at FlamingoBuffet 10 - Arrived at the Carnival World Buffet at Rio at 4:15pm.Final count: 10 buffets in 24 hoursComments:Favorite buffet - Flavors buffet at Harrah's, followed closely by Spice Market at PH and Carnival at Rio.Least favorite buffet - Emperor's buffet at IP, and Lago at Caesars.Best service - Flavors at Harrah's followed closely by Paradise Garden buffet at FlamingoWorst service - Le Village Buffet at ParisBest prime rib - Carnival at RioBest crab legs - Spice Market Buffet at Planet HollywoodHey BoB, it was fun...but let me know when you come up with something a little more challenging.OK real talk. This is the best deal on the muthaf#%n strip!!! at only 50 bucks? ain't nothin wrong with that!! The deal already pays for itself after 2 visits! U just gotta eat at any of the participating buffets before your 24 hours is up! Lago Buffet (Caesars)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmLe Village Buffet (Paris)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmSpice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmFlavors Buffet (Harrah's)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmParadise Garden Buffet (Flamingo)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmCarnival World Buffet (The Rio)  7:00 am - 10:00 pmVillage Seafood Buffet (The Rio) ** 4:00pm - 10:00pmEmperor's Buffet (Imperial Place) - This buffet sucked!!.... just my opinion.. :p7 great buffets, one stylish wrist band equals one hell of a food coma!! choose wisely... **- "Seafood Village buffet" an additional charge $15 to eat there.. just saying..What a deal!  24 hours of buffets for only $45 (with Total Rewards membership, which is free).How it works: - Sign up for Total Rewards online- Go to any of the Total Rewards casinos (we went to Planet Hollywood) to their Total Rewards desk, and pick up your member card- Go to your first buffet when you're ready to start your 24 hours and pay at the cashier.  (NOTE: you cannot buy this buffet pass online!  only at the cashier at your first buffet!  This is when your 24 hours officially start!)- Use your total rewards card as your admission ticket to the buffets for the remainder of your 24 hours.It's such a good deal, you already get your money's worth after 2 buffets.  In order to maximize the deal, try to do 2 dinners, a breakfast, and a lunch.  That's what my fiance and I did.  Meal 1: Started out with a late dinner at Spice Market at PH.  The food is okay... not as great as it used to be back when PH was The Aladdin.  Food here is better than the dessert.  Meal 2: Early breakfast at 7:30am at Paris.  I've always heard this is the best breakfast buffet so there was no question about where we wanted to have breakfast.  Meal 3: Late lunch at Harrah's.  We got to enjoy both their lunch food and dinner food cuz we came so late (we were still super full from breakfast and had to eat lunch at 3pm).  This was my first time at Harrah's buffet and it was actually our favorite of all the buffets we ate at on this buffet pass!Meal 4: Dinner at Caesar's Palace.  We weren't hungry, but just went for the sake of going to a 4th buffet.  Plus we heard Caesar's had the best dessert... and that they did!  Their desserts are much more upscale in terms of presentation.  And they come in little cute serving sizes so you can definitely sample more desserts in one sitting!  Food was okay, but we didn't grab a lot of food since we were already full.Some extra tips: your 24 hours starts and ends when you officially swipe your card at the cashier.  So take into account of waiting lines!  If you have a line pass or VIP member status, then kudos to you.  But if you have to wait in line like everyone else, then plan accordingly.HOLY CRAP!This is such an amazing deal. It pays for itself in 1 and 1/2 visits!Once you got the pass, you have 24 hours to eat the Hotels in the chain, which include: Rio, Harrah's, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and Caesars Palace, and maybe others I can't recall. If you sign up for the free Total Rewards players card you can get the pass. This is also great bc you put your card in every time you play the slots and get points. Also, every time you book with these hotels you accumulate points..Total for each buffet is about $30 including tips and all the other fees. The BoB pass is $45 - I think it's a pretty sweet deal! The best time to get the pass is about noon. Since you have 24 hrs to go where you please, you'll be able to eat lunch, dinner, breakfast the next day and lunch!Also, you can change buffets... for example, if you go to Flamingo for lunch and don't like it, you have time to go to any other buffets during the lunch hours to find what you like. We did that for dinner once, we liked different things at different buffets so we went buffet hopping!I recommend the Rio World Buffet... it's amazing! Anything you can think of ... is there!Also, the crab legs at Imperial Palace is pretty good since it's a slower buffet, the wait for fresh crab legs is shorter.Harrah's is also very decent for brunch!Flamingo has a chocolate fountain!!I also hear that Caesar's Palace is amazing, but I personally had never eaten there.Enjoy!$50 for 24 access to 7 buffets (use your Total Rewards Card to save $5 which you can get from any of the participating Hotels AND it comes with $5 in slot play!)1. Spice Market at Planet HollywoodMy favorite because of the location, setting, food and convenience. Super cute dessert selection like cotton candy on a stick! Solid prime-rib and surprisingly nommy middle-eastern food. We ate here twice. 2. Carnival World Buffet at RioThe food here is probably the best of the seven buffets in terms of selection and quality (especially the Asian station) but gosh! So annoying to get to Rio on foot from the strip, even with the free shuttle from Harrah's to Rio. 3. Le Village Buffet at ParisI don't know why this buffet is rated so high, but it was my least favorite by far. The prime rib was tasteless and chewy, the grilled asparagus were like burnt splintery chopsticks, and the marinated mushrooms were SO SALTY that my tongue just about withered up after the first bite.  Everything else was average.  But I do have to say that the décor is the most charming, from the little street lamps and candlelit windows right down to the costumed waitresses. Good for dessert and breakfast but not for anything substantial. We didn't bother with the other four, because our stomachs are mortal, and we heard that they weren't that good anyways.Tips for surviving the onslaught of buffets.-yes dear, that skinny belt looks great with your fitted top and secondskin jeans but change into the moo-moo tucked in the back of your closet. You're welcome.-if you are secretly weight-conscious, drink lots of water and start with veggies and soup. You will think that you can just pop in and pick up a light snack but you will always end up eating a large meal and will complain about how much you ate for the next many many hours. Just accept it.-if you are with the above person, bring headphones.-if you want to eat as much as you humanly can at every buffet, ease up on the protein; you will be lugging a 20-pound frankenmeat in your tummy for the next 2 days and will be severely constipated -if you wanna hit all 7 buffets, prepare to make it an all-day event and get a bus pass to haul you from hotel to hotel.Happy eating!All throughout college, I have frequented The Strip countless times, and every time I have been tempted by the Buffet of Buffets (B.o.B.) billboard ads. Problem is, when you're with a huge group, everyone's sole mission is to hit up as many bars and club, and get as schwastey as f***... there's simply no time to spare on buffets.So, it was Chris K.'s 21st last March, and we unintentionally made our Vegas trip a romantic getaway (surprisingly, Vegas is very suitable for couples... who would have thought?) with very few plans. We're both fatties, so the B.o.B. seemed like the obvious choice to spend our weekend. Plus, you save a lot of money, because for $55 / person (I am not a Total Rewards member, and this amount includes tax) you can pack in 4 meals and "snack" buffet trips.(1) The start of our B.o.B. adventure was at the Carnival World Buffet in Rio for dinner. The only one off the strip, and this particular buffet is loaded with childhood memories (and a huge food selection)... this was the one buffet we always had to hit on our fambam Vegas trips. As a child, I didn't know any better,  but the food tastes pretty crappy now.(2) The next day, we dined on The Strip. Since we stayed at Vdara, it only made sense to have breakfast across the street at The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood... aptly named, because all the dishes were very well seasoned. (3) Immediately after, we hauled our filled tummies to le Village Buffet at Paris for lunch. Luckily, I didn't realize Champagne Brunch was being served, so the hour-long line gave us time to finish digesting our breakfast. The Champagne Brunch (which normally costs $27) alone justified the price of the pass... 2 brunches and we've eaten our money's worth! and you can't skip out on the Crepe bar... that was Chris K.'s favorite part of B.o.B. I know I drank a good amount of champagne, but my flute stayed full the entire course of our meal. Lesson learned at le Village: DON'T CHUG THE CHAMPAGNE!! It is a choking hazard and is a mistake not to be repeated! (4) Our final buffet was Cafe Lago at Caesar's Palace. Although it was impossible to find (there were no signs directing us to the entrance) and the line to get in didn't move (we missed our 24 hour mark by 10 minutes... thankfully we were still allowed in), the food here tasted the best. All the other buffets offered prime rib, but Cafe Lago additionally gave us the option of herb-crusted flank steak (super savory!!). I went back 3 rounds for the flank steak, and even had it as my dessert. Compared to the other participating buffets, this cafe has classier-looking, artistic food displays and seemed more clean, but the selection of food items is less extensive.I am so glad to finally check off B.o.B. on my Vegas To-Do list. Worth every penny! I would do it again in a heartbeat, but need time to mentally prepare my tummy for another 24 hour food marathon...and next time, I'm hitting all 6 buffets :)How many more reviews do you need to believe that this deal is SO WORTH IT?? At first it sounded a little too good to be true but wow, superb deal considering most Vegas buffets are already $20+. I got to squeeze in 4.5 meals...two lunches, one brunch, and two dinners. I didn't stuff myself either which I tend to do regularly to make it worth it, but with this pass I'm able to eat comfortably knowing I can always come back to eat more haha.$50 (that's with taxes) and unlimited access to 7 different buffets.-Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood-Le Village Buffet @ Paris-Paradise Garden Buffet @ Flamingo-Carnival World Buffet @ Rio-Flavors @ Harrah's-Village Seafood Buffet @ Rio (additional $15)-Emperor's Buffet @ Imperial PalaceSmall downside is you still have to get in line with all the regular buffet purchasers. Wish there was a separate line for the 24hr buffeters but that's just asking too much haha :pThis is definitely worth it folks! Even if you just eat 2 meals, it's still the cheapest (quality) ticket in Vegas. Especially if you do what all the hard core people do (I researched the buffets...ahem...)  and start your 24 hours later in the dinner hour on the first day so that you can get TWO dinners during the 24 hours...not to mention a possible breakfast and lunch!I was working a big corporate convention and STILL mentioned to get my 2 dinners in. So it was totally worth it. Most (if not all) of the buffets are open til 11pm, so that helps. I had to be at work before the 7am opening for breakfast (I KNOW!)---so I missed out on that. But my good friend who had also bought the buffet ticket with me was a champ and brought a piece of the buffet (a bear claw) to me! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  #lifeofcrimeWe went to dinner the firs night at Spice Market in Planet Hollywood.  It was solid. Decent selection, and at 830pm on a Monday night we didn't have to wait long. I ate mostly stuff from the Middle Eastern station. Lamb kabobs, chicken curry and rice with lentils. YUM!Tried a bite of the Key Lime cupcake before we left but it wasn't worth finishing. The cupcakes were plain with a bit of flavored stuff in the middle, with cheapy sugared whipped cream icing.  Also too dense, texture wise. Not in a 'thick, I'm filled with butter' kinda way, but in a 'I was overcooked in the oven or don't have enough baking soda/powder' kinda way. But then, you MUST remember, my sister is a baker and I am a cupcake snob. So, yeah.Since we were staying at Bally's, we stopped to get the made to order dessert crepes at the Le Village buffet in Paris on the way home. 2 buffets in the same night. That's what you do with a 24 hour buffet pass people. Come on!The crepes were AMAZING. Totally great life choice. And then tonight, we went to Paris for the dinner buffet, since it's swankier than the Spice Market buffet (which we discovered the night before when we got the dessert crepes) . I got the banana one with carmel sauce instead of chocolate. YUM!For dinner I had the prime rib with the mushroom sauce (YES!), the mac n cheese with truffle sauce and mushrooms or something (not to be confused with the very bland shells with brie and bacon - don't waste your time here), scalloped potatoes and french green beans with almonds. Delicious!Didn't even bother with the other buffets cause they were farther away and the reviews weren't as good. But with the Spice Market and Le Village being right next to each other, you really don't NEED any other options. Be happy. Eat good food in Vegas that doesn't make you poor.TOTAL DIET KILLER!But hey, you're in VEGAS!My Buffet of Buffet List of...... Best to Worst:1. Bacchanal Buffet - Caesar's Palace2. Spice Market Buffet - Planet Hollywood (Formally Aladdin)3. Le Village Buffet - Paris4. World Buffet - Rio4. Flavors Buffet - Harrah's5. Emperors Buffet - Imperial PalaceBest food deal in Vegas, HANDS DOWN. $12 for a footlong at Subway? COME ON. Be smart.Buffet of Buffet Pass (good for 6 all-you-can-eat-buffets for 24 hours: some of which include all-you-can-drink champagne, mimosas, etc.) - $45 (with Total Rewards card which is completely free)Additional Charge for Upscale Buffets - $15 each per visit ($15 once does not mean that you can come back later for a second meal and not pay again)=~$60 for great food of all varieties and enough alcohol to get a nice buzz (if you have good service) for the cost of a tip... (UM, have you seen the cost of alcohol in Vegas???). AKA unlimited food and drinks for ~$15 each meal? YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!Get your pass at a dinner buffet (between 7pm-9pm) so you can have dinner, breakfast, lunch, and another dinner.Yes, the lines will be long. Yes, they are unavoidable since your stomach will need some time to digest between stuffings and you WILL end up having to eat during some meal rush. No, it is not worth paying extra money to "skip" the line... a Total Rewards woman even admitted to that. But YES, you will find at least one thing you want seconds of at most buffets and you WILL have the option of eating as much or as little as you desire with free reign for 24 hours.YES, you should go to Bacchanal (best quality) and Le Village (best flavor).NO, you should not go to Spice Market unless you have drunken taste buds. Even then... it's hard to black out biting into a rock from the couscous or miss the fact that there's no cheese in your cheese quesadilla.Use Yelp, make good choices, don't hesitate to repeat buffets. What's good is good and this deal is GREAT.I have done this deal twice and I'd like to say that it's worth it. For $50 you get to eat as many meals as you can fit in within 24 hours. Most people would probably be able to get 2-3 meals within those 24 hours. Without it, a buffet would cost anywhere from $30-$60. I know that some of the other yelp reviewers say that you have to eat fast and time it right but I think that as long as you get two meals in, you've received your money's worth.In a way, it's a lot like getting a season pass at an amusement park. Even if you go three times in that whole year, you've spent less than you would if you had bought three individual tickets so it's well worth it.I've only had a chance to go to the Rio and Paris buffets and I am absolutely satisfied. The Rio one is perhaps the bigger of the two and it has a variety of foods including pho and wonton soup for my asian food craves.I have to say I was a little disappointed by the Paris buffet. It had a lot less food than I had expected but if you really love crepes and dessert, this is where to go. Also, the service is great and the people are friendly.As for tips,I recommend getting the wristband as late as you can before closing so that you can have a more flexible schedule for dinner the next day. Also, it is never too late. Your wristband lasts until the minute it reaches 24 hours. I remember the last time that I went, my wristband was supposed to expire at 7 pm. My boyfriend and I rushed to the Paris buffet only to find a super long line. It was 6:59 but I refused to give up so I went to the customs desk to the left of the line and told the friendly lady at the desk that my wristband is about to expire but I'd like to squeeze in one last meal. She smiled and gave me a receipt for two at the buffet and told me to show the cashier at the line my receipt and proceed to the line to be seated.I didn't want to wait in the same line for the cashier where people were waiting to pay for their meal so I skipped to the front and told the girl showing people to seats that I already had my receipt and asked if she could seat me. She asked if everyone in my party already paid and I said yes so she took my boyfriend and me right in.So we basically saved 45 minutes of standing in line and managed to squeeze in a meal with one minute to spare.Also, if you happen to walk past a buffet while you're going about your day on the strip, and the buffet has no line going in, feel free to stop by and grab a gelato or a cheesecake. Because you can. So there.I have yet to try the other buffets on the list but I heard that the Planet Hollywood one is superb. Either way, the great thing about buffets is that there will most likely be food that you like. Remember, a buffet is not for eating as much as you can; it's to give you a variety of foods to choose from. Don't like the food you chose? pick another! wish you had more? go get some more!Oh, and the wristbands are waterproof in case you were wondering so don't go showering with your arm hanging outside your tub in the hotel.In 24 hours...You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)Did I get enough to eat?  YesDid I get my money's worth?  You bet I didWas the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it wasWould I do this again?  Hell no!We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.Cost savings analysis!Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96-------------------------------------------------------------------------------SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 OR$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)I finally manned up and attempted the Buffet of Buffets.  Well, not entirely though.  I had a little bit of misunderstanding on how the pricing worked with the higher end buffets that are offered as an upgrade (Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and Village Seafood Buffet at Rio).So here's how it goes for Total Rewards members like me:  for $47.99 you get 24 hour access to The Carnival World Buffet at Rio, Le Village Buffet at Paris, Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo, Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, and The Emperor's Buffet at The Quad Resort (formerly Imperial Palace).  Here's the part that I misunderstood, you also get access to Bacchanal Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet for an upgrade of $15 PER VISIT.  The PER VISIT part is the where I got things mixed up as I thought it was a one time upgrade fee only.  With that in mind, and the fact that I had only intended to use the BoB strictly for Bacchanal since it was new and I wanted to try it for 24 hours, I ended up spending more than I expected out of this.  But that's completely my fault for not reading the fine print. I'll get into details with how my sessions at Bacchanal went in a separate review.  However after going though two buffet meals, I remembered why I stopped doing buffets as I realized that I can't stuff myself silly like I did during my college years.  So even though I still had time for breakfast the next morning, I didn't have the appetite for it and just omitted it.  I was in major food exhaustion.  LOLFor what it's worth, I still think the Buffet of Buffets is a great deal if you know how to plan ahead:  knowing breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, knowing locations of buffets, and also going with the idea that since you've got 24 hour access there is no need to stuff yourself silly.  Good planning of all those factors can help you get the most out of your 24 hour pass.Oh the ridiculousness that is the Buffet of Buffets! 24 hours of unlimited access to worship at numerous temples of gluttony! Some of the Buffets are just okay, some are down right gross. We figured that by doing this deal, that it would save us money. We could could try numerous restaurants, eat massive quantities of food and come and go as we please.What I will say is you WILL get tired of buffet food after 24 hours. By the forth meal I couldn't look at another prime rib carving station without crying on the inside. But it did save us a bit of money on the strip (thus allowing us to deposit it back on the craps tables). But it's definitely fun in a ridiculous sort of way.  Here's my breakdown of buffets, in my humble opinion. The buffet at Harrah's is gross, skip it. The Paris buffet is delicious (we ate here twice), B line it to the crepes line when you get there! The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood is middle of the road.In order to save some funds we got the wristband which allows you to eat to your hearts content as much as your stomach can hold within 24 hours at the participating buffets. Our group stuffed in three buffets and could have done a fourth but we were away from the Strip on the first evening and no one wanted to drive back, so we waited until our first am to sign up. I fully recommend staying at one of the properties that offers the buffet as it will be difficult to get up and make it on time to breakfast or before your time runs out, as my friends found out last time they were in Vegas. You most definitely need to watch out for additional charges with the premium buffets as we found out unfortunately with Bacchanal. However used to it's fullest this little wristband can save you quite a bit of change which you can piss down a hole on the casino floor. Don't forget to sign up for the member rewards card as it can knock off $10, or so we were told, from your total bill.With Total Reward card. $5 off. So it is $49.99 per person...1. Started from Bacchanal Buffet Dinner: $25 extra upgrade per lunch. per dinner. Will be $15/person/breakfast per breakfast.Cold and hot Crab legs are great. Mochi and gelato are really good. Oyster shooter is good. Sushi and Chinese are not that great. Very average.The liquid sweet butter nearby the cold crab legs areas is sooooo delicious. Beautiful restaurant and fancy.We went there at 8:35 PM and waited about 15 to buy the ticket, and 5 more min to get to the seat.2. Paris: BreakfastAbove average. Many eggs choices, including egg white. Pastries such as danish and croissant are available. Crepe has 7 choices3. Spice Market: Late lunchLess crowd at 3 PM. Cup cakes is their strong item. Sooooo many choice and colorful. They are having the summer seafood festival that finally brought back the quality of Spice Market. There are crab legs, shrimps, shrimp cocktails, etc.. 4. Rio Seafood: $10 extra to upgrade.Went there around 8 PM. Short line. For real seafood lovers, here is the place. Crab legs, lobsters, shrimps, prawns, oysters, sashimi, etc.. Fresh and real. Yes, they do have beef and chicken for people who don't eat that much seafood. Several choices with gelato. The waitress and waiters are very nice and help us to clean up the tables.If you have no interest in dining at a regular restaurant, you're crazy hungry, and you don't mind eating dinner earlier the second day, this is really the biggest no-brainer in Vegas.Buy the buffet pass fairly late for your first night's dinner. Gorge yourself on the wonderful options. Have another buffet at breakfast. Have another at lunch. And eat a second dinner all on the same pass (as long you you do it before your 24 hours is up).You have to pay extra to do Caesar's Bacchanal, but it's still worth the upcharge. My recommendation would be Le Village at Paris as your breakfast option. It excels in the morning and is nothing special at other times. If you love seafood, the Rio's seafood buffet is a good choice for your other dinner. The lunch options are all pretty much the same. Bacchanal is not worth the upcharge for lunch when you consider that it will be your 3rd of 4 meals in a 24 hour period. You're just not going to get your money's worth there. So do a boring lunch one like Spice Market at PH.All in all, there are few better options to eat 14,000 calories in 24 hours.Best deal in Vegas if you love to eat! Nearly $60 with no rewards card but if you do it's $5 off. There are lots to choose from and 2 require you to pay an extra fee for those.I tried out the buffet in Paris, Harrahs, The Quad, Planet Hollywood and Flamingo. Paris is perfect for breakfast. Get there before 9 or else it's packed!Planet Hollywoods was very good as well. Lots of choices from Middle Eastern to Asian to Mexican.Harrahs was pretty good too. They seemed to have the best desserts in myopinion. Flamingo was so-so. Food was nothing special with the exception of the chocolate fountain. I didn't even try the food at The Quad.I didn't think it was open at the time since there were barely any people in it! Food just looks bad!!Yes! Yes! Yes!Definitely a great deal as far as food goes in Las Vegas.  This deal is offered by the Caesars Entertainment properties, which includes: Caesar's Palace, Flamingo, Quad, Paris, Harrahs, Rio (both buffets), and Planet Hollywood.We ended up doing this more or less by accident, but I would HIGHLY recommend this approach:Get the "weekday" price by buying the deal on Friday just before the price goes up on Friday at 11:00am.  The week day price is $49.95 per person.  On Friday at 11:00am, it goes up to $64.95 per person.  We purchased ours at 10:35am on Friday.We ended up having breakfast at Quad - big big big mistake.  That was GROSSLunch at Paris Le Village Buffet - loved it.  Food was delicious, very flavorful, setting is cute.Late dinner at Harrahs - mehBrunch with bottomless Mimosas at Paris again on Saturday after 10:00am - fantastic!!The brunch at Paris starts at 10:00am on Saturday, so with our weekday-priced buffet, we still got the Saturday morning brunch - which by itself would have been $25/person.  We happened to time it so we got there just after 10:00am, but before our buffet deal expired at 10:35am :)Unfortunately, we did not make it to the Rio buffet, which I've heard good things about.The Caesar's buffet, Bacchanal, would have been $20 extra per person and the line was long, so we decided against it.I would definitely do this again...but skip The Quad and Harrahs.Gluttony at it's best!!This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!3.5 stars rounded down!When they first introduced this program a couple years ago, it was a GREAT deal. $49 all you can eat for 24 hours right on the Strip is a STEAL.  For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.However, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.Besides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.The reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.I don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.However, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  So it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!#GLUTTONY!If you're in LV, and you feel like a fat ass, and you want to save some cash, and you don't mind buffets, and you have no dining plans, then the buffet of buffets is for you. The price went up to $49.99 so now you really have to pig out (it used to be $45) and it includes 24 hours of:Caesars Palace: Lago BuffetHarrah's: Flavors BuffetImperial Palace: Emperor's BuffetParis Las Vegas: Le Village BuffetPlanet Hollywood: Spice Market BuffetFlamingo: Paradise Garden BuffetRio: Carnival World BuffetRio: Village Seafood Buffet - available for $15 more per personThe trick is to squeeze in as many meals as possible. Note: Waiting time during weekends and peak dining periods are HELL. ANDDDD it's apparently more expensive. Try this combo: Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.Or, if you're a night owl, try: 11am Brunch, Early Dinner (linner), Late Dinner, Breakfast (you just need to get in before the pass expires).If you squeeze in 2-3 meals, you get your money back unless you add all the surcharge for Rio's Village Seafood buffet or Bachannal.GREATEST DEAL IN VEGAS!Try this winning combination for the ultimate gluttonous experience:10am: Breakfast at Flamingo2pm: Lunch at Paris (the off time will help you avoid their notoriously long line) 6pm: Dinner 1 at Rio10pm: Dinner 2 at Planet Hollywood (open late until 11pm on Fri and Sat, if Sun-Thurs, make it a 9:15pm dinner)9:30am: 2nd Day Breakfast at Harrah'sBack in April 2014, we did this and I told myself next trip I'd do it again! Just got back recently from my trip. Buffet of Buffets includes multiple buffets located in multiple hotels. I didn't get to go to all of them considering that it's just too difficult to do so in 24 hrs and I'd probably have to schedule my whole day around visiting each buffet. I did manage to visit my favorite ones so that was okay with me, the carnival buffet in rio,village seafood buffet also located in rio, and the spice market buffet in planet Hollywood. It was definelty worth the price considering we came to visit a total of 5x within all the buffets. We did get out money's worth. Next time I got to vegas, going to the other buffets will be on my check list. A little tip: try to purchase your pass afternoon or late afternoon. That was you sneak in a lunch meal for the next day, I only  say that because we purchased our around 10am, so we were able to eat breakfast the following day at 8am, but couldn't squeeze in lunch.Recommended - it's a neat way to try buffets in 7 locations for up to 24 hours.  They're not the best buffets on the strip, but then the pass is really meant to give you lots of food and selection for a low price.Some things to watch for: - Get the Total Rewards membership (it's free). - The $49 price applies during the weekdays only for Total Rewards members.  ($59 if not a member) - The $49 deal is weekday oriented, with the price being $65+ on weekends - While it's valid for 24 hours, the buffets are really only open from 7am-11pm. - Two of the buffets (at Caesar's and Rio) have an extra upcharge on top of the pass.I have been buying the Buffet of Buffet pass my every Las Vegas visit (2-3 times a year) for past couple of years, so guess I have developed some experience to share here. During my first couple of visits, I have been taking it as "ROOM & BUFFET PACKAGES" which included 2 buffet passes if you stayed at one of TR hotels in Vegas. This experience was disappointing for one reason: the Total Rewards staff in different properties (and sometimes even within one property) do not have the same information about their businesses and services. So if one person tells you one thing in one place, another person in a different place can tell you directly the opposite. Let me give you an example. When I booked my room for the first time with this package I called to my hotel (Bally's) to verify that I'm getting exactly 2 Buffet of buffet passes during my 3 days stay. The lady on the phone confirmed it. I went to Vegas, and at the Check-in another lady told me that I have only one buffet pass. I said that on the web-site it clearly says that "Stay two nights or more with us and receive two complimentary Buffet of Buffets passes". She confirmed it, and said that I'm getting two passes but I must use them at once (so I was suppose to be with a friend to use them both). It was disappointing... when I went to one of the buffets, I talked to a lady at the desk, and she said, that I can use both passes at different time and I should just ignore what the other lady at the Check-in said. So during that stay I ended up using both passes for myself and everything was fine. The next time I visited Las Vegas with a friend, and she was staying at the Harrah's and I was at Bally's again. We both had the 2 complementary passes. In my case at Bally's I already knew how to act and they didn't charge me anything for using both passes at different time, but in case of my friend at Harrah's, they'd charged her extra $50 for using both two passes. So at her check-out, I had to go to her hotel and talk with their staff to convince them that she could use her passes at different time. After about 30 minutes of arguing and calling the managers, and checking the TR's web-site they got convinced that what it says on the web-site is true, and we could use both of our passes. Although each time the situation got resolved in my favor, I still was very disappointed in Total Rewards. I just don't get how can their information be so inconsistent . So, buy the pass separately!The above information and my disappointment in TR are the reasons I'm deducting 2 points out of my rating, otherwise I would give the Buffet of Buffets straight 5 stars for being the best Buffet pass in Las Vegas. Now let me give you some information about the pass itself. First of all, it's totally worth it! Withing that 24 hour period that pass works, you can have 4+ meals at any buffet, which makes each meal worth less than $13.So this 24 hour pass gives you access to 7 buffets. Two of theme will charge you some extra money (from $10 to $25) per visit. Those are Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace and the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio.The Bacchanal Buffet is a high-end Buffet, with very good food. It's not very large but there are some dishes there, that you won't see in other Buffets (eg. lamb chops). It's worth a visit. The other buffet that charges you extra is the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I walked  trough it, and I can't really say that they had anything that seafood sections in other buffets didn't have. So probably it doesn't worth a visit, unless you're really into a seafood.The other 5 buffets are totally free if you have the pass.The best food quality you will find at Le Village Buffet at Paris and Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. They both are about the same size, and have about the same food quality with the Le Village Buffet, probably being little ahead. I recommend visiting the Le Village Buffet in the morning, because they have fantastic crepe station there, and the entire atmosphere of that buffet will give you an excellent morning mood. Also in the evening they have complementary wine. So probably these two buffets are going to be your main targets if you have the pass. The next best food quality would be probably the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. They have very good service in here and the largest food diversity. As a matter of fact, this is the largest buffet in the World! Too bad it's pretty far from the strip.Then comes the Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo. The food quality is a bit lower than in all other buffets, and in general it looks and feels bit cheaper. But when you will get tired from the lines and crowd at Le Village Buffet and Spice Market Buffet, you will come here and relax. I never visited the Flavors buffet at Harah's, but assuming it's the same level or may be even lower than Paradise Garden Buffet. Take into consideration that the better is the buffet, the longer are the lines: up to 2 hours, sometimes.I have done the buffet of buffets every time I have gone to Vegas. It really is a good deal. For those who are more on a tight schedule, I really wouldn't recommend doing this. You really have to devote one full day of doing this to get your money's worth. The price with a totalrewards card puts your total to 49.99 without tax. Make sure you print your cards out before you get to the counter, or they will send you back to get it or charge you 54.99 and make you wear a tacky wristband. START your buffet of buffets around 4-5. This gives you time to eat a late lunch, and maybe another dinner around 9. Most of the buffets close at 10. That's already two meals. Then tomorrow morning, eat breakfast, lunch, and you can also score another dinner. That's five meals for only $50! That's really a steal. With the high prices out here, you will definitely get your money's worth. Recommendations: breakfast at Paris Hotel, dinner at spice market buffet in PH, lunch at harrahs. The Banchanal buffet and rio charge an extra fee because their buffets are really well known.Got the pass at Planet Hollywood in the evening, that way wifey and I could squeeze in two dinners which ends up paying for itself... but thanks to the nice lady at the TotalRewards desk/players club, we were given the passes for free just for signing up for a TR cc with the option of cancelling it at any time and which also gives you a platinum players club upgrade for 'fast track' in the lines restaurants may have.  ymmv.wooHoO for crablegs!You feel like such a fatty buying this 24-hour pass but it's so worth! Especially when you're 20, stuck in Vegas, and with nothing else to do...The price right now is about $55 WITH the Total Rewards card. Since we weren't of age to gamble yet, we weren't allowed to get the card BUT for the same reason, we were still able to get the discounted price. Awesome!Bought the pass at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet at 3:40 PM (that way we could squeeze in two dinners, since all their dinners start at 3 PM) 3:40 PM Spice Market (PH) - was our first buffet and we were excited so we ate PLENTY and everything tastes promising. Tons of snow crab legs, and their prime rib + Yukon mashed potatoes were really good!! Everything else was ok.8:30 PM Carnival World (Rio) - they had a bit of a line but it didn't take too long to get in. They had a huuuuge selection of different foods. Highlights: *Asian selection-made to order soup bowls (ie pho and udon), dim sum (their shu mai was pretty on point), bbq foods (crispy pork, roast duck, bbq duck)*hot crab legs, ask for a little crab slicer from waiter*snow crab legs agaaain *their Mexican station had guacamole!!! Weow*GELATO.....I love gelato. I went back twice (sorry not sorry) I wouldn't get prime rib at rio..theirs was way too salty. 8:00 AM Le Village (Paris) - where do I start..this is breakfast HEAVEN! And their decor is so awesome. Wait was long, about 45 minutes to get in. (NTS-they start at 7 AM). Highlights: **made to order CREPE station**endless variety of egg dishes (fav were the EGGS BENEDICT-so good, and the lox scrambled egg)**Lyonnaise potatoes, potato triangles, fingerling potatoes?? So many potatoes..**endless variety of sausages as well. **sliced ham and slab of bacon, chef is available to cut for you**lots of French pastries but some tasted oldI saw them making creme brûlée but they don't serve it until 11 AM :( we left at 10 AM. Would definitely come back to this one, it was amaazing.2:00 PM Flavors (Harrah's) - you could definitely forget about this one. We ditched after two plates and left for Rio hahahaBut I did get raspberry gelato..and it was bomb. OVERALL-we went to 5 buffets for the price of $55 each person. $11 a buffet. Worth it especially since we couldn't enjoy Vegas to its fullest potential! Buy it during a time where you could make a 4th meal out of it. (Ie 4:00 PM) Also-drinks like soda, tea, coffee are included. And all the hotels offer free self parking, if you didn't know :)This is totally worth it if you like to eat A LOT!!! We bought our pass on a Sunday night around 9pm at the RIO. Since we were Total Rewards members, we paid $55 each. Beware: you pay upfront for the pass and they will ask you to TIP on the total. I think it's best to write: CASH, and just tip your server personally at each buffet.1st stop @9pm, Rio Carnival buffet. Waited about 20 minutes in line. HUGE dining room, tons of options! I liked the fried and steamed shrimp as well as the gelato! The crab legs and prime rib were really popular. And the Asian noodle/soup bar was really cool! The Mexican food and pasta was not touched by anyone.....2nd stop: 9am Harrah's breakfast buffet. Got seated right away! Typical breakfast options: eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, fruit, salad bar, pastries. They did have a free mimosa/bloody mary bar as well as an omelet and crepe station. I didn't try an omelet, but opted for a crepe. The line wasn't too long, but it wasn't worth the wait. The crepe itself was good, but the filling was just plain cherry pie filling from can-- gross! I did like their assortment of pastries and soft-serve ice cream (around the corner, so don't miss it). They also had a lot of sugar-free dessert options! I really liked the seating next to the live flamingos!3rd stop: 2pm lunch at Planet Hollywood. There was no wait, so we got seated right away! I thought that this was the cleanest, newest, and nicest dining area. I loved the desserts (crème brulee, cotton candy, soft-serve ice cream, etc); some of them were fancy and not just the typical pre-made, store bought desserts. The prime rib and pre-made salads were delish! I loved the Caesar salad! The sliders (both chicken and beef) were disgusting! 4th stop: 8pm dinner at Le Village at The Paris. We waited in line about 30 minutes. Everyone raves about this buffet, but it was my least favorite! I'm not sure if it was because this was our last buffet and we were sort of buffet-ed out, or because it was a Monday night. The French onion soup was the saving grace! Although I was bummed to have to search for the croutons and cheese to add to it-- should have been right next to the soup! Again, crab legs were popular with other tables, as were the crepes. We waited in line for dinner crepes-- I had a chicken, cheese, and spinach, and my husband had the mushroom. BOTH were TERRIBLE! All of the fillings were cold, and they were not cooked long enough to have the cheese melt. We were both really disappointed. The desserts were also very disappointing-- nothing was good! This pass was worth the price since we squeezed 4 buffets in, but next time we are in Vegas, I plan on trying the Spice Buffet, Bellagio, or Wynn, and skipping the pass! I only need one buffet in my life!hella worth it!..."open entry to 5 buffets for 24hrs @$54.99+"...w/ diff upgrade options to incl the other 2 premium buffets...see below...if you're gonna eat anywaz while in vegas, y not get a sampling?...i personally heart buffets!... think about it, 24hrs = at least 4 meals... your best bet is din, b'fast, lunch, & din again...y 2 dins?...best value cuz more $$... but anything more that 2 any meals period, u'd get your money's worth...this was esp what my chinese fam called a "good deal"...24hr AYCE pass to 5-7 locays!... whereas, reg. prices range frm:$19-30 for b'fast/lunch/brunch$25-46 for din...BEST VALUE: New Paradise Garden Seafood @Flamingo fri & sat luau din w/ no upgrade charge!

Sign up with their gold rewards and U pay one price of $54.99 and u get to eat buffets for 24 hrs. Buffets include harrah's, paris, planet hollywood, rio (for an upcharge EACH time) and ceasar's palace (higher upcharge each time).Upcharge for ceasar palace but worth it! Really good options and decent food.Paris on the other hand, food were over-seasoned. We upgraded to platinum rewards and had priority line and it came with many perks. Check it out!
Hot Franks="So.... Is Frank really hot???"Of course this was my mature reaction the first time I had heard about this place!  At first glance, you just don't expect this place to be that exciting.  But it's straight up good food at reasonable prices.  There is your expected burgers and dogs, but there is also some Greek food!  Plus a tiny bar area!  Cool!This is one of the cheaper options in the Strip.  My go to is the 1/2 pound Cheeseburger.  It's about $6 for a fresh off of the grill burger.  Special?  No.  But a little bit of happiness in every bite?  You bet!The hot dogs always look good, and the gyros are delicious as well!  The help here is so friendly.  If you are eating in and don't carry cash, tip on your credit card when you pay initially!  They bring your food out to you, check on you, and clear your dishes.Hot Franks is a not in the hustling part of the Strip, but I like that!  You don't have to wait forever to get a seat, and there is plenty of parking on the street.  So no reason not to check it out!
Republic Ramen + Noodles=I'm not a fair judge of Republic Ramen. I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have "tonkotsu ramen" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.I ordered the "tonkotsu ramen" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona. I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore. And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine.Who knew Ramen could be so much fun? I came here for the first time last night with John C, and I absolutely loved it!  Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!  I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!Secretly I have been wanting to try Republic Ramen for many months, but the fact that I am not a soup person keep me from it, but after a little adventure with Ramen not too long ago, it left me craving for some more! So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delishI used to live in So Cal & Vegas, so all Asian food gets compared to those areas.  As much as I wanted to love this place, it only gets 3 Stars. The portions here are pretty big and the flavors are unique.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzw#ksAFcidCv_BmBaBXB8aXzwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6Tw#qmZ7A6n_Is96cBXnDNw6TwTheir idea of "spicy" is really mild though....so for spice lovers, you'll have to supplement it with Sriracha.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/republic-ramen-noodles-tempe?select=hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQ#hfn4x4jMbFl8pF73iXVUgQIt's not like a legit, Ramen place you'll find in other cities....but it will suffice until I travel somewhere I can get the real thing.Return Factor - 65%
Popeyes=I love it how you order 8 biscuits and and you ask for extra honey....so we get 3 total honey packets. Seriously?We decided to go here pretty late because we had family over and forgot to eat and this location was one of the few places open that we haven't eaten in awhile.  So we go through drive thru and get the 16 piece chicken meal with 8 biscuits.  I specifically asked for more honey because I know how these fast food restaurants skimp on the condiments.  So the cashier asked us to pull foward and she'd bring the meal to us.  My Spidey senses began to tingle a little bit  but it wasn't too alarming.  I'm always skeptical when they ask you to pull foward when there are no cars behind you.  Im like ok Ill pull foward because of the potential customers that are not coming so you can keep a clear lane.  Honeslty I should have checked but the cashier had a reassuring answer for us like she was gonna load us up on honey like it was a bank robbery.  Not the case!  Get home and we got all this delicious chicken and all these biscuits and basically no honey.  Bee's work overtime to provide the masses with their honey.  I tried to eat a biscuit after the honey was gone and the dry biscuit sucked all the moisture out of my mouth.  Immediate cotton mouth was the diagnosis.  Trust your tingles and check your order before you leave is the moral of the review.
Le Chalet=Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes, Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that you'd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   "tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust  " super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all. The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne, Switzerland... , there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland ,which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already. There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.   Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!This place is getting me to let go somewhat of my perception that Bell Road in Glendale is gastronomically uninspiring. When I think of Bell Road, especially the Glendale stretch, I think of nothing but chain restaurants and steakhouses. I don't know if Le Chalet is an emerging chain, but it's already unique in that they specialize in crepes. Hard to find of great quality in greater Phoenix.My friends and I went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded. Decor wise, there is a lot of charm. The chefs wear beret-style hats. The dining area, and even the restrooms, have a cobblestone motif. Reminds me a little bit of an old toy store inside Fantasyland at Disneyland though less cheesy (pardon the pun). All the napkins are even bound in cute little cow theme napkin rings. The servers all sport the suspenders one would see on traditional Swiss outfits. The menu is a cheese-lover's dream. Instead of ordering off the appetizers section, we had a regular Swiss cheese fondue for an appetizer. Cheese was just the right degree of sharpness. They bring the little fondue and long forks to the table. You can adjust the heat. Wish I had warmed it up a little more after some time had passed. Every table gets a little sliced tartine (crispy cheese bread) to start as well. After all that cheese, we each had a crepe for an entree. The crepes were folded into perfect squares with crisp edges and the filling and sauce visible in the middle. Also comes with 1/4 cup of salad with a garlic-mustard vinegrette. I had a smoked salmon crepe with lemon and dill cream sauce. I really loved the crispy outside of it. I wish I had tried one of the more exotic crepes. Some you might not be able to finish in one meal because they are filled with ingredients like potatoes and bacon. We split a salted butter caramel crepe for dessert. Heavenly. It's one big, almost paper thin triangle on top of caramel with more caramel drizzled all over. The caramel was a luscious diversion for the palate. It had some almonds that were over-toasted but not a big issue. The staff was pleasant. Next time, I want to try La Potence--what they call "The Hanging Man." A chef wheels out a cart with pieces of filet mignon hanging on a cylinder with little hooks and flambes it tableside over rice pilaf. A chef was demonstrating it to someone as we were getting ready to leave. He was thoughtful in explaining to us as well what he was doing. Can't believe I actually want to go back to that part of Bell Road but it's worth the trip. A great place for groups with its reasonable prices. There were people with their kids. But none of the kids were running around wild. Not surprising if the parents are  willing to do something like  fondue for dinner out with the children. Despite the name fondue, no pretension in the ambience. At the same time, it feels a little classier than say an Applebee's.Le Chalet has become a breath of fresh air for the Glendale/Arrowhead area, maybe even for the entire valley itself.  Such a different concept that seems to be working very well so far.   Beautifully decorated on the inside with no corners cut and great attention to detail.  Feels as if you are entering into a little French village as the doors close behind you.  There are many different crepes to choose from.  I suggest asking the server what some of the best sellers are and go from there.  Service has been exceptional each time I have visited and they even wear appropriate attire with suppenders to keep with the authenticity.While dining you'll see behind the bar two tv's that are fixated on the area where the crepes are made.  Kind of fun to see if they are making what you have ordered and exciting to see how they are prepared.  Never seen anything like this before.Before you leave you must try either the chocolate or caramel fondue for dessert.  Quite a treat that is served with apples, strawberries, brownie chunks, and cream puffs.  It is so good that it may just make you yodel on your way out from this restaurant.RACLETTE!!!!!  OHHHHHHHH sweet sweet raclette, how I love thee.This place has raclette, and it serves it in the old-school way.  Big wheel o' cheese, stuck on some stakes and melting all over meats, potatoes, and cornichons.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!I tried their savory crepes, I tried the dessert crepes, and I can't wait to come back for some chocolate fondue and more raclette.  And maybe some tartiflette.  Holy crap am I happy I discovered this place.***They also have the calories listed next to about a dozen entrees, pretty cool!I would totally recommend this place but not on a meal-eating holiday such as mothers' day. Our reservation was for 1 p.m. and we were not seated until after 1:30. They were polite and apologetic - however, offering some sort of a complimentary snack to tide us over might have helped to take the edge off! (The rose for mom was appreciated.) When we were seated, we were in the bar area which featured a guitar-playing vocalist who played covers from the Eagles to the Beatles. He had a great voice! They have hoegaarden on tap and which we promptly ordered directly from the bartender while we waited for our server to acknowledge our arrival. Immediately upon being greeted we placed an order for an appetizer (roquerfort flammenkuche - more like a pizza than tart with sour cream, pears and blue cheese) and a tartin which was an open faced grilled brie and caramelized onion sandwich, to share as an appetizer. Both were good; although, I think canned pears were used on the flammenkuche. I would return for the tartin alone! So, Le Chalet is a fondue or crepe place. We went with crepe. Mine was creamed mushrooms, rosemary ham and swiss with a sunnyside up egg on it. Acceptable but not memorable. As if that wasn't enough food -- we are a family of eating champions -- we got chocolate fondue for dessert. The fondue was a disappointment. While the brownies were moist and cake-like and the cream puffs were a popular dipping option, the chocolate was not hot. At all. It was served in a carafe and it was melted (liquid) but it was not hot. While I might be convinced to give them four stars if I lived closer and was able to dine there for a non-freakishly-crowded meal, I'm gonna go with three because I would definitely go back if I was in the area but may not make the drive for cold fondue.Crepes to DIE for.  YUM YUM YUM!  We only stopped by for desert.  OMG!  The choclate ganache and carmel fondue was ooouber good.  No words to describe it.  It was so good and we had a fun time talking.   Love the atompshere too!  The rocks on the walls, the decor, the feel of the place.  Loved it.  Need to try dinner here next time!When Le Chalet first opened, I did have something akin to high hopes for the place.  It had a nice, somewhat eclectic, look.  The concept was novel, especially for what I'd seen of Glendale.  I thought it might be a hit.Well, after a handful of visits there, I can say that my hopes are thoroughly dashed.  The worst part is that it's not even the food that's the major flaw.  Crepes are hard to make.  The fact that they are competent at it here (while also being on camera), points to a skilled kitchen staff.The problem is that the front of the house staff is so wildly incompetent that the thought of going here makes me cringe.  The majority of the servers have been sullen and wholly uninterested in dealing with customers.  The lone light in this grumpy morass was a charming server who was on her very first day there.  I hope they don't abuse the friendliness out of her.The coupe-de-grace for me was the last visit there when it took them at least ten minutes to run my bill.  Without a word of apology or recompense for the annoyance at having to wait long after the rest of my group had left.  It seemed like the manager who was trying to resolve this was wholly untrained in not only how to use the register system, but customer service as well.Nope, won't be returning here any time soon.Wowser's! Finally a fantastic place to eat in Glendale at La Chalet! We had an amazing dinning experience here Sunday.  After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I bookmarked this place as a "must try" and I'm so glad I did!We walked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was decorated.   There are two sections on the restaurant, a dining room area for families and the other a "bar and lounge" area that has a warm ambiance.  Since this trip was a family adventure we were seated right next to the Ice Cave, where my son could watch the TV's in the bar area, making the crepes, which was very was very cool.  They have very entertaining "French" signs and posters on the walls.  They also offer entertainment some nights and have special entertainers scheduled for reservations. Appetizer: Traditional Flammenkuchen ~ "Oven roasted tart with sour cream, swiss cheese, bacon and onion".  It looked like a pizza at first, but don't be fooled! The flavor and texture get you quickly. The crispy "tart" and unique flavor of the dough itself is enough to party with the sour cream love affair your mouth is having.  Meal: Berg ere crepe (ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top), Roquefort crepe (melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts), and a Roasted Chicken Salad (roasted chicken on a bed of mixed greens, cheeses and a delightful vinaigrette dressing).  They have a decent wine list, great selection of Swiss imported ails to try and a full bar. Desert:  Chocolate Fondue ~ it was fun and entertaining with the kiddo!  It wasn't too hot and they provide a lot of strawberries, apples, pastry puffs and chocolate brownie wedges for you to dip into the chocolaty goodness!  Service:  Was FANTASTIC!  Our server was able to give us just enough suggestions based on our like/dislikes.  We had the Groupon deal so it made our meal was very inexpensive.  Everything was fresh and fantastic and most of their crepes are gluten free.  We can't wait to go back and try something different.Ok, if you judge a Vietnamese restaurant based on the number of people from that culture who patronize the establishment, why not apply the same principle to other places?Strangely enough, you CAN judge Le Chalet by the same standards. No joke, last night there were people sitting at the bar conversing in French, and an entire large family came in chatting happily away, again in French. I definitely take those things as a good sign. In fact, the chef himself was French. Clearly, something good is going on there.Can I just say, yum? I've never been to a French restaurant, so this was a completely new experience for me. Their menu offers an assortment of crepes, wraps, salads, and fondue. I ordered the Mont St. Michel wrap, which was smoked salmon, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and this great dill spread. It came with a small salad dressed in a lovely honey mustard vinaigrette. It was fantastic! Fresh and complex tasting. I enjoyed every bite. I also ordered the ratatouille and shared with my friend. It was delicious as well.For dessert, I ordered the salted caramel crepe. AH-MAY-ZING! It had toasted almonds and fresh whipped cream. If it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the plate clean. So good!Our waiter was Scotty, blissfully unpretentious, refusing to affect a French pronunciation of anything, and overall affable. He did a great job. A great experience! I know where my birthday dinner's going to be...I had a great time at their monthly Clean Comedy night!Every first Sunday of the month at 7pm, Le Chalet hosts a PG rated clean comedy night safe enough to bring the kiddos along. No cover at the door, but a $5 per person minimum on food or beverage is required. As we arrived, we were greeted by a delightful gentleman, complete with authentic french accent. This guy must have been practicing it his whole life. The waiter was an energetic, pony tail sporting, ball of electricity and was delighted to call my wife out on her bland choice of pizza crepe and insisted she ordered the mushroom chicken; excelent choice sir! We had a great time listening to the comics come up to the "bat cave" like stage in their back room to quote one of the comics, and with 50% of them hitting home a humorous set it was like "batting 500, and that's a win" to quote another.We both loved the food, I had one of their delicious sandwiches and the wife couldnt stop eating her savory crepe. I normally keep my dining and entertainment limited to downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale, but this food was good enough to come back for. Here's to you clean comedy, stay funny Phoenix and happy Yelping! ;-)I came to Le Chalet for my birthday based on word of mouth and the reviews on yelp.I was disappointed, my wife was disappointed and we won't be returning unfortunately.  The good...The salted caramel dessert crepe was superb!   The flat iron Angus steak my son ordered was delicious! The ratatouille stole the show in my opinion!The bad... Appetizer - I ordered 2 orders of garlic bread.  What a complete joke!  Take a piece of sourdough bread from you local grocery store put some garlic and cheese on a SINGLE slice with tiny bit of tomato relish and voila!  At 5$ a slice...RIPOFF!!Entree - I ordered the "La Potence" the signature dish.  What a joke!  This dish is being described on the menu as being "Flambeed table side by the chef and comes with a skillet of wild rice"  THIS WAS FLAT OUT FALSE!!It was attempted by our freaking waitress (who was nice and courteous) who could not even get the portable burner working.  It was completely botched!  The signature dish, the most expensive dish on the menu and the god damn waitress flambeed the thing???  Shame on you chef and owner!  Also, "wild rice"  FALSE AGAIN...I counted and I mean I freaking counted about 20 grains of "wild rice" in a pan of white rice.  Shame on you again.  My wife had the "Swiss Cheese Fondue" and I also ate some of it...it was mediocre at best.  The bread was stale and lacked flavor.  Also the cheese was flavorless...come on guys, seriously?  For the record I ate all my meat, it was a filet mignon thank god, so in spite of the botched flambeau it was edible.  ( i skipped lunch though...not sure if this played into it)When I walked in and saw 5 out of the 30 or so table occupied at 630pm I should of known something was wrong.  This is Bell Rd at prime time dinner rush....ouch!I doubt this place will be around much longer unless the chef and owner get serious again about the food.  Carrabas next door was packed FYI, should of gone there!!Note:  You may disagree with my review, I understand but lets make this perfectly clear.  3 restaurants share the same parking lot as Le Chalet.  The Tuesday night I went with my family the parking lot was near capacity.  The restaurant (Indian Bistro) right adjacent was filled with people plus folks waiting for seats!  The "chain" restaurant was filled up with people and folks waiting outside!  Le Chalet had 8 people inside eating...my family made it 12 total.    When those "trove of mediocre chain" restaurants have 500% more business than your 5 star (Yelp) restaurant something is seriously wrong....and it sure isn't the customer...Damn, look at how many stars this place has out of 140 reviews. Nearly a 5 star rating. That's fucking phenomenal. And rightly so, as this place is truly a treasure among a trove of mediocre chain restaurants. Why on earth would you go to Carrabba's when this place is next door? First of all, cheese. Second of all, moar cheese. No seriously, if you like cheese, this is the place for you. And I. Love. Cheese. In case I was unclear earlier. If you don't like cheese, gtfo. You're dead to me. Not really, but this place is definitely all about some cheesy goodness. I ordered a savory crepe called "Roquefort". It's melted blue cheese, swiss cheese, sour cream, crushed walnuts and caramelized apples. DEAR GOD. I inhaled it. My friends both got some amazing-looking grilled cheese thing. There was cheese ON TOP of the bread. Wow! The food truly was unique, authentic and appropriately priced. I clearly enjoyed it to an extreme degree.As for the service - great! Very friendly and inviting. The owner, Alain, was a complete sweetheart as well. He came over to our table and chatted us up. We asked him a ton of questions about his heritage and the restaurant itself. He was so genuine and kind-hearted, I could not wait to write my review about Le Chalet. And I certainly will be telling people to go there. He deserves the business, as I'd never expect such a gem of a restaurant to be located 56th Ave and Bell.HollaFor March's International Supper Club UYE #ISCUYE, Le Chalet was the place that was picked, and I was pretty excited to go. I love me some crepes! For me, this wasn't my 1st time here, but I was just as thrilled, after looking over the menu I went with Savoyarde, it was sautéed potatoes & onions, bacon with melted raclette cheese and black pepper in a buckwheat crepe, let me tell you, the potatoes, cheese, onions and bacon are a marvelous combo, this crepe was delish!For desert I again ordered a Nutella & Banana crepe, Nutella is crack, I just can't get enough of it, and put it with banana inside a crepe so so good.Service was good, just a little slow, but I understand we were a group of 12 to14, but they were very friendly and helpful, so really I didn't mind too much, gave me time to socialize with the group.I really like Le Chalet, wish it was closer and look forward to coming back!For March 2014, the International Supper Club UYE dined at this establishment.  I was happy to try out the place because I had heard some nice things about it.   I ordered the Fresh Cold Cuts and Cheese plate to share with the group.  This was a fine appetizer that was good for sharing and passing among the Yelpers seated at the table.  For dinner I ordered the Mount St. Michel.   Unfortunately, this wrap was equally unappealing to my eyes as it was to my taste buds.  I ate about a third of it and tossed the rest.  I took photos of it, but I think it would be unfair to the restaurant to post them.  I might change my mind later.  Tom S talked about the pictures so bad, I felt horrible for taking it.  I did not order a desert.  I was happy, but not impressed, with the group experience.  We were seated in the second dining room with the stage.  I believe on certain nights, the restaurant has live performances, so check their website if you are interested.  There were about 16 of us that night with one server to take all of our orders.  That seemed to prolong the ordering process and the service was a little slow.  I suppose we were served in a fairly timely manner, nevertheless.  With the size of our groups, I tend to be a little more tolerant of slow service.  BUT, 1 server?My return factor for Le Chalet is about 10%.
Verde=The owners of Verde have converted an old building into something modern and vibrant, a south-of-the-border neighbor for the restaurant row along First Street between Pierce and Garfield in downtown Phoenix.The food here is made from scratch, including mouth-watering flour tortillas made by hand. You can taste the love. The only item on the menu that isn't made in-house is the tortilla chips, and those come from the legendary La Canasta.It's fresh Mexican food with one surprise -- not one burrito is on the regular menu. How can this be? Simple, it's all about down-home plates filled with roasted chicken, red chile or their amazingly killer green chile.Verde is a fast casual restaurant, so you order at the counter, then take a seat while the food is prepared.First to arrive were the Chips and Salsa ($2.50), a large bag with perfectly crunchy chips accompanied by red and green salsas. The tang from the green salsa was bright and made my mouth water for more. While the red was good, I would have enjoyed a little more heat.Weekends at Verde mean a handful of breakfast options, including a few coveted burritos. I couldn't stop eating the Green Chile with Beans and Eggs ($5). The spicy simmered pork was so tender and delightful that it was like green chile butter as I slathered the meat onto a piping hot flour tortilla. If you order only one thing from here, make it the green chile.After the first bite of Red Chile Beef ($7) I was puzzled trying to figure out the exotic flavors. It's not your typical red chile; its flavors of clove reminded me of a cross between curry and mole, if that's even possible. Beans came along side and, with smoky notes from the addition of chorizo, are worthy of eating alone.If chile isn't your thing, the roasted Oregano Lime Chicken ($8) is a great alternative. The meat was practically falling off the bone and right into the awaiting flour tortilla.Beef Tacos ($7) were featured as a special on my last visit. Two corn tortillas are filled with tender stewed beef, then topped with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato. They are simple and satisfying, with the addition of a pinch of salt to bring out the sweetness of the beef.With outstanding green chile, this place is called Verde for a reason. They've got some of the best green chile I've had in a long time, and don't forget the tortillas.
Badger Cafe=This is embarrassing.I decided to go on a Burger Binge to find the best burger at 3 places that are within blocks of each other on East Tropicana.The Badger Cafe.The Dispensary.Sammy's LA Pastrami.I know, I know....a little excessive. But someone had to do it, and it was very revealing.The Badger Cafe has the best burger of the three, without question.It's grilled not fried and the meat is fresh and flavorful. And it's cheap: $3.99 for a half-pound burger, or another dollar if you get it to take-out.The Dispensary's burger is a close second....same price for a half-pounder, but $2 extra for take-out. This was the only burger of the three that came with fries, but unfortunately they were boring and limp.The big disappointment was Sammy's. I like the place, and I especially like the guy who runs it. But this burger was really uninteresting and the only one I didn't finish. And it's twice the price of the other two.The problem is the meat. It tastes like those pre-packaged patties you get at Costco...kinda thin and not flavorful at all. It's obvious these are not freshly-made patties and that makes the burger very ordinary.However, Sammy's does have the best fries of the three of them: the Garlic Romano Fries are phenomenal, but cost extra.This place is kind of hidden in a plaza full of other cafes. As part of the Rum Runner Lounge, it is a 24 hour sit down style restaurant. From all of my visits so far there are more pros then cons.ProsSince its 24 hours you can come here any time. The lounge itself is sealed off from the cafe because they put a door to the entrance instead of being an open space. Menus are on all the tables so when you sit at whatever table is available you can already start looking at your options and everything is on the menu is available at any time. Every table has all the condiments you will ever need for any of your entrees. ConsLIke I mentioned above, since its 24 hours, if you come between the hours of 12 am and 5 am, you just might run into some colorful characters. The bathrooms are located in the casino so if you have kids, they need to be escorted at all times.As for the food, I have discovered so far that most everything I have tried is good. The things that you cant go wrong with are the burgers, hot wings, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and any breakfast item. For the burgers which are half pound not frozen angus beef patties, (starting at $4.99) you have a checklist of what you want on there so you can mark off what you want with the pencils provided. Items like pickles, lettuce, mayo, and onions are free while some others like tomatoes, cheese, bacon, etc are extra. Same goes for the hot wings. You select your quantity and what flavor.The one downer for food I got one time was the new york steak. It was bland. I had to douse it with a combination of A1 and Heinz 57 sauce just to give it some kind of flavor.Service for the most part was stellar. Understandably if the place is busy then service will be slow sometimes especially when patrons from the lounge order things as well. Yes, you can hang out in the lounge and order food to be brought out to you. So overall, Badger Cafe is a nice spot to hit up if you are in the area no matter what time it is for good grub at decent prices. Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #150
Nourish=While randomly searching the internet for 'Vegan restaurant Scottsdale', I stumbled upon Nourish. Nourish is a new restaurant that has only been open a couple weeks. What I love about their menu is that they denote vegan menu items.Nourish Menu http://nourish123.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/menu-nourish-updated1.pdf10 of their 12 starters, sides and snacks are vegan (11 are vegetarian)5 of their 7 soups and salads are vegan (6 are vegetarian)All beverages are vegan1 of their 6 sandwiches are vegan (3 are vegetarian)All 3 Non-beef burgers are vegan1 of their 7 entrees is vegan (4 are vegetarian)They rotate their desserts, including vegan selectionsToday we decided to get take-out to eat by the pool, since it is such a lovely day. We both ordered the sweet teriyaki burgers.The burger is an amazing combination of chickpea, sweet potato and black beans with a slightly spicy seasoning. It is served with air-fried (without oil) crispy sweet potato waffle fries. The fries are seriously crave-worthy. They are seasoned with cinnamon, which I thought was a surprisingly good flavor combo. The burger is normally served on a bed of greens, but we got ours on multi-grain buns (lucky for us). I can't imagine this burger without the bun; the bun was the perfect compliment to the burger. We got the teriyaki sauce on the side, along with a garlic dressing that I didn't see mentioned on the menu and they were both awesome. The burger came with cucumber, tomato, onion and lettuce.We decided to try the Ogave sodas and they were awesome. We had the cola and mandarin key lime flavors.We asked about vegan desserts and sprung for some vegan chocolate chai ice cream. OMFG. The ice cream, which is made with coconut milk, was probably the most amazing flavor of ice cream I have ever had. The take-home container had 4 baby scoops...I could have eaten like 2000 scoops of it. It was so good that I want to go buy an ice cream maker just to try to recreate the flavor at home.This new restaurant will be seeing a lot of me....I already want to go back for 2nds. ;)Nourish is one of those places I recently found that I'm hesitant to share on Yelp because I selfishly don't want them to get so crowded that I'll have to wait for a table when I go... A friend of mine who lives in the Optima told me about "this new healthy restaurant that opened up" recently, and I couldn't wait to try it. Jared and I went in for dinner last Friday night and were both extremely pleased... we both loved the casual environment, friendly service, and of course the incredibly fresh and healthy food.  We worked up an appetite by taking a bike ride prior to our visit and we were both starving when we arrived.  We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu.  OK... that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but we did have the following:1 x chunky sweet potato and avocado salad - (one of my favorite things that we tried)1 x quinoa salad 1 x confetti veggies of the day 2 x seared sashimi-grade ahi tuna 1 x salmon burger with peppered air-fried, no oil, sweet potato fries1 x steamed teriyaki wild rice bowl with chicken2 x flavored water of the day (it happened to be blackberry that night)And as if that wasn't enough food for our first visit, we ended up purchasing two orders of quiche so we would have breakfast the next morning... and guess what? We finished everything we ordered and enjoyed it all!To top off the experience, we got a chance to meet Kirstin, the owner, and she was extremely sweet.  She told us about how she came up with the idea for the restaurant and all of the planning and hard work that went into it.  Judging by our experience that night and the reviews so far, Kirstin's work is paying off... Jared actually went back for lunch today and I was jealous!  But I am excited to go back to "nourish" myself very soon.  A few additional notes:*There is a bar with plenty of outlets set up so bring your computer and have a working lunch... they've got WiFi too!*There is a long list of wine, beer, and cocktails.*Parking is kind of annoying... park underground and walk up.*There is a dog friendly patio!*They are closed on Mondays.*They offer personalized healthy meal plans.*Catering is also available.I have a new favorite restaurant!I had heard about this place because my sister had interviewed for a hostess position early this spring before the place had opened. She ended up taking another job, but she told me how beautiful the place was going to be and how health conscious and vegetarian/vegan friendly it was. I was excited to hear of a place like that finally opening in the East Valley. I love me some Green- but most of that place is vegan junk food and not so healthy (albeit delicious).I had the Teriyaki burger, which was yummy and very flavorful. I spared myself the carbs and had it on the field greens, but I sort of wish I would have went with the bun after reading some reviews.I even went with a very NON vegetarian, and he ended up really happy with his burger. Seems like this place has something for everyone.I just had water, but the oogave sodas and all the drinks looked tasty. Maybe next time. Also on the agenda for next time is the deserts!I'll be back for sure- it was great leaving from dinner and not feeling disgusting or suffering from gut-rot.Eating healthy and eating out very rarely mesh well together. If presented with the choice of something like a 'Prime Rib Sandwich with Garlic Shoestring Fries' or a 'Roasted Chicken Salad'...there are very few people who would pick the salad over the sandwich under their own free will (excluding people who are under the influence of the newest greatest dieting trend). My girl and I try to eat healthy...we'll avoid anything that's too over the top; and we strive to find places that focus on being fresh and not overly greasy. That being said, there are limited choices when looking for establishments that cook up low fat food that doesn't taste like old cardboard. Nourish is definitely going for that niche...the health conscious foodie. In addition they offer pretty extensive options for people on Gluten free diets and Vegans. Don't get scared away though, there's still plenty of options for the rest of us. We tried a few things here; the burger and the tenderloin grilled cheese sandwich. Both don't sound healthy, so I know I'm going against everything I just said about the place; but both meals were very fresh tasting and had zero grease or fat; the food tasted healthy...there's an obvious difference in the type of lean meat used and in the cooking process if you were to compare it to a normal burger at a place like Chilis. It's like night and day. Also their sweet potato fries were quite tasty and were cooked in some way I don't completely understand (air popped?). All this being said...the food didn't knock our socks off, but it was good for what it was...and for being on the healthier side, I can forgive it a bit. It was a perfectly good meal, and we felt great afterwards...that's more than I can say about a lot of other places we've left bloated and greased out from.One quick downside to mention is the parking. It's pretty confusing. If you can find the entrance to the underground parking you have to pretty much sprial around this maze of parking spots looking for a 'guest spot', and once you find one you'll have to navigate through the Optima Condo area looking for Nourish...I'm still not quite sure how to find it...we just kind of stumbled into it; so good luck on that. P.S. Flavored water...some people have mentioned it...the menu talks about it; I don't think ours was flavored at all...not sure if they were out of it or if the flavoring was so mild we just didn't notice...hmm.3.75/5.The Beautiful Carin and I have never been confused with health food enthusiasts.Nevertheless, in effort to broaden our horizons, we decided to give Nourish a spin at lunch a few weeks ago, and see if it might "change our point of view".I was a little disappointed, frankly.But then again, I freely admit that I might be an outlier to their target demographic!Located in the ruins of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon...I mean the Optima Camelview...the place is definitely going for a hip feel...but it just doesn't quite succeed.Nourish is just so aggressively healthy...from the colors of the décor to the too eager menu to the very strict tables and chairs and the meager portions...all of them as warm and inviting as a rap on the knuckles from the teacher in the one room schoolhouse where I spent my first few years in the educational system.The patio, while nice enough, overlooks the desperately deserted inner atrium of the OC on one side, and the street on the other.We gamely settled into the rock hard and posture correcting chairs (subtly telling us to "sit up straight and eat our veggies...act healthy dammit!") and perused the menu.We looked and looked and looked, but I couldn't find the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes (which I consider health food) and Carin looked in vain for some of her favorites (or at least some salad dressing that wasn't essentially flavored water).We start with a shared bowl of "chili"...all I have to say about that "chili", is that it wasn't.I ordered a "Salmon Burger"...which I (silly me) assumed would constitute salmon and a bun...but when the menu says "served on a bed of greens" they mean "you just get some lettuce under this thingy...no buns".I suppose that wouldn't have been so bad if they had given me an actual slab of salmon, like I can get at AJ's grill for $3.00 less...but this was a "salmon pattie"...ground up salmon and fillers (bread crumbs, green onion, chopped pepper, and assorted other crap).Why did they do that to a perfectly good piece of salmon?Unless of course it wasn't a perfectly good piece of salmon, but a perfectly good can of salmon!I don't know...it was just fishy...and not in a good way.At least it was gluten free!Carin's "Kitchen Sink" salad was also a disappointment...unless by "Kitchen Sink" you mean a small salad consisting almost entirely of sliced peppers, shredded carrot and cucumber, onions and a little bit of romaine, in a small soup bowl...maybe they have a very tiny kitchen and the sink is quite small...I just don't know and I didn't bother to investigate.The service was perfunctory, but fine (we didn't get a lot of interaction with our server...he was working pretty hard for the attention of the young lady behind the bar, as well as chatting with a couple of his friends who happened to drop by).The good news for us is that place was essentially empty from the time we showed up (at 12:30 on a pleasant Saturday afternoon) until we left, so we had a waiter all to ourselves (even if his attention was split between us and his potential hook-up).All-in-all, this little repast cost us about $40...and we walked out of Nourish feeling not so much "nourished" or "nurtured" or "healthy" as we felt "corrected", "admonished" and "hungry".Oh well, I tried to be healthy...it's just not in my DNA!I love this restaurant.I eat an incredibly strict paleo-ish diet which means I don't eat the following:canola oil, soy oil, sugar, flour, farmed salmon (served by virtually every other restaurant in town including True Food Kitchen), grain fed beef, and a host of other food.  It sounds awful, but believe it or not there is no limit to the number of incredibly delicious meals that can be made despite these limitations.  Unfortunately, these meals *almost* always have to be home cooked.  Restaurants simply have not gotten to delivering a pure, healthy meal.Well, that changed when I discovered Nourish.  Their menu consists of a variety of items that I can eat.  As a bonus, their food actually tastes great.There isn't much more for me to say: a restaurant that cooks healthy food that I can enjoy.  Given my incredibly strict definition of the word healthy (and I admit that this is a relatively subject label as the scientific research stands in the year 2012), Nourish is one of the few restaurants I can enjoy.  And so I love them.Other notes: the service was hit or miss when they opened but these days it has gotten a *lot* better, to the point where I rarely have a problem.
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana=Excellent service and great pizza.  The owner came by several times and  suggested we try the Regina Margherita as first timers;  a simple cheese and tomato thin crust pizza.  We tried it and were not disappointed.Several days earlier the owner, server and chef came to visit Scottsdale Community College for an Italia event sponsored by the SCC Language Department.  I listened to how they use only ingredients (at least the primary ones) directly from Italy and the 900 degree oven that can cook a pizza in 60 seconds.  The trick in Italy is quickly cook the crust but not overcook the tomato and cheese.  They served very generous samples of lasagna and a traditional thick cheese pizza at SCC.  Both were very good but had to go to their restaurant to experience the "real" thin crust Italian pizza with the Italian DOP rating expected soon. Not exactly sure what the letters DOP stand for but it is a good thing. Will be back again to try to try some of the other thin crust pizzas!!It is with 100% confidence that I write a completely different review for Pomo, a review that is 180 degrees different than the original. As my previous entry mentioned we went to Pomo a few weeks ago and our experience was less than stellar.  It was going to take nothing less than a very sincere apology to get me back.  And I got that and a whole lot more.  This past week I received a personal email from owner Stefano Fabbri that not only apologized for the oversight but also explained that he would like to win back my patronage.  So I decided to take a work associate over and give Pomo a second chance.From the moment we entered, the experience was different.  We received polite and attentive service from the start.  Stefano himself came by and not only explained to us how he had used my complaint to restructure how his servers operated but also went into great detail describing what goes into making an authentic Neapolitan pizza.    And than the pizza came.  It was light and full of simple flavor, a symphony of perfection.  You could absolutely taste the quality and the care that went into its preparation.  There are no short cuts here, just pure craftsmanship and passion.    And finally, the education came.  He walked us through all of the steps, ingredients, and preparation that go into making this treasured dish.  We tasted the mozzarella di bufala, we  inspected the handcrafted Italian wood burning stove, we learned about the delicate flavor of the tomato that is so often lost by pizzas that are overcooked.  We laughed, we almost cried, we talked about the old country.  I am convinced that once the public is able to understand and distinguish an Italian pizza from those raised in the U.S. that Pomo will become a prized fixture in the Phoenix dining scene.  This place offers an experience that is exceptionally authentic....and authenticity, as most of us know, is in very short supply in Scottsdale.Stefano Fabbri, owner of Pomo Pizzeria, is not only passionate about his food, but he has a contagious enthusiasm that's informative and downright convincing.The Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana at the Borgota in Scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space. The dining room has soaring ceilings, dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of Italy. It appears to be another trendy, albeit sexy, pizzeria, but it's actually more than that.Pomo recently earned a certification from the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, meaning that everything from the flour, olive oil, kneading and baking meets exacting standards. This is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification. But the staff doesn't let the honor go to their heads; service is friendly and attentive.Pizza is the name of the game here, and seeing it prepared is a blast. In the open part of the kitchen you'll see a classic red Berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats. This is one serious meat slicer that I can only dream of having in my own kitchen. To see it in action I ordered the Affettati Misti ($14.95), a plate filled with the chef's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola, prosciutto, salami, olives and cheese.At lunchtime, Pomo serves a handful of Paninis, but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches. They quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred, yet light and crispy bread. Then they stuff it full of Italian goodness, like the Salami Panini ($9.95), which was filled with spicy salami, arugula and mozzarella cheese. Served with a simple side salad, the panini was excellent and satisfying.Like the panini, pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees. This means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook. By Naples standards, the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust isn't ultra crispy as one might expect. Instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew.Fabbri recommended starting with the basics, and since he'd know best, ordering the Regina Margherita ($11.95) was on point. The tomato sauce was bright and sweet, then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil.Another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the Calzone Napoletano ($14.95), which is not your run of the mill calzone. It was filled with spicy salami, tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. Each creamy bite deserved another, as I wickedly ate the whole thing.What better way to end than to order dessert? While they do have standards like Tiramisu ($7.95) and Panno Cotta ($7.95), the light and airy Semifreddo Di Mandorle ($7.95) was a standout. Each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust. More please.With a passion for tradition, this might be as close to an authentic Italian pizza as you'll get without going to Italy.On a hot and humid Friday night wanted a tasty pizza done right Heard about a place called Pomo that would be good for some homos (sapien that is) Stepped inside to discover a little waiter like no other A friendly man with an Italian tongue who made our night a ton of fun Got a few pizzas from the menu to try Margherita, Diavola and the Fritta, oh my! A fried pizza we had never had before but after one bite, we were sure to come back for more! Perfect crust and flavorful sauce made our Pomo pizza 'the boss' You're sure to become a fan if you give it a whirl just don't eat too much or you'll have a little hurl! 4.25/5Went back last night for dinner.  We went a little later (7pm) and there was a 20 minute wait and I was kicking myself for forgetting to make a reservation, especially because there were four of us this time around, and it is a very small place. It gets loud in there when it's busy. Joint was packed and it was a little toasty hot from #1) all the windows #2) the door opening and closing blasting hot 114 degree air inside #3) 950 Pizza oven #4) It's frigging HOT OUTSIDE!!!! The poor hostesses and staff.  I bet they can't wait 'til the fall.We ordered the mango salad again, (as fabulous as the last time) our friends had the caesar, which they said was very good as well.  We got a custom pizza with sausage and arugula.  They got the Pomo pizza that has all the fixins on it, kind of like a 'supreme' pizza.  Both were delicious! We both had our pizzas cooked a little extra time and they came out perfectly this way! I highly recommend it, especially if you get one with a lot of toppings on it.  Next time adding parmesan to our plain sausage pizza would have put it over the top.  We finished off again with the Tiramisu and the pineapple and sorbet dessert.  We didn't try their pineapple because we were so full, but it looked very fresh and light. Love this place! We will be back for an earlier dinner, or make reservations next time.  FYIBe prepared to walk a little ways, there is no valet, and the parking lot is narrow and long.  It gets filled up quickly because it also shares parking with the hotel in front as well as Dolce at the end.Rounding down from 4.49 to 4 because that's how we do it. I wish half stars were available.Look, I'm not going to say this is the best pizza ever in history. Or even the best in the Valley because a straight-up review shouldn't be about comparing local pizza to Bianco. So...When my wife and I could finally afford the time-off and the cost of a real honeymoon, we rented a car and drove Europe with almost no agenda for awhile. One of our stops that we happened upon was Santa Margherita, Italy. This cool little village is on the Portofino Peninsula. But unlike Portofino itself it wasn't loaded with Loveboat tourists. It seemed to be mostly young Italians looking to get laid (after eating fantastic food of course!). Kind of like what the douchebags from Jersey Shore wish they were. But, they aren't. Because real Italians don't say stupid shit like "pro-jute" and "mootzarell" or "GTL".At the end of the strip of venues catering to partiers, on the walk back up to our hotel, was/is? a little place called Santa Lucia. It was the essence of simplicity and taste. We found ourselves eating there at least twice a day. A couple times we'd have dinner there, go out, and come back and take a pizza back to our little terrace and eat naked on the balcony after the love. My wife's lack of clothing very likely made more people happy than my ass.Pomo Pizzeria evoked strong memories of that perfect pizza at Santa Lucia. And that means a lot. It's great that they have this special certification of 'Verace Pizza Napoletana' - but that's not what matters to me. It's how distinctly wonderful it tastes and how many memories it brings back.STUFF I LOVE1) simple, simple, simple. with the right ingredients and the right approach, you don't need designer pizza pretension or bullshit.2) friendly from the first phone call to the greeting at the door to every step after. that sticks with you. service was thoughtful, personal and well-timed without being patronizing.3) welcoming to families. we know how challenging this can be and we're pretty conscious of the impact a teething baby can have on our neighbors. but a family-friendly place tends to attract family-friendly customers and our daughter enjoyed flirting with anyone around us. and when the teeth struck, it was easy enough to take her on a calming walk through the beautiful grounds.4) Borgata is that weird place that should be doing so much better than it is. It's got location, it's got charm. It's built like brick shithouse. and it's got a genuine Old World feel (dare I say, Tuscan), but it's not faux like everything else these days. this place is really made of stone and it wastes tons of square footage with unused vertical space and wandering outdoor areas. and that right there is probably why it's hard to monetize this place, especially when in a shit economy, and being owned by Macerich. so I love that Pomo adds some vibrance to a place that I pray never gets bulldozed in favor of stucco palace full of "concepts".STUFF I DON'T LOVE[i got nothing]The fact that this is minutes from where we live is a huge bonus. It's not going to cut into our Bianco time, because nothing other than our feisty daughter could do that. It will more likely cut into our lunch and cooking at home time. So be it.After exploring the menu more, I could see 5.After the Cupcake Love In I needed real food.  Salad, ya, that's it, a good salad.  So I pulled out my cell phone and opened my trusty Yelp app to see what was close by.  Pomp Pizzeria sounded like a place I could get a good salad so off we went.  We were greated warmly and seated.  The young man who was our server was nice and even listened to my daughter as she told him about all the cupcakes she had just consumed.  He brought drinks promptly and let us leisurely look at the menu.  They had those sticky stick things for the kids so my daughter was happily making shapes and animals while we waited for our food.  My daughter had pasta with butter which she loved. And I had salad and pizza.  The salad was great!  Just what I needed.  The pizza was very good but I though the crust should have been a bit crisper on the bottom.  I took most of it home anyway and thought it might be better heated up the next day.  I heated it in the over the next day and it still seemed soggy.  Next time I'll try it in a frying pan on the stove.  I would come back here on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a relaxing early dinner.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff was friendly and accomadating.  And I loved the italian scene on the wall.....so cool!After all the hype on Yelp, I had to get myself over to Pomo. It's a great little place with a lot of atmosphere. I can envision myself on a warmer night out on their patio sipping my wine and chowing down on pizza. The staff was attentive and friendly and offered helpful recommendations. We started with bruschetta and the Romana salad. The bruschetta was very good- delicious crispy bread with a generous heap of flavorful tomatos on top. The Romana salad was perfectly simple... romaine, croutons, parmesan and I thought I tasted a some basil.  It was perfectly dressed too - not too light or heavy handed on the dressing. After a lot of contemplation, we decided on the Pomo pizza (sausage, roasted bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms). My first bite was okay, but after I doctored it a little with some parmesan, pepper flakes and a little drizzle of pepper-infused olive oil, it was delicious. The crust is definitely a winner. I will most definitely be back!Holy F%#K!!! This place is mind blowing.Pizza was AMAZING!  Did the Fradiavolo pizza.  This place is so unique. It has an olive oil and red pepper mix that you can pour on your pizza and dip your crust in.  So unique, and I just could not stay away from it. Olive Oil and Red Pepper.. These are a few of my favorite things!This pizza is fantastic. I usually like a thin and crunchy crust and the way they cook it the pizza is very fluffy... but oh my. It tastes fantastic and is really unlike other pie I have had.  This place got 5 stars because as the icing, I had an itailian desert which was a chocolate pastry with chocolate cream on the inside. It had a fancy name so I don't know what to call it... but it was fantastic.I can't wait to go back.Pomo, how have I missed your existence for so long?  I hadn't noticed a single review until my friend, Kerry M, suggested we go visit you for my birthday dinner.  We made a reservation, which proved to be unnecessary for our early-bird arrival at 5:30.  Definitely should call ahead if you like to eat later, though.  It was really packed when we left.The layout isn't my favorite.  Too many tables, too close together, and it got really noisy in there!  While I really do enjoy eavesdropping on conversations, this was a little much for me.  Luckily, the service was so fantastic, that I quickly got over my issues with the floorplan.  Our waiter had amazing Italian charm and seemed to read my mind the entire night - lemon for my water?  Why, yes, thank you!  Spicy, red-pepper olive oil?  I was JUST going to ask for that!  I love when waitstaffs are so good at anticipating needs.On to the food:  I have never had traditional Neapolitan pizza before, but had done my requisite yelp research before our night out, so I knew to be prepared for a thin, and perhaps soft-in-the-center crust.  I think it was perfect.  I love the super-quick cooking time (5 minutes from ordering to delivery at our table!).  My choice, the Principe, was delish - simple, perfect tomato sauce topped with prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula and shaved parmesan.  Drizzled with the incredible olive oil, it was one of the better pizzas that I've ever enjoyed.  SO good in fact, that I finished the entire thing - and I may or may not have stopped at Zinburger for a milkshake on the way home.  I'll be avoiding my scale for a few days...Looking forward to a return visit!I am in love with 'Pomo Pizzeria! They had me at "Ciao!"...I love this place, cause for a moment in time-- I get transported back to Italy. Everything is authentically Italian. Certified Italian -- the only restaurant in the entire state of AZ that has been through the rigorous requirements to be certified Napoletana. As others have mentioned, the 6,000lb pizza oven is even from Italy. The quality ingredients in their plates -- all imported. Even chitter chatter in the restaurant -- in Italian - l'amo. For Valentine's Day, I surprised my hubby with a dinner date here. I knew that he would fall smitten in love with their autentico Napolitano blistered-crust pizza. Fortunately, I found this place the week earler - as a referral from an esthetician. When I dined here the first time solo, I had wonderful and friendly service dining in the bar area. I loved hearing the cooks & service staff speaking in Italian. I enjoyed the small, cozy atmosphere of the tables. I loved the wall mural of the Italian street scene complete with Vespa (minus the real toxic exhaust fumes). Yes, I fell in love with this restaurant my first visit. Enter Valentine's Day -- the restaurant was filled, and our reserved table was waiting for us. Again, love the atmosphere here. All servers were friendly and very hospitable. We kicked off the night with a bottle of Soave - -  Tedeschi, I believe. Very good... light, white wine with some flavor. For starters we had the Caprese - - lovely buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and also some sliced bread drizzled with EVOO. Delish! I requested extra of the OO with the red peppers... very tasty to dip with. Then on to the pizza - - we tried the Don Alfonso this time. It was very good -- however, I think the pizza I had the first time was even better. (I can't remember the name.... uggh! ... but it had prosciutto, salami creminilli (which was off the hook!), and a bunch of other meats for $16.95.  Next time we go back, I'm getting that kind again. Dolce... of course! Due espresso, another sweet wine for me (forgot the name - - but it was good.) Not too overly sweet....  But the Tiramisu! Si, the Tiramisu -- was as delicious and divine as I was hoping it would be. My husband is not a big Tiramisu fan, but he said that it was probably the best he's had. Dusting of cocoa powder on top, moussy layer after layer -- love their Tiramisu!It was a great evening -- great food -- great service! No brainer that we'll be back. Va bene!I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.After a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizzaAfter a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=Me5jFmm9lrWCfKaRI4OtFQAfter dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhAOverall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.Return Factor - 99%This is for Lydia & MacRae - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOG3rD5CrQBeing the ancient age of 30, I have just now realized that I can categorize pizza into 2 categories: fancy pizza, and hood pizza. Hood pizza is the kind of pizza you buy in your hood. This includes the chain restaurants and those local joints that may not have a wood-fired oven, or they may have a wood-fired oven, it just depends on how the place feels. Some hood places mask themselves as fancy pizza, and hood pizza can sometimes be mistaken for fancy pizza. It is totally subject to the whim of the individual. A hood place can never receive more than 4 yelp stars, but 4 stars is good. A fancy pizza place can never be compared to a hood pizza place. They are two completely different worlds. This place is fancy. If you are normal, and not a douchebag, just ignore all the douchebag clientele in this place although it might be hard because we are all packed like sardines. Remember, you are focused on the pizza. You. Pizza. Focus.I'm sorry I can't remember the server's name, but she was AWESOME and attentive. Her behavior almost made me stop thinking the douchebag at the table next to me was a pedophile. The hostess was also really nice - we came in on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we had to wait about 45 minutes which was fine except for the douchebag clientele complaining about how they have to wait for so long. Effers. The hostess handled the situation with grace.We started with that salad that has the mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. I can't remember it and I'm not pausing to look it up. All you need to know was that it was fantastic. I've had many of these salads, and I get really angry because tomatoes don't taste like tomatoes anymore, they taste like nothing. A watery nothing. The tomatoes in this salad were pretty good. Not the tomatoes I remember as a kid, but still tasty.The kitchen lost our pizza ticket, and the server, again, a really nice person, admitted it and said she would have it right away. This was fine because I knew it would be quick and I could continue eavesdropping on the douchebag on the other side of me, talking in a fake east coast italian accent about how his italian grandmother beat him to discipline him. I think he was lying, because if he was disciplined by someone as a child, he wouldn't talk like such a douchebag.Anyway, the pizza WAS AWESOME. I AM NOW TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD. We had a margherita pizza. I don't know if i spelled that right, and I don't care. The sauce was simple but really effing good. The crust melts in your mouth and is perfectly chewy with a little bit of crunch from the charred bubbles. I will make the trek to Douchebagville, AZ for another pizza soon, but not on a Saturday night.OMG! I'm hooked on the fried pizza. Don't judge. It's DELICIOUS! When we were in southern Italy a few summers ago, we enjoyed panzerotti -- blurring cultures for the sake of description: they taste like a fry bread empanada filled with tomato sauce, basil and loads of cheese. I found recipes once I returned but, truth be told, I suck at frying. Imagine my delight when I saw the fritta ($12.95) on the menu at Pomo! Quadruple that delight when a "panzerotti" no less than FOUR TIMES the size of what I had in Puglia was delivered to my table! With each bite, the rich flavor of the fried crust melts into the sweetest tomato sauce in the Valley, complimented by a burst of basil and stretchy, milky cheese!I've been lucky enough to visit Italy and try authentic Italian pizza. While I have tried the Napolean pizza, I will say that it was in Rome and not Naples, but that didn't seem to make a difference in taste to me. Needless to say, the pizza I had in Rome was the pizza I use to weigh against any other slice of pizza. Pomo Pizzeria has come pretty darn close to authentic pizza in my book. I'm late in the Pomo Pizzeria game and just visited recently. This is hard to admit especially since the restaurant is in close vicinity to my home. Since the weather is so nice, I was looking for a place with a patio where we could sit and enjoy the last remaining days of cool weather. The patio at Pomo is relatively small so they had about a thirty minute wait which was well worth it for us since we were in no hurry. So we set up shop at the bar for a glass of wine while we waited. The wine was quite tasty! We ordered a house cab and for $6.75, it was a pretty decent glass of wine. About thirty minutes later, we got seated on the patio and the meal began! Be warned that the patio is intimate and if you need to have a private conversation without a third party peeking in, I'd choose another location in the restaurant. It's authentic to European dining in that sense and we were in very close vicinity to our neighbors. We started with the bruschetta and Cesar salad (Romana) to share. The salad is huge and you could probably share it with two to three other people. It was zesty, creamy and delicious. The order of bruschetta gave us two pieces of bread heaping with tomatoes. If you are with a party of more than two, I'd suggest ordering two orders of bruschetta or you can cut each slice in half. So the meal was off to a great start as we enjoyed the great weather, tasty food and thirsty quenching wine. About 45 minutes into the meal, we had just finished up our appetizers and were waiting for our pizza. The waiter then came out and asked us if we had already ordered a pizza or no? We said yes. So he then turned to the table next to us and asked them if they ordered the pizza. He was confused when they answered yes as well because the kitchen only had two orders in and there were three total pizzas (one for us, two for our neighbors). So he went back in and comes out with our neighbors pizza but alas, not ours. It turns out that they accidentally dropped our pizza ticket on the ground so our order never made it through. This made our dinner longer, but not too much longer and they definitely made up for and got our pizza out quickly. Now let's move on to the pizza, for this is what Pomo Pizzeria is known for is it not? Oh friends, the pizza is exactly what you hope for it. It tastes like it's straight from the streets in Italy. We got the Quattro Stagioni which has tomato, San Marzano DOP, mozzarella, fior di latte, sauteed mushrooms, Italian Sausage, etc. The bread was thin crust but soft and melted in my mouth. The crust was fluffy and soft. The pizza is definitely large enough to split and the combo of salad, bruschetta and pizza worked out perfectly. The reviews are right in saying that this pizza is absolutely excellent and comparable to the other great pizza places in the Valley.3/16/11Came in to see what Pomo had to offer on their happy hour menu-- certain cocktail drinks are half-off (I had the lemon drop, or something akin to that, with lemon vodka and fresh lemon juice).  The two pizzas I've tried here were just OK.  The Quattro Formaggi (mozzarella, provolone, gorgonzola, and parmigiano) was very salty, but good, crispy crust that didn't stay crispy for very long (not even ten minutes!), and the Quattro Stagioni (minus 'shrooms) was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again, as the crust was very soggy due to the tomato sauce.  Such a shame...  Order the bruschetta!  I had it for happy hour-- sadly, HH menu only offers discounts on cocktails, not food.  Boo!  So, I ordered the bruschetta to try while waiting for the pizza... I should've just ordered two of the bruschetta!  Loved the crunch of the bread, and the toppings tasted so fresh!  The panna cotta I had for dessert was good- you wouldn't have to twist my arm to order it again.  :)  (But of course, I'd like to try other desserts on the menu first.  That is, if they aren't off-limits...)  Mom liked the millefoglie w/ chantilly cream and strawberries offered to her as a token of appreciation when we had dinner there on Pomo's first-year anniversary.  I really enjoyed the slice of "anniversary cake" I was given, since I couldn't have the millefoglie special (due to powdered sugar and cornstarch in this pastry).Service was very relaxed and probably modeled after the service you'd find in Italy-- it brought us to recall the same nonchalant attitude we encountered when we visited Rome many years ago... (Most, if not all, of Pomo's servers and bussers are Italians from the "old world," complete w/ accents!).  Mom and I noted that most of the dinner customers here seemed to be Italians, w/ many of them carrying an air of being visitors, or tourists, not locals.  Two visits and the only things I can vouch for are the lemon cocktail, the bruschetta, and the anniversary cake (which wasn't even on the regular menu!).  One more try, perhaps...Three visits and three delicious meals.  Visit #1 - Two weeks prior to restaurant opening.  No silverware, no plates - just pizza straight from the oven.  Mind you, a 950 degree wood burning oven that bakes pizza perfectly in less than two minutes per pie.Visit #2 - One year later.  Three girls. three glasses of wine. one caprese salad, one affettati misti (assorted Italian meat and cheese appetizer), one specialty pizza, and three desserts.  Visit #3 - Two days after visit #2.  This time with my husband.  We shared one caprese salad, one sausage and mushroom pizza, and one capriccossa pizza, and one dark Italian beer.Aside from consistent, authentic food, the atmosphere is casual and welcoming, and so is the owner, Stefano.  He's quite the character and his accent is reason alone to go to 'Pomo.  Make sure to meet him when you go!Not sure why I took a year hiatus between my first two visits, but I'm glad to see that 'Pomo is going strong, and I'll certainly be back again real soon... if you want true Neapolitan pizza, this is the place to go... and make sure to order enough to have leftovers; they are just as good the next day!'Pomo is the real deal. The VPN certification is proudly displayed, and the pies adhere strictly to its requirements. Passing through the dining room, I stopped to take a picture of the gorgeous red-tiled wood-fired oven. The master pizzaiolo in charge that night, Fabio, invited me over to get a closer look, and preached to this choir about the virtues and perfection of Neapolitan pizzas. The DOP margherita was sublime, and the pizza bianco was absolutely wonderful, with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, enhanced by the nuttiness of shaved parmigiano reggiano on top.  Fabio sent over a sample of a wonderful dip of fresh and roasted garlic with a mild heat from red-pepper infused olive oil. This was beyond excellent, a great topping & super way to finish off the pizza crust. Our service was swift and knowledgable, and kids are not only welcome, but easily accommodated. We dined al fresco in February - a rare treat for a Buffalonian. Dessert consisted of a deliciously decadent Nutella cake, and Fabio sent over a lemoncello nightcap that had a creamy consistency not unlike an Orange Julius - a flavor and consistency that I now feel compelled to seek out.Absolutely fantastic. I could close my eyes and I was back in Rome enjoying a Margherita. It surely helped that I could actually hear Italian being spoken when I closed my eyes. In addition to the Margherita we had the Pomo, the Crocchette Pugliesi and the Mista salad. The crocchette was just like I've had at a street fair but I was a little jealous that they were out of the Arancini, which are my favorite treat. Too bad, but I will be back and next time I will save room for dessert.There is a reason why this authentic pizzeria was lauded "Best New Restaurant" back in 2010 when it first opened.At Pomo, you are getting a truly authentic experience, with simple ingredients and a method of pizza making that has been in use for hundreds of years.From start to finish - from the photographs and murals of Italy on the walls, to the strong Italian accent of owner Stefano, to the Italian pop music piping through the speakers, to the open kitchen where you can see the home-made dough being levitated through the air, to the moment that pizza reaches your taste buds - all of your senses are engaged.What makes this pizza restaurant unique is the method in which the pizzas are prepared and fired.  Being fired at 950 degrees and cooked in a manner of minutes locks in the flavors and aromas of the ingredients.  The crust is soft, this being the nature of a true Napoletana Pizza. I feasted on the special that day, a white tartufo (truffle) pizza with fresh Parmesan and arugula.  The thin and gooey center, with the blistered soft crust made it an easy pizza to eat - the flavors from the simple ingredients were extraordinary.Upon reading further about the art of Napoletana pizzas, I discovered that there is an entire organization, the APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napole- tani) that certifies restaurants for this type of pizza making.   According to their guidelines, the simple ingredients of flour, cheese, tomatoes and olive oil must come from Italy, and the pizza must be fired at precisely the right temperature.  Pomo is proud to announce that they are the only restaurant in town that has been certified.The average cost of a pizza is $15, and it is worth every dollar.   The menu boasts 16 different pizzas, ranging from the most basic Reghina Margherita (tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, and olive oil to the Capricciosa (mozzarella, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and prosciutto).  Finish your meal with a sweet bite from the dessert menu to complete the experience.  I highly recommend the "Torta Nutella", a flourless chocolate hazelnut cake filled with Nutella.Overall, a truly wonderful and unique journey to Napoli.  Molto molto bene!My previous review says it all when it comes to the meal and atmosphere, but it lacked an opinion on the dessert. Well, now I can add my opinion. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of tiramisu! It's moist, flavorful and amazing. They also serve Nutella deserts, cream puffs and more. I've decided that dessert is a must here.
JB's Restaurant=I just got into town, it's time for lunch and my friend suggests we go to JB's.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#2EgVWhCOv-7DeELNh0ZvWA   SERVICE: We walked in, are greeted with a smile and were seated quickly.  The servers are all very friendly and when I asked to get a small sample of one of the soups to taste it, they happily said "of course!"FOOD: I look over the menu and everything looks really good, but I decided on the Cuban Melt.   It's roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle chips on grilled marbled rye bread ($8.29). It comes with french fries and a dill pickle spear, but I opted for onion rings. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#t_Pp5iY7t8SiamWBuNvBEgA close up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#x7NE7o3JicBDwCbVeb3o8QThe roasted pork was tender and had a great flavor and everything else worked in unison to create delicious sandwich!  I opted for onion rings instead of fries.  They tasted pretty good but we're kinda greasy and when I bit into them the breading fell right off.My friend had a bowl of clam chowder and said it was O-K.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#Ecs--5eNPD9QSXdLyo6Q4QOne other note, while I didn't opt for the salad bar, I was impressed by the variety of items available!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#0B-AG7KYniJehO-k0CdMcwOVERALL: A really delicious lunch at a nice place with very friendly service.
Urban Seven Martini Kitchen=Martinis, martinis, martinis.Sure, they take awhile to get to the table, but that's because they are masterfully crafted behind the bar. Without the three m's (muddling, measuring and mixing), the lip licking liquid bevis that made their way from the bottle to our mouths wouldn't have had us all playing musical martinis. So many fresh flavors and chilled deliciousness.Love the pictures on the wall..very poetic and romantic.The food was wonderful, but the martinis were the highlight of the evening. Slurp!Attended SpaFitFinder.com's launch/AZ's Finest Honoree benefitting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation tonight.  The event itself seemed successful (the bar was packed, the service was s-l-o-w, but understandable); however, no one from SpaFitFinder came around to introduce himself/herself and to elaborate on the site's services.  Indeed, the server who handled V's and my drinks all night (a $10 per person netted donatee drink coupons for a mojito- d'lish!- and a beer/wine, and a sweet goody bag*) wore a SpaFitFinder shirt, but did not offer up any info on its services, neither.  While I wouldn't ever go back to the bar (TOO NOISY- I NEVER like to SHOUT at the person sitting next to me to be heard), or order the $11 turkey club again [this was a basic deli sandwich made w/ turkey, cranberry chutney mayo, smoked bacon (mmm... bacon!), avocado slices, and alfalfa sprouts on toasted Hawaiian bread, but it's nothing to write home about); had V and I gone to FEZ w/ the $11, we would've been in heaven munching on a delicious burger and some perfect sweet potato fries!), but I may give Urban 7 Martini Kitchen a second chance to redeem itself on the food a foodie coworker of mine RAVED about.  I can say the martinis I had were good.  Loved the mojito and the Inhibition -something (vodka, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice, minus the cranberry juice, and instead, club soda and sour).  Didn't care for the house pinot grigio.  I will say that the jalapeno and olive tapenade bruschetta and the grilled marinated skirt steak skewer were tasty... (FYI, the noise level was a lot lower at the resto, but the band, while they played pleasing music, did get loud at the end.  Also, the service was quicker.  Appreciated the fact that our server was honest in telling me that he hadn't tried the dessert I'd asked him about.  Other less-conscientious servers would've gushed about how it was their fave item off the menu to make the sale.  Kudos to Anthony!)*Among the goody bag offerings were an 8 oz. Philosophy foaming bath and shower cream (easily $8 retail), trial-size facial products, a wine stopper/pourer, a 20% off food/drink at Urban 7, and a $20 off coupon for Yelper John H.'s massage services!  Nice :)
Bacio=LVRW2012: Day one of Fall Las Vegas Restaurant Week (LVRW) and I've already hit gold. I don't have to eat around the other menus to figure that Bacio's prix fixed menu is the best value dinner of the whole shabang. Not only are there a myriad of excellent options to customize your three-course meal, the selection of dishes available to you is outstanding. At $30.12, Chef Carla's menu measures about $20 less than the average LVRW dinner. And she offers more than just a salmon and a steak. I kicked off my meal with the Fritto Misto di Mare ($14.50). Atop a bed of zucchini, majority of the bowl of deep fried sea life was calamari joined by a couple healthy chunks of tilapia and a single shrimp. Although outnumbered, this prawn was meaty, sweet and easily the stand-out piece in this starter. Between the rémoulade and the tomato sauce, the latter seemed to better compliment the taste and texture of the dish. The balance of flavors was a little off in the rémoulade. Either my palate was falling flat this evening or the herb and caper flavors were overpowered by the mayo-base. This isn't a dish to take your time with; the fried zucchini wilts quickly.Anyone whose met me knows I'm one of those "banana-asians." You know. Yellow on the outside, white on the inside? I may not act F.O.B. but I certainly eat like one. On a rare occasion, I'll crave Italian. And on an even more rare occasion, I'll actually enjoy it. Linguini alle Vongole Veraci ($21.00), or linguini with clams in a white wine sauce, is one of those simple dishes that quite often comes out wrong. There aren't many ingredients, so it's all about finding just the right measurement of each item to really make it sing. The al dente linguini was heavy on the garlic with the olive oil, wine, and brine all in perfect harmony. It all came together with just a touch of cracked pepper and a light sprinkle of parmesan. There's a dessert option for every palate. But I couldn't leave The Trop without a bite of Chef Carla's famous Tiramisu ($8.50). At this point, the first two courses had filled most of my stomach so I could really only manage a bite before packing the equally massive dessert course to-go. The creamy, sweet sabayon was the perfect finish to such a rich and excellent meal. Combine that with the coffee-soaked lady fingers and a dusting of cocoa powder, you have another thousand calories of decadence in front of you.I've eaten many LVRW meals since its inception in 2007. And after a couple fail whales last season, I was happy to find that Bacio by Carla Pellegrino did not disappoint.I'm not a fan of Italian, but a friend took me here, and who am I to turn down a free dinner? It was solidly OK. I felt like having some kinda baked cheesy comfort-foody goodness, but shockingly there is nothing like that on the menu. Not even lasagna! So I settled for the shrimp risotto, which was pretty good. We shared fried risotto balls for an appetizer, and they were pretty good too. The bread basket was uninspired -- just regular lightly toasted sourdough slices with oil & vinegar. My friend had the pounded veal cutlets, which he found a tad dry, but they brought him some marinara on the side and then he liked it ok. The custom cocktail list is fun, and the drinks are really good. I had the ginger mojito, which was fanTAStic -- served with a sugarcane garnish -- and my friend had some fruity vodka thing. Both our drinks were chock-a-block with fruity minty greeny goodness -- they do not skimp on garnishes here!For dessert, we shared the profiteroles, which were also good. The main problem as far as I can see is the atmosphere. It's BORING. The place is located on a walkway in the back of the casino, very claustrophobic and dim, with not much of a view -- just hotel patrons walking back to their rooms. Although I did see a bride, in full wedding attire, carrying a bag of Hooters-to-Go...so I guess the people-watching is OK. Overall, if you're staying at the Trop then yeah, try this place. Otherwise, it doesn't stand out. I probably won't be back.If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.
Lao Thai=Now that I've done "take-out" a few times and eaten-in once, I can officially say that I'm a huge fan of this place.In my handful of experiences with Lao Thai, I've had the following dishes:-fresh rolls -house salad with peanut dressing-stir-fry eggplant-ultimate asparagus-garden delight-pad cee-ew-drunken noodles-pad woon-senI've enjoyed them all, but the eggplant may be my favorite.  It's actually better than the eggplant at Tottie's and I'm a huge Tottie's fan!  The portions are really big, and I've found everything to have a ton of flavor.  I especially like that when you get take out, you get side containers of hot sauce to spice everything up as much as your little heart desires.Ann, the owner, is extremely sweet - I spoke to her for awhile during my last visit when I did take-out.  She told me they've got a website coming soon, and I noticed that on the menu she gave me, it says "we deliver" on it... I'll have to try that sometime.  Another bonus? They are open on Sundays!I think I may have been Thai in a past life... I love Thai food and could eat it every day if given the chance.  While the restaurant itself lacks character, it's clean, and I found the service to be attentive.  If you cannot tell from this review, I'm super excited to have another quality Thai restaurant close to home.Not bad.  We moved to AZ from Bangkok and my wife is Thai and a superb cook to boot, so we're kind of a tough crowd as far as Thai food goes.  Most of the Thai food we've had in Arizona has been absolutely dreadful.  This wasn't that bad, but it's not all that special either.  When we saw the Yelp! reviews of this new restaurant we were anxious to check it out.  Lao food is also the food of Issan, as northeastern Thailand is called (where the people are mostly ethnically Lao or Khmer). Anyway, Lao/Issan food is kind of like the soul food of Thailand - down home, earthy, super spicy and very delicious.  Also very hard to find anywhere in the States outside of L.A. or Vegas.  We scanned the menu for a long time searching for the Lao/Issan component but that did not appear to exist.  We asked the waitress - who couldn't speak Thai by the way - where the Lao food was and she said it was "all mixed in."  Uhmmm... okie dokie.  Basically, it's all 100% Thai food.  (As was every single other thing in the restaurant). Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we were kind of geared up for some nice spicy Lao food.  That wasn't going to happen.The menu is a pretty standard Thai-American menu. Sadly, there wasn't even one of the classic Lao/Issan dishes.  Just the usual stuff.We opted for the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and Yam Woon Sen, both traditional Thai dishes.   Both were okay, by American standards, not particularly spicy, even though we had ordered them that way.  Neither dish had fresh chilis.  The Yam Woon Sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodles but it was alright.  The Drunken noodles were okay.  Again, not nearly as spicy as they should be.  That little four-jar condiment tray isn't some Lao-Thai innovation, that's a "kreung prung," a standard Thai noodle shop item that's found on every table in Thailand.  It's supposed to supplement the fresh chilis in a dish, not supplant them.  The dishes need to have fresh chilis cooked in them as well, not just crushed dried chilis added on top.The real problem is that honest-to-goodness Thai food just isn't acceptable to Americans - too salty, too sour, too fishy, too spicy - so it can only survive in communities like LA or Vegas where there is enough of a Thai population to support it with exclusively Thai patrons.Anyway, big portions, although a tad expensive with virtually everything on the menu over $10.  If you're hungry and in the neighborhood it's okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip.If you really want to have traditional Thai food, your best bet is to get invited to one of the Thai temples on a festival day, when all the older Thai women bring home-cooked food.
Tia Rosa Taqueria=Bummer. That's all I can say - I wish I could like this place, but it's too ostentatious. Basically, this is a Mexican restaurant going through a identity crisis. You walk in and it's really clean, but there's no smell - I mean, where's the spice, the flavor, the umph? There was none. Moving on...the people behind the counter - very friendly, no problems there. I get my food and hortacha, and this burrito is the size of a burrito from Taco Bell...except at TB I pay $.99 and here I paid $2.50 - the beans were runny and I was a bit disappointed in the taste/texture of the tortilla. The hortacha was tasty but the same as a Fili-b's, and a few cents more.Here's the thing...we have Baja Fresh for the over priced, Rubios for the beachy/hip feel. We have all the -bertos and Taco Bells for the authentic and cheap...and all of these provide overall better tasting food - why would I go back to Tia?What I really need from Tia, is some proof that they really care that I come back. I need them to show me they are ready to compete...because right now they're not cuttin' it and I know I've experienced better.
Match=With my newly purchased Groupon in hand we decided to check out Match last Friday night. It's located at the corner of Maryland Pkwy and Silverado Ranch in a strip mall. From the outside it didn't look too inviting with their "Open" sign not lit up and no patio furniture. But the inside is a different story. It looks like they spent a pretty penny on the interior design of the place (or maybe the previous tenants did?). Either way, it's got a cool, modern feel. And the top of the bar is eyecatching because it's made to look like a ship's hull.The owner, Gregory, was incredibly nice. Apparently, he's worked on the strip for over a decade operating restaurants like Morels at the Palazzo. Their concept of "cosmopolitan tapas" seemed a little weird to me at first -- not knowing how it would taste to pair flavors from different continents together. I'm also skeptical of restaurants that have large menus, thinking that with so many dishes it's more difficult for chefs to master all of them. But, based on the  seven dishes we had I was impressed. All but one of the dishes ranged from good to great.- Spicy sour fish ($5.00) - Red snapper, ponzu, jalapeño. Not as spicy as I expected.- Seared tuna ($6.00) - lightly seared with a garlic sauce. So fresh, so good.- Olepe: mussels ($4.00) - my least favorite dish. The flavors were decent but the mussels were too tough- Dragon balls ($3.50) - my favorite dish of the night. A ball of spicey tuna, chopped onions, and peppers deep fried.- Garlic sausage ($3.00) - slices of a mild sausage topped with chips of garlic. A very simple dish but it tasted great.- Croquetas ($3.00) - 2 huge croquetas. They're about 3 times the size of the croquetas at Firefly. Absolutely delicious.- Frozen orange ($5.50) - orange sorbet presented inside a hollowed out orange fruit. It's pre-made and frozen. Although the sorbet was so frozen that I had to chip away at it, the flavor was nice and refreshing.Their prices are amazing! Most tapas range from 3-6 bucks, cheese plates are $12.00, entrees from $9-17, Korean BBQ is $18, paella $25 pp. Beer prices are around $4-7. Their wine list is filled with some gems that are all reasonably priced. Service was excellent, as well. Our server gave us some great recommendations and did a great job checking in on us throughout our meal. The waitresses all wear schoolgirl outfits that they alter to fit their personalities -- some are punk/rocker schoolgirls, others look like your typical sexy schoolgirl. I don't really get how the outfits fit in with the global tapas concept, but I'm not complaining.Their concept contains so many different dishes but the interesting thing about it is that you can try the same main ingredient in different cuisines. Want a meal with different styles of pork? They have a Chinese style dish and a Korean one. But it would be cool if they had more dishes with the same protein so you could create a whole meal around that one ingredient -- a southern style pork dish, Latin-American pork dish, European pork dish. You get the picture.Overall, Match is an amazing value. The subtotal with four drinks and tax was $54.59. Minus the Groupon it was $19.59. So, with tip it was just over $31. C'mon, that's unbelievable considering the quality of the food. I really hope these guys succeed. There needs to be more of these type of restaurants in suburban Las Vegas instead of more chain places. Despite it being a bit of a drive from my place I intend to be back often.
Empire Bagels=I had to update this review because my feelings have changed, I had originally given this place 5 stars because I love the sandwiches and te everything bagels here, but today I came in and prior to ordering I went to wash my hands in their restroom and there was not a drop of soap. My first thought was, obviously the employees aren't washing their hands after using the restrooms and returning back to work. Ugh my stomach turned. So I told the girl behind the counter there wasn't any soap in te bathroom, she shrugged her shoulders and then told another employee, in Spanish, "no soap in the bathrooms" neither of them seemed bothered. I left, and will never return. Good thing I have my hepatitis A vaccine. Like another yelper said, it's hard to find good bagels on the West coast but you have to make do with what you have and this and Brooklyn bagels are my favorite in town. My favorite bagel is an everything bagel and my pet peeve is when bagel places don't put the "everything" on both sides of the bagel and they do here! My favorite sandwich here is the uptown turkey, fresh sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, alfalfa sprout and scallion cream cheese spread, if you're watching carbs it tastes great on wheat bread but if not, of course an everything bagel then. Service here is, well not the greatest. I seem I get the same scowl faced girl who hates her job, but I'm not there to make friends.My only complaint, I wish they would open one in southern highlands! We need a bagel shop!!!Eleven miles southwest of New York-New York there is a New York style bagel shop named Empire Bagels at the southwest corner of Fort Apache and Patrick. I was unaware of Empire Bagels up to the time that my Yelp friend Lea checked-in here. I was under the impression that I tried all of Vegas's independent bagel shops. Lea's check-in developed into a mental bookmark that I was going to erase the next time I was in the southwest part of the Valley.   Yesterday morning, I erased this mental bookmark at the time that I stopped here on the way to a Summerlin park adventure. The first thing that I noticed from the parking lot is that it is next to Starbuck's. What a clever concept having a bagel shop next to Starbuck's. Customers can pick up a bagel sandwich to bring into Starbuck's and others could bring in a Starbuck's coffee or Frapucino to compliment a bagel.   When I walked in, the woman working behind the counter greeted me. She let me take my time ordering off the menu displayed on the wall. I ordered a Nova lox with cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, and numerous toppings for $8.99. At 11 a.m., they were out of a handful of bagels. I was satisfied with a sesame bagel. The sandwich was good (3 stars) at the same time it fell short of the New York bagels (5 stars) that I vividly remember. The sandwich included a can of a Coke Beverage and bag of chips, which reminds me more of a Jason's Deli that authentic New York Bagel shop. New York bagel shops generally follow the practice of including either potato salad or macaroni salad plus a pickle with the sandwich. In my taste, fresh potato salad or macaroni salad tastes better than a bag of chips. In Las Vegas, the Bagel Cafe follows this practice.    Noticeably missing in Empire Bagels was the scent of fresh baked bagels. The smell of fresh baked bagels is one of the most delicious smells. It is evidence that the bagels are being made fresh and on the premises. In New York, bagel shops are also called bagel bakeries. To be fair, the scent of fresh baked bagels is missing in all of the bagel shops that I have visited then consequently reviewed in Las Vegas. The upshot was that this bagel was missing the softness and warmness of many bagels I have enjoyed up in the Empire State. If a five star New York Bagel shop was at this location, I assume it would be so popular that the Clark County Highway Department would expedite installing a traffic light at Fort Apache and Patrick.    I am happy that there is a New York style bagel shop eleven miles southwest of New York-New York. In my heart, I know there are better bagel shops 3,000 miles northeast of New York - New York. In conclusion, I  rate Empire Bagels at a 3 stars equals good.
Martorano's=i wish this thing had an option to vote 0 stars because this place was a piece of shit.  The chef looks like a ghetto wrestler who should be fighting on UFC and his dishes are so unrefined, he probably NEVER went to culinary school, or else he used to be a sous chef at olive garden.  On the menu, he writes,..."This is how i cook, dont break my balls" he has got to be the most ignorant uneducated fool who got a chance to cook.  The service was mediocre, food is WAYYY overpriced. NEVER GO HERE.  The food? IT WAS TERRIBLE.  I like my pasta "al dente" but he didnt even cook his pasta.  The sauce was OK, a little salty, but i couldnt get over the pasta.  It was like biting into a straw.  This chef needs to learn how to cook pasta.  Thats foundation stuff.  He SUCKS!!!!  FOOD SUCKS, the restaurant vibe SUCKS, and i give it a big FAT ZERO.  He needs to go back to wherever the hell he came from, and maybe try cooking again after taking some high school level foods classes.ugh::UPDATE::this is what the chef of this place has to say after reading a bad review of his place.  Instead of apologizing and inviting me back to redeem himself, he writes..."From   user photoSteven M.Sent  3 days ago   You obviously have no idea what flavor is.. I'm sure you are accustomed to Olive Garden type food since you seem to be a pro .. However, Cafe Martorano uses only the best quality products... Come in and show your face we will definitely give you a tour and show you products I'm sure you have never seen and with your non existing culinary background I'm sure you cant pronounce "Based on the reviews, it seems you either love or hate this place.  That's what originally drew me to it, i had just checked into my hotel some firends and family to celebrate my 21st, and in amongst some downtime and getting unpacked, i immediately started thinking about where to go prior to the nights out that were soon due to come.  So i opened "THE BOOK" in The Hotel and while flipping through the pages i noticed an add for an Italian Cafe that had the picture of a big guy (Vin Diesel Looking) and a 2 paragraph dissertation on how his cafe became.  The long and the short of the ad, is that he loved to cook since he was young, so he calls himself a cook not a chef, and does things his way.  Basically the story said; A customer came in once and was insisiting that he turned down the music, and he politely said "Sir, this is the image that my restaurant upholds and what we are, so i'm sorry i cannot do that." The customer became extremely mad and began to demand and yell at the owner, and the owner told the man to get up and GTFO!  As soon as i was done reading that, i was sold, "This was a place i must check out", mainly becasue it's rare that people and restaurants now a days still have a backbone, and don't let people walk all over them.The theme of the restaurant is his way or the highway, where from 5-7pm music like sinatra is played, then from 7-8pm it's 80's music, and then from 9-close is club style hip hop since the restaurant turns into a 1/2 club at night.  And throughout any of this, the music will pause, the lights will dim and all of the many plasmas on the walls will show one of his favorite scenes from one of his favorite moives (casino,the godfather, knockaround guys.....) and then quickly before anything gets too gory the music resumes and the lights come back up. The food, is the best hands down italian food i have ever had and 1/2 of my family is from a little family owned city in northern italy called consa.We ordered the chef's choice which is an (5 course) assortment of food both on and off the menu, and whatever the owner/cook feels like making.  It was a bit pricey ($125 pp for chefs choice) but i know there are other things for sub $30 and $40 on the menu, plus it's vegas, what isn't pricey if it's not good, i mean really good.  You get what you pay for and you're not in vegas all the time, so indulge a bit.  We also had a personal wine concierge that helped us select wine throughout the meal, and our waiter who's name was meatball was extremely helpful in preparing us for what we were about to experience (the most food in one meal i have ever seen).  One of my personal favorites was the crab and lobster stuffed shellfish (that was not on the menu).  Holy mother that was good!  They also have a more than capable bar, and you can take a photo with "the cook"All in all, it was hands down my favorite place to eat in vegas, and i will definately be returning when i go back there.  If you want some killer italian food, and a memorable atmosphere, you must make a stop here.ughhhhhh.....Let's negate the price here because the meal was free and I'll still say, quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had. My chicken parmigiana tasted like something I microwaved from a Michelinas frozen dinner. On top of that, the waiter was a condescending eegit with a superiority complex. Listen to me and listen to me now, DON'T COME HERE! There are so many good Italian places in Las Vegas, that there is no need to stop at this self-righteous restaurant in The Rio. Do yourself a favor and go to Valentino in the Venetian or Rao's in Caesar's Palace. Cheers!LOL, this place is a joke, although It's worth a visit just to see how off the wall it is and to bring home a good story of the awkwardness. I'm a foodie and know for a fact I could cook proteins better than the head "cook". I know for a fact there are better tasting pastas from Sysco. I also know when I can taste a marinara that has a base of canned tomatoes yet it's called "homemade".. I know for a fact that Lipton style instant Iced Tea out of a plastic bottle doesn't cut it as a drink in a restaurant of this price range. I've traveled Italy, ate at some of the best Italy has to offer and I have a moderate respect for the cuisine, but even if I do over look the under cooked pasta and a horribly dried out meatball and bring it all down to flavor, this place still just doesn't cut it and dont even get me started on the service.. We tried this place on a whim before the Penn and Teller show as it looked to be the closest thing to fine dinning at the Rio, but we should have known better when there are TVs playing the God Father all over the place.. The Rio really needs to up their dinning game. If you're a foodie, my suggestion is go for a overpriced poorly mixed drink at the bar to experience the train wreck that is Martorano's and take home a story of a "restaurant" you will never forget..Oh yeah, what the hell was that thing that Martorano's calls bread? Wow, who ever came up with that one needs to be taught the basics of baking bread again..Family StyleThis was our convention group dinner. They closed the restaurant to accommodate over 200 of us. The restaurant is on the second floor of the masquerade tower at the Rio Hotel. It over looks the swimming pool. It has a nice long bar They had 3 TV in the main dining area, two of which was playing Godfather II, Sweet. Music playing and disco lights on. A really nice place to have dinner. Here's the rundown:The Best Meatball & Salad "Signature Martorano Meatball" I have to say, the meatballs are really good. It  was serve with ricotta which made it taste better. The salad it came with was just okay. Fried Calamari w/ Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce   This dish was my favorite of the night. Nice size calamari. Perfectly fried. That sweet & spicy chili sauce was dynamite. So good. Thinly sliced Serrano chili rounded this dish nicelyFried Mozzarella Stack "Tomatoes, Prosciutto di Parma, Aged Balsamic Vinegar & Extra Virgin Olive Oil" This was another winner. A thick piece fried nicely and tasted great with the prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Yum!!Rigatoni Pollo "Diced Chicken Cutlet, Hot & Sweet Peopers, San Marzano Tomatoes & Reggiano Parmesan Cheese" the rigorous was a bit too Al dente for me. The taste was good, just not pasta part for me. Chilean Seabass Scampi Style w/ White Wine, Garlic Butter, Peas & Cherry Tomatoes. The Seabass was just so buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. The white wine sauce complimented this dish Chicken Downtown "Chicken Cutlet, Ricotta Cheese, Spinach, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella" a nice well rounded dish. Crunch from the chicken cutlet and a very flavorful sauce.Red Velvet Cake. The cake was very moist with a cream cheese frosting. A nice way to finish our meal. The service was excellent. Sparkling mineral water was refilled constantly. Plates cleared efficiently. Dishes explained as they are served. What an Italian feast!!Family Style!!
Outpost Saloon=If I could give a big fat ZERO I would. This place is a joke. The bitch that is a co-owner likes to sit at the bar and demand all the attention from who ever is bar tending. I have named her blond possum faced bitch, seeing as how she looks like one. She likes to give dirty looks to groups of younger women who come in. One night a group of us went in and the bar tender "RADD" I am assuming its initials for ridiculous, ass, dingle,douche. He acted like it was a chore for him to refill our drinks and at one point was sitting with blond possum face bitch drinking shots w/ her. When we left my man didn't tip him and wrote on the receipt "be nicer" . Blond possum face bitch followed us out into the parking lot and asked us if we wrote this on her bar tenders receipt. We said yes b/c it is gratitude & that we don't have to TIP and your bar tender Radd was very rude.She then told us that we were 86th from the bar and I then had a bit of an argument w/ her about how Torrey Pines Pub was way better bar anyway. My sister came out into parking lot at this point to try and defuse the situation and mega bitch got into her face and 86th her as well. So my sister said fine I'm going to get my stuff so, blond possum face bitch continued yelling at her and in her face as she is trying to walk in and get her purse. Blond possum face bitch then grabbed my sister by her throat and tried to choke her. However mega bitch isn't too strong being as she only hydrates her body with copious amount of vodka and whatever dick is working behind the bar. My sister was able to knock the blond possum face bitch out with one swift hit and went in to get her purse. We are proudly 86th from the establishment. If anyone wants to go to a real bar were the bartenders know your name and have your drink poured for you before you sit down go to TORREY PINES PUB its located on the corner of Lakemead & Torrey Pines.6374 W. lakemead 89108
Smashburger=Who goes to a restaurant with "Burger" in the name and orders a chicken sandwich?  Me, that's who.  But I had a couple bites of 2 burgers while I was there as well as trying 2 of their fries.The chicken sandwich was quite good.  The fries were also good but not as plentiful as I was led to believe from the cashier.The burgers I tried were also pretty good.  I would go back but the bottom line for me?  Pricey for a pretty good burger.  I can get as good or better for less at other spots around town such as Lobby's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobbys-beef-burgers-dogs-tempeSure Smashburger is a "chain burger place" but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant...  They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries.We tried their Arizona Smashburger with fried pickles. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning and temperature!  It came with fresh guac, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, other veggies with Habanero cheese served on a chiptole bun.  It was fantastic! The fried pickles were also a nice change to fries. Crispy with lite batter and some ranch dressing for dipping.  You've got to try these!We also had the Classic Smashburger with their Smashfries. Again the burger was cooked exceptionally well with just the right balance of seasoning and temp.  Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic and rosemary. The seasoning was spot on! We've ate fries that are very similar at Diablo Burger in Flag, but the fries at Smashburger are better balanced with rosemary/garlic and salt.Recommendation: order a create your own 1/3 lb Smashburger with which ever bun, but ask for them to toast it ~ they will! Then add an extra 1/3 lb patty and request them to cook it the temp you want it ~ they will. Choose the cheese of your choice with either smashsauce or chipotle mayo and then get all the veggies including jalapenos. Your total will be $6.99 for a 2/3 lb burger of deliciousness that will leave you planning your next trip to Smashburger!  Don't forget to try their fried pickles and down everything with a cold bottle of beer.12/22/10Yelp offered Yelp members a chance to eat here for free, and hooray, I was one of the lucky few!  (Was a bit confused at first as this "event" was not organized like other meet-and-eat Yelp events; I was just supposed to mention to the cashiers that I was on the Yelp list- no big deal.)  Had the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger and "sweet potato smashfries."  Had to wait a bit on the fries, as the deal only included their regular "smashfries" (rosemary, garlic, and olive oil).  [FYI, other side fries' options were Haystack Onions and Veggie frites (flash-fried asparagus, carrots, and green beans- all sound great to me, except I'm allergic to carrots.  And maybe green beans.  LOL.)]  After finally trying the soggy sweet potato fries, I'd wished I'd stuck w/ the regular smashfries, which were actually tasty and nicely-crisped!)  The burger is definitely "smashed," and it was definitely greasy, but, oh was it delicious!  Really loved the added crispy onions strings, too.  I had them put the BBQ sauce on the side (didn't know what ingredients were used to make it), so I can't review that.  Honestly, though, w/ the cheese, shoestring onions, crispy thick-cut bacon, and, of course, the grease, there's no need for the BBQ!  The meal also included a free fountain drink and a sample of two choices of mixed-in ice creams (something akin to TCBY shivers, DQ's blizzards, and Ted Drewes' concretes).  I chose the butterfinger (yes, I know these cornflaked candies are off-limits to me, and perhaps the Haagen-Daaz ice creams, too-- some varieties have corn syrup and cornstarch in them), but I like Butterfinger, and so I dove in!  The 4 oz. sample was very, very good!  Great, even!  Too bad I couldn't eat the whole thing (the less allergens consumed, the better!), but I sooooooo wanted to, though!Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly, too!  And the women's restroom was clean and fresh, and the dining area, while a little crowded, was also clean.  There's not a lot of fast-food places I'll go eat at willingly, but I definitely would not turn up my nose at Smashburger!Breaking News: The Hulk decided to open his very own burger joint and called it Smashburger.  Whaaaa? you asked.  That's right.  The Hulk's signature move is now being incorporated into how his burgers are made.Splat.  Splat.  Okay, okay.  I was joking of course.  For all we know, he really did come up with this.  ;-pThe funny thing though is, I never really order the beef burgers here.  I LOVE, LOVE their crispy chicken burgers with swiss mushrooms! Sooo effing goood! The patty is so crispy while the breast meat is tender and juicy! TRUST ME.  YOU NEED TO TRY.The buns hun! fantastic! I think within the last year or so, they've revamped their decor and added an "Ice Tea Bar."  Its kind of cool, cuz the Tea Dispenser is in a tubular, modern shape and colorful too making it "pop."  I usually get their mango passion or something like that.  Its awesome!I'm hungry just typing this out.Greasy is an understatement.  I know they smash their angus beef on the "griddle" to seal in the flavor, but I've had much better!  Had the Sin City burger with haystack onions, fried egg, and applewood bacon.  Nice concept, presentation, and yes....very filling!  But the freshness and seasoning of the large patty was blindsided by the greasiness.SmashFries were better!It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.
La Pasadita Hot Dogs=So the address on here shows 83rd and Glendale, but the actual location in on 83rd and Indian School.  They also do a mobile stand, so maybe the address on here is the owner's home address, because it looks like a residential address.This place is great.  My boss is from Tucson and kept telling me I have to try Sonoran dogs.  I work in the southwest valley and many people at my accounts tell me about their family members that sell delicious Sonoran dogs from their mobile carts at night.  Well I work during the day, so those wouldn't work for me until one of my accounts told me one of the about the best Sonoran dog cart that also has a store on 83rd and Indian School.  I paid them a visit and discovered the most delicious hot dog ever.  A Sonoran dog is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, fried and placed in a bollilo roll and then covered in goodness.  There's ketchup, mustard, beans, tomatoes, onions, and probably more delicious goodness I can't remember.  It sounds overwhelming, but they are sooooo tasty.  $3 for one or they were having a special $5 for two.  I just got one and a bottle of coke and I was full.  They restaurant is small and not fancy.  You order at the counter and there are a few tables inside and a few tables outside to eat at.  The woman who took my order was friendly and bilingual.  They take cash and cards.  If you are looking for authentic Sonoran dogs, this would be the place."Hot dogs and Red Vines and potato chips and french fries are my favorite foods." ― Betty WhiteIf hot dogs are good enough for Betty, they're good enough for me.  She's the classiest!  Review is for the Sonoran dog, the only thing I ate.I'm a sucker for a good Sonoran.  What's not to love?  At La Pasadita's, they do things a little different.  The Sonoran features house-made bread, bacon [of course bacon!], beans, grilled onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, mustard, and guacamole.  I can't say I've ever had a Sonoran with ketchup and I don't think their dog really needs it but it was still all very tasty.  It's a bit on the small side and I think I should have ordered two to be happy.Not the best Sonoran in the valley but definitely delicious!  I would like to try their other dogs like the Chihuahua or the Sinaloa.  All the more reason to be back.  I wish I saw the pictures beforehand too.  Seems like there's a dog topped with Ruffles and cheese.  It's a small cozy place and the staff is friendly even to the awkward looking Asian girls.  ;)  There's a fee to use the credit card machine so cash is definitely preferred and recommended.  Parking can be sketch.  Look for Pizza Patron or you'll miss this place.  Enjoy!Once you've had a Sonoran Dog from El Guero Canelo in Tucson, you'll do anything to recreate the experience.  I've been looking for a good Sonoran Dog since I moved back to Phoenix 10 years ago and I came to La Pasadita in my quest.  Their Sonoran Dog was just okay, the wiener was small and overcooked.  The star of the show is definitely the creamy corn cocktail.  The service is outstanding, they make you feel their gratitude for your business.This is salty junk food heaven. I'm still not a big fan of hot dogs in general, but anyone should try dogs like the Sonoran, with the guacamole and crushed potato chips (queso flavored!) There are also small orders of fries, ranging from carne asada to one that I swear was smothered in like 3 different kinds of peppered mayonnaise (jalapeno, chipotle, etc.) This is overkill. This is too much, even for me. It's only like $3-4 per item.  You might as well go, if you've got the calories to spare.
Chronic Tacos=I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, "I want that."  Very stoner.I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.I'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu.
Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill=I needed a quick dinner with some leftovers.  I had been to this Sammy's for a Yelp event several years ago and decided to give it a go.  I phoned my order for an Italian sausage and a NY Style pizza.  The person on the phone told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I immediately left and got there just as they were about to be removed from the oven.During the payment time, Beto, the man at the counter, asked how In was going to enjoy the pizza at home--with a beer?  When I said no, I would be having iced tea, he went to the counter and got me a take out container of their passion fruit iced tea to try compliments of Sammy's.  Nice touch.The pizzas were good.  There's nothing special about them as far as gourmet topping but I wasn't looking for that.  This is OK standard, chain pizza, and it was a nice change from what I normally get.  And the leftovers make wonderful breakfast when you eat the slices cold out of the refrigerator with plenty of red pepper sprinkled on top!
Mac Shack Spring Valley=Considering that I'm a power yelper and this was a yelp event, you'd think they'd cut me a bit of slack for being 3 minutes late and serve some kind of food to me.  Not even an offer for a drink, a glass of water, a spare cracker! I guess I can't kill this place with a one star rating because it is partly my fault for being late, and I haven't even tried their food. But good service is a crucial key to any successful establishment and this place dropped the ball.What really shocked me was that I shook the hand of the manager/part-owner there and she still turned me away. "Sorry, the event ends at 8. You can come by when we open this Friday." She said with a smirk.Oh well, at least I had good company. So what did my fellow Yelpers think of the Mac? "Meh" was the general consensus. Actually you won't see me here this Friday.Actually I think it's not a bad place :) Free lunch + great service ( My, their lunch time service is much better than dinner time )... and of course great food ( I upload couple pix, check it out... )But I don't like their tomato soup that much and their backgroup music.. and their price are not cheap even at lunch!Do i love this place! Such a great concept. a quick order restaurant with everything pasta has to offer. I always get the build your own with angel hair, vodka sauce, spinach, basil, sun dried tomatoes, shrimp/or chicken. It is absolutely delish! My brother got the Mac & Cheese with cut up hot dogs and ruffles potato chips in it. Sounds odd but its surprisingly amazing. They have an awesome selection of different pastas such as bow tie, rigatoni, and fettuccine. Also an array of toppings. Oh yea and you cant forget their side salad, it has a great house dressing.Mac Shack also has the cutest decor and an amazing staff. Very friendly. Only bad experience Ive ever had is with a heavy accented manager. He was very rude and unaccommodating when the wrong order showed up via delivery. And if you decide to pop  in they have a row of Tootsie pops as you leave. very nice touch!Oh. My. Macgasm. (that's a mac and cheese orgasm)This place is something different. I'm a huge fan of mac and cheese, I guess I never really grew up, but this place just makes it fun and unlike anything I've had before. Myself and a guest decided to check this place out since it's down the street from my place. Located on Warm Springs and Durango, this little shack has a lot around it. We walked in and were promptly greeted by the cashier. We were in the mood for fettuccine and wanted to try something popular. We considered getting a BYOB (build yo own bowl). This however included too many options for me. I mean bowties, penne, fettuccine, or elbows?!?! How could we decided!! Lucky we had an amazing cashier who let us try some the sauces just to give us a better idea of what we were getting. One of the sauces I tried was the pesto, which they had cold... So i was to imagine it warm.. I'm just gonna come back and try it. We decided to get the chicken alfredo and the cheddar mac sammich. Also while paying I realized I hadn't checked in yet. So, I checked in and received free bread sticks!! YUMM. We were gonna order a side anyways so it's nice that it was free. They gave us our numbers and we grab drinks and sat down. I was excited they have blue powerade. Most places just have the standar coke sprite and stuff. They have tables and chairs or booths. I wanted the booth side and made my friend take the chair side. HAHA, cushion for my butt!! After waiting maybe 10 minutes or so all of our food was out. I got right to it with a fork full of alfredo and chicken. The alfredo sauce was delicious, however I'm wasn't the hugest fan of the chicken slices. They were a little bland. I added some crushed peppers to spice it up, and we were back in action. We then move to the cheddar mac and cheese sammich. It was great. Nice toasted bread with cheddar mac.. Oh, ill be back for another round and hopefully soon. Cool part is when you clean your own plate you can grab a tootie pop at the door, mine are still sitting the in the car but it was a nice gesture. :)
Beso=Beso is a Mexican-style restaurant with happy servers! I just love the aura and feel to the place- it is just so gorgeous! My friends and I went on a random night before we were to head to a local club, because we were offered a complementary dinner, so we did not get to choose what to eat.  In this complementary dinner though, it included guacamole dip and chips (the best guacamole dip I have ever tried!), ribeye steak covered in horseradish, and caesar salad. The rest of the entree was not necessarily the best of all time, but it was worth the stay and eat! I hopefully will go in and try something on the menu that I choose, so until then, stay in tuned!Beso: The Spanish word for "kiss"This hidden restaurant within CityCenter,  was inspired by Eva Longoria Parker :DHours of operation:Dining Room/PatioSun-Thurs 5:30pm-11pmFri & Sat 5:30pm-Midnight LoungeSun-Thurs 5:30pm-11pmWed-Sat 5:30pm-2amTo get this started, I first would like to brag about this "comp" dinner my lady friends & I had ;)We had reservations at 9:30pm & they wouldn't allow us to sit until the whole group arrived.When we finally got to the table, we all could not help but adore the well-designed restaurant, especially, the gorgeous custom-designed crystal chandelier.On the other hand, our server was ready to greet us, and prepared us with a brief description of our comp dinner...Appetizer: Eva's Avocado Guacamole w/ crispy tortilla chips (best I've ever tried!!!! Yum yum Yum)Entree:  Their version of strip steak w/ horseradish creamy sauce & roast potatoes (not really a full order on the menu, since this was a comp dinner) but was very tasty, yet small portions where given. Salad: Cesar salad (simply what it would normally be) great with the steak we had.As you can see, these three selections above, looks a bit too minimal, and to tell you the truth, I wanted more! But in the end, I had a full tummy  & smile for the free food I just had eaten. "free food tastes even better"My overall experienced was well-appreciated, somewhat disappointing with portion, but satisfying with keeping our money in our wallets ;)Maybe next time, I could actually order from the menu & get the real deal ;)
Thai Cuisine=Living on the East side of Las Vegas, we are limited on good places to eat. Thai Cuisine is a place I've been going to for years. Thai food is probably one of my favorite type of foods to eat, so I've tried many places in the valley. This place rates right in the middle. The food is good enough to crave but not great enough to be my number one choice. Of course if I don't want to drive far and I have a craving, I don't really have much of a choice. The Thai Beef salad here is delicious. Just the perfect amount of lettuce and spices. I always cry about how Thai places do not like to put a lot of veggies in their Thai Beef Salad. They think a lot of beef is what people want. But not everyone. I love my veggies! Last visit we had ordered Spicy Seafood Soup. One of my favorites dishes to order. It comes out in a bowl on fire. Soup is sour with a great kick to it. Large variety of seafood inside, We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, first time ordering it here. It was ok. Noodles were cooked well but there was a lack of flavor. It was more on the sweeter side.Service is great. they bring out complimentary egg rolls which is appreciated. They don't accept debit/credit cards for some reason. But, they do have a ATM inside the restaurant. So be prepared to have cash if you decide to dine here.
Rice Trax Teriyaki Grill=Yep, I would like to eat here every week. I would say everyday but, that would be exaggerating it a bit. *not really*I always find anyone/anyway possible to eat here lolAfter hiking at Red Rock, the topic of lunch came up and my suggestion was this place....and despite the half hour distance, I won =)Got the garlic chicken bento with a side of onion tempura. You can choose ur veggies for the tempura which got me all flustered because I wanted alllllll the veggies tempura'd.....was hoping for one of everything tempura'd but, since they were out of brocolli, I had to go with onion tempura (onion rings/not really/almost). Swear, I love their garlic chicken but, I shoulda went with my friends order.He got the mochiko bento with a side of curry. And in looking at his meal, I think that's the best bet of a meal. You get the mochiko (delish!), chicken katsu (my fave katsu in Vegas), and the curry (ur own chicken katsu curry). Altho my complaint with the curry was it was sooooo little...it wasn't enough to feed the curry craving.I have yet to try the tempura fried rice. I'll be here next week. And by next week, I mean, tomorrow!
Siri Thai=Considering that they were shut down in August by the health department, and just got a C a couple of days ago at the next inspection is enough for me to write them off. It lets me know they really don't care about the health and safety of their customer. Last Thursday I got their tom yum soup with shrimp which came out to $12.36 because they don't take card payments for orders under $15. So you're already raping me with your overpriced MSG filled soup, but now add extra .50 cent penalty because my order is under $15. Anyway, I had the soup and shortly after got a headache and upset stomach. I know my body and the reactions it has to certain foods, and I can say with 100% certainty that soup was an MSG filled mess. I am happily writing this place off.I am so unimpressed with you, Siri. I met my homegirl Jaime W. for dinner after a long and stressful day. There was only one table with customers when we arrived, so I was looking forward to a good meal in a relaxed setting. What I got was a bland, boring meal served up by some of the worst waitresses I have ever had to deal with. Thankfully, I had good dining company!Jaime was already seated when I arrived, and the waitress came over fairly quickly to take my drink order. It was all downhill from there.  Two men arrived shortly after I got my water and sat at the booth next to us. We were both surprised to see one of the waitresses taking their food order before taking ours... Perhaps I had left my menu open too long and they thought we were not ready to order, but a good waitress would have checked to see if we had any questions. This isn't a huge deal, I was there to catch up with a friend and waiting a little longer than normal to order just gave us more time to chat.We ordered our food and went back to our conversation. Our meals came out relatively quickly and correctly (I had requested no onion in my dish). I just wasn't impressed with my Ginger Beef dish at all. There was an abundance of shredded ginger on the plate but the sauce itself was very bland. The steamed rice was mushy as well. By this time I was out of water. Also, the table that was seated when we arrived was done and ready to pay. I watched our waitress go to them with their check and take away their plates. She went back to get their credit card, took it to the cash register and back to their table. The other waitress was seated at the register during this time. At one point she stood up, looked over the register at the booth where the men were seated to see if they needed anything and then sat back down. Not even a glance in our direction, if she had I would have waved at her to get her attention...  Finally, Jaime got fed up and walked to the register to request refills. This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. Thanks to the piss-poor service coupled with the sub-par seasoning of my dish, I was over my meal. While the waitress was intelligent enough to see that I had left a lot of my meal on my plate (she asked if I needed a to-go box) she was not intelligent enough to ask if everything was ok with the food. Whatever. I won't be back.EDITED TO ADD: Siri Thai was closed by the Health Department of Southern Nevada in August of 2013 for RECYCLING RICE. That is disgusting and has ensured I will never step foot in this place again.

The Beat Coffeehouse=I heard about The Beat on NPR and was so excited to try it. I really, really, really wanted to like it...but sadly it fell short of my expectations. Expectations meaning a good cup of coffee. Honestly, when I go to a cofeehouse this self-admitted coffee snob is really just looking for a good coffee beverage. Sure, good service, a good vibe, good food, live music, free Wi-Fi, these things are all a plus. But if you call yourself a "coffeehouse" at the very least you should be able to produce a good cup of coffee and good coffee beverages. That being said, here is my experience at The Beat.We arrived at around 3 pm. We walked in and it looked like they were trying really hard to capture a 1960's No. Cal. beatnik vibe. Nothing wrong with that but it just felt like they were trying a bit too hard. We walked up to the counter and waited while the barista finished making a drink. It took a really long time...that should have been a clue. She eventually finished, handed off the drink and approached us.Me: Hi!Barista: (just to point out there was no "hi" in return...not even a smile) Just to let you know we don't serve alcohol until after 7pm.Me: That's OK we are here for coffee.Barista: Oh and the kitchen is closed because they are having a meeting.Me: No problem. May I have a non-fat cappuccino for here?She rang it up and we had a seat. It took a really long time...btw, it was the only drink she was making. She finally called out my drink and what I ended up with was a mediocre (at best) cap. The foam was big, soapy bubbles which dissipated quickly leaving about 4 gulps of slightly milky espresso in my cup. The espresso was fine but the overall drink was disappointing. In fact the entire experience was a big disappointment.I always walked pass this place and wondered what is going on inside. Last night I finally got to try it out as I was there for the Yelp Holiday Bazaar event. Here I won't review the event but the special turkey sandwich that I ordered. This sandwich was their sandwich of the day or something like that and it was amazing. Sliced turkey breast on top of a brotchen with lettuce, and cheese and some other things that made this one of my favorites. The first thing that came into my mind when I bit into the sandwitch was: where the heck did they find brotchen in Las Vegas????? That is one of the things I miss about Germany and I hope they share their secret brotchen location with me. Anyways, I will be going back there to try more on their menu.Im so obsessed with this place! They have great coffee and also do little events at night such as a free style story telling. that was so fun to watch. If your ever downtown def check this place out.I popped in to The Beat Coffeehouse after a walking tour of Fremont Street.  It was a nice spot to sit and relax and cool off in the AC after being outside for a couple of hours.  It really reminded me of the coffeehouses I used to hang out in when I was in college.  The whole place seems to be a mishmash of furniture, neighborhoods, and stuff collected at flea markets.  I only had a cold soda, which was bottled, so I can't really comment on the food or drink served in the place, but the menu looked good.  This really isn't a place I would search out, but if I was in the neighborhood and wanted a tea, I would stop in for sure.On the Fremont Street East Entertainment District the Beat goes on. The Beat Coffeehouse is a coffee house experience that hits the right chord.  The Beat Coffee House is the antithesis of the standard corporate coffee shop chain (still a major Starbuck's fan). It is a symbol of the preservation and revitalization movement occurring in downtown Las Vegas. Standing at the southeast corner of Fremont at 6th Streets, across from the El Cortez, the Beat Coffeehouse lives in a building dating back decades before the records displayed in their bins and walls were recorded. Decades before I was born, the Beat Coffeehouse was a J.C. Penney. The handicap entrance to the current Emergency Arts Building that The Beat shares space with used to be the J.C. Penney catalog showroom. Considering that I am into current history, I am fascinated by this. Anyway, Boulevard Mall opened which took away the J.C. Penny and major retailers from Fremont Street. The Fremont Medical District took over the J.C. Penney. Recently it closed. The innovative spirit happening in downtown turned this into a multi-use building that includes art studios and the Beat Coffee Shop.   The Beat Coffeehouse is an awesome coffeehouse scene. It reminds me so much of an independent coffee shop in downtown New Orleans or San Francisco. When I walk in the doors I see the counter with stools to the left and a chalk board menu beyond. When I order there is a turntable playing the album heard throughout the cafe. If I keep going straight, maybe to use the rest room; I walk through a hall that is now the Emergency Arts. To the right is an art studio separated by pane glass. When I turn around and head toward Fremont Street where I entered the Beat, the record bins will be on my left. A few more feet are the seats. There is an eclectic arrangement of seating from couches to tables and counter stools. If I walk out the door, the Commonwealth (with the Laundry Room), the Griffin, and Don't Tell Mama are across Fremont Street.  The Beat is versatile. Their menu includes coffee, espresso, soup, sandwiches, sweets, and yes wine and beer. I have kind words to say about the strawberry Italian soda and drip coffee with strawberry syrup. Those kind words are "4 stars."  When it comes to a place to hang out, The Beat Rocks. Management has good taste in music. Pink Floyd and coffee really go good together. An activity I enjoyed was when they played a record that I enjoyed but had zero clue who the artist was. Like a little kid chasing an ice cream truck, I'd dash over to the turntable to find out the artist. The windows overlooking the street activity happening on Fremont Street is entertaining. The activity ranges from a character yelling "shut up" to a nighttime sightseeing bus. There are also poetry events.   The Beat Coffeehouse is a unique coffeehouse scene in downtown Las Vegas. And when it comes to the coffee house scene, you can say I march to the beat of a different drum.The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 95.One of Downtown's first day time places to hang out and around the corner from Vegas' new Godfather, Tony Hsieh's Ogden...this hip little coffee house drips with history. This building was once a JC Penny's, then a medical building. Painted concrete floors and old vinyls characterize this historic hipster hangout.They offer an extensive lunch menu and the delicious garlic aroma made our mouths water during our downtown project tour. For a coffee house, they need to have real coffee machines as they look silly pumping coffee orders out of a large thermos. Expect an extra long wait for food orders. Even having what looks like a full staff, the pace is slow. We waited 45 minutes (after we were told it would be 15 minutes) for a tuna sandwich and baked mac & cheese that still came out cold in the middle. Food was ok, but definitely not worth the wait time. Parking downtown also not the easiest. Hopefully with the revitalization, there will be more competition nearby to make The Beat come up to par.I passed this place at least 50 times walking along Fremont Street to the El Cortez over the past several years. Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.It has a good vibe, and friendly service.  It attracts business clientele in the morning, not hipsters like I expected.Rock posters, cut out articles, and flyers of every kind are posted to the wall.  Everything from a moving notice from Skin City to a call for homeless activists.Free wifi.  70's funk, whiteman-overbite tunes.  I like it.It's eclectic.  Sells both pastrami sandwiches and used records.  The chairs and tables are a little beat up, but that adds to funkiness.The coffee came from canisters, already made, not fresh as I love -- but it was a tasty brew.Very cool and very chill.Yes! I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is. First off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package. More on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool. The staff? Friendly. I'm super, duper glad I decamped from my situation at chain-coffee ground-zero and sought out some realness. For any visitors or locals looking to avoid the 'bux or the chaos just a few miles down Las Vegas Blvd, this is your spot. Grab coffee, post up, get things done, and feel good about the whole thing.Coffeehouse check list time...- Weird random stuff hanging on the wall? CHECK!- Assortment of seating arrangements. Varying in size and comfort? CHECK!- Funky names for food items? CHECK!  "Slap N' Tickle", PB & J w/ Bacon, "Tina Turner Wrap" Turkey Wrap Sammie- Interesting yet good music playing. CHECK! - Varying assortment of customers... Businessmen, Indie Folks, Zappos employees  changing their scenery yet still working, fast on their feet. CHECK!Honestly, this place covers all the bases of a great coffee shop. First and foremost their coffee is very good. Super smooth and with no burnt taste, which is was what most people are used to from that large coffee chain on every suburban street corner. No, burnt doesn't equal strong. You've been Yelpucated!I came here after a meeting and was in the mood for a caffeine boost and some coffeehouse treats in my belly. I ordered an Iced Coffee and the "Tina Turner Turkey Wrap". Like I said before, the coffee is great and surprisingly the food is on the same level. The Turkey Wrap was made perfect; fresh veggies, flavorful turkey, and a soft tortilla, but its just not wraps and bagels. They offer many food options as the menu here is quite large, so if Turkey Wraps or PB & J sammies aren't your cup of tea (or coffee), I'm sure you'll find something to snack on. Free WiFi, vinyl for sale, various art shows, plus fun trivia nights. The Beat really does a great job at being awesome. It's really in your best interest to just come down here, sit down, enjoy a cup of happiness, and bob your head to The Beat.The Beat Coffeehouse proudly plays rock music in the background while serving different types of drinks and offering a decent selection of things to munch on. It's a short walk from the Downtown Container Park and across from Commonwealth. The interior was pretty cool. Different things such as newspaper articles, ads, and posters were all tacked up on their walls. The music was pretty good; a lot of rock classics played and then other songs I've never even heard of before came on. They had vinyl records for sale in the little crates on the counters.I ordered a mango/banana smoothie, but I'm pretty sure I was handed just a plain banana smoothie... Okay, maybe the nice young woman taking my order didn't hear me. It's alright, though, because I honestly needed something cold and refreshing to cool me off before I venture off into the crowd for First Friday. When the guy behind the counter called me up to grab my drink, he handed it to me in a way that made the drink ooze out through the lid and fly everywhere! There weren't any apologies, no offering up napkins, nothing. Well, whatever. At least I got my drink. (Although I did have to clean it up for the photo). The smoothie had the ripe banana taste and wasn't really that sweet.I sat on the couch, and it made me sink in it a little. It's super comfortable and it got to the point where I felt like I wanted to take a nap. In the same building (towards the back), there's the Emergency Arts art gallery which you should check out if you've got the spare time... I don't think this coffee shop is a good place for groups of 4+ people, but it's perfect for bringing a friend or two to chill (or go solo and work on some stuff).
Orange Sky=9/26/10I am overjoyed w/ my decision to have dinner here on the last night of Restaurant Week despite three days' of failed attempts to get out of work early enough to enjoy the sunset views!  The terrific value on such a delicious meal coupled w/ a great perlustration of the eternity pool/fountain in the patio deck made up for the missed survey of the desert mountain landscape (don't forget the beautiful Talking Stick golf course, resort pools, and water fixtures!).  Besides the two restaurant lounge areas, private dining booths, two Chef's tables ($2000 minimum ticket), and a large, yet intimate, main dining area, there are many "pockets" brimming w/ positive energy in the patio where one can enjoy a cocktail (or not!), catch up w/ friends, or just linger and take in the beauty of the space.  Before or after dinner, you can also enjoy a bit of live music (tonight featured a pianist)-- loved the aeronautic-themed chairs!  Enough on the atmosphere, let's get onto the food!For Restaurant Week, Orange Sky's $39 menu featured:APPETIZER:Lobster bisque; Half-dozen of iced oysters; OS dinner salad.MAIN COURSE:Filet of beef; Grilled half-chicken; Herb-crusted Pacific yellowtail tuna.DESSERT:Chocolate dome; Lemon semolina cake; Choice of gelato or  sorbet.If I didn't have food allergies to worry about, I would've chosen the oysters to start; the tuna for the main, and the lemon cake to finish.  Instead, I ordered the salad, the filet, and the crowd-pleaser chocolate dome, and what a wonderful meal they made!!  The salad was comprised of greens and spicy candied walnuts dressed in a roquefort-sherry vinaigrette, and sprinkled w/ a few dashes of toasted shallot ribbons.  The sherry vinaigrette gave the salad a lovely, smooth, and mild flavor.  That is, until I'd bite into a roquefort crumble, which lent a welcomed burst of tang and pungency!  The combination of candied walnuts, roquefort, sherry, and shallots might not be for everybody, but I loved it- a great way to stir up my appetite!The twin tournedos of beef filet were truly remarkable!  Cooked to medium, the filet was lovely to behold, and even more delightful to eat- the sauce choron, a bearnaise variation, that supplemented the dish made for a perfect pairing!  The steaks also came w/ two roasted sweet peppers, a few asparagus spears (a few I found were slightly overdone, but still very good), and silky mashed potatoes.  (I personally like a bit of texture in mashed potatoes, so I was very happy to find that this specimen wasn't TOO silky.  Alone, it was a tasty side, but after tasting the meat, the potatoes could've used a bit more seasoning.  However, I feel it's better to have to add more seasoning after than to have too much and not be able to enjoy a dish at all!)  I really appreciated that the steaks were presented twin-style instead of one whole-- I was able to enjoy a small serving and still have some room for dessert!And oh, what a great dessert I had!  Drum roll please... The chocolate dome, made in-house, presented w/ two blackberries and a glaze of white chocolate and bitter orange.  The dome itself was a "hard shell"  of chocolate ganache (it really wasn't hard at all, and I personally would've appreciated the "break" of a chocolate bar here), sprinkled w/ almond brittle, and inside lay exquisite mantles of chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which sat on top of a chocolate cookie!  While the dessert looked very rich and decadent, it was surprisingly light (I had three glorious bites before putting it aside to move onto the gelato).  I definitely wanted to take some of this cake to enjoy later at home ;)  The gelato, while not made in-house (or so the server believed), was equally satisfying- the coffee flavor was quite delicate-- this was a scoop to be savored ever-so-slowly, like a favorite spirit to be sipped over time, and not chased down.  I also had a cup of Peet's coffee to go along w/ dessert.I waited a very long time to experience Orange Sky, and what a remarkable evening I had!  I will be back very, very soon!p.s.  Small details, such as pretty dinnerware and embedded crystals in silverware (although I noted fingerprint smudges all over- tsk, tsk!), friendly and courteous service, and the lovely upgrades to the fixtures and decor really added to my overall satisfaction w/ my OS experience.  I would suggest everyone try Orange Sky at least once, but make sure you arrange yours w/ a sunset reservation!  (Unless, of course, you quite enjoy looking at the tops of brightly lit parking lots!)p.p.s  Recall those private dining booths I mentioned?  They're certainly worth checking out if you value some privacy-- the tables all face panoramic views and certainly keep prying eyes from seeing who are seated.  [The only giveaway to the tables' occupancy was the pockets of barely discernible conversation my ears picked up as I walked by.  Visual inspection of the tables would have you believe that the booths were empty.Had a few drinks at the bar....what an amazing view of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  The night I was there, a piano player was playing jazz standards and some cover songs.....excellent Wine selection and the house Zinfandel was superb!The bartenders here are very friendly and accommodating.  I can't wait to come back here with my Better Half to give dinner a try.Return Factor - 95%I'm giving Orange Sky a solid four stars for a great experience. It's not my favorite restaurant in town, but it definitely one that impressed me beyond belief! I visited Orange Sky months back when Talking Stick first opened and explored the restaurant sans guests, so I knew what I was walking into. However, I must say that it was even better the second time I went! Time was running out to participate in Restaurant Week so we looked at the list of restaurants and decided that this was the perfect chance to try Orange Sky. Luckily we made reservations because when we arrived, they said that it was full until 9 PM (this was at 7). Upon arrival at the hostess stand at the bottom floor, I noticed that they have a really strict dress code: no t-shirts, cut-offs, flip flops, shorts, and some others that I can't remember. Once they checked our reservation, we got into the elevator and I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the walls is glass, allowing us to look out on the desert as we zipped up. We arrived on the 15th floor and walked out into a lively lounge equipped with patios, plenty of seating and even a pianist singing classic tunes. The restaurant itself is intimate and very much like a restaurant you would find in a large city. Glass windows line the restaurant and they have plenty of private seating. They have rooms to the right that seat roughly 15-20 people, including a wine rack room. To the left, they have private niches that seat between 4-6 people with windows looking out on the skyline. The main section of the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables as well as other tables along the windows. Then the rooftop patio has couch seating as well as regular tables. They even offer light-up menus since it's dark. The patio would be a wonderful place to sit and grab drinks and food and they even have a staircase that goes directly down into the club on the 14th floor. Moving on to the food, it was pretty good. I started with the Artichoke bisque, followed by the game hen and ended the meal with a chocolate tarte. Everything was tasty. A couple things I noticed that stood out was when I asked our waitress what appetizer she suggested off of the prix fix menu, she said she didn't like one and hadn't tried the other and really did a pretty poor job of selling any of the items. I opted for the bisque without high expectations and it was a lot better then she sold it to be! Then for the wine, another waiter came by and asked us if we wanted refills on our cocktails. My bf opted for another beer and said so but I still had a half of glass of wine so didn't order another one. The second beer shows up and the next thing I know the waiter is pouring wine into my glass. I stopped him and said I didn't order a glass of wine and he said he thought he heard me say I did. I said I hadn't and at this point it was too late because the wine was already poured in. However, the waiter was very nice and since I hadn't asked for the wine, they didn't end up charging us for it. In summary, I like Orange Sky and this is definitely a great option for date night, if you have visitors in town, or if you are staying at the casino. It's worth it to go for the ambiance alone.This restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the casino. There is a dress code warning including no flip flops, t-shirts, shorts or cut offs which helps to keep the casino riff raff out. There are glass widows lining the restaurant  with tables and booths placed all around them. The mountain and desert views are spectacular and the overall ambiance is classy and captivating. The food was excellent although a bit overpriced. I had the tenderloin flatbread , the steak was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. The Tuscan kale salad and the fried green tomatoes were also delicious choices prepared with care. I agree with another reviewer who said the wine list pricing was all over the place, luckily the selection made up for the scattered pricing. The bartender we had was personable and friendly and made our visit quite enjoyable.Overall I don't think I would make dinner reservations here, but it is a nice place to grab an app and a glass of wine and take in the stunning views of our beautiful desert city.The service is impeccable here. I still love coming here for special occasions because the night is so relaxing and I know the food will be executed flawlessly. That's why I was excited to start the new year's day 2013 with my family. I stepped out of my routine of ordering a Malbec or temperanillo with my meal, and ventured to ordering an Old Fashioned. They do it well here! I'm almost thinking about making the picture I took of it my phone wallpaper because I always want to remember it! My family ordered oysters to start as always. One of the oysters I chomped into contained a special surprise... A pearl! Don't worry, I didn't break a tooth or anything, but it definitely surprised me when I was chewing and thought, "Wow, this is a huge piece of grit in my oyster," and was shocked to find a small pearl! I guess that doesn't always happen, but I will look for another when I eat oysters so I can make earrings or something!My twin beef tournedos (mini twin filets) was just as amazing as always paired with the Bernaise sauce. I actually split it this time with my friend so we could try their special for the night... A chilean sea bass sitting on lobster cakes topped with an Asian glaze type sauce. Usually I love sushi, so cooked fish seldom impresses me, but this sea bass was incredible, especialyl mixed with lobster cakes. Who wants crab cakes, when you can have awesome lobster cakes, right??
Bar North=Ripoff Report - Proceed with caution!A group of us came here for happy hour last night to celebrate a coworker's departure. Our office is located in Kierland, so we chose Bar North as it's within walking distance, they have a nice patio, and have provided great service in the past. The service was friendly and very accommodating to our large group, but we left feeling bamboozled! Four of us in the group ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We were about 3/4ths of the way through the first pitcher, when another pitcher had been served to our table. None of us had wanted another pitcher, but started to drink it anyway as we all thought that someone else at the table had ordered a second one. There were about 12 people at our table so, it was hard to know who ordered what. We all asked each other "who ordered the second pitcher?" The answer was no one ordered the second pitcher, the server just served us a second one without asking, and added it to our tab. We felt that we couldn't dispute the check since we started to drink out of the second pitcher, even though we barely touched it as we all had to drive ourselves home that night.To make matters worse, one of the woman in our group had ordered a glass of Chardonnay not knowing that there were several options on the menu. Instead of asking her which one she would like, they served her the most expensive one at $14 for one glass. If you have several different kinds of Chardonnay, why wouldn't they ask the patron which one they wanted? Instead they just took this as an opportunity to up-sell.There are several options in Kierland for Happy Hour without shady service, that is where we'll be going next time as Bar North left us all with a feeling of being taken advantage of.
Rising Sun=Came to Rising Sun sushi restaurant on E. Flamingo Rd (across from Tuscany casino) for a recent UYE.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, plays a fantastic playlist of music, and is really clean.One of the main selling points of this sushi spot is their Happy Hour (in addition to their regular menu, they offer a limited HH menu of food and drinks). They actually have two of them (5pm-8pm and 10pm-midnight, excluding holidays).  Another for out of town visitors staying at nearby casinos and resorts is its proximity to the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.Personal highlights of the food I tried are:Miso Yummy Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber inside and topped with salmon and miso dressing) being one of my favorite.  Cherry Popper Roll is good too.  If you like California Roll and tuna plus a little spicy orange sauce, then you will like this.Their Japanese Chicken Meatball served yakitori style is a nice salty appetizer, and I think everyone at the table enjoyed it.  Hangover Roll is an interesting one. It has hot link sausage, avocado and cream cheese wrapped in bacon then tempura fried, with sprinkles of parmesan cheese, scallions and drizzles wasabi mayo.  I am glad I tried it, but will probably save room for something else in future visits.Wild Salmon Sashimi was good. It is not the traditional sashimi (just slices of fresh fish) served in Japan, but new style sashimi made popular by Nobu.If I was rating the restaurant solely based on food, creativity and taste of the rolls, service and ambiance it will get 4 stars.  But factoring in the overall price/value, I would have to only rate it 3 stars.  The main reason being that nigiri is not part of the HH menu, and at regular price is more than most off-Strip non-AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.3 stars (A-OK).
Mom's Good Eats=stopped in here today after picking up an order from the wonderful retro bakery. this place is right next door and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for a snack. we walk in to this cozy little place to one woman working. she was nice and helpful and after minutes on debating on what to get we decided on the 4 piece chicken tender with a side of sweet potato french fries. total was a little over 8 dollars. she said it would be about an 8 minute wait so we sat on some chairs up against the wall. now be forewarned there are no tables in this little eatery so make sure you know the food is to go. while waiting Dan and I were deciding where to eat this made to order little snack. We opted for a picnic in his car. (hey...we had to make it work!) After a few minutes of waiting and examining the menu some more for next time we got our little goodie bag. we took it to the car and opened the box of wings to a hot and spicy with a pinch of sweetness smell. we just looked at each other and couldn't wait to dig in. (oh btw we got the mom's special spicy sweet sauce.) we took some bites of the sweet potato fries. they were really good. the chicken was very fresh, juicy, and pure white on the inside. biting into these tenders was a little bite of heaven. ok maybe a little dieters sin, but so worth it. the sauce had so much flavor to it and it felt like these littler sinners were melting in my mouth. the little hint of spice lingered in my mouth for a few good moments. i wish we ordered more! Next time I go back I already decided to get an order of the jalapeno mac and cheese.I am only deducting a star for not having table and chairs for people to eat. My boyfriend and I decided next time we come back up here we will order this food and have a picnic over at floyd lamb state park. If you don't live in the area that would be a good (and cutesy!) option rather than driving it half an hour back to henderson. You could also do like we did and just picnic in the car. just be prepared for messy, sticky fingers and have lots of napkins handy!I gave Mom's Good Eats my first try the other day when me and my girlfriend were next door picking up an order at Retro. It's a small hole in the wall joint with no seating but something was calling our name. Good thing we went in and checked it out because it was a good find. Though I must admit we were both very skeptical at first going into a place with no seating and being that we've never eaten there we had no clue what to expect. We ended up ordering Chicken Tenders smothered in moms Sweet & Spicy Sauce with Sweet potato fries. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and the Kitchen was in plain view so you know your food is made to order. We received our food and proceeded to my car for a "Picnic" lol. As soon as we opened the box my sinuses immediately clear up and I couldn't wait to dig in. Chicken Fingers are one of those foods that are hard to mess up but you can really tell when a place does it well. Crispy enough on the outside with hot & moist white meat on the inside. Mom's special sauce was awesome! not too sweet not too spicy : )As for the sweet potato's; they were absolutely to die for! I still have some places to try in town before I can say they're the best I've had but they're up there for sure! They also had some interesting stuff on there menu that I would like to try next time they stop in like Jalapeno Mac & Cheese, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, Etc. If I didn't live all the way across town this would be the perfect place for when you're on your way home and just want something tasty because you don't feel like cooking kind of nights ; ) I'm giving Mom's Good Eats 4 stars on strength of flavor and reasonable prices. Definitely worth a try!
Goldfinger's Bar & Grille=Sadly this place was a real disappointment. Bought a GrouponNOW! lunch special, went over had a decent tuna melt, and then went to pay with my Groupon and they said the decided not to honor it because to many people had bought them. So they expected me to pay for my lunch even while the deal was still up on Groupon and they were selling more of the deals. Sleazy Business, with run of the mill bar food. Not worth the effort ... Typical Las Vegas scammers...The only reason for the one star is because there is not an option for zero stars.  I have been here 3 times; the first time we ate breakfast on the restaurant side.   The food was decent, as was the service and price.  The second visit here and I thought I was in the twilight zone.  The bartender was incredibly rude and informed us that our conversation should not be able to be heard over the music that was playing.  I initially thought she was joking.  She wasn't.  We left and I chalked it up to perhaps she was having a bad day.  The next time I go in, she is there and walks past me at least 4 times before asking for my order.  I should add I was there around lunch time and there were only two other people in the bar so her service wasn't slow due to being busy; she was again very rude and quite frankly should not be in a customer service position.  I speak with the manager and he is no better. Evidently his father or grandfather owns the bar and he does not take customer complaints well. He became defensive and essentially told me I was wrong.So, I leave and through casual conversations with friends after the fact, find out that the same thing has happened to them or someone they know.  Needless to say I will not return to this establishment.
Mother India's Cafe=Mother India's was my first experience of non-British Indian food. You know what I mean. Indian is indian, but us Brits have a way of doing it that makes it distinctly British-Indian. Creamy kormas, and don't forget the vindaloo. Don't get me wrong, this sort of Indian is nice, but it's all a little repetitive.Mother India's Cafe serve up far more authentic Indian food, in tapas style portions, which means you can order 2 or 3 different dishes to share in all the flavours and textures. And this can only be a good thing.The curries are absolutely delicious, and a million miles away from the standard "chicken tikka masala". My personal favourites are the aubergine and potato curry, channa dahl, ginger and chilli chicken, lamb pasanda...in fact it's all pretty damned good.They also do a takeaway service (although no delivery) and it's something I make use of frequently. Rather handily with the takeaway you can order a 'large' portion which is bigger than the tapas portions you get with sitin.I've only done takeaway from here so far, and everytime the food has been hot, hot, hot (both tasty hot, spicy hot, and sexy hot. Yep you heard me.)My only recommendation? Try it.
City Market Deli & Catering=The Good: sandwiches are mostly very quality and are made quickly. Not crazy about the Tuna salad - too rich. Same goes for the Chicken salad sandwich. The beef sandwiches are really good. Not so good: they seem to have a high turnover rate for employees. The man who seems to be managing is more often than not engaged in loud conversations with vendors and other people. He is often arguing with people related to the Esplanade management. It does not create a pleasant ambience. I am fed up with this guy and will not be back.
Famous Dave's=So...I don't eat pork, but I do chow down on chicken and beef and that's what I was in the mood for. Hit up Famous D for some saucy chicken and beef. Ordered the Two Meat Combo with Chicken Tenders and the Smoked Sirloin Tri Tip as well as the Dave's Sassy BBQ salad. The salad was actually soild. It came with honey bbq sauce which I asked for on the side. Glad I did because it tasted boo-boo. I'm glad I asked for the ranch because it made the salad so much better. As for the Two Meat Combo, they got the order wrong. They brought out a bunch of pork and chicken tenders. They eventually brought out the tri-tip but there was a scant amount of sauce that came with it. The sauce was actually super good, but it seemed like they were in a rush to get the order out and it came out lacking. The chicken tenders were soft and crispy and the best part of the meal. Service was pretty good and they had flat screens everywhere so you can watch playoff basketball. And last but not least, if you want to watch Gilbert's finest - this is a 5 star place to people watch.
Narai Thai + Sushi=Oh my this is such a great little hidden gem of a place!! We came here today to enjoy their happy hour, we are always looking for good little happy hour spots to renew ourselves after not so joyous days, Woo-hoo!! :) Boy it WAS definitely Feliz (Happy) hour for us!!! :)        The mojitos were oh so Delicious and just $7/each. While the Cali and spicy tuna rolls were just $3.95/each!!!  Talk about YAY and WOW!!! But wait there is more, they also offer scrumptious shrimp tempura rolls for just $5.95, What a steal right??      WHY ask for more!! Well, okay we did too, so we had the Pad Thai, which was great with a load of yummy flavorful noodles and chicken along with a small portion of veggies, we also ordered their Chicken Yellow Curry, that was rich and creamy and ever so satisfying!!      This place is soooo AWESOME that they even have a scale of hotness for their plates 1-5, 5 being the hottest, PLUS for those whom prefer their food super hot and spicy they also have the Thai 7, which is their absolute hottest. I myself settled for a 4, and that surprisingly was hot enough, yet edible and just right for me!!  Even after consuming all of our food that we knew and felt was colossal, we experienced a HAPPY FULL and not a GREASY FATTY FULL. Finally, we had a great time and the service was FANTASTIC as well as the food!! We truly enjoyed ourselves here, the vibe was just right and the people there were ever so nice. You deserve a High-five!!                    - Narai, you will be seeing our hungry faces more often!!                                                 Thank you new friends!!! :)yummy! i had the yellow chicken curry lunch special, level 3 heat. not spicy at all so next time i'll try it at 4. it came with egg drop soup which was mediocre after adding soy sauce(so i guess it was only good after adding something to make it taste like something else therefore skip the soup), a salad, plus the entree and choice of rice. it was pretty inexpensive, like just under $9. good deal. it was tasty, fast, and clean. i'll be back!
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=The worst experience I have ever had... My boyfriend took me here a while back when we came to Vegas from Los Angeles to visit his parents (They live in Southern Highlands)... He kept saying how wonderful this place was so I was forced to try. We show up and immediately I felt tension in the air. Everything I asked about on the menu apparently wasn't available because: "The stove is turned off"... "We ran out of that bread"... "There isn't anymore meat"... I mean, I kid you not, he literally left us with nothing left to order except maybe 3 or 4 items which weren't at all appealing to either of us. Mind you, as we were asking them questions, both the manager and some kid kept smiling at each other like this was some joke. I told my boyfriend lets just go somewhere else, this isn't looking good anymore, he agreed. As we walked out, the manager called out to us "FAG**TS" and started laughing with his employee. This was by far the most disgusting place I have ever been. The employees were extremely inappropriate homophobes and the establishment itself was appalling. I pray someone shuts this place down.
