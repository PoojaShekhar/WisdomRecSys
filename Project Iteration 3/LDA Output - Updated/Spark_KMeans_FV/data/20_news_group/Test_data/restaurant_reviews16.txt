Review Text :
This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.  Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs. They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers. Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually. Had about 10 different choices... I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough. Very good no complaints at all. It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had.They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware. OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit. Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.I say get down here and try it out.Mom and Pop place a little off the beaten path in downtown Chandler. That really sums it up. The restaurant is located in an old house so you really do feel like you are sitting at someone's kitchen table having coffee. We went in for a late breakfast on Saturday am. I had a Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and the hubby had the steak skillet. Food was A-ok. Good coffee and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper since they were not busy at all. The server was a little awkward but his mom explained that it was his first day working the front of the house. Remember what I said about Mom and Pop? I can't say this was the best meal I've had but it was pretty good and we will definitely be back simply because all the other breakfast places we like just have such a long wait on the weekends. Also was an interesting visit since I never knew this shopping plaza existed even though we come to the main part of downtown Chandler regularly. Two of the shops were out of business so I guess I am not alone. I am going to write some reviews of the stores that are still open so stay tuned for that.... ;0)Yoli's is easily in my top favorite breakfast restaurants. I usually go with my gf Saturday or Sunday mornings and get the mix and match. You can pick from several items and I usually get the standard egg, sausage, has browns with one pancake. And, this pancake is just about perfect. It's big, fluffy and cooked to a light and slightly crispy golden brown. You don't even have to use syrup. Recently, I tried the Morning Monte which I am definitely getting next time. The flavor is exquisite. Just about everything on the menu is worth ordering.The restaurant is tucked away in a garden oasis in downtown Chandler. We wouldn't have found it except for all the popular Yelp reviews. They have a good amount of outdoor seating nearby a quaint arrangement of flowers, plants and birdcages that house several exotic and colorful birds. It's worth going just to check out those lil guys. The only downside is that the kitchen is small, so when the brunch rush hits, it can take a while. But Yoli and her staff are so friendly and pretty honest about the wait. We grab coffee and sit it out. Trust me, it's worth it!I must confess that I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I haven't sat down to a real breakfast in approximately eleven years.  I have never been one to just roll out of bed and go, "Pancakes sound amazebeans!"  Had I been served some Yoli's Hawaiian french toast in my younger years, that might have changed my mindset in my adulthood.A few days ago, that pesky rascal named Brett B. texted me to rally up the Lunch Bunch for some Yoli's Cafe.  I must live in a cave because I never heard of the place.  After some strategic texting back-and-forth where a group-text probably would have been a wiser choice, it was set that we were going to meet up for brunch.  Being the OCD individual I am, I spent the next few days scouting the online menu and creeping on Yelper pictures of the joint.  Time-jump to yesterday, Friday at 11:30am.  Finding this place was slightly tricky and locating a parking spot was even trickier!  Nonetheless, we all arrived on time and sat down to be served by the most amusing and friendly waitress ever.  She's so friendly, outgoing, and personable.  I wanted to put her in my pocket!  This lady's a hoot!  I ordered a Mornin' Monte after being told the difference between that and the Monte Cristo [one has egg whites in place of ham].  Best decision ever.  There was turkey, crispy bacon, egg whites, and Havarti cheese sandwiched in between the most perfectly grilled Hawaiian french toast with spicy orange marmalade and syrup on the side.  Although it's french toast, I opted not drowning my french toast with the syrup.  It would be much too sweet and strong on top of all that powdered sugar goodness.  Instead, I had spread a modest layer of spicy orange marmalade onto every bite.  It was bliss.  The lovely Ms. Yoli saw me sharing with my lunch companions and gave me an extra marmalade.  Totally sweet of her!  I ended up taking half my sandwich home which I tucked away a few hours later straight out of the fridge.  Still delicious, still amazing.So now I sit here daydreaming of a delicious Mornin' Monte for breakfast and wishing I could eat it every day.  Of course, I'd probably end up packing on the pounds but hey, who needs vanity when you can have Monte?*** Featured in The Weekly Yelp, December 17, 2014 - The Breakfast Club

Went for lunch today with Rand H and Mike C just as they were opening for the very first time.  I am far from being a buffet expert, but this was nothing like the Chinese buffets I had been to back in Chicago.  As Rand said, there were over 130 items, including a Mongolian BBQ, a sushi bar, as well as a good variety of Chinese and American foods.  Everything I tasted was excellent with good flavor and high quality.  There is something for everyone here and at 7.95 for a lunch time buffet, it's definitely a bargain.  I will be back!

I was starving and sick from a bad sinus infection... My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.

We went on a nice drive out to Red Rock Casino and decided to hit up the HH at the Yard House.  I started off with a Victory IPA and the buffalo chicken wings.  We then proceeded to try some lettuce wraps, chicken pizza, poke stack, spinach dip and the seared ahi.  Everything was excellent, especially the lettuce wraps and the poke stack.  Next beer on the list was a Boulder Beer chocolate porter on nitro.  Smooth, delicious and very creamy.  I remember drinking Boulder Beer way back when and I always thought their beers were very tasty, and this was no exception.  The service at the bar was excellent and our bartender was on her game (I believe her name was Aimee) and very attentive to our needs. We will definitely stop back in to try a few more beers and try some of the tasty appetizers that we missed.

Restaurant name  786 Halal Restaurant

Review Text :
Most people just lump Indian food into one group and think it represents the entire subcontinent as a whole.Folks, it's a subcontinent. Like Europe or South America, just as there are huge regional differences in the cuisine of even smaller countries like France or Italy, there are just as wide and divergent diffrences in food from Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Goan, Punjabi, Bengali, Assamese, Keralese, Tamil, Pakistani, Lahori, Nepalese, Tibetan, Sri Lankan, Bhutanese, Old Delhi, Karachi, Marathi, and Baluchi areas reflecting the history, ethnicity and geography of these places and peoples. Perhaps restauranteurs from these countries are also partially to blame for not offering the richness of their cuisine on a wider scale when instead they just dumb down and offer the "generic" Indian restaurant menu, but I digress.786 Halal Restaurant is located at 768 Jean Talon West. No, the owners and sign makers weren't dyslexic. 786 is the numerological value for the opening verses of the Koran. And Halal obviously means they serve only Halal meat here, meat which has been properly (ahem) killed, blessed and prepared, much like kosher meat in the Jewish tradition. They do not serve alcohol here since it's an establishment that likes to keep it close to it's Islamic roots, as evidenced by the donation box by the cash register for the local mosque as well as the family tables set aside near the front. Hindus are vegetarians but Muslims eat meat, so vegetarians, beware, go to Pushap instead. 786 Halal does have a pretty large vegetable menu so no worries if you do find yourself here with omnivorous  friends.Simply put, the food here is amazing!No wonder they opened a second franchise in Toronto which apparently has line-ups around the block. Lahori food is known for it's marinated, spiced up grilled meats. (think of it as BBQ Pakistani style) and the specialty here is definitely the Lahori Deep Fried fish and BBQ Chicken. Come here on a Friday (The Islamic holy day of the week) and you can order the Haleem, a mish mash of meat, lentils and wheat which is like a thick stew.The desserts are alright, not the best, but passable. The one dessert I do recommend is the Gajar ka halwa, which is a carrot pudding, sounds strange, but trust me, it's great!I came here for lunch today and it was a packed house, so I ordered to go and went to a local park and enjoyed lunch out in the sun, but I'm definitely coming back when it's quieter.

Review Text :
REALLLLLLY!!!! Finally!  Japanese style crepes in Vegas?!?!?For those of you who are so loveable that you have read my reviews in other states, you know I have a thing for hand held crepes.  My favorite place is Sophie's in San Francisco's Japantown, a place I went daily on my most recent Bay Area vacation (I posted a pic with my review of my eating the coveted green tea ice cream red bean paste matcha sauce crepe).  Then last summer in Seattle, I made my co-vacationers go to a mall just so I could try Unicone.Needless to say, I had no idea based on the picture on yelp that the crepes would be hand held.  I just went because I knew it would at least smell good in a place that makes crepes and waffles!  Heading in there today, I learned that Crepe Shack opened 3 days ago.  Owner Li is a young entrepreneur with a big colorful space and lots of restaurant experience.  We talked at length about the business idea, his support of other new businesses and food trucks, and sushi (because we all love it mmm).He is working out supplier issues so more toppings and ice cream flavors are to come, but for now, there is still a great selection.  I enjoyed a crepe with fresh strawberries and kiwi, shredded coconut, and almonds.  It was a really good treat, sweet and tasted healthy.  Li told me the batter is meant to taste fortune-cookie-esque, and it did.  This is a really fun place for a "healthy sweet tooth" craving.  If you track me down at the Yelp Seats kickoff on Tuesday, Li gave me a stack of 15% off cards that I can hand out!  Bon appetit!I've wanted to try Japanese-style crepes for a while after learning about their existence through reviews on Yelp LA (Yes, I like to peruse the eats of other cities...). Sadly, Vegas is slow on food trends...forcing me to look at pictures (like this http://bit.ly/h42u9L and this http://bit.ly/ftAs5D) of these crepes to satisfy my craving. Just in the nick of time before I was about to attempt to create my own Japanese crepe in my kitchen, Crepe Shack & Waffles popped up in my neighborhood next to my beloved Trader Joe's. And reading all the fabulous reviews, I knew I had to make a visit to this shop ASAP. With friend by my side, I visited Crepe Shack & Waffles for a sweet dinner treat. The place is super clean and roomy with high ceilings, colorful walls & a minimalist feel. Perfectly designed to cater to the rush of high school students who come by this place after school and during the night to hang out. Plus 1 for free wi-fi! Upon walking in, we were greeted by one of the workers who explained how the menu and ordering process worked. My friend and I both decided to order from the Specialty menu rather than the DIY menu, as the Specialty Crepes are a much better deal in terms of price. I chose the Tickle Me Berry (Strawberry, Raspberry & Blueberry) Specialty Crepe w/ Green Tea ice cream and no whipped cream, and w/ my Yelp discount I paid less than $5 for this wonderful cone of yumminess. Owner Li and I started talking about his business, Yelp & such, while he was making my crepe. He told me that he wanted to make his crepe batter reminiscent in flavor to a fortune cookie with the addition of more vanilla,  compared to regular crepes which are more eggy in taste. Great decision! I'd much rather taste more vanilla than more egg. Anyways, after Li added fresh strawberries, blueberries & YELLOW raspberries (!) and a scoop of ice cream into my crepe, he rolled it up in a cone and handed me this piece of food art. Being a Japanese-crepe newbie, I thought the crepe was meant to be eaten w/ a fork at first, but then I realized "utensils not required" as it's meant to be eaten like how you would eat an ice cream cone. I took my first bite and was impressed. The crepe itself was thin, soft, airy & slightly chewy all at the same time. The flavor of the crepe was sweet but not too sweet, the berries were fresh (I wanted more berries...) & the ice cream was just the right amount of sweetness. All these elements harmonized well with each other, resulting in a concoction that left my sweet tooth satisfied and not aching. I felt less guilty about eating this somehow. My favorite part of the crepe was the last bites before it disappeared, as the slightly melted ice cream combined w/ the remaining fruit and the crepe made for the last perfect bites. I'll be back again with friends in the near future. Not just for the yummy crepes but for the friendly service as well. I hope this place sticks around for a while.We were in the area and I was feeling on a snack and saw some of my Yelp friends check into the Crepe Shack so I decided to get crepe-y and be creepy. I didn't find my friends, but I found some treats to fill in the need for a afternoon snack. I got the East Meets West: red bean, mochi bits, condensed milk and green tea ice cream. I forgot how messy Japanese crepes was, but it was fun eating it. The flavors all went really well together and the crepe was good. It's a little less crisp than some of the crepe places I like (like Sophies in SFO), but good flavor and chewy.The BF is more of a waffle person so he got a Bananas Foster: bananas, cinnamon powder, caramel, whip cream, ice cream. It was good toppings, but since they are using the crepe batter the texture is less than ideal. It was dense and wasn't crispy enough. The BF thinks next time he will order a crepe instead since that wasn't what he looks for in a waffle. The staff is really friendly. The owner was the one who rang us up and saw my Yelp check-in offer and asked about how often I used it, asked what I thought of the crepe, etc. Seems like the type of owner who is responsive to customers feedback. They're fairly new, but it seems they are getting into a groove.We live way across town, but definitely a place I can see myself stopping by again when we're in the area.Holy crepe! I love this place. So much so that I went two days in a row. The crepes are delicious, the people are cool, and the crepes are delicious!I didn't really know what "Japanese Crepe" meant, but I am all in. They explained that the batter is less eggy and this results in a crepe that kind of tastes like a fortune cookie. I'd have to agree. On my first visit, I went with the Strawberry Sensation (strawberries/cheesecake/strawberry syrup) with strawberry ice cream. Yum! The next day, I went with the Rebel Special (strawberry/banana/nutella) with green tea ice cream. This combination didn't match the previous day, but it was still good. The crepe is rolled into what resembles an ice cream cone. So with the scoop of ice cream in there, it basically feels like you are eating an ice cream cone.Make sure you check in on your Yelp app to get 10% off your crepe. Make sure to also get your punch card to get your tenth one free. I usually don't fill up punch cards, but I can see this place getting repeat visits from me, despite how far south it is located.I haven't tried their waffles and I probably never will. But for a delicious crepe snack/dessert, five stars all the way!Dear Lord...I was lost and then I was found after having the Camp Out S'more Japanese Crepe. The marshmallows, graham cracker crumbs, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream were like a dessert nirvana. It was quite crowded when we went at 1:30pm....the local school was getting out. I was impressed how quickly the staff worked and we had our crepes within 7 min...which is a perfectly acceptable wait time in my mind. Also...I must commend the kids...they were all well behaved and very respectful...nice to see. Will be back VERY soon for the Camp Out S'more.So, after a very large meal at Monstah Lobstah, I felt like my sweet to savory ratio was a little off. I remembered that this place was in the area and I've been dying to try it, so we stopped in for a little dessert.My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert. About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry. All in all, great little dessert spot. I'd come back if I'm in the area.I picked this place for one of my last hurrah treats before summer dieting begins. Oh to be a naturally thin person so I could eat here every day (ok I'd settle for once a week!). We tried a waffle and a crepe. Both were wonderful. We customized them to our own tastes (I got bananas, oreos, caramel and vanilla ice cream in a crepe and the husband got birthday cake ice cream and brownies on a waffle). Both were cooked to order and utterly delicious. Yay for birthday cake ice cream, tons of beautiful fresh fruit, and a nice mixture of conventional and creative toppings. The owners were friendly and service was quick. I will be back once my bikini days are behind me !Crepes.....I LOVE crepes. Now this is a different kind of crepe that I've never had before. Japanese style crepes are a "fortune cookie" flavored crepe. We came here on a Sunday and it was pouring! Rain won't stop us foodies! Since we were full from a 4th of July party we decided to share one crepe which proved to be more than enough for the two of us. I ordered the Rebel Special without ice cream, which meant that I got more fruit. I really liked the crepe itself without all the filling.....which you can actually order! Next time I'll order my own crepe with the fillings that I want. A pretty cool concept and pretty good dessert.Excellent batter makes excellent crepes. These guys really do a great job of making crispy crepes and filling them with fresh fruit and other goodness. I really enjoyed the Bananas Foster and the East Meets West. Definitely add strawberries to the East Meets West. It's so yummy! Definitely will be back for more... too bad I don't live on this side of town... sigh...This place was just OK.  My Japanese wife and I would've preferred our crepes a little more on the well done side.  No burn marks or toastiness at all, too soft and spongey.  Japanese crepe places also offer more than just desserts too.  Maybe a BLT crepe to pump up the business around dinner time?  Great selection of dessert choices as it is essentially the Yogurtland of creperies but the taste just isn't worth schlepping it over to Henderson for.After having a savory crepe at Suzuya, when I got home, my tummy was telling me "Mike, it's time.. for a sweet one". I thought to myself, "Where is a place close to my house that sells crepes?" And I remembered, CS&W. I jumped in my car, and went here ASAP!!CS&W is located on Eastern, past Horizon Ridge, in the same complex as Trader Joe's and Sears. It's a new place that has been opened for less than 2 years and has been getting rave reviews on yelp.Inside, the store is clean, really clean. It has a modern vibe, furthermore, it is bright and airy. The staff is very friendly, professional, but very approachable. After ordering, I sat down and waited. After about a few minutes, they brought my order to me.Rebel Special Crepe - Strawberries, Nutella, Bananas. I added the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The crepe is more chewier than the ones at Suzuya or Crepe Expectations. It tasted O.K., just o.k. The nutella sauce they used was amazing. The bananas tasted good too. The whipped cream and Thrifty brand ice cream were very good. But, I do have a couple gripes. Now, I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts. But, IMO, this could have used some more sweetness. Also, the strawberries had little flavor. Maybe if they used Harry's berries, it could have been better. The crepe was a 3.Classic Waffle - Nutella, Bananas, Toasted Almonds. This time I added whipped cream and Thrifty's Cookies and Cream Ice cream. They also put a side of pancake syrup in a small container for me. For my personal preference, I'm not really into soft waffles. But, even though it was soft, the waffle had really good flavor. The nutella sauce, bananas, ice cream, almonds, and whipped cream were very good. What really elevated the waffle was the pancake syrup. It provided the right amount of sweetness for this dish, and it tied all the flavors together. Without the syrup, like the crepe, it wouldn't have been sweet enough. A big 4 to 4.5 for this one.I spent about 5 to 6 dollars for each item, it's a very good deal. I would recommend the waffle over the crepe, and I do urge you to get the pancake syrup and pour it on top before you eat it. That's my story and i'm sticking to it. Good day, sir.I rarely get cravings for sweets, but when I do this is the place to go to fulfill them.Who doesn't love crepes? The softness of the pancake in relation with the ice cream, whip cream and fruits is enough to make me die and go to heaven. They have so many toppings and flavors! Not to mention, if you're a fan of Thrifty's Ice Cream - that's the type they serve here. My go to is ALWAYS the rebel special which consist of strawberry, banana, and nutella. I opt for vanilla flavor though since I don't want anything to overpower the deliciousness that nutella has to offer. PLUS! Nutella and vanilla is a classic pairing that you can't go wrong with.The place itself is very modern, clean, and spacious. There's even some board games customers can play to kill time while hanging out. If I was still in high school and lived in this area.. I would use this place as a meet-up spot or something.As long as I continue to work in Henderson or whenever I'm in the area and craving something sweet (which like I stated is rare) - Crepe Shack here I come!After looking at the pictures of their delicious creations, I had to check it out for myself.  Before this, I've only had the traditional crepes that are rolled with sauce and toppings drizzled over it.   Here they have Japanese crepes.   It is filled with the dessert toppings and scoop of ice cream of your choice.  They have many options with pre-determined filling.  It's great for people like me who can't make a decision.   The crepes and waffles are made there when you order.  I chose the banana cheese pie crepe filled with cheesecake, white chocolate sauce, bananas, graham crackers and whipped cream.  Can I get a hell yeah?! I went with vanilla ice cream so it wouldn't take away from the others toppings.  The crepe itself is formed into a waffle cone shape to hold all of the goodness.  I loved it! It's different and fulfills my sugar craving.  A friend of mine ordered a dessert waffle.  Honestly it was just ok.  I'd choose the crepe over that.   Service was great.  Both gentlemen were very helpful and friendly.  They made our first visit a delight! I am happy to add this to my dessert list!Waffles, waffles, waffles! Absolutely addictive! My family and I were only staying in the area for a couple of weeks and we were here almost every day. Every time we visited, the place was very clean and the staff- very friendly. Whether it was crepes and ice cream, waffles and ice cream, scoops of ice cream, or a yogurt parfait, there was satisfaction in every bite! I first had the East Meets West waffle which came with red bean paste, mochi bites, condensed milk, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of green tea ice cream. First of all, it looked incredible, then it tasted so dreamy. Another time, I had the Rebel Special waffle with bananas, strawberries, Nutella, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of black cherry ice cream. This was a real classic, on steroids!!! Their yogurt parfaits have just the right balance of sweet and sour with a whole lotta freshness while their cone crepes are made super thin as the perfect vessel for ice cream and other heavenly goodness.

Review Text :
I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege.So my best friend in the whole world (and another Yelper) was born on New Year's Day, and her daughter was also born the same day.  (What are the odds??)   They wanted an intimate get together to celebrate both of their recent birthdays and this restaurant was their choice.   Okay, no point in beating around the bush...I'll just come right out and say it; our waitress was friggen awful.  She left us high and dry for several minutes at a time and she completely forgot to bring me a high chair.  Finally after waiting for about 30 minutes for her to remember to bring me a high chair, another diner at our table went and found one since I was having trouble keeping my wiggly daughter sitting on my lap.  And I could make a big deal about the fact that we were seated for probably 30 minutes before she even took our orders, and probably about 25 more minutes before they brought us our appetizers, and that she never even once asked if we wanted to see a drink menu and I finally had to ask if they even offered cocktails and that finally prompted her to produce a drink menu about 20 minutes and another request later (20 minutes, I'm not kidding).  Since my husband doesn't drink and is my permanent designated driver, and we were celebrating, I got a pineapple mojito, minus the pineapple.  No, I didn't order my pineapple mojito without the pineapple, it just came that way.  So it was just a mojito flavored mojito.  Now, to be fair it was still a damn tasty mojito, but I don't think it had passed within 22' feet of a pineapple, EVER.  I'm just saying.'  Our waitress obviously didn't notice that when she got our order from the bartender either.  I just have to repeat it; she really isn't very good at what she does.  I'm sorry, I know that is harsh.  And despite the fact that I was in a party of three (yes, I knew the other diners, but we were all on separate checks) I still got hit with an automatic 18% gratuity for a large party.  WTF?  Really?! Ugh...   But then let's talk about the food.  When they finally decided to serve us food it was a mixed experience.  My baby daughter got a tempura plate and I think she really enjoyed it.  She ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed dipping her fried shrimp and veggies in the dipping sauce.  I tasted her food and it wasn't bad at all.  And the mushroom soup that comes as an appetizer with the teppan entrees is delicious.  I mean really, really good.  I don't know how they prepare it, but it was staggeringly good and I would've consumed a gallon of that stuff.  Also, the salad with orange ginger dressing was very cold and crisp and delicious too.  For dinner my husband ordered the vegetarian teppan and I ordered the combo teppan dinner with scallops and sirloin steak.  (Side note: I love scallops, but the last 3 times I had them prepared in a restaurant I had gotten violently ill.  I knew I was taking my chances with getting another bad batch, but I wanted scallops again so bad I decided to roll the dice.)  The good news?  I didn't get sick afterwards, these scallops were very fresh.  The bad news?  They were so fresh that they still had fresh little pieces of sand embedded all throughout them.  You never want to bite into a scallop and hear a crunch:  EVER.   Also my food was horribly over salted, and I do mean horribly.   I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to salt, but this was too much salt, even for me.Also, my scallops were done cooking a full 15 minutes before my medium rare steak was done.  That kinda sucked as they could have easily been timed better by the chef.  Our chef was very friendly.  The fried rice that comes as a side with the teppan dinner was pretty good, but nowhere near as garlic-buttery-tastic and delicious as the chicken fried rice served at another unnamed teppan place that I routinely go to in Tempe...The damage for our whole dinner and my drink was about $70, so it wasn't too bad in the grand scheme of fresh prepared teppan dinners.  I just wish the service had been better and the scallops hadn't been full of sand. But you know what's most important? That my best friend and niece had a great birthday party.  And at the end of the night, despite the hiccups with the food and service, I think they did have a good time.  And THAT is *still* what matters most to me.PS:  Sandy scallops=YUCK!Terrible experience. Horrible service. I know it's New Years Eve, and we had a reservation for 8:00pm. We were sat at 8:05. It's now 9:35 and we have only received our drinks. Other tables that were seated after us are eating. The manager came over and said there was a miscommunication between the hostess and the server and then he walked away. Bullshit! I'll never return here again. If I knew we could eat at another restaurant this evening, I'd walk out. POOR MANAGEMENT.UPDATE: After 2 hours, and not even a second round of drinks, we DID walk out. Now eating at Chili's. Great service here.

Hidden Gem.She's an awesome spot to watch a game and throw back a few drinks. Decor is modernized.We came in here during the football season and they had an awesome special, 24oz (or more, can't remember) beer, chicken pesto sandwich & fries for $10!!! Sandwich is full of flavor and the beer is served in a goblet so the price is well worth it.Our bartender was great! Service was awesome, love this place!Had to update, since I actually tried some of the food on Saturday night!Tamara and Brian were great all night. I ordered with Tamara, and I got the seared ahi salad, with the sesame dressing on the side, and no wasabi aoli. (I'm watching my weight)It was really good.  The tuna could have been seasoned a bit...because it was rather bland, but...it satisfied my fish craving.  The dressing complemented everything really well, too. Also, I was drinking ice water, and after I downed my first class, Tamara gave me my own pitcher of ice water!  Perfect!They also offer $15 bottomless mimosas on Saturdays and Sundays.  SCORE!As a note to the service side too, some friends met me up there, and ordered a couple food items.  My girl friend got hers right away, but her husbands was nowhere to be found. He asked Tamara, and apparently the cook hadn't read the ticket correctly.  They rushed his order out, and took it off the bill, no questions asked.  That's pretty awesome, to make up for the mistake.  I'm really liking Brentwood more, every time I come out.  :)This place is in the middle of nowhere. Well actually I only say that because this side of town is pretty foreign to me. It's a pretty cool spot if you live in the area. My friend had a birthday party here and she got to rent out the whole outside patio. It was a cool night so it wasn't too hot. Everyone that was there for her got a stamp so you can get half off appetizers, well drinks, and beer on tap. The beers on tap was pretty good. They have karaoke and the DJ was awesome. He seemed like an aspiring rapper. The prices for the the food and drinks were pretty reasonable not too pricey. This place is pretty cool we had a good time. I probably won't be coming here too often considering is pretty far from me but if I was in the area I wouldn't count this place out.

Restaurant name  Spoon House Korean Kitchen

Review Text :
I was hoping to be the first to review but oh well :)Spoon House Korean Kitchen just opened on Green Street this week. I was pretty excited to go sometime this week. From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi)  which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but  it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck.

Review Text :
We were eager to visit and try the "new place" in the 'hood.  Especially because it appeared to be a sophisticated environment considering the location on Indian School & 56th, just south of Arcadia.  I met my friend at the bar, waited 10 minutes or so for a table and enjoyed a glass of wine.  There was a nice selection and the majority of it priced under $10 a glass.The design is simple and unassuming, which led me to believe in the service and food being of higher importance ( both great aspects of a successful restaurant.)  We were promptly escorted to one of the best  seats in the place for people-watching and great one-on-one conversation.  The settings were in the way, we pushed them aside and continued in conversation.  The service was just ok, same with the food.  We had a chicken and fish entree, not sure which ones though.  An odd part of the evening happened every time that the server would come to our table, he addressed us as "Kids".  Apparently, sitting in the best seat and conversing, on a Friday night & drinking wine by the glass, is not the best way to get respect or attention.  We were only a "deuce" or a 2-top.  We weren't there to be sold.  We didn't ordered a bottle.  We were occupying his "money table" during the 7pm slot.  We weren't interested in small talk with him.The server sized us up immediately and figured that either we were on a date, or that we didn't truly "get" what good service truly is at a restaurant.  He rarely checked on our glasses of wine.  My friend actually had to ask for a second glass while her empty wine glass sat there, mortified.  I've opened restuarants, hotels, spas, coffee shops and done more in the "service industry" than most my age.  My friend's background as a Stylist is also about catering to a client, being friendly, confident and comfortable.The finishing touch to the incompetence of the server?  Walking over to the table, check in hand, shaking his head "no", and saying, " You're probably not going to have anything else, are you?" while setting it on the edge of the table.I value my time enough to know when the staff needs some assistance with the finer points of service: Engage with your clients, offer suggestions / don't sell, be courteous, don't judge and always be authentic.I'll be back in a few weeks to see if they value constructive criticism.Have you ever been excited because you want something to be great...and then it's...very disappointing:(  This is how the story went at Vatra!  It's almost like the owner is a home cook trying to go "pro".  We went for lunch and all signs started well...we were greeted upon entering the place, it was clean and nicely designed and decorated.  The menu had many items that were appealing.  The waitress took our order and the ice tea was well brewed and fresh, some absolutely freshly baked bread with some designer butter came out and we were thinking things were going well...until the steak chimichurri arrived!  What cut of meat it was ...i have no idea but it was under seasoned, undercooked and super chewy!  The chimichurri sauce lacked any flavor and this plate had some boring flavorless potato wedges.  Paella...I have no idea why they think this is anything like Paella...it was 6 pieces of overcooked seafood on a bed of dry yellow rice.  How the chef could taste this and think wow this is great is beyond me.   The deserts were boring and we were afraid to order them and have more mediocre fare.  I fear that there is no hope for Vatra and it is going to go down in flames.

Beaver Choice.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I don't know what the name means, I have no idea why it's named that, I don't know why the logo is a beaver (the animal kind - get your heads out of the gutter people) in a Swedish triple crown shirt holding a fork.  With all that said, what I do know is this place is definitely worth a try.  I had never heard of the place until my girlfriend fianc√©e sent me a link saying we should check it out sometime.  I checked out the menu online, it looked good, so rather than wait several weeks for my fianc√©e to have a free lunch period, I decided to investigate for myself that very same day.  Good move on my part.  It's a great little Scandinavian restaurant that's only been open for a couple of weeks in a pretty non-descript suite in the strip mall behind Ted's Hot Dogs at McClintock & Broadway.  It's a very clean place with about 6 or 7 four tops, furnished from top to bottom by...you guessed it...Ikea.  It's a family owned and operated spot and they are some of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  They are very proud of their little piece of Scandinavia in the desert and it shows in their service and their food.  They are well aware of the fact that with the exception of Swedish meatballs, most people aren't really familiar with Scandinavian food so when you approach the counter, right off the bat they ask if you would like to try a little sample platter free of charge.  Who's going to turn that down?  I had a little piece of Gravlax (raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill), some potato salad and some pink lunch salad thing the name of which I forget.  I really enjoyed the Gravlax and potato salad but the pink one was made with sour cream and since I've never been a fan of sour cream I only had a bite of that one.  They have two menus. One could best be described as a lunch/to-go menu and one that they call the bistro menu which is essentially akin to a dinner menu except that you can get anything on it all day.  They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups, entrees, etc. with all kinds of different varieties of meats to choose from.  They even had two that they say on the menu are recommended for hangovers.  My kind of place! It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get.  I decided to try the schnitzel.  It comes with a decent little side salad with your choice of either a honey mustard or garlic vinaigrette, a little citrusy red cabbage slaw both of which were good but were primarily there to compliment the main event which was the schnitzel.  It's an enormous breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and brie cheese, cooked to perfection and topped with an amazing mushroom gravy and on the side were dill mashed potatoes also topped with the gravy.  Both of them were in a word, delicious.  It was about $11 for the whole entr√©e and it was worth every penny.  I wasn't able to finish the whole thing but I can tell you that it keeps really well because I had it for breakfast this morning.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if any of it is even half as a great as the schnitzel, it's gotta be pretty damn good.  You know how every now and then you go to a place that's just starting out and you get great service and great food and you just hope that they make it?  Well this is one of those places.  I strongly suggest that you go check it out.Beaver Choice?Uh...Yes, Please!I thought it was a question...a natural mistake.You see, I love Beavers...after all, I come from Oregon, the Beaver State (state motto - "M'mmmmm, that's some mighty tasty Beaver") and I have spent so many years pursuing Beavers, frolicking with Beavers, really, just delighting in Beavers in all their many guises!I have stalked, trapped and released back into the wild...(I'm a conservationist) more Beavers than I can count...from adorable Golden Beavers and the elusive California Shaved Beaver to the wild and wily Crimson "Fire" Beaver...I guess you could say that I am Beaver enthusiast!The Beautiful Carin put an end to my halcyon days of hunting wild Beavers...really, I'm much happier for it...and calmer.That said, I was going to drop by Ted's for a wiener at lunch and saw the sign for this adorable little place (I personally think that it's no coincidence that Beaver Choice occupies a cozy little spot very near Ted's Wiener Emporium), and I thought, "Donald, let's go get us some Beaver".Well, it turns out that Beaver Choice is a terrific little Scandinavian restaurant...for Scandinavians...like me!As I looked over the menu, I saw things I hadn't seen since I was a kid...things I hadn't seen since I was last at that great Smorgasbord place back in Portland that I can't remember the name of...the stuff that Nordic dreams are made of!Gravlax, K√•ldolmar, Laxpudding, Fylld L√∂vbiff...and fries!I had a smoked salmon sandwich that was well made, tasty and filling (oh, don't worry...I didn't upset the subtle forces of nature by eating too healthily...I had fries, too!).While they do have several vegetarian options on the lunch menu, I would remind you that the sweet little family that owns and operates Beaver Choice is Swedish (by way of Poland)...Scandahoovian...like me...and we never met a vegetable or fruit that we didn't think was better boiled, fried, baked, distilled or fermented...just sayin.But I am going back...the only thing better would be if these guys would open up a smorgasbord place...but then they would have to contend with me pretty much wallowing in the buffet tables...and nobody wants to see that.Drop by Beaver Choice the next time you are in that part of the world!Even if you're not a Beaver Enthusiast (like I am), I'm sure you'll find something to eat.What a great little spot! I don't often eat Scandinavian food, but that might all change after today. The family that runs Beaver Choice has charmed me with their delicious food and friendly spirits. I can agree with some other reviews and say that the food did take a good amount of time to get served, but Beaver Choice has heard that cry and they are trying to work on it (Also, when I ordered off of the Grab & Go menu, I got my sandwich very quickly). The lady and I ordered a Swedish Meatball Pita and the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu to share. The food knocked the socks off anything IKEA had to offer in it's cafeteria! The pita was loaded, and I mean loaded with fresh veggies and about three meatballs per half. For a mere $5, that's a steal for a sandwich that doesn't make you feel like you just ate a grease-soaked sponge. Now, make sure you go before 6pm if that sparked you're interest because they switch to the dinner-only menu after that. What about the schnitzel, you ask? Yum! It was basically a flattened cordon bleu covered in a very nice mushroom sauce. Every bite was very tasty, but there is a pork variation that I wish we would have gotten. Apparently the owners put the chicken version on the menu to appease non-pork eating individuals, so the pork is the original for them. Along with the schnitzel there were a few different salads (all of which were fresh loaded with crisp red onion) and a side of pan-fried thyme potatoes. I want to just eat a big bowl of those because they were that good to me. They were simple, light and flavorful.Beaver Choice. Remember that name and go check it out! It was good, but be patient. They are new and they'll get their groove thang going soon enough. Lastly, make sure you write them a review! I know I can't be the only one to be excited about multiple "schnitzel" references in a single review!Sometimes, it is just wonderful to be alive.  Actually, all the time it's wonderful to be alive.  Life is amazing, the weather is gorgeous outside, I am or think I am getting better at tennis, my girlfriend loves her job and I love that she is bringing in money for the first time in 5 years, 3 years later I can finally convince myself that bright red is not too girly a color for the car I drive, and I found a restaurant that serves food so good that I want to photoshop some incriminating photos of the husband so that I can court the owner-chef Hanna, marry her, and keep all her food to myself.  As that would be a terrible thing to do and that I don't think I'm really spouse material and that I have no game whatsoever, instead I will eat here whenever I think I deserve an amazing meal and spread the word on how awesome Beaver Choice is!On to my actual experience, I start with a phone call asking general questions about their restaurant, and engage in a nearly 8 minute dialogue analyzing what I like and ordering based upon their recommendation.  This also creates a 10% discount by ordering over the phone for pick up off their bistro menu, which is nice for my lunch hour.  I wound up picking the Chicken with Cardamomsauce, perfectly seared slices of chicken then simmeredin cardamom accented, heavy creme sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, with the seared outside giving a pleasant mouthfeel, yielding to the moist and tender inner portion, all swimming in that wonderful sauce.  You can choose a side dish and 3 portions of salad to go with your entree.  Couscous was heavenly, absorbing all the juices of the chicken and mopping up the sauce in its fluffy goodness.  Tomato-basil salad was fine, but too peppery.  The spinach salad was straightforward and competent, and home-made coleslaw was tastier than most I've had.  Very filling and extremely satisfying, I would bathe in that cardamom sauce if I could.  One note I need to make, a previous review had slammed Hanna for tasting something she was making, and using the same spoon for tasting something else.  When I arrived I mentioned I heard about them on Yelp and mentioned this review, which prompted resulted in me being ushered into her kitchen to proudly display a set of about a dozen spoons at the ready for tasting.  Also of note there are no microwaves!  The pride in their food is entirely justified, yelpers.  The only thing to be aware of is the time involved to prepare your food, but ordering in will alleviate that, or simply set aside plenty of time.  Choose Beaver Choice.  You won't regret it.Don't let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience. My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendre's on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter's advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate. I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon. We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all. Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you won't come away disappointed!So um we really, really wanted some Swedish meatballs one day. Then low and behold we landed at Beaver Choice. Best. Accident. Ever.This is a family owned business. We were the only guests. The Scandianvian son fawned on us. We had to sample EVERYTHING. I mean we had two heaping full plates of samples, before we were allowed to order. He insisted! It was so amazingly awkward. Truly though, very gracious people. It's a gem of a place.Worth the drive to Tempe! NOT fancy but totally comfortable thanks to the wonderful, gracious family owners/operators.Do NOT miss the dill mashed potatoes! Also, I LOVED the tomato sauce that came with the cabbage rolls. Was dipping everything I possibly could in it!! I ordered both of the beet options but, if forced to choose, liked the beet salad best... wound up "cleaning" the dish by wiping it down with the remaining pickled beets! I liked the cabbage rolls but I LOVED the hash one of my dining companions had ordered. This is likely what I will get on my next visit.The pierogi were boiled but didn't seem to spend any time in a frying pan. I love pierogi but I prefer them to have a little more of a crunch -- the firmness you get from a quick pan fry.It's a tiny, casual place. Order at the counter, they bring you your food and you pay at the counter when you're done.A BYO, if you also bring your own glasses they waive the corking fee!Seriously cannot wait to go back!! :9To set the record straight for all the pervs out there who thought I was checking in at a strip club tonight (it's Wednesday night for God's sake and I have to work in the morning!!!!), Beaver Choice is a tiny, VERY unassuming Scandinavian/ Canadian restaurant in a strip mall in Tempe.Check out all of the awesome reviews to get an idea of how great this place is and then get in here. They serve a nice selection of Scandinavian fish, meat and pork dishes.I started out with Quebec-style poutine which was delicious (the Canadians weren't pulling my leg on this). The only thing that was missing was beer (they are BYO FYI, so I'll bring beer next time). I'm telling you folks, our evil socialist neighbors to the north know how to whip out some great comfort food!!!!!For my main I enjoyed some hearty Swedish meatballs bathed in a hearty cream sauce and accompanied with tomato basil, spinach salad and sauteed green beans. You get a LOT of food because your main comes with a side(choice of potato) and three types of salad. The salads are small but throw in three choices, your side and your main and you wind up with a lot of food.They have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you'll want to get your dessert to go.The family that run the place are so warm, hospitable, kind and welcoming and I'm thrilled that they're moving to a bigger location. This is a hidden gem in the valley and really and great option when you're sick of all the usual choices to eat.Totally unpretentious, small, very casual, interestingly-named, family-operated, and offering good values on large portions of delicious food. Thus: A keeper!Two things to note before you go: There are only 6 4-top tables so reservations are recommended. Also, no liquor license, so it's BYOB with a $5-per-bottle corking fee. The side-salad options on the menu are kinda confusing at first. Keep in mind that they don't combine the separate items in a bowl: You are essentially ordering three separate small side dishes served on the same plate as the main course. Business is good enough that they're talking about expanding to a larger location, which would be nice. I hope they can keep the same qualities that make their place a must-visit today.Still get 5 stars. Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine. Glllrrrbbbl. Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating. Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed. We love this place. They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa. Fortunately, they will be even closer to us :)We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant?).Beaver Balls are next on my list to try.

Restaurant name  Las Pupusas Restaurant

Review Text :
I noticed how close I was to a milestone 600th review a few days ago. Since then, I've actually been stressing about it somewhat. Should it be another cool non-food destination like #500 (well, actually #499 after a stub-like review removal)? Should it be a hot new restaurant? Should it be a high-end restaurant that I haven't been to?I guess Yelp may have spoiled the reveal by now... it was none of the above. Instead, I went to an oft-overlooked restaurant in my own neighborhood. Although I have seldom heard about friends' experiences with this restaurant or with pupusas in general, they have all been positive. I decided to act today for lunch.Las Pupusas is located in the gigantic plaza on Stephanie and Sunset. It is one of several businesses between Hobby Lobby and Ross, and it could qualify as a hole in the wall. It's a little dim inside and the decor seems to try to bring back the feel of El Salvador. The facade-of-sorts over the back area is Mission-style, there are paintings about the old country, and the TV was broadcasting CentroamericaTV. I can make an educated guess that a lot of the patrons are from that part of the world too.Before I get into the food, I should state that this isn't a place for a quick lunch. It was still slammed after 1pm, with dirty dishes on tables owing to the lack of a busboy. That's right, there was only one employee running the whole front of house. This helps me somewhat mitigate the regret over the missed opportunities for lunch with friends, although we perhaps could have still ordered to-go to fit a visit here into the constraints of a lunch hour.I'd already browsed the menu, which is available in PDF with prices on their web site, but I had plenty of time to go through it again anyway. To get a feel for the variety of the restaurant, I decided to get a bunch of smaller items. Each of which was conveniently $1.95, which was generally a bargain for what I got. You can build a solid lunch out of 3-4 of these, but I ordered 5.First, the pupusas. Move over, arepas. While these bad boys aren't as big and there are significant differences, I'll take two of them over one of the arepas from most or all local restaurants when I'm craving something with a thick corn-based container and hot meat and cheese. These pupusas are sealed then cooked, and they have a disc-like shape, resembling a smashed sphere of dough or a flattened hockey puck. They're served with a refreshing, mild slaw on the side, but they don't have any plantains, and the mild tomato sauce is much less interesting than the green sauce that's served with arepas. Regardless, they're delicious.The revuelta was filled with refried beans, cheese, and "chicharron," a pork that is not at all the same as the fried pork rinds of Mexican cuisine. I actually couldn't decide whether I preferred this to the second pupusa, which was simply chicken with cheese (note: my order could have been less than absolutely specific, but I guess they don't offer a "revuelta" with chicken substitution). The corn flavor shined a bit more on the latter, and I couldn't really get much out of the refried beans anyway.I also tried their take on a pork tamale. Stop me if you know what I'm talking about when I say it bears a small resemblance to a Vietnamese food known as banh chung. While the fluffy corn masa is a far cry from the somewhat sticky rice and mung bean, the chunks of pork and the flavor from the banana leaf wrapping are definitely similar. I'm not sure whether dousing a tamale in that same tomato sauce is typical, and I didn't need more moisture, but an elderly woman who arrived later did just that. Be forewarned that the pork is concentrated in the middle half, so the edges are just corn dough if you decide to eat directionally instead of cutting it apart and evening out the meat and masa.Finally, I got to the two tacos that I'd ordered. They're not exactly the same fare that you'll get from most popular taco joints. They do start off with two corn tortillas per taco, but the diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce (with traces of onion) are a far cry from the typical cilantro and onion topping. They also lack a variety of salsas, instead providing a side of some ridiculously hot concoction that I'm sure would challenge even the spicy-tolerant.They're not bad for what they are though. The meat portions are huge, with cube-shaped pieces spilling out when I tried to eat them by hand instead of utensil. Both the carne asada and the al pastor are seasoned well and flavorful. Unfortunately, the carne asada was overcooked and dry (albeit not inedibly chewy), and the al pastor can't compare to some local taquerias. But that's because the latter are marvelous, not because the meat is bad here.Phew! I'm glad #600 was an overall success. I'll definitely come back to Las Pupusas for their namesake food and perhaps a tamale. I would even consider the entrees, burritos, or tortas, but I just won't expect a fast dine-in meal.

Custard style ice cream? I am now completely spoiled and no trip to DQ will cut it. The husband keeps telling me we need to have some of their ice cream shipped up here-I keep explaining that it won't happen. The food is take it or leave it IMO, but even I was a fan of the bits of ice cream I had on my two visits here and definitely a super fan of their banana milkshake which could indeed bring all the boys to the yard. Damn right.

I actually just left there and couldn't wait to write a review.  I am so pissed off for the underhanded up charges.  Beer and bites my ass!I have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.I stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  Now here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  A basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? NOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why.

Review Text :
The best Indian food I've had yet!! Hidden in a little corner on Craig and Tenaya... My boyfriend always told me about this place, but it had temporarily closed down due to the cook having to go back to India. I saw the reviews on here yesterday that it had reopened and I called to confirm. We went last night.  They are only open for dinner hours until they get their clientele back up.Soooo, for dinner we had the following -Shrimp KormaRogan Ghoshtand the mixed Tikka PlatterWe had everything on a 7 spice level, and it was perfect. Everything was delicious and I cannot wait to go back again.The Skinny: came in for their $12 lunch buffet and was greatly disappointed with the lack of selection and the quality of some of the items... for f*(k's sake they f^&ked up kheer (2) service was good - nothing special though (3) value: given the plethora of Indian restaurants offering buffets in the valley, this one ranks poorly with regards to price, selection and quality (2).Came in because we'd heard they were starting to do lunch buffets. Add the recent promotion of $2 off, we were psyched to try it out especially when it's a lot closer to our neck of the woods.I was really surprised by the lack of selection available considering the price. For $12, there were 8 hot items (including rice) with a small salad/fruit bar and kheer.But this would be okay if the food was fantastic across the board. However it missed the mark. Of all of the dishes, the standout was the Goan Fish Curry. The fish had a lovely texture while the curry was wonderfully mellow. However, you were pretty much dumpster diving to look for pieces of fish in the curry. Other than that, everything else was okay (lamb masala, chana masala, paneer masala) to not-so-great.Of the not so great items was the dal (bland), the orange chicken (soggy, overly sweet --- I'm not sure how this fits in with everything else - this s*(t is about as American as apple pie), and the kheer. I have to take a minute about how they messed up the kheer. Not only did they cheap out on the rice (they used some sort of long grain instead of basmati), they may have used leftover rice to make it with the rather large clumps of rice emerging from the pudding. If you stirred the rice while you were cooking it, this doesn't happen. In addition, the rice was undercooked and hard. Plus you don't even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all.  Bleh. Major turn off. The garlic naan came to the table nice and hot and flavourful. However texturally, it was a little too hard, a little too doughy and not enough flakiness. Sporting a tomato chutney, an unpleasantly weak mint chutney (where's the mango chutney?) and a rather watery raita, I was disappointed by the lack of pickles and other condiments normally seen at other places.Given the plehtora of places available in the valley that offer better selection, better quality and overall better prices, I'd skip this place for the lunch buffet. 2 starred review.

I really have to gush about this place!I had a business meeting, and we were supposed to meet at the Merc. Their signage was completely wrong and they never opened when they said they were going to. So, we walked around the corner and saw Fuego Tacos.I've been to the Bistro once, so I knew it was a safe place to go. It was just after 5 and the place was about half-full downstairs. I noticed the upstairs was empty. I asked if we could sit up there and we were given our choice of tables.Our server was amazing! He immediately brought us chips and salsa and took our drink orders. He brought me two drinks! I'm ok with that, because usually I'm used to having servers who don't keep up with my drinks. (Diet Coke, FYI)The chips were freshly made, and the salsa was good. We ordered a plate of nachos to share with pork on top. It's one of the best plates of nachos I've had in a very long time. We all devoured them.As I was getting up to leave, our server brought me a Diet Coke in a to-go cup. I didn't even ask for it but wow! I'm going back, most definitely. The prices were reasonable and there was a good crowd in there. Oh, and they were playing 80s music. That pretty much gives the place 500 cool points.Finally decided to try out Fuego tacos and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.... that I didn't come sooner. First I have to say that Matt (our waiter) was awesome. Attentive, nice, accommodating, and friendly. I say this because it is just about opposite of my experience everywhere else I go. I just assumed that it's normal for your waiter to be snarky and ignore their customers. He seems to prove that theory wrong. I'm usually cheap and give out only a 10-12% tip for the usual lack of service I receive, but Matt earned the full 20.Awesome just doesn't come close to describing the meal. It started with the salsa and chips and kept going all the way through dessert. I know it's usually chips an salsa, but the real star there is the salsa, so you have to say it first. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce, the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip. Wife and I shared both the pernil (pork) and shirt rib barbacoa (beef) tacos, either way you choose it, it's a great dish. Although I did like the short rib tacos slightly better than the pork. The tacos come with sides of both rice and black beans. I've made black beans before, and they don't even compare. Like trying to compare a huffy bicycle to a Ducati motorcycle - they just don't. Our meal was followed up with a slice of cake covered with a mango and pineapple reduction. I will definitely be back sooner rather than later.Expect to pay about $12 - $14 per plate after tax / tip, a few more if you order drinks, apps, and / or dessert.If you've read any of my other reviews, you might just know that I'm driven by good food with a great value, and as such. You can find usually grab a deal on (choose one) $5for$10 on yelp / groupon, or $25off$35 from restaurant-com; yes I did use a deal for myself. While normally you can feel the glares of the wait staff whenever you pull out your coupon, Matt made us feel like it was no big thing and was happy to serve us! I had such a good experience, that I might even consider **gasp** coming without a coupon **/gasp*

Stop on in for a glass of glass.  Pass on by for sass with class.I've been to places I wasn't thrilled with, but have never felt such a need to vent on Yelp.First, the backstory.  I used to live in Tempe and frequent Kazimierz in Old Town Scottsdale.  Memories of that place hold a dear place in my heart.  My family, and now some of my boyfriend's family, live near Amaro.  With the association, they thought it would be cool to check it out.And now, the rest of the story.  The two former Kazimierz employees learned nothing from their time there.  The first tastes of a place are the service and atmosphere.  Strike one and two.  We were greeted by sloppy dress and served by a brat.  At Kazimierz, if you wanted a cozy nook for 8 on an early Saturday evening, you'd need a reservation.  At Amaro, don't bother... there's no need.  Also, nooks?  Yes.  Cozy?  No.The last straw.  My dad found a large piece of glass in his drink.  With the attitude of the server, he brought it to the attention of the owner... who really could not have given a damn, though he finally halfassedly offered to buy my parents a round upon their next visit.  At this point, we were just trying to get a human reaction to such poor service.The food and drinks (other than them not being able to make a Bloody Mary) were great, really.  What brings me here, and gives Amaro their third strike, is the snide way in which our complaint was met.  Upon waving a white flag at forcing reason, our usually laid back party was making our way outta there.  I'd gone to the restroom, and ducked into where we'd been sitting to grab my purse.  As I joined the others, I overheard the owner laugh and say, "And don't come back."If I treated my customers with such unwarranted disdain from the get go, I'd be told to start finessing my resume.  Maybe that's just what Kazimierz did.

Everything they make is incredible. I've been consuming gallons of their soup. Seriously, some of the best soup around. Last week I tried the Chicken Tortilla soup, and it blew my mind. Plus, the people who work that cart are super friendly. I've only been to the cart near the Walgreen's on Cap Square, but I reckon the food is equally delicious at their other location.Worth the praise. Top-notch, y'all.

Dropped by for lunch recently.  The restaurant is one of those 'Tweener' places that's not quite fast food, not quite sit down.  You order at a counter and they bring the food out to you.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=DfsU-CsIddif5KvRj2aeQAAfter browsing the menu, decided to go with the Carne Asada Burro (Steak, Beans, Rice and Pico de Avocado, $4.95).  It comes with complimentary Chips & Salsa and you can refill your Chips.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=NHAjUA3KMYUy-V8y5i1myAThey have a bottle of Hot Salsa on the table for you to use.  It's not too Spicy, but better than Mild Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=vDjj2E6e0LU0j7BHBI9PYQThe Burro was just OK, nothing special.  The food was fresh but just lacked that extra special flavor to make it great.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=nl6zwg9DykIVa0VqehHnYQOverall, it was a A-OK experience.Return Factor - 30%

I drove by Pho MaiLan all the time going home. This is located on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. And finally i just decided to give this place a try.I give it a thumbs up!This is a Vietnamese noodle house.I ordered the pork with vermicelli and it came with the noodles. The portions are pretty big it filled me up pretty quickly.  The pork and the noodles were awesome! The pork was marinated to perfection and it was not chewy or tough. It was just perfect along with the vermicelli. The noodles were nice and fresh along with the veggies that came with it. You can tell everything was just cooked and not sitting in the fridge for a long time.I also ordered the fresh Vietnamese roll. That too was really good. Inside the fresh wrapped were veggies and vermicelli. You dip the rolls into this peanut butter base type sauce, which is mmmm mmmmm gooood!Overall:The service is great they filled your water up and did not have to be told.They have free Wifi so if you wanted to get some work done you can.This place is nice and quiet , really relaxing, different from those loud Pho places.I highly recommend this place. This is a must try. This goes on my top list of Vietnamese places to eat.Talk about some real vietnamese food being delivered right to your door step ( 3 mile radius, I am 7 miles away almost got turned down but talked him out of it, yessir!) Thanks to the pictures of food and the menus on yelp which helped out awhole lot. The phone order was easy and smooth. It took about an hour due to 2 deliveries before mine but well worth the wait. We ordered the crispy fried spring rolls, Pho Tai Bo Vien, Combo vermincelli, vietnamese sausage and marinated slice pork vermincelli, and kalbi ribs with rice. The food was very fresh and really flavorful, everything was really tasty especially the broth of my pho, the kalbi ribs was the best, tender and packed with flavor.My family and I loved every bite. We will be ordering more to come.I really like this Vietnamese restaurant. The food is always good, service is always friendly and the place is always clean...and doesn't smell funky. I used to come here a lot when my office was still in Anthem. I would always get a bowl of pho or grilled pork chop.Pho:I normally get a bowl of pho with any of the following: brisket, flank, and steak. The broth is excellent. They have different combinations including one with salmon. 5/5Summer Rolls:Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper. The 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. 5/5Roasted Pork Spring Rolls:Roasted pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper.  Again, the 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. The pork slices have that grilled taste to them. 5/5Bun Dac Biet:Fried egg rolls, grilled pork, pork sausage, grilled shrimp, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and peanuts on top of vermicelli. You get that vinegar + fish sauce on the side. My friend who absolutely hates egg rolls loved it. 5/5The service here is always great. I joke around with the employees. In general, the place is clean but sometimes it takes them a while to clear out tables."Please Review Us On www.yelp.com" is what it reads from the bottom of last night's dinner receipt. OK, you talked me into it. Here's the review you requested...Thanks to fellow Yelpers for some wonderful reviews and photos, I decided to try this place last night for dinner, and am very glad I did.Located on Eastern, north of Sunridge Heights en route toward Anthem in a small strip center next to Lee's Liquors.1st things 1st...Clark County Health District issued this restaurant an A Rating, as of last night 13 August 2015. So any reviews you may read prior to this date regarding anything other than an A Rating does not pertain to the current status of excellence. See photo below.The service was exceptional...friendly, fast, and accurate.The ambience was very pleasant to dine with a contemporary interior design of walls/ceiling, open floor plan, nice use of soft colors, plenty of modern lighting, low volume background music from the radio station 106.5FM, and two TVs; football and CNBC w/ subtitles.It took less than 10 minutes for my food to arrive. My Jasmine iced tea was served within 1 minute of my asking. From 7pm to 8pm, the place was almost packed with over 50 tables/booths + handling take-out patrons and I had exceptional service. Needless to say, they were well staffed. Pho MaiLan last night was clean reasonably priced for a better than average Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas.Food...ordered too much but managed to devour it all, thanks to wonderful chefs in the back.Started w/ an appetizer of A4. Nem Nuon Cuon, which are roasted pork spring rolls. The roasted pork is wrapped in rice paper w/ crispy rolls & fresh herbs, served w/ the chef's special sauce. Very good! $6 See photo below.P1. Pho Dac Biet - MaiLan Combo Special. This is a better than average tasting beef noodle soup w/ sliced round-eyed steak, brisket, marble brisket, flank, tendon, tripe, and meatballs. I thought the meatballs were the best of all the meats in this large Pho bowl. I added the fresh basil, bean sprouts, and squeezed a couple wedges of lime for extra flavor. I love to dress up my Pho w/ Sriracha & Hoisin sauces, w/ a few small scoops of chili sauce. I really liked their fancy wood chopstix, instead of the cheap kind that you typically break apart often w/ splinters. Very classy touch! It's a good thing I am ambidextrous as I was able to scoop the broth w/ the spoon in my left hand, while utilizing the chopstix w/ my right. Too bad I got splashed. I have yet to master the art of eating Pho w/o getting my clothing splashed, Mouthwatering good! $8.50 See before/after photos below.Lastly, I tried their BM2. Banh Mi Thit Nuong sandwich, includes grilled marinated pork. Delectable. $5.Pho MaiLan was the recipient of 2015 Best of Las Vegas Review Journal Poll. I can now understand why. In the famous words of Arnold, "i'll be back!"

Review Text :
Do one thing, do it well - This is what Brit and Chips was born for!I was here around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening, it's a small joint and it was getting full quickly but they do have a take out counter. Seating is a mix of bar stools and tables. Brit atmosphere is complete with Beatles music in the background.Nice menu variety, was surprised to see tandoori popcorn shrimps so I wanted to try that immediately and it was delicious. I ordered sour cream and onion batter sole and my friend got the maple syrup haddock - both were very tasty and cooked well, however the batter was thicker on mine. Crispy on the outside, moist inside.Fries were thick cut, not too soggy. Simple ingredients that turn into savoury satisfaction! If you're still feeling for some greasy goodness, I dare you to try their deep fried dessert ;)I'm also digging their British Ben Shaws soda, I drank up the "cloudy lemonade" which is a perfect balance of sweet and sour that got my taste buds tingling.  I'll be back for more and I'm making sure to tell everyone!My last meal in Montreal did not rhyme with wooteen sadly, but it did feature a firey fish and chips number from this fine establishment. This part of town looks as if it recently came into some money, so it has a more posh exterior than the rest of Montreal, and while it lacks that North American Euro anytown look and feel so pervasive in the rest of the city, I kind of like it. It's clean, well maintained, and pretty quiet.But, enough about that...onto the food! The fish was fried expertly, with a crisp finish and flaky interior. The chips were fat, plump and greased up just so to give off that perfect glisten. I had the poisson du mois, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. This particular mois featured a sole with jerk batter that gave the fish a wee bit of kick.I also love the origin story of the place that is on the menu, on the wall, and even on the paper in the basket, below the fish and chips.

Looking for good banh mi? How about fresh, flavorful spring rolls? Or maybe you're in the mood for boba? Well, you don't have to search any longer because Mr. Sandwich delivers on all these levels and more! Not only is Mr. Sandwich convenient and wallet/credit card friendly (no minimum purchase required here!), they also have Free Wifi! Yes! So you can nibble on Vietnamese eats while surfing the web- a perfect match. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi- flavorful pieces of chicken and pickled veggies sandwiched between a buttery, crispy baguette. Quite delicious. I also ordered Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls ($3)- Two nicely sized spring rolls packed with lettuce, green onion, cilantro, shrimp and pork, with a side of sweet, slightly spicy peanut dipping sauce. Fresh and healthy. The place is clean and the workers are friendly- extra points. I think I found my new hangout in Chinatown when I'm in need of Internet and tasty treats.Mr. Sandwich is  little strip mall place in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain near Valley View. It specializes in Banh Mi, the Vietnamese sandwich with the French heritage and bun. They have about 30 different varieties, and they all cost $3.24! They also have the drinks popularized in Taiwan and now ubiquitous in Asian establishments, MIlk Teas and Boba. Slushies with Boba (Tapioca balls) too. They are also $3.24! There are a handful of tables, some candy machines, and a few odds and ends variety store items to increase the store's total revenue potential. The sandwiches are ok. Pretty decent size. Not the best Banh Mi, but it is hard to beat their price/taste ratio.BANH MI BATTLE: HUE THAI vs MR. SANDWICHMr. Sandwich is the satellite restaurant to Hue Thai. Its a seemingly 'new'--but not really--banh mi place that's smack-dab in the middle of prime-time Chinatown. I am a lover of Hue Thai. But while they're sister restaurants, Mr. Sandwich knows his banh mi just a little bit better.I was bored one day and worked up a big appetite. I decided to run a side-by-side comparison: Mr. Sandwich vs Hue Thai. It was the only way to really know who served up a better banh mi. I ordered a House Special or (b√°nh m√¨ c bit) at both locations. While the veggie and meat comparison yielded the sandwiches as equals. The bread is why Mr. Sandwich cuisine reigned Supreme (ha). The Hue Thai baguette didn't compare to the buttery-deliciousness of Mr. Sandwich. And texturally, it was a little tough and a tad bit too crispy. I'm a die hard Dakao fan. But Mr. Sandwich is a few blocks closer to the strip and just  a few minutes off I-15. Every time I go, there's never a line and my order is served up quick and ready to-go. I'm never in there longer than 7 minutes. So Mr. Sandwich--essentially 'Hue Thai Express'--and his good and quick food has made his way into my regular quick-bite stops. CREDIT CARDS: SUPER+, they don't have a problem with me using my credit card on a $4 sandwich. **I also work the Phan Xiu Mai, or Viet meatballs, into my order. Just as good as Hue Thai, served with a better baguette.

Restaurant name  Growlers Pourhouse

Review Text :
In the ever evolving NoDa neighborhood, the space that used to be Niche and was Mamalu's before that, Jeff and Paul bring you Growlers Pourhouse.  On the corner and next to their other incarnation, the Crepe Cellar, GPH is a guy's bar that is girl friendly.The old world charm starts as soon as you walk through the huge antique Chinese estate door and it continues as you belly up to the bar next to the 1936 beer engine tapping cellar temperature craft beers.The chalkboard menu next to the bar lists the craft drafts by genre and it is hard to ignore the local staple, Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Especially with it being $1 on weekdays and $2 on Friday and Saturday.  That beer special alone should keep the lights on.The other chalkboard on the wall boasts the origin of their oysters on the half shell.  When you order food, they bring you an old spice (not the afters shave) box that houses your hot sauces, napkins, and crackers.The menu starts with the lighter fare such as chips and dips, truffle popcorn, and a few salads and then takes a turn with the oysters and peel and eat PBR shrimp.  The meat of the business seems to be the sausages and brats though.  From the potentially gut ripping chili cheese dog with peppers and onions to the Veganator option there is something for everyone.  I had the turkey apple sausage with the house mustard and it was quite tasty.The dessert portion of the menu is just as fun with marshmallows made in house for smores and nanner puddin'.The place is peppered with flat panel televisions and has the potential to be the place in NoDa to watch football on Sundays.  If only Jeff weren't a Cleveland Browns fan...Cask beer, you say? Indeed I'll have a pint! While I'm no ale aficionado, I was really excited to hear about this sweet new pourhouse (with cask beers and 1930s growlers) in NoDa. Naturally, hubs and I dropped in for a quick pint and bite to check out Growlers. I love love love the feel of Growlers, with the exposed brick on one side, cask ales, laid back approach and teeny space, it's definitely a place you want to keep coming back to. Service was friendly and knowledgeable and the bartender helped me choose my ale of the day - the Orange Blossom Pilsner. As previously mentioned, I'm not a big beer drinker but I really enjoyed my pint. I dug the orange essence and the smooth finish. As for the food, I only tried the beer cheese dip - which had great flavor, I just wish it was a bit thicker. Being that I went to school in Madison, WI I'm pretty picky about my cheese...especially beer cheese!Overall, I'm really excited to come back to Growlers. It's a great neighborhood bar with a super cool concept and interesting menu. Looking forward to my next trip...word on the street is that the bread pudding is amazing!Those craftbeer signs had my curiosity piqued for a while and I was beginning to wonder when they'd reopen this space in NoDa. I'm very glad for this addition to the area! Growlers has a great atmosphere that just engulfs you right when you walk in through those awesome wooden doors. From the exposed brick walls, to the beer tap lined bar, to the cool tables in the middle, Growlers is a great place to hang out with a pint of good beer. Place was packed on a Saturday night, but service was still prompt and friendly. Only got to enjoy a few beers, but will def be back to try some of the food. And by food I mean cheese. I love cheese and beer.i absolutely love the feel of this place. It's not all that big unless i missed a section hiding in back, but everything just felt right. It's the kind of place that i would almost like to see without any televisions and totally embrace an old school whistle-wetting, watering hole feel with the sole mission to drink and socialize. That being said, the tvs seemed to be nicely situated throughout.   i was very pleased to see their beer list had a nice little variety (like 14 on tap and the cask selection). They had a choice for brown, belgian, IPA, stout, pilsner, seasonal, etc. but also included a single representative from the basic American beer family. A go-to cheap beer choice in the PBR ($1 weekdays, $2 on the weekends) It's nice to have that option in case you drink beyond the need for a good tasting beer (no offense, i am old friends with PBR) or are just in one of those moods where it seems downright foolish to pass up any beer that could literally be found on a dollar menu! As Mrs. P. stated,  the toppings on the sausages were very tasty and were in fact better than the Italian sausage itself. The mustard was pretty good also.Our server who we will call Bethany (not her real name) was fantastic and we shall return.I was expecting more testosterone, for some reason - maybe ze German influences had clouded my hopes. But the massive door giving way to raw materials and polished concrete, the sausage party menu, the pulls meant to be grasped by some village-conquering Viking with a serious thirst, it all blended into comfy, impressive, trust us to serve you top notch beer-chic. Oh, you wanted a nibble too? Have a (CLT's first!!!) beer/cheese pairing party. We have 5 varieties to sample, a beer for each delicious slice. Served with crackers, honey and a comb, this could be din-din if you lean more toward a liquid diet.Yeah, we have pretzels and mustard. The 'zel isn't homemade, and you need to order it salt-light, but tastes straight off a best-case-scenario corner cart in NYC, slightly sweet, charred, soft and chewy. The mustard, ground in back, impressive.It's a bummer they felt a lack of confidence in the crowd this place is built to serve - we don't need the thrill of a game to coax us into dropping cashwads on really good beer. But there they are, the bet-hedgers - TVs every 5 feet. Beer cheese needed a kick of mustard, tabasco, something. Chips came out a tad cold.Who cares. Prost!We came here just because we were waiting on a table at Crepe Cellar and then we ended up getting full on bar snacks! We tried the fries, the wings, the pretzel, the fried chicken taco, a portobello sandwich and the chicken skins. I would recommend getting two tacos and a beer to anyone coming here for a quick bite to eat. The fried chicken taco was the best thing I tried. The wings were ok, I like wings fried hard and these weren't. The fries were good but not a must. The chicken skins I would skip - kind of gimmicky and $7. Our friend had the sandwich and the pretzel and he didn't say anything bad about them and finished both. I didn't expect to like this place because it was dark and packed. They've got booths but you kind of seat yourself? The waitresses were all "in a mood" like they were mad they had to be there. Not really a welcoming vibe.As for drinks, funny to see a shandy on the menu out of season but I would recommend the Shandy the Elder. Really refreshing and light - I'd drink another anytime!

First off, this place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Worst service I've ever had.It was my friends birthday, and his girlfriend planned everything. There was 14 of us, and she made reservations. Everyone was so upset over the awful service and food, I felt bad. It wasn't her fault it was so horrible. Most people at the table complained. I didn't want to add to that and make her feel worse, so I promised I would write about it on Yelp.The waiters were awful. Horrible attitude, didn't refill drinks, pretty much demanded we hand them things instead of getting it themselves. The portions were small, and not worth the price. Everyone but one person was missing a dish/drink or more. When people politely asked about their dishes/drinks, the waiters said, "Oh.". Not, "I'm sorry" "I will check on that"... Nothing. It seemed like we were inconveniencing them. The food was missing things, not cooked properly or enough and very small. The crab cake appetizer was small, and not flavored well at all. The lamb dinner was not good either...we asked for medium. It was barely pan seared, and it was practically pink on the outside. It didn't even come with the green sauce promised. The lobster Mac and cheese - the waiter, " It's amazing, I highly recommend it, we're known for it." It was extremely salty and tasted like boxed Mac and powdery cheese with two small pieces of lobster. Cesar salad - don't know. We never got it and were never asked if we still wanted it. They charged us $140 for 3 drinks, lobster Mac and cheese, small lamb chops and two crab cakes. They charged everyone 20% gratuity. It's usually 18%, but the waiter didn't even deserve that. He didn't even care to serve us much less care if we were even there. Do not eat here. Save your money and eat somewhere else before going to the Artisan. The hotel itself is awesome for the ambiance. But the restaurant...I promise, you are missing nothing.

On my last trip to Vegas we dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  When we lived in Vegas, we would dine here 2 or 3 times a year.  It was nice to come back to experience it again.  We love the views here and got lucky with a table next to the window.  Situated in Summerlin, which is about 10 miles NW of the Strip, you have a great view of the city from here.I couldn't wait to order my favorite items on the menu...which they still had:Wedge Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing, Bacon, Cherry Tomatoes), $812 oz Filet, $38Side of Potatoes Au Gratin, $7The Lettuce on the Salad was nice and fresh...very crisp and juicy, just the way I like it.  I like my Filet cooked between Medium and Medium Well...not too well done....they hit the mark, it was perfect.  The side of Potatoes Au Gratin was good, very large portion though....enough for 2 people.We had a great server who took very good care of us.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty....that's the way it should be.Overall, it's a nice place to have a good Steak with friends.Return Factor - 95%

This place could easily be a 4 or 4.5 star restaurant but it was an accumulation of little things that made me subtract the star and a half.  First, when I got to the podium, there was no one around.  Immediately behind me at the bar were 3 employees.  They all saw me, yet not one said a word--not so much as a "someone will be right there" or "let me go get someone."  Nothing, nada!  Several minutes went by and a woman appeared from a door which turned out to be the kitchen.  She then seated me.  Little thing #1.I had a Groupon and she asked to see it.  When I loaded it on my iPhone she stated she wasn't sure they were doing it that way.  They wanted a paper printout.  At that point I was ready to leave so she said she'd talk to the manager.  He agreed to take the Groupon number if they could copy my ID.  What?  Little thing #2.There are 6 entrees on the dinner menu and 6 items on the dessert menu.  They forgot one item from my steak and they were out of bananas for the dessert.  Their banana supplier had not yet been there.  Little thing getting bigger #3.Charge for a second iced tea at $3.  It was a partial refill. I had 1/3 left when she asked if I wanted more.  Bigger little thing #4.Now for the meal--it was superb!  I got the 8 ounce filet which was on a bed of garlic-onion mashed potatoes (the menu says puree, but it isn't).  There were 5 stalks of grilled asparagus for the seasonal vegetable (they were perfect!), and the drizzled Port syrup was very tasty.  The crispy tater strings were forgotten or maybe they hadn't been delivered yet, either.For dessert, I had the Gossip Sundae--green tea ice cream on powdered crispy wontons with butter rum caramel sauce, caramelized bananas, and walnuts.  Of course, the bananas were missing.Plating for the entree and dessert were nicely done.  I looked at some of the photos for the restaurant to see what I should have gotten.  I sure wish they had gotten their delivery!I'm not sure if I'll give Addiction another chance.  It is good, but there are too many little things that just add up to a subtraction in the enjoyment of the meal.The ambiance and decor of Addiction matches perfectly with my birthday dinner dress-- that's honestly probably the only reason why I chose to go to eat at Addiction for my 25th celebration. On that note, physically,Addiction lived up to all my expectations. Someone even said it looked like a rockstar's girlfriend's room, and quite frankly, I would love to be a rockstar's girlfriend if I get to live in a place like Addiction. Unfortunately, plans changed and instead of sticking to my 6PM reservations, the gang and I decided to opt for brunch so we can make it to Marquee to see Kaskade. Bust on both parts. While the food itself delivered quite well, nobody at the table had anything to complain about, it was so painfully slow service that earned them just two stars. We awkwardly walked into the dining area, with not a soul there to greet us. When the host/waiter seated us and took our order, we seriously had our suspicions that he was the host/waiter/chef. Not even joking. It took our salads and sandwiches a whopping 45minutes to come out-- and we were the only table there! Luckily, I purchased a restaurant.com voucher for $50 and our bill came out to about $12/person. Not too shabby for a meal in Vegas at all.The whole setting of the restaurant and hotel is quite interesting.. it almost looks like an upscale motel. Am I addicted to Addiction? Nope. Won't be back again unless someone else wants to do their birthday there!

Love this place! Every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They have great prices on food and great drinks! My favorite is the 3 tacos appetizer. You get a chicken, steak and pork taco wrapped in corn tortillas. A lot of Mexican food places in AZ are hit and miss, this place has great tasting everything, down to the beans and chips and salsa. Each Mexican food places I like, I like for different reasons, because of a certain dish, or what I am in the mood for. I wish I could combine 3 different Mexican food places around the valley to make 1 delicious one haha. This place has always grabbed my attention because of their tacos and tequila specials! I also have a friend who loves this place too, so its our little spot to have a great meal, great conversation and surrounded by fun people for a good night.I am certain when you come here you wont be disappointed! Check out their happy hour when you can. Keep it up Tia Rosa!

Vegas Express Sushi (VES) can be found all over Vegas.  They are usually the supplier for premade sushi at supermarkets and the like.However, there are a handful of locations that will make some basic sushi items for you on the spot.  Mind you, this isn't a place to sit and dine, but rather to order and go.  They don't offer anything fancy in terms of a sushi bar to view the goods either.  Their menu is simple and to the point.At this particular location, they also sell alkaline water and Filipino goods.  Yes, their specialty is water and Filipino items from the dried, canned or frozen.  We were pleasantly surprised with all the different items that had stocked in this little market.  I'm sure there's a markup versus visiting Seafood City, but it saves you the gas money in this case.Nonetheless, it's your local water source, Filipino grocery store, and take out sushi joint.

Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt.Second visit and I see what I was missing.... It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. $10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation.One of Kiddo's friends had a birthday party up in Anthem, which is very far from where we live.  So rather than drive back home and come back to get him, we decided to make a night out of it.  After we dropped him off at the party, we drove around and spotted this place using the Yelp app.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:Brisket, Ribs combo platter w/Slaw & Fries, $13.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQ#0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmw#bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmwPork, Ribs combo platter w/Beans & Slaw, $13.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUw#ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Q#MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4w#bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4wThe joint is pretty small and we were there during the peak dinner hour, so it got packed.  Luckily we found a table.  After a little while the food came out.  We were starving, so it had no chance to last very long.  I had the Brisket & Ribs.  The Brisket was very good....juicy and full of smokey flavor.  The Ribs were ok, not the best I've ever had, but good.I sampled some of The Better Half's Pork....that was very good too.  The Slaw is outstanding.I think this place is family owned....everyone there was nice and accommodating.  Too bad it's in BFE, otherwise I'd eat here more often.Return Factor - 95%

Restaurant name  Weera Thai
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am usually not a big Thai food gal.I will say it: I take Vietnamese over Thai any day of the week. Not even looking back, asking questions or wondering what I missed.Because in my experience - I never really missed much.Don't get me wrong; I enjoy pads, tom kah kai, curries and papaya salad once in a while, and really, nothing is wrong with them. They are even quite good, most of the time. But what makes me really sad is that I KNOW that they are only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many, many other treasures to be found. Well, eaten. But most places don't bother, or choose to "hide" these culinary pearls in secret menus that I am too scared to request upon ordering after being told once that they don't exist.Bummer.Now you can lure me in anyway. And Weera Thai did just that, with the promise of Issan food. Northern Thai Issan cuisine is more sour and spicy than Central Thai food and is cooked in hot chili peppers, rice powder, served with sticky rice. The result? My nom tok which was thinly sliced grilled beef with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili. Just to die for, and accompanied by the best tamarind-based sauce ever. There are a whole variety of similar dishes using beef, pork, duck and fish.Not in the mood for Issan?What about crispy pilot fish stir fried with Thai holy basil? Or ground pork stir fried with Thai holy basil & preserved duck egg? Or squid sauteed in a garlic, cilantro and pepper sauce?And for the least adventurous, Weeara does classics as well, and perfectly so. The simple spring rolls and the crab sticks we ordered were by far the best I have ever had. Fresh and vibrant - they redefined what they could be in the best of worlds. Wide rice noodles had just the right bite, and the green curry of my friend was outstanding.Skip Lotus of Siam, and come here. To top it all, service is absolutely darling!I'm a fan. Lunch specials every day -- that includes weekends -- are from 11am - 3pm. Each item includes soup, egg roll, salad, and rice. And they don't skimp on portion size. Chance are you'll leave satisfied. The yellow curry was awesome, although could have had a little more chicken. Pad Thai and the cashew nut chicken were excellent too. Service was friendly and quick and prices are inexpensive.I love Thai food. I know it is not the healthiest type of food out there nor is it doing me any favors in my quest to lose the rest of the baby weight, but I love it nevertheless. We have been here on a number of occasions for lunch and I have been pleased with my dish and service on all of those occasions.From the exterior it looks like a dumpy place next to a massage parlor on Sahara, but as usual the interior tells a different story. It is warm and inviting with elegant decor on the inside. The service has always been friendly and to the point.We tried their special which was Red Snapper in Panang sauce, and wow! It was such a flavorful dish masterfully prepared. Beware though, it is a large portion and enough for both my husband and I to share. We have also tried their appetizer sampler and absolutely loved it. It is rare to order a sampler and love everything on the plate, but I did. It consisted of cream cheese ragoons, stuffed chicken wings, spring rolls with several types of sauce including peanut, and sweet and sour type varying in intensity. I also enjoyed their combination drunken noodles with a generous portion of meats and shrimp. I intend on sampling more of their menu, but it is also hard not to stick to the dishes I've already tried since they are so good!I highly recommend this place!I was looking for a good Thai restaurant here in Vegas. We found this restaurant using the reviews and Yelp and other internet options. This is pretty much a locals place, as it's far away from the touristy areas. Entering we are greeted right away and seated. I notice most of the crowd was Asian of various flavors. Me and one or two others were the only white folks in here. I guess that's a good sign of good food! We start with Thai Iced Teas as we look over the extensive menu. The tea was just the right strength and not over loaded with ice. One of the things that made me choose Weera Thai Restaurant was they featured Issan regional Thai food selections. I have never heard of this before so it seems like a good time to give it a try as I've had most of all the standard dishes served in the US. Our first selection was the Thai Stuffed Chicken wings. ($9.95) The wings were a good version, not too heavy on the glass noodles and good tasting ground chicken and pork inside. Next we tried the soup, Tom Yum Kung. I've had this soup at various Thai places and this was one of the better ones. Just ordering the smaller size was enough for 2 people. ($8.95) Following the soup, we had from the Issan section , Larb with chicken. ($9.95) Another dish I've had, so I could compare. Very good version with the limey flavor coming through. Then to start our entrees we had the Nom Tok Moo, from the Issan section. ($10.95) This was thin slices of grilled pork with rice powder, spices, lime juice & chili. This was not one of the better dishes. The pork was a bit dry and tough. The taste was very similar to Chinese BBQ pork. I wouldn't get this dish again. Following the pork, we had the Panang Curry ($10.95). The rice was extra ($2.00). Charging for rice when you already order curry? I thought that was a bit nickle and diming the customer. The Panang Curry was flavored well and was not too spicy. You can order all spiciness levels for most of the dishes here. As you can see we ordered way more food than we could eat, so I was glad our hotel had a full kitchen and fridge to bring all our leftovers to. The food really adds up when you go a bit wild, our bill was around $70.00 bucks including tax and tip. A bit high for a Thai dinner for two, but what the hell, I'm on vacation!I think if I lived here in Vegas, this would be one of my Thai restaurants I might come back to maybe to try some other things. I was looking for some things that I don't find at every other Thai restaurant in the US. The Issan selection wasn't impressing me as any ultimately tasty treat at all. Most of the dishes here I've seen or had before, so no impressive innovations going on here.The service was very cordial and professional, not really friendly in a chit chatty way, but they get the job done. Most Asian restaurants, the servers are there to get the job done and not be your friend. The prices here are pretty much in line with most Thai places with entrees averaging $11 each.

Restaurant name  Off the Strip Just Real Food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The "Off the Strip" location in Southern Highlands has gotten some great reviews not just from Yelp but from almost every other review site out there. So, when I found out that they have a new location close to my house I decided to finally check them out. It's located on Tropicana a few blocks west of Fort Apache in a small strip mall. When you first walk in, the bar will be straight ahead, the dining area to the right, and a lounge area with pool tables and dart boards to the left. This is a gaming establishment so they've got all the usual bar-side games as well. I'm not sure how much redecorating they've done since they took over this space from the previous gaming tavern because there are some design elements that don't exactly fit the Italian/New American cuisine they serve. The bar is covered with a tin roof and there's a lot of fake wood lining the top sections of the walls (a la crown molding).The customer service was fabulous. The second we walked in the bartender and manager (I think ?) welcomed us and acted like we were regulars there. We were seated in the dining area, where there was only one other party. Throughout our dinner we were served by the manager and a waiter. Drinks were brought out quickly, orders taken soon after, water was refilled often, and we didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. The manager stopped by a few times to check if we liked the food and chatted a bit. He talked about everything from  the fresh ingredients they use to wine in Germany compared to wine from California to being retired from the military and taking this job to help out his friends. Our 2-year old son was with us and a few seconds after we sat down the waiter brought over a couple coloring books and crayons for him to play with. Very nice touch. They don't have a kids menu but the manager offered to make him some boneless wings and fries after asking us what he likes/doesn't like. Their menu isn't very large and they said they don't have everything that the Southern Highlands location offers. But, based on the items we tried the quality and execution of the dishes are excellent.We started off with the NY Asparagus ($12.00) -- thin slices of NY strip wrapped around asparagus and grilled. There are two per order and they come out in a mushroom sauce that is delicious. What a great concept -- wrapping asparagus in meat. That's a sure way to get me to eat vegetables. For entrees, we ordered the Rigatoni alla Vodka ($17.00) and the Lobster Ravioli ($22.00). The sauces for both looked and tasted the same which, according to their menu, consists of a vodka cream sauce with tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, and shallots. Both dishes were very good, although I thought the lobster dish was too heavily sauced and took away from the flavor of the lobster and ricotta filling of the ravioli. The chunks of lobster could have been larger in my opinion, as well.The entrees came with a side salad (choice of house or caesar). We tried both and enjoyed them. It was nice to see the salad served as small portions, like they should be, and NOT ridiculously huge Cheesecake Factory-sized portions. The entrees, however, were big. But, I'm not complaining because now we have dinner for the next night since we each only had half of our entree.Even though we were stuffed, they brought out a complimentary slice of cheesecake. It was rich, creamy and smooth New York Style cheesecake with a few strawberries and a little whipped cream on the side. Between the three of us it didn't last long.I don't think the food was perfect and the dishes we had probably rate closer to 4-star quality. But the service was so friendly, so excellent that I have to round up and give them 5-stars. It's a great neighborhood hangout and a cheaper alternative to other Italian/American places on the strip.They have $2 domestic drafts for happy hour and, from what we were told, on Mondays and Tuesdays the food is 25% off.Was invited to a friend's Birthday party here the other night.  They reserved an area to the left side of the bar.  I loved this place as soon as I walked in.....2 Pool Tables, 2 Dart Boards, and a full sized Shuffleboard game, plus comfy chairs and a wall of big screen TVs.....perfect!They ordered tons of food for the party....Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fingers, and several Pizzas.  With over 40 people coming, they needed to load up.I tried the Mozzarella Sticks & Meat Lover's Pizza.....they were both very good.  The Mozzarella Sticks were cooked just right....the Breading was crispy and not too greasy and the Cheese was melted and gooey.....it had a nice flavor to it and went well with the Marinara Sauce.The Meat Lover's Pizza was awesome too.....from what I could tell, it had Canadian Bacon, Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni loaded on top of the Pie.  It was very flavorful, but with all of that Meat, the crust was a bit soft, very difficult to eat the first few bites of the slice without a fork.....which is not good for Pizza traditionalists.  Other than that, it was spectacular Pizza....full of flavor and I thought the Cheese to Meat ratio was good.To wash all of that down, I had a Hoptoberfest Beer made by Fat Tire.....very tasty, not as Hoppy as other Beers I've had recently, but very good.  It went well with the food.Overall, I had a blast here and so did the rest of the party.  People were playing pool and darts....it was too packed to play shuffleboard as the party goers were too close to the table to play a game.Will I return?  I'm considering having my Birthday Party here.

Like many think of their loved ones, I think of the love I have for the biscuits I had here.  The true love I experienced is like none other.  Do you love that I've started with the bread options here?? So seriously, this buttermilk biscuit is just beyond! It's made with chives and has little cream cheese surprise inside.  Served warm. Are you dying just by the description?!  Anything with cream cheese in it is divine if you ask me....I shoved in four.  No lie.I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant.  It's funny because when you think of American food, what do you think of?  I think burgers and fries.  But make a food presentation fancy looking and you've got a fancy restaurant.  We tried the swordfish appetizers, which came out split between two plates.  I actually liked that because I can get greedy with my appetizer and not share, so it made things equal!  The app was good, but it wasn't amazing.  My scale goes from gross, ok, good and amazing.  This place was definitely not gross or just ok.   My main dish was very good.  I got the day boat scallops + pork two ways.  The scallops were nice and crispy, just the way I like them.  I was not thrilled with the risotto.  Granted, there was no false advertisement that it  was pearl barley and not a creamy based risotto I usually enjoy.  It just didn't have any taste, it was just....there. The pork belly, which was described as the part of the pig that bacon comes from, was amazing!  I mean, bacon, hello!!  The homemade sausage was also really good.  The cabbage underneath both meat options was very very tasty.  I was much more into that than the risotto. Remember that you MUST have a reservation!  It's very tiny inside, so I'd doubt you'd be able to walk in and get sat within 2 hours.  The place itself is very cool.  It was very cozy inside and had a nice intimate feel.  Great for a first date or romantical dinner out.The service was definitely 5 star.  Our service was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when selecting the food options.  For how hip it felt inside I was surprised to see an over 60 plus crowd on a Saturday night.  But maybe I just went too early for all the cool kids. So did this place live up the the hype?  Not necessarily.  But would I come back?  Definitely.  I'd be interested to try some of the other unique food options they have on the menu.  Maybe in a few months I can rate this as amazing!  I'm fearless and I like food, so who am I kidding, I'll be back!!Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.D√©cor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entr√©e, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) saut√©ed spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.I can't believe we waited so long! Really! It is a as close to 5 star as you can get. I will explain further. We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess in a cool, trendy little restaurant.  The vibe is cool and chic. We were immediately tended to by our wonderful waitress. She was attentive and super nice. She immediately brought us water and the superb wondrous bread basket. Oh the delight in the basket of' bread. Ours included the corn muffins that were little but oh the flavor. If you read any of the other reviews then you will have noticed the mention of the muffin with chives and the wonderful cream cheese delight in the middle, wow! And we also had a baguette with the amazing honey butter with sea salt. We decided on the chicken meatball appetizer. The meatball was smaller but you get three and on the side - a grilled sourdough with what I can best describe as a hummus type topping. I loved the grilled sourdough however the hubby did not and this is where the 4 star comes into play( from the hubby). I chose the seared fluke as my entree. It is a seared fish with a lobster and artichoke saute. The fish atop an amazing , tasty English pea and goat cheese ravioli. I have to say the ravioli made this dish. It made a ho hum piece of fish phenomenal! The hubby chose the duo of beef which is grilled rib eye and braised cheek on loaded smashed potatoes with baby veggies, natural reduction and  bacon and arugula salad. The rib eye was so tender and juicy. The hubby did not like the cheek noting it tasted too much like a roast than a steak. He was not keen on the cheek. I got a side of roasted fingerling potatoes which were done to perfection. The hubby chose a side of roasted baby veggies- yum! And for dessert...I chose the s'mores. I love bacon but candied bacon is on a whole other level. The bacon coupled with the dark chocolate terrine (it was like a little dark chocolate cake) and the little puffs of marshmallow goodness and the cumin Graham cracker and the rice crispie treat, amazing! The hubby chose the Spoon bar which was what can best be described as one terrific chocolate piece of cake ( some of the best I have ever had). If you are looking for a wonderful place that is a little pricier I would recommend Spoon. We will go back again! It was a terrific dinner from start to finish!Spoon, one of the better restaurants in the Burgh.  The decor is nice and tables are far enough apart to make it intimate.  Service was outstanding from our waiter, to the other servers that assisted, to John the Sommelier.  John spent a little time with us with several recommendations that would go with our mix of dinner orders.  He actually highly recommended a bottle that was one of the least expensive on the wine list.  He got it right, too, very nice cabaret franc.The bread basket was very good, probably could have eaten bread all night.Interesting menu with many fresh items.  We shared a grilled avocado that came with a charred tomato vinaigrette, oven roasted tomato and some creamy burrito.  We also had the bleu cheese souffle that had french peaches, nectarines, plums and a nice arugula with a sweet and sharp vinaigrette. I had a pork and shrimp dinner that was very good, the pork was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was good but maybe a tad over cooked but still tasty and good. All of the meals had some interesting ingredients that introduced some very tasty meals.  The preparation and presentation was top notch.

Today, we ordered takeout from chopstix as we frequently have in the past, but this experience was so bad that I doubt we will return, and I encourage you to BE CAREFUL if you order from this restaurant. As we began eating, my friend took a bit of general tso's chicken with a STAPLE in it. After spitting out the staple and experiencing quite a bit of confusion we called chopstix to complain. They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number.  We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest.  The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was "curved" differently.  My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife.  The owner then told her that she would get "IN TROUBLE" if she reported this.  We are taking our chances and calling our local chapter of the Illinois Department of Public Health tomorrow morning.

slooooowwww awfully slooooow to the point of behind hysterical laughter, like we were laughing at first, then it became downright retarded.We ordered smoothies, after about 40 mins we cancelled our smoothie order, and just ordered some waters...the smoothies never showed up.  We sat without a drink for 40 mins prior to that, not even a water, or being asked if we'd like something else to drink. no attempt at all and probably no notice at all that we had nothing to drink.There was 7 of us, they messed up all of our orders, AND we were supposed to get chips with our sandwiches.  After an hour & a half of being there we *finally*  got our food. No chips. After inquiring about the chips, the waiter did agree we were supposed to have chips on the side somehow he had missed this when he was bringing us the food. Then  we were told they were totally  out of chips.  Instead we got 7 grapes in a cup. No attempt to ask us what we'd like instead, fries, salad something.  It was awful.Unfortunately this place has good food. It's poorly managed and the waitstaff is horrible.  I'll never go back. I'd suggest unless you have 2 spare hours you skip it as well. They also have no music on or TV on in this place at all. IT was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.I bought a groupon for elixir back in April. I usually always yelp before I groupon but of course this time I didn't. Lesson learned! When I finally did my research & saw all the negative reviews, I chalked it up to them being a newer business & figured I would wait a while for them to work out the kinks out before giving them a shot. Silly me, thinking that this business owner might pay attention to yelp & surely the types of issues people were talking about would be dealt with. Well, fast forward 4 months to this past Thursday when the hubby & I finally got a chance to give this place a try. We walked in a little after 5pm to a completely empty restaurant. I tried to push aside any lingering doubts & keep an optimistic attitude. The sign said please wait to be seated but the lady behind the juice bar didn't so much as glance our way or acknowledge that we had even walked in. We started walking towards a table while asking if it would be ok to sit down. I think she grunted or something but definitely did not give a clear answer. We sat down & waited for her to bring over a menu, say hi, smile, something!! Nothing. She continued to clean or do whatever it was she was doing behind the counter & then finally brought over some menus after close to 5 minutes. Sorry to put you out! She took our drink orders, water with lemon for me & a sugar cane soda for hubby which she said they were out of b/c Whole Foods was out of it. Um, ok. He asked for just water with lemon too. We also ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls as a starter. I noticed that it came with a choice of dipping sauces but she never asked which one we wanted & hurried away before we could tell her. She came back with the 2 waters, no lemon. I asked for some lemon again & she came back with a tiny wedge of lemon in a filthy little bowl (pic attached) which I unfortunately didn't notice until after I had squeezed the lemon into my water :/ Then I realized we had no place settings therefore no napkins to wipe my lemon-juice covered hands on. I got her attention & asked for some napkins which she brought over, but again like I was putting her out.A couple minutes later, she came back to take our dinner order. I asked if I could have my chicken sandwich on a multi-grain bun to which she replied "that's what it comes on" The menu has several different bun options listed, so I'm not sure why that is the default bun for that sandwich. I guess if I had wanted another type of bun, they would have been out of it. Another 10 minutes or so & she brought out the spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce. Still no silverware so I guess it was good it was finger-food. We asked if we could get some of the peanut sauce instead & she informed us that they don't have peanut sauce. I mentioned that I had noticed it on the menu & she said "oh yeah, the manager is really bad about updating the menu" Way to call out your manager! O.OWe finally got our dinners after another 20 minutes or so. Cobb salad wrap for hubby, Mediterranean grilled chicken sandwich for me. Hubby's came with 4 grapes, a tiny pickle & a pepperoncini pepper. Mine came with some mango salsa &, no joke-I counted, 7 blue corn tortilla chips. The food itself was pretty good, albeit a little pricey for what you get. I'm glad we had the groupon! I wouldn't mind going back to try other things on the menu but you could not pay me to go back there & sit through another dinner that was as awkward, uncomfortable & slow as that was. I usually don't discount a place on service alone & always understand that people can have bad days. Yes, even a waiter/waitress!  But when I see yelp review after yelp review stating pretty much the same thing, I get a little ticked off. If some business owners took the time to read through reviews & fix the problems that are glaringly staring back at them, more businesses would succeed!

Review Text :
I went asap after reading Mike C's review!  This is by far the best ramen I've had in Vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in Japan. Its certainly a 4+ star place in LV.  We both got the tonkotsu ramen which was pretty good although more miso-y than I expected.  I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.  This certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.  I'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time."Got Ramen?"My life has never been the same ever since I became lactose-intolerant. I've tried to substitute with soy milk to no avail. Now thanks to Monta, I can drink Tonkatsu broth all-day to get my nutrients! Yes, Tonkatsu broth, rich, creamy pork marrow. Served with slow roasted pork in pork fat. Topped with green onions. I wish I drank this growing up, I would have been 6 foot-tall and playing in the NBA. Instead, I'm short and pull people's teeth for a living. My one complaint, turn up the AC yo! It is HOT! I was sweating more than the pig I just ate. I was sweating like a hooker in church. Like junkie in withdrawal. Like Clinton next to an intern. Like a blonde reading a math book. Seriously Chuck Norris would complain that it's hot in there..Before everyone gets carried away this started off as a strong 4 star review because I was stoked that we finally had decent ramen in Vegas. That other place Togoshi that closed down was not even remotely worth mentioning. I apologize but you people are really reaching. I'm not going to name drop, but there are GREAT ramen-ya in California and New York as well as some not so good ones in the mix. Monta....I was willing to over look a few things. Like the fact that it's 103 degrees outside at night and you have no working A/C. Also the faint smell of sewage doesn't really get your appetite going as you walk through the door. Let's serve a steaming hot bowl of ramen in the middle of the Las Vegas summer with no adequate ventilation except for some ceiling fans. Let's pretend I'm part Asian even part Japanese and I know something about food. Yes the food is decent and the ramen, pork belly and boiled egg, noodles are decent. Not the greatest but good enough that I would have returned. Prices are reasonable until you start getting extras. Our bill was $44.00 for the 2 of us. Pretty respectable check average for a small establishment. This is where I am not understanding how you could overlook simple customer service. I have reasonable expectations of decent food and decent service.... Whoever the arrogant F**K is that owns Monta: 1. This is not Japan 2. We live in the year 2010. 3. There are not enough Japanese here in Las Vegas a town dominated by the Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and every other nationality that you can afford to lose business. 4. Treat your customers better. 5. You might as well save some money and switch to walk-up counter service because that's about how useful your waitress was. It was not so much a lack of experience or lack of training issue, but more an arrogant I don't care it's not my job mentality and attitude. What? You don't think I saw this in Japanese restaurants 20 years ago? Even the Chinese have changed Mr. Bakatari and deliver with much more friendly and caring service. Is it that hard?? I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with tamago, extra pork and extra noodles. They serve the extra noodles on the side in a bowl and later I find out why. YES YES YES I know broth is costly, labor intensive and time consuming to make. But if you order XTRA noodles then the ration of broth to noodles should be proportional. It was not even close. I asked the waitress, Miss Personality very politely if I could have a little extra broth as I had a ton of extra noodles and no broth left. I'm not complaining, there wasn't that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodles I was served. Answer was "no". No big deal I will pay for extra broth just a tiny bit, whatever you guys want to charge....fat sumo kitchen lackey is like f'****n way and again "no" then a half ass sorry as she is walking away. Honestly this is such a joke I've been to restaurants in LA and again NY that have the name and ability to be arrogant and pretentious yet the service is warm and hospitable. You can go to Naked Fish, owned and operated by Japanese, yet the service is outstanding.This noodle-house is one of the hottest businesses in Las Vegas. (Yeah, like LV is not hot enough!)But the thing is, "I'm definitely not a Ramen-guy!" Because I'm not contented with just noodles, flavored broth, diced meat and/or vegetables in a bowl. It's been a LONG while since I've had a bowl of Ramen....even before 9/11 to be exact (yeah, that long).  I met up with a bunch of friends in Las Vegas and each of us ordered one of the restaurant's tasty Ramen Noodle. I ordered the Chashu and Tonkatsu Ramen Noodle Bowl. For $6.95, it's not a bad price and had slices of Chashu and noodles in a flavorful Miso soup. The soup/meal was actually pretty good and comforting. This bowl of soup would definitely warm me up in a cold winter night in San Francisco. I got my ramen soup very fast and the service was also good.Friends used credit cards for their meals. But I paid my meal in cash.The 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. My mom in law doesn't like Asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in Indonesia. BF and I are food adventurous- them not so much. It's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. We like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. They shared a tonkatsu ramen and a pork belly bowl. They said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. BF tried the Miso ramen- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. It's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. They are very similar though. I went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as "cold noodle salad". The cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. It has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). I also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some green onion and nori. The service is friendly and attentive. I always appreciate places that have very nice servers. I have a habit of talking about the service and I think maybe I should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. Miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)Update 9/13Brought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. They didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the pork belly bowl. I got hiyashi chuka again since I love that dish and they do it well here. I also got a mini mentaiko bowl. Not for everyone, but I like spicy roe and rice.Update 10/26Nothing better than soup on a crappy day. Shoyu Ramen this time. It's good. I think Tonkatsu is my favorite, but I'll order this again. Sometimes I feel a bit of variety. I always get a belly bowl though :-) It's noms.Update 11/07 Tried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. You can now order it as such. Keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. I think this is my favorite broth. Tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. Shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than I want. Marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. This is what I'll be ordering from now on. I will try to ask if I can do a shoyu miso as well since I think that would be a good, more delicate balance. Update 11/16Got a belly bowl, but also tried their gyoza. It's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. I was in the mood for them, but not something I'd get often I think.Finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in Vegas - Monta Noodle House.  Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)This place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)I went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.The Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.We also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.  A side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.There's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for "Kaedama."  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).Service was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.Update!  I returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.Very good ramen.  I've been here about five times and I like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  But it is very filling.  Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.I highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.If the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.It's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.Strange - i thought for sure i wrote a review on Monta.I have to rate their Tonkatsu Ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me, considering i eat out at least 7 meals/ week, it takes a lot to rate so high.  It ain't the fanciest , it ain't the cheapest but it's simply, just right.  Add the roast pork, the egg and corn to the ramen and it's ALL GOOD  !!!Base price is $7 but adding the extras puts it over $10.  I always share the bowl with the gf, along with either get the pork belly bowl or the gyoza but  the star of the show is the ramen.  Raku and Monta in the same shopping center ...nice !My first experience with authentic Japanese ramen, and I was not disappointed. Prior to Monta, the only types of ramen I ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually Korean in descent and instant in nature. So I was surprised, in a good way, when I discovered that Japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen I've eaten before. My boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so I immediately suggested Monta Noodle House after remembering all the positive reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. The restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in Japan (at least in my mind). Service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. After reading over the menu, he ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu and a Mini Mentaiko while I ordered the Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen and an order of Gyoza. Here is the breakdown of the food:Gyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory. Miso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. Mini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted. Overall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom.Wanting a light lunch, we headed on over to Chinatown to get our Ramen on. This place is located not far from the Vegas strip in a little shopping center. The restaurant is on the smaller side, yet has a comfey vibe. Our waitress was friendly and gave us a moment to look over the simple menu they have. I ordered:Shoyu Ramen- Brown and clear color broth, based on a chicken and vegetable stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that's tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. Added a seasoned hard boiled egg to the soup.For $6.95 they hook it up with a large bowl filled with equal amounts of broth and noodles. The seasoned hard boiled egg was delish and not dry or rubbery. Added some garlic paste and that soup was the biznass!! Friendly service + great prices = One happy full customer!!!YUM YUM YUM...YUMMY Alert!!!  Me and my fiance finally checked this place out and have eaten there two more times. When you finally find it in this strip mall the whole in the wall is a treasure. You can tell you are there because there is always people waiting out side and cars all around the one door.This place is SMALL and HOT! There is a little wrap around bar that holds about 6-8 people and then maybe 5 tables. It is warm in there but no one seems to care. Everyone just eats there hot ramen noodles in the hot restaurant.The ramen is so yummy! Get the egg added to your soup. That is the only add on I would recommend. I have had two of the broths and they are so rich and yummy.  You really cannot go wrong. This place is NOODLEISH!Monta neighbors Nakamura-Ya, & Raku. With an authentic sushi place to join the strip mall, this is the spot to get some kick-butt Japanese food. Monta is a ramen-specialty restaurant that is not to be skipped!RAMEN: Their menu is small but mighty. What kind of ramen you like? Miso, Shoyu, or Tonkatsu? They come with thin slices of char-siu pork. Ichiza actually has my favorite char-siu.... but Monta's is a solid second. Overall, the ramen here is far superior anyway. There's also a variety of toppings you can add for an additional cost. Generally, I order the same thing every time: Miso Ramen w/ Egg & Nori. YUM! I've sampled every type of soup but Miso is my favorite. The broth is rich & flavorful and I can't find it as good anywhere else.APPETIZERS: If fish eggs are your thing, Monta has the freshest Mentaiko in Las Vegas. Order a Mini Mentaiko Bowl (Rice, Mentaiko, Scallion)--throw some soy sauce & togarashi on it as a delicious starter. Gyoza here are good too but nothing to get excited over.OTHER: There's a board on the wall that has the other entree items. On different occasions I've seen some type of cold noodles, rice bowls, and fried rice. My memory fails to remember the rest but so far none of them interested me enough to try. A client of mine recommended to try the cold noodles.... maybe next time.Come for the Ramen, Stay for the Ramen, Come Back for the Ramen--good eats.I gotta agree 100% with respected Yelper: Tien N's review. He was the only guy brave enough to leave a low rating for Monta. Personally, I think that most people are riding the bandwagon and just rating this place up because everyone else is. I came again today, and just couldn't enjoy the Ramen here like I used to. Like most of my Yelp friends already know, I am somewhat an expert at Ramen. During my college years, my friend Takeichi and I went on a bizarre and pointless quest across the West Coast in order to eat Miso Ramen at every single famous Ramen house in America. 30 days and over 50 Ramen houses later, we declared ourselves Ramen Masters.Ramen has a lot of historical and cultural significance to the Japanese people. After the defeat of the Imperial forces in WW2, Japan had practically become a poverty stricken 3rd world country. It was around then that Ramen became extremely popular due to how cheap the ingredients were. There was one Ramen house in San Diego which I visited years ago, that had the exact variation of post WW2 Ramen. The Ramen itself was practically a less salty version of Shio. It had absolutely nothing in it besides for noodles and salt water. That means, you get no charsiu, egg, or vegetables. Personally, I thought it was the worst bowl of Ramen I have ever had. The owner of the Ramen house told me that the only reason she serves this depressing version of Ramen is because of it's cultural significance. At least Monta doesn't have anything that bad...    I guess the reason I originally liked Monta was because I was so used to eating the extremely spicy style of Ramen from California, so when I first had Monta's Miso Ramen it was so different that I actually thought it was good. I can't identify which regional variation of Ramen is served at Monta. Me and Takeichi think that it might be a specific Shibuya variation, but we just can't come to a positive conclusion. But, we do believe though that it definitely is some kind of Tokyo variation.I myself have begun to believe that the Miso Ramen at Monta is actually a combination of Toyko style and a random American style. In the 1960s, Ichiro Mashita created the "California Roll" because Americans kept complaining to him that his rolls that had Otoro in it tasted like garbage.  I kind of think that Monta's recipe is the "California Roll" of the Ramen world. And that's why it's rare to find a full-blooded Japanese person eating here.Weird observation:The Tonkatsu and the Miso Ramen here at Monta taste almost identical. This is very unusual. Those two should never taste that  similar.One of my friends who is full-blooded Korean always refused to come here with us. When I asked him why, he said it was because Koreans believe that Ramen is "the food of the Rats". I don't know what that's supposed to mean....It is just so difficult to move around here. The seats are designed for people who are less than 5'5" and weight around 120lbs. The stools at the bar area are very uncomfortable. Walking to the bathroom is difficult because you keep having to bump into other customers and the girls at the cash register. It's common for Ramen houses to be small, even the most popular Ramen house in America(Orochon) only seats like 20 people and the chairs are very uncomfortable. But, somehow Monta is far worse. Like 90% of the customers here are yelpers. Every time I come here I recognize someone from their Yelp picture. When I was here today, I overheard a person talking about how Monta is "the greatest" and Anime Ramen is "fake ramen". To me, Anime Ramen is far better than Monta. Anime actually gives you gigantic portions of bamboo, mushrooms, corn, eggs, and charsiu for free, while Monta charges extra and only gives about 1 tbsp of micro-sized diced bamboo. Today, I ordered extra butter and I got a teaspoon. At Sora or Anime, they would have loaded my bowl with butter. Also, at Sora and Anime, the bowls are at least 30% larger.  But, the best thing about Anime is that they give you 3 slices of Narutomaki for free.  Also, the guy who runs Anime Ramen is a guy named Ryosuke and his dad is one of the most  famous traditional Japanese sushi chefs in America, so I don't understand where this "non-japanese" rumor is coming from.   I still believe that Monta has the best Shoyu Ramen, but out of the 3 major Ramen houses in LV(Monta,Anime,Sora), I gotta say that Monta has the worst Miso Ramen. Maybe the reason why Monta has bad Miso Ramen is because it is a Toyko style Ramen house. And Toyko style Ramen houses always specialize in Shoyu. While, it is the Sapporo style Ramen houses that always specifically specialize in Miso Ramen(Miso Ramen was invented in the city of Sapporo).  But, I still love the excellent customer service here, so I'll give Monta 3-stars.Ode to Monta's Pork Belly Bowlcue violinHey, I just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   All of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  Yeah this will probably be out of date by the time I hit submit review, but I'll deal with it.   I've been to Monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times I stuck with getting various ramen.  Of those my favorite quickly became the Tonkotsu as I really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  I did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to Tonkotsu.  As a quick aside, I actually found the Tonkotsu-Shoyu to be my least favorite.  The pork was always tender and tasty, and I would almost always get an egg added and I tried most of the other additions as well.   I personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though I did like the Mustard Leaf on occasion.  For an appetizer I had the Gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   Then one day I decided to split a pork belly bowl with a friend as an appetizer.  Game change.   It's seriously all I think about when I think of Monta now.  As much as I enjoyed the Ramen whenever I'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  Currently saving up for an engagement ring.  Pork Belly Bowl will make a lovely bride.Service is always friendly if a little rushed, and I always thought the overall price was decent.Still need to try Anime and Sora so no comparison on Ramens unfortunately, but unless they have Pork Belly Bowl on their menu, it might not matter.Monta Ramen: The 411 and maybe something different than the 559 other Monta reviews...Location: 1 block West of Decatur on Spring Mountain Road. It's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the North side of Spring Mountain. Signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.  Parking: Limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. Can be tight to park if crowded. Monta is small. Square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. Don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door. Seating. They have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. If you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you. Food: I walked in here skeptical. 559 Yelp reviews. Lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about Monta. I came to try it, and I came in a bad mood to boot. I ordered Miso Ramen with extra slices of charziu. And I had an OMG moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and I left the bowl totally empty. I will say that Ramen Sora has better charziu, hands down. But the overall experience I had at Monta was superior in every other aspect.  Special Notes: Monta's Miso Ramen has a bit more oil in the broth. It's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. But it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. If you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some Shout wipes on hand is essential. Overall Impression? I loved it. From the wide range of people I ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the Miso Ramen to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why Monta inspires such a range of emotion. For me, this was an experience I won't soon forget, and I can't wait to go back and have more of it.YES PLEASE, MORE PLEASE.Loved this cute little place. And it's CHEAP!  under $8 for a huge bowl of wholesome goodness.  It is a really small place, so keep that in mind, people were definitely waiting outside to get in.  But the food comes out fast, in fact, our dinner came out before our appetizer, which wasn't optimal but was OK.Service was meh in my opinion which is why it was 4 stars instead of 5.  It was FREEZING in here, they have the fans on blast, way too cold for both of us.  But once they serve you the steaming goodness in a bowl it does warm up a bit, but not that much. Tip-move the fans to the kitchen to help the workers out but it was too cold for us.I ordered my Pork Ramen w/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg. It's worth the other $1.50 or whatever it is they charge you, it was delicious.Great for a cold day too!During my last 3 visits here to MONTA I did not see even one Japanese person eating or waiting in the 2 hour long line. Do you know why it is that the Japanese community in LV has turned their back on MONTA? There are many reasons.....I was confused. I was really confused. Why was I not a fan of MONTA? Every Chinese person kept telling me that MONTA was "the best". Every Korean woman kept telling me that it was "the best". Even their white husbands kept telling me that MONTA is "the best". My Mexican-American and Black foster kids kept telling me that Monta was "the best". Why is it that I didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? Am I just not Japanese enough to enjoy MONTA? My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese-American and he did marry a Korean woman, so maybe that Korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. But then I started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in Japan kept insisting that MONTA was NOT "the best", In fact they thought it was "the worst". So I came to the conclusion that Japanese people just don't like MONTA like everyone else does. Personally, I think MONTA is  the California Roll of Ramen. It's a slightly Americanized variation, just like how the California Roll is an Americanized variation of traditional Maki. MONTA's ramen belongs to no true Japanese region.  It's made in America like Burgers and Fries. No one eats comfortably at MONTA. The place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. The counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on Maryland and Flamingo.  The bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. There is never any parking in the lot. Frequently, I just drive across the street to Shuseki(A Chinese-Japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  MONTA is the most popular ramen-ya in Vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? One of the wealthy Korean business owners who is a member of my Asian-American Activism agency informed me that Seoul Plaza(where Monta is located) has the cheapest rent in Chinatown.  The owner of MONTA is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave Seoul Plaza.  Cheapness is the main reason! And Cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at MONTA is only half the size of the other 4 major Ramen-Ya's in LV. And Cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. You gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! How cheap is that!!! If you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. You can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at Fukumimi. The Deluxe Ramen at Sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.The f*cking hipsters! This is a major reason why the Japanese have left MONTA.  Hipsters are usually White people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or Chinatowns. I don't know why, but hipsters think it's "lame" being around other Whites. Unfortunately, they have chosen MONTA as their "COOL MINORITY HANGOUT SPOT!". As a Japanese-American, do I wanna sit with a bunch of guys with " David Lynch Eraserhead" haircuts who wear Geek-Sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? Do I wanna sit with a 6 foot 4" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: Indie Rock, Indie Flicks,  Jesus(aka Obama), Apple Products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  My response= THAT'S IT! NO MORE!  I'M F*CKING OUT OF HERE! I'M GOING TO FUKUMIMI!By the way... How f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? While I'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, I always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. This is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat. MONTA has the worst Gyoza in LV. It tastes like the Chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). And they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. That's like a dollar a piece!! Walk 2 minutes to Shuseki for a much better gyoza.Why did my egg come from the Alley? They ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? Are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?A Japanese restaurant is supposed to have Kim-Uchi, not Kimchi. I saw with my own eyes, the cook here at MONTA going to Greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of Korean Kimchi. At Fukumimi, Katsu-San makes his own Kim-Uchi which is slightly sweeter than Korean Kimchi. It's a true Japanese variation of a classic Korean dish.  #$@!*$#%$ *%#!  F*CK I JUST HIT THAT 5001 WORD LIMITI still think Monta is tasty, but it's just not as tasty as I used to think it was.While Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.The Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.A couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.And of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles.On my last trip to Vegas, I finally got to eat at the legendary Monta Ramen.  This place has been on my "to do" list since I lived here 3 yrs ago.  I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.I ordered:Small Fried Rice, $3.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTawTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGgMiso Ramen (no meat), $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQThe portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.Other notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.Did it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.Return Factor - 80%When I think of Ramen, I think of Instant Cup O Noodles or the Pre Packaged ones that you pay like 5 bucks for a big bulk box at Wal Mart.Not until a friend of my wife mentioned this place that we stopped by to check it out. That's when I found out that this is not your ordinary dollar store ramen. Their menu is pretty simple. You pick which noodle bowl you want, choose whatever you want to add to it (like a hard boiled egg for example) for an extra charge of course.They also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.Service is above average and it should be because you can only fit so many people in this tiny place. So slow service with an excuse of "Sorry, we are really busy today"  will not fly with me. Memo to those that eat here: Once you're done eating, please pay and move on with your life! I have seen people finish their meal and proceed to just shoot the breeze for another 15 to 20 minutes while you have 6 to 10 people waiting for a spot.Some random info. Make sure to sign in to your right as soon as you come in so they know who got next. Don't just stand there and expect for them to remember if you came in before somebody else. If you see lots of people outside just standing there, chances are you will be waiting for a bit before getting a table. For those that are chopstick challenged like me, they will not give you a fork unless you ask because you are already given chopsticks by default. All the condiments you need like sesame seeds, soy sauce, etc are right there on your table.So you see their operation is simple. It's just that their space might seem constricting especially if you have claustrophobia.What can I say about Monta. I used to like it. Unfortunately, "used to," is the key word. Today, I keep coming back expecting their classic ramen, best broth, and perfected simplicity. But I now must admit all I have come to expect is disappointment. I have been coming here for about 2-3 years. But now I can't help but second guess my decisions. The service here has seemed to have gone down the drain. They give so much attitude and don't really care about the customers. You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. I'm not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key. Now to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didn't seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? To this I'm sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this "new" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past.I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!Nose ~ Smells good!.Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!Tummy ~ Satisfied.3 1/2 stars. Came in for lunch during the week. I sat at the counter due to the full house and went with the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg and extra chashu.Sitting at the counter I was able to watch them prepare the ramen and noticed there was a chef in training. When I received my bowl all looked decent and tasted good with the exception that the ramen was overcooked and soggy. The patron next to me received his bowl and he ordered double meat and they only give him a single serving also which wasn't cool either. Service was decent, but lets get it together in the kitchen!After having ramen from the restaurant down the road,  I was quite disappointed in Monte Ramen.  It was relatively easy to find...on the right side of Spring Mountain Road as you drive east. The parking lot is shared with other busy restaurants.  I could feel a slight breeze from the air conditioning which was really helpful since it was 100 degrees outside! The interior was small and dark. There were 5 tables and 9 counter seats. There were a few chairs for customers to wait for a table. Make sure you get your name on the clipboard! The gyoza was shocking. ..it looked pale and undercooked,  like it was just fried on one of its 3 sides.  The inside was bland and flat tasting. On the other hand,  the miso broth was really salty and the noodles were too soft. I didn't finish it.  The toppings of green onion, bamboo shoots & black fungus were room temperature as if they were hastily thrown on the top. I would only go back if the competition down the road was full and if there was no line.  If there was a line,  go to the other restaurants right next door!  Sorry...Monta Ramen, a top ramen restaurant in Vegas, provides good food, but it is not worth the long wait. Although the nitamago (soft boiled egg) had a great texture, it was bland and lacked the distant soy sauce flavor. My friend's spicy tonkotsu ramen had pork with great proportion of fat and meat; yet, the soup was not spicy by all means. I recommend going to Monta Ramen at 11:30 a.m., its opening time, in order to avoid the wait.First off, I'm a huge ramen eater.I came on a Saturday with two other people for dinner at around 6pm.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  Once seated, I went for their Miso based ramen with added garlic oil, chili, egg, and corn.  It was delicious!  My only complaint was it was very salty.  Not overwhelmingly salty, but salty.  The ramen was the perfect texture.  The meat was good and everything went together really well.  My sister went for their Shoyu ramen, which is soy sauce based.  I had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  If you want a healthier choice, the Shoyu would be the one to go with.  We also ordered one Mini Mentaiko bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  But later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.  For 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  It was very reasonable.  The service was very fast.  Our food came out super fast.  The inside of this place is teeny tiny.  There's about 5 small tables and the bar that's it.  Prepare to wait on the weekends.PS... if you have a crying baby/child, this is not the place to bring him or her.Yes, yes, and yes.This is definitely the best ramen I've had in Vegas, though it's still at an average quality compared to many places here in LA. It's a small restaurant so there is definitely waiting involved but luckily some of my friends went earlier and put our party down on the list so I myself did not have to wait too long.I tried the tonkatsu shoyu ramen, but asked them to switch to thick chewy noodles since that's the way I like it. Hungover Aileen enjoyed the broth very much and it wasn't too salty, which is much appreciated. The noodles were the perfect texture. The chasu was also incredibly tender and just the right portion for me since I was able to get some in every bite of noodles.The service by the older woman was so attentive and kind, while the younger waitress gave off the vibe that she was too cool for school. Regardless, the food was quick and good so I have no complaints.Monta Ramen serves "KURUME" style Tonkotsu Ramen from Fukuoka. It's a broth made from selected pork bones and special soy sauce imported from Japan. Nice!!Small but clean ramen spot, Monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door. The Kuro Ramen was black & impressive, the Tokotsu Ramen was creamy and deep. Both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. The fried rice was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Service was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. The whole time, i felt rushed. The glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting. Other than that, yes! i'm a fan!!Good For Kids: YesHighchair: YesAsked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. It was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. Wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. Ordered the Special on the Spicy Ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the fried rice was really good. Would come here again if they didnt have the wait.

Review Text :
Carnitas Guanajuato is located in the old Knife and Fork building on Sharon Amity. When you get our of your car, it smells like roasted meat, rotisserie chicken or grilling pork, it smells delicious. The menu has the mandatory, basic Mexican restaurant items, but where they differ, they offer all kinds of meat, kind of reminded me of a Peruvian restaurant. By the looks of the photos on the menu, they pile the plates high. One item caught my eye, a pound of pulled pork, yes please. I would like a large plate of pork, enough to feed four. I decided on ordering queso, guacamole and an al pastor taco. So when the server came around, I ordered, refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, and guacamole. There were so many little dishes on the table,  they also greet you with three salsas, pico and lemons. (LOVE) Every little dish on the table was delicious, you wanted to keep putting different salsas on bites, each bite would be a blast of comfort and heat! What a rush!We never made it to round two for the tacos. Maybe a reason to return today!Sad to report it looked like beer only. No tequila. Gasp.

Review Text :
Coming here twice in the last week just for their pork must make it 5 stars!  I took Janel's advice in her review and went with the double order of the pork for the BBQ combo the second time around.  The crispy juiciness of the meat mixed with the fat was phenomenal.  I've neglected Chinese spots with hanging meat for too long.  I used to eat this stuff at least once a week.    The duck is also tasty but I recommend asking for a breast cut.  Some pieces of the thigh were straight up skin and fat.  While some people appreciate it, I am not one of them.  I also had their chicken chow fun which is something I'll certainly order again.  The service is also pretty friendly compared to most Chinese places around but it's all about the pork!Wanted something cheap, good and quick so we stopped in for lunch. I've heard so much about their BBQ so we ordered up a 2 BBQ combination rice plate. The roast pork has a awesome crunchy skin and the bbq pork is juicy and succulent. Definitely good for the price and I would order BBQ from here again. They also give you a bowl of soup, this was beef broth with potato and carrots. We also got shrimp wonton soup with thin egg noodles. The wontons were quality with shrimp, black mushroom and pork. I realized the more I have simple Chinese broth soups the more I feel they're sort've one noted. Just a personal preference, but I think anyone who wants a good wonton noodle soup with some greens will be satisfied.They serve complimentary tea, which was sort've odd tasting. It tasted like moth balls to me and the BF said it was like spinach water.  Servers was friendly when we were ordering, but I wouldn't say there was much service at all. We weren't ever checked on or refilled, we went to the counter to pay. BBQ definitely quality and I would order some to-go of this sometime. It's just one of those places that isn't bad, but didn't impress either. It's good for all the things they do and makes for a good cheap work option.Best chinese BBQ place in town. I guarantee it! Do not go anywhere else. instead of a long paragraph I'm just going to tell you what to orderDO ORDER: - 3 meat combo (crispy pork, roast duck, BBQ pork) over rice *** THE BEST***- won ton noodles (you can choose type of noodle and if you want meat in it)- fried noodles with vegetables on top- chow fun (beef, pork etc)- porridge (w/ thousand yr old egg is my favorite)NOW GOGOGOGOGO!Picture it, three Asian dudes and one Midwest white dude who never acquired a taste for "Asian" food."I'll order for everyone OK?" says my bud, fluent in Cantonese.  Mutterings of indifference. A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims "why couldn't we eat that", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.The waitress answers for us "You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish".  To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pur√©ed innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.Good eats for sure.300th review for Yelp! Crazy how time flies...So I am a little late to the game, just finding out about Asian BBQ and Noodles recently...but better late than never!Came here with Grandpa, so I decided it would be a great time to try a BBQ combination platter! We chose the Roasted Pork Belly, Roasted Duck, and BBQ Pork. Pork Belly was good, tender and flavorful with a very crispy skin. The Roast Duck was outstanding! Very juicy, flavorful and not gamey at all. The BBQ Pork was the highlight for me...great smokey BBQ taste, beautiful smoke rings and lots and lots of flavor! I'd say the Roasted Duck and the BBQ Pork are the best I've ran into so far!Also tried the Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce. Good stuff! Came out piping hot, fresh, and yummy...good distraction from all the meat and rice This was too much food for two people! And the prices are very reasonable, with rice bowls starting at $6.50 with choice of BBQ meat!  All of this cost less than a $20 bill for two people.  Just remember, cash only!I love finding new places I can get excited about...a very worthy #300 in my book!I arrived to Las Vegas mid afternoon since my flight was delayed several hours. Once picking up my rental car I headed over asap to Asian BBQ & noodles. Located in a strip center parking was no issue,  possibly BC it was hot.I ordered won ton soup and the combo roast pork & roast duck over rice. The won ton soup was decent but not as bomb as Noodle boy in Rosemead Cali. What was outstanding was the roast pork which was tender, moist, crunchy skin and yummy. The duck was pretty good and of course the duck sauce on the rice made the entree.Service is prompt but the help is your typical Asian joint - to the point and without a smile. Cash only :+(I agree with the consensus here. The roast pork is phenomenal. The perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy meat. It is little angels dancing in your mouth when you eat it. The BBQ pork and duck are alright in my opinion, good but nothing to go crazy over.If you order a two meat combo with rice, you get your money's worth. No question. I have only ordered off the menu and not off their a la carte buffet. I want to but with the language barrier I am sure it would be too difficult.However, as much as I love this place I haven't been as much as I would like because sometimes ordering can be very frustrating here. I swear I think they understand me but choose not to. Last visit, I wanted to scream. I was that frustrated. Because of the ordering I have to give this place a 3 star. I feel that if I walk away from an experience more annoyed, then something is wrong.GETTING MY ASIAN BBQ FIXIt's been at least three years since we had last visited this Hong Kong style deli noodle house. As the Las Vegas Asian community has grown exponentially during the past two decades, this sort of restaurant fulfills a most important culinary appetite for rice plates and noodles with barbeque deli meats. In Chinese communities throughout the world it is an essential food business on every block. Breakfast is the rice porridge or congee while afternoon and evenings are rice plates and bowls of noodles of all  varieties. Here at Asian BBQ & Noodles it's no different.It's the Asian version of McDonalds...with one exception, it's better and never boring.Best spot for Chinese noodles in Las Vegas! The wait can be insane on weekends during lunch time. I've waited 30 min to an hour on Sundays for a table...usually if this is the case I'd just leave but my grandma absolutely loves this place. This is not the nicest chinese restaurant that you'll find in Las Vegas but the food is great! They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees. My go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.Most of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.4 1/2 stars. Arrived for dinner In the early evening during the week. I definitely  prefer this place over the local Sam Woo due to far better quality and service. I came in earlier for lunch but it was so crowded I departed.We started off with a won ton soup noodles to share and followed with a entr√©e of double meat delicacy - pork belly roast pork and soy sauce chicken. Both meats were cooked perfectly - pork belly crispy on the exterior with just the right amount of fat for flavor and the chicken was fresh and you could taste the freshness. Chow fun was just as solid as the other entrees and was a generous serving. Service by the older waitresses was solid and one of them spoke Vietnamese and Cantonese. Impressive food and service so I'm upping my average rating here.If you're looking for the best Asian roast pork belly in Vegas - look no further. In addition to the bomb Asian BBQ here the wonton noodle soup and seafood chow mein Hong Kong style are a few of my faves.Service is decent, but you'll want to arrive early for the lunch and or dinner hour since the place is popular and gets busy.  Bring your Jackson bills because plastic is unacceptable and you'll be washing dishes to settle your bill otherwise. Waitresses here aren't out of your way friendly but cordial and get the requests filled when made - pretty typical of most Asian establishments. Come here for the solid food you won't be disappointed.Items Selected:Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork, Roasted Belly Pork ComboRoasted Duck Shrimp Dumpling Noodle SoupRoasted Pork and Preserved Egg Congee Seafood Dry NoodleLocated in the same plaza as Chada Thai as well as China Mama, and on my 'to-do' list since a few days after relocating to Sin City, it was finally on a Saturday evening that I met a friend at Asian BBQ & Noodle - the only two Caucasians to set foot in the place between the hours of 6:30 and 7:45pm proving to be a very good thing.Tight yet tidy, with a Cash-Only policy that proves no issue as items trend far cheaper than one might expect when considering the quality and quantity of the food, it was at the last remaining table that the two of us squeezed in and navigating the concise menu it was to the amusement of us both that the waitress' eyebrows raised as preserved egg porridge was ordered, not to mention three additional plates.Waiting mere moments for orders to be prepared, several to-go customers popping in and out as my friend sipped potent iced tea while I opted for water, it was first the aforementioned cauldron of congee that arrived and almost as if to award our "adventurous" order the creamy bowl of rice was absolutely chock-a-block full of both crispy pork and blackened egg, each bite a new adventure with baby bok choy, chives, scallions, and mushrooms also joining the mix.Next brought the barbeque plate, a bountiful trio of meats with crispy belly pork outperforming supple flesh of barbeque and excessively bony duck, it was an interesting contrast to see the same fowl deboned in a steaming bowl of soup fare much better, the skin softened only slightly by broth while long-style noodles were springy and plethoric, a half-dozen tender dumplings fully packed with nicely seasoned shrimp.Well aware that we had over-ordered, but happy that my friend would have a couple meals the following day at a grand tally of $60 inclusive of tax and tip, it was with a substantial plate of dry noodles that the meal would end, and although the seafood was undoubtedly frozen and rather par for the course, it was the melange of mushrooms that helped to prop up the plate, each featuring a distinct earthy flavor that worked in concert with the vegetables and gravy to offer a flavor both savory and a touch sweet, a nice compliment to the otherwise rich dishes more rich with fatty cuts of meat.A bit disappointed by the duck and seafood, though universally impressed by the pork, portions, and price there is little question as  to why Asian BBQ & Noodles remains a local favorite, the frequency of return limited only by a somewhat limited menu and several more Chinatown spots to explore.

-A nice, variety of Chinese food, plus some salad bar fixins, jello, desserts, and some American food.-Seven buffet islands, plus the Sushi area = eight total areas of food to choose from.-Clean restaurant. Pleasant decor.-VERY friendly, coridial staff.-Food was really good & fresh for a Chinese buffet. Tasty & delicious!-Drinking water did not taste filtered (usually from the soda machine), it tasted like Phoenix tap.-Convenient parking.-The ladies restroom smelled like sewer (not like someone who just made a stinky in the stall, but the foul aroma of a sewage drain)...-Despite the smelly restroom, I would definately eat here again!

I really love Vietnamese Food and this little restaurant is easily a favorite of mine. Cuisine from the Hue region of Vietnam is a little different than your typical soup places. No Pho here ... so get ready.The owner is really cool and extremely helpful. It was fun on my first visit. She wanted to make sure I understood this type of cuisine and how it should be eaten. They take great effort to make sure the food is packed full of flavor and beautifully presented at the same time. Nice!So far I have tried several of the soups and a good sampling of their tasty bite sized appetizers. Bun Bo Hue - Spicy Beef SOUP is a good place to start. The Crab and Shrimp versions are also excellent as well as the Duck. They have some really good specials during the week that will fill you up cheap. Just ask her and she will tell you what is good.Located in the Mekong Plaza Food Court. The eating area here is pretty basic with a dozen or so community tables and chairs. Just kick back and enjoy yourself and pretend you are on a vacation adventure. It usually works for me. DID I HEAR SOUP?4.75 STARSThis place has some fantastic food.  No MSG, no corn starch, just simply the food with no fillers to bolster the flavors.  Just enter Mekong Plaza through the northern most doors and walk directly back to the food court.  You practically walk right to Hue Gourmet.  Don't let the food court atmosphere fool you.  The food here is quite tasty and the owner is happy to tell you all about the food and how they prepare it.I have been here on several occasions for foodie lunches (got to try a lot of different things) and lunch with friends.   I've gone here for lunch most days and I'm partial to the Banh kahn cua.  I recommend this place for folks who enjoy food!Return Potential:  90%

I'm so glad there is finally a place to go in the East Valley that has the energy and vibe of a downtown Phoenix club. The best part is, it is literally steps away from the Sycamore lightrail stop (last stop on the line).They just started 2-4-1 on Thursdays and considering my summer work hours are Mon-Thu, this is going to be my Thursday night spot.The Happy Hours prices are fantastic. Heck, their normal hour prices are fantastic! Happy Hour is everyday from 3 - 7PM and again Sun - Wed 10PM to Close. Most places have cut their happy hours from 4 - 6PM so how refreshing that I can still make it to a happy hour after work. They offer $2 small plates, which is the perfect size for me (I have a Lap-Band), but also gives customers the chance to taste a variety of the menu. Drinks specials range from $1 off drafts and bottles (reg $3-$4), $1 off wells, $2 off wine (reg $5-$8) and $8 off bottled wine (reg $18-$30). Plus they have all day weekly specials. Everything can be found on their website.Food is great and kitchen is open until 10PM on weekdays. I had the roasted poblano hummus and their green garlic fries. Very addictive! My friends sampled the wrap, chicken avocado club sandwich, and the blackened ahi burger.The bar has almost every vodka and flavor imaginable, thus their extensive and unique martini selection. The staff is personable and by the second time you visit, they will probably remember your name and anything you talked about at your last visit.The interior is modern with touches of leather and steel. The colors are my personal favorite: black, red, and white. There are 3 VIP/loung areas, a dance floor, and DJ booth. The bar is this incredible layered and intricute colors of biege, black and silver granite. The place is just stunning and you feel like you're in Scottsdale or Phoenix.The Grand Opening last weekend was packed and I truly hope every person returns. I am elated that this establishment has chosen my neighborhood and my type of friends to be of service to. Stop in, introduce yourself to the staff, and make this place your regular.

Review Text :
EPIC FAILURE! I am BOYCOTTING Coriander India Grill for life! I used to be a huge fan (See my previous review), but I had a horrible experience there on Christmas Day 2012, which has TURNED ME OFF FOR LIFE! I'm an event planner for Meetup.com. In 2012, I planned a Holiday Dinner at Coriander India Grill for December 25, 2012. I CALLED & CONFIRMED a reservation with the owner 3 weeks in advance, and had his assurance that his kitchen could handle taking individual dinner orders and writing separate checks for an estimated group of 20 people. I even asked if he would have enough kitchen and wait staff to handle our group and was ASSURED that they would be well-staffed, and it wouldn't be a problem.On Dec. 25, 2012, 18 people from Meetup attended the All-Holidays Dinner at Coriander. Soon after my arrival, I got into a 10-minute heated debate with one of the waiters, as I tried to confirm that each person would receive a separate check. The owner/manager, Victor, had COMPLETELY FAILED to communicate this information to his wait staff, and the waiter was refusing (at first) to write separate checks. THIS IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME AS AN EVENT PLANNER! It's a nightmare to try and split a check with 18 people! It took a while, but the waiter finally agreed to my request--after I asked to speak to the owner. But, I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO DEBATE this in the first place--when the owner had confirmed with me over the phone 3 weeks earlier that this would not be a problem! That argument took time away from my friends, and away from my enjoyment of this event.After that issue was resolved, and we had all ordered our food, one of my members got up, put on his coat, and started to leave--before his food had even arrived! I asked him why he was leaving so soon, and he informed me that his WATER GLASS HAD LIPSTICK ON THE RIM, and he had to ask for a new glass! Then, when he took his silverware out of his napkin, THE NAPKIN HAD LIPSTICK ON IT, TOO! And, the butter knife was dirty. This person had planned on enjoying a meal with friends, but was so disgusted that he got up and left. I was horrified, and now embarrassed that I had even recommended this restaurant. I apologized to the group and convinced them to stay! (We had already ordered, and where else could we go--last minute--on Christmas Day?)I'm still not sure how someone FAILS to notice lipstick on the rim of a water glass while setting a table. It was not that dark in the restaurant. After that person left, things got even worse!!!I don't know if it the staff was intentionally punishing us for "daring" to ask for separate checks or complaining about lipstick on a glass and napkin. I don't know if the owner had deceived me on the phone weeks earlier when he assured me there would be enough kitchen staff to accommodate our group. What I DO KNOW IS THAT IT TOOK OVER 90 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD!!! I suspect this was a PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE MOVE on their part meant to punish us--because--many people who got seated AFTER US at nearby tables, got served their food BEFORE US!The final insult for me came when I spoke to the owner/manager, Victor, at the end of the night, and he REFUSED TO APOLOGIZE for anything! I can understand having a bad night. We're all human. But, apparently the words, "I'm sorry" don't exist in his vocabulary. He was completely UNAPOLOGETIC. He acted like these things were perfectly normal and acceptable, and there was no apology whatsoever, and no assurance that these things wouldn't happen again. It was his attitude, as much as the problems, which made me decide to never set food inside that restaurant ever again Lipstick on a glass of water and napkin is NOT NORMAL! Failing to convey important information to your staff after CONFIRMING SEPARATE CHECKS with a customer by phone is unacceptable. And not apologizing for your mistakes is also UNACCEPTABLE.Also worth noting:  the restaurant was not that busy when our group first arrived, and only about half the tables were full at that point. Victor used the excuse that they were very busy that night, and that it's "normal" to wait 90 minutes for food to be served in a busy restaurant. I disagree. That was one of the longest waits for dinner I have EVER experienced in my LIFE! And, I had specifically asked him if it would be a problem--if he would have enough kitchen staff to handle it--and he had assured me it would not be a problem. Obviously, he was wrong.What a TERRIBLE WAY to run a business when you alienate one of your very best customers who happens to be the MAIN ORGANIZER of a Dining Group! His refusal to apologize when clearly he and his staff made a SERIES of mistakes was infuriating! I have brought many people there in the past, but after this TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE, I will never return, and I will be telling my friends the story of their EPIC FAILURE and BAD SERVICE for years to come.

Restaurant name  Hong Kong Asian Diner

Review Text :
I would have never known about this Hong Kong Chinese restaurant unless the waitress at Saigon Pho ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-pho-chandler#hrid:K7dcALr_WARav3-SqLC4LA ) hadn't recommended it! Kudos to her! We discovered that the waitress had virtually the same taste in Chinese cooking as my sister and myself! She even liked Wong's  Place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/wongs-place-tempe#hrid:r9k_c5ki5lhCkm9wOsj8Hg ) on Baseline in Tempe. Tonight we decided on her recommendation of Hong Kong Asian Diner.Stuffed Meat To-Fu (*** 1/2 $5.95) The most subtle tasting entree that we had this evening. We probably should not have ordered it along with the Fish Ball entree, Salty Fish Fried Rice or Singapore Vermecelli. Our fault, not the restaurant's! The flavor was very subtle. You will see a slab of Tofu cut into eight thick squares... each Tofu square is topped with a piece of Shrimp and liberally sprinkled with small Peanut chunks. Chinese Broccoli flanked the sides of the Tofu, which was immersed in a White Gravy. Nice looking presentation.Sizzling Black Bean Sauce Fish Balls (***** $7.95) There is some problem in translation with this entree. The "Fish Balls" are actually Filet of Fish... not the Fish Balls you'd associate with Pho! The problem is the absolute direct translation from the Chinese lettering on the menu. The Filets are sauteed in a Black Bean Brown Gravy along with Green and Red Peppers and big chunks of Onions. We enjoyed this a lot!Salty Fish / Chicken Fried Rice (***** $7.95) Unlike other traditional Cantonese restaurants, the Chicken is fried golden brown (before being added to the Fried Rice), along with bigger chunks of Salty Fish to create this Fried RIce! This was one of the dishes unanimously voted best of the evening! Proviso - I hesitate in recommending this Fried Rice to non-Asians, as Salty Fish is an acquired taste.Singapore Vermecelli (***** $7.95) Hong Kong Asian Diner's innovation in this staple Egg Noodle dish is the addition of a lot of Ground Black Pepper, sprinkled profusely on top of the prepared Noodles! It seems like, even though I order this all the time, this was the first time my sister and my friend ever had Singapore Vermecelli. Singapore Vermecelli is a Egg Noodle dish fried with Barbeque Pork and Shrimp and bits of Chicken, also with Green Pepper, Eggs, and Onions, spiced with Curry. Because of the use of Curry, Singapore Vermecelli has been confused as a tropical item from the island of Singapore... when in actuality it's strictly of Chinese origin. Delicious!Pot of Hot TeaSliced Valencia Oranges afterwards.Nice presentation of each entree, especially the Salty Fish Fried Rice and Singapore Vermecelli. You might have a problem with communication... as there is a definite lack of knowledge of English in this restaurant... from the translation in the menus to the wait-staff.There are many Lunch Specials under $6... but you will be disappointed if you don't order off the strictly Chinese Menu even with the bad English translation! Attempts at being a little bit more upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant. Demographics at 9pm: 40% of capacity, 90% Oriental customers.A definite 5-star Chinese restaurant in the Valley! Not just a Cantonese restaurant... but a Hong Kong Cantonese restaurant. Perform some research on the Internet before coming through the door.I use to be a huge fan of this place when I was still a Sun Devil over at ASU.  Prices were good, portions were decent, and the atmosphere was lacking but oh well.  The boss lady is loud and speaks Cantonese and talking with her was always fun.  After moving away from the area, I had stopped coming here.  It was by whim that a group of us stopped in today for a late-lunch/early-dinner.It's the same boss lady, same husband-chef, the same bland decor, and the same food.  The thing that has changed is me.  What I use to rave and crave over no longer seemed as amazing.  We got the sizzling fish fillet with black bean sauce, salt & pepper pork chops, and the seafood & tofu hot pot.  As always, the food came with a complimentary soup.  It was a bone marrow kind of soup with orange peel and beans.  In 106¬∞F weather, I'm not sure if I should be thankful or cursing them.  The restaurant was kept warm as well so it didn't help things.  Oh well, it was free and it was tasty.  Then came a parade of food.  It was all served hot, still a decent size portion for the price, and the flavor was good.  Will my skirt flip for this place?  Probably not.  I wouldn't mind coming back but I won't be going out of my way to come here. 3.5 stars!

The dining room was at capacity when we arrived.  Thankfully, I had the foresight to make reservations, as we were seated within 10 minutes of our target time.  The hostess was fantastic, wish I could say the same about our waiter, who was as elusive as the mythical nessie.  Granted, the place was packed, so I gotta cut him some slack, however, I really cant extend the same graces to his lack of personality and charm.An onion ring appetizer kicked off the culinary cornucopia.  There were about 8 decent sized beer-battered rings, somewhat overcooked, served with a ranch dipping sauce.We both ordered rib-eyes, one bone-in.  Each came with a house salad, and a choice of frys or baked potato.  We opted for the 'loaded' option, sacrificing a pair of Washington's in the process.  The house salad was a standard iceberg mix accompanied with a single slice of cuke, three black olives and a trio of commissary croutons.  It was standard fare.Milady had to ask for bread.  It was ok, slightly warm, paired with cold butter.  We both got to try our hand at "maim the french loaf".The water and arnold had a hint of chlorine, so either they don't filter their water/ice, or they're trying to battle green algae.Now, all previous grievances can be overlooked, based on the performance from the star of the show.  The rib-eye was pretty good.  Not $38 good, but it was tasty.  Great char marks, and cooked to order.  It came with 3 delicious mushrooms.  I'd suggest popping the additional $3 to secure a side of them.The baked potato was medium size, served in tin foil.  It wasn't piping hot, so it took a little longer to melt the butter.  The loaded option included crumbled bacon, sour cream, chives and shredded cheddar, well worth the up-charge.For a high-end steak house, I wouldn't rate it in the same class as Fleming's, Morton's or Houston's, and for the price, your money would be better spent at those places.Understand, I'm not trying to slam DC... it was good.  But for the money, if DC wants to compete with the big boys, they need to visit their competition and take some notes.With that said, I'd rather not see any patronizing responses from the establishment's representatives thanking me for my comments and stating that they strive to create an environment and product pleasing to everyone.  Replied like that are worthless, and show the disregard the author has for the customer's constructive criticism.Went to DC Steak House for dinner with my family on a Sunday night.  This place was packed!  I am glad that I had a reservation as people were being turned away.  Getting seated was a bit of an issue.  Two parties that came in after us were seated before us.  I had to speak to the hostess to ensure we got seated.  The food was great we all enjoyed our meals.  What I did not enjoy was a lot of additional charges.  I did not find out the "small charge" until the bill arrived and no substitutions are allowed.  So if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable.  Even though they are the same price on the menu  These extra charges increased my daughters meal almost 50% and this is not acceptable.The food was good but the service issues may prevent me from returning.Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.This last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!Bottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said "the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out". Cool. No problem, things happen.Out comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.Bill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak! Told the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us "I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.Owner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening! I just said "look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.They literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.Tip for the owner: Look up "cost of doing business" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.Will be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was.

After my first visit, I fell in love with JJ's Delicatessen.  Everything is made-to-order with quality ingredients.  My boyfriend and I stopped by one Sunday morning for some breakfast.  Everything on the expansive menu sounded delicious.  JJ's serves breakfast  (skillets, eggs, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, pastries, etc), lunch and other savory deli items (knish, challah...). Place your order at the counter, grab some coffee and find a seat inside or on the patio.  I ordered an egg white Greek omelette with fresh fruit and a whole wheat bagel (the options included potatoes or fruit and bagel or toast).  My honey had two eggs with fruit and a side of buttermilk pancakes. Our food arrived within minutes of finding a spot on the patio.  What impressed me most about JJ's is the quality of the food.  When ordering an egg white omelette you'd expect less eggs and more veggies than your typical "whole-egg" omelette.  Not so at JJ's.  The veggies were fresh and the egg whites were plentiful.  I finally found a place that caters to my health-nut tendencies without skimping on quantity or flavor.  Did I mention the buttermilk pancakes are phenomenal?JJ himself was helping customers, busing tables and even moving in heating lamps for the chilly patron.  It was nice to have our needs met by the owner himself.  Amazing food, service and down-to-earth atmosphere.  I will be back!

Review Text :
There are few things in life that make me happier than falafel and shawarma.  These guys deliver above average quality for both and I already know I'll be a return customer.The falafel plate was around $11 and it was huge.  The balls themselves were smaller than usual but that was made up for in quantity as you can see from the photo I took.  An overall 3.5 star falafel in the world is pretty much a 5 star falafel in Las Vegas.  The plate also came with my choice of 4 sides to make up my salad side of it.  I went with babaganoush, hummus, a red cabbage salad and their Israeli salad.  It also came with a big side of rice and beans so I pretty much had lunch for the next day.I just HAD to sample the shawarma so being the pig that I am, I got a shawarma sandwich to go too.  The quality of their pita was very good and although I prefer lamb shawarma, their chicken was still great.  They allow to put in whatever you'd like in the sandwich and as much as the pita can fit so I went wild with every little thing.  You should too.  The dining area is OK and teetering on hole in the wall status.  I see myself doing takeout orders for the most part.

First time ever at this location. Nicely decorated all remake stuff of the old time stuff.Clean restaraunt, including the bathrooms.We came really early for dinner. We were running errands and wanted to eat early and get home.They were serving all day,which is a major plus. The hostess gave us lunch menus along with our dinner menu. However, lunch had been over for 25 min.Anyway, our waiter was nice. He bought our drinks and bread quickly.The food is very cheap (price wise) . So for the $$ you cannot complain.But, it really has no flavor, it is very plain.We both chose the soup. Which was really good, Minestrone.Food was good , just not a lot of flavor.Of course it is an Italian place owned by Greeks so they will have things a little differant.After we got our food we sat for a very long time with no drink. Our waiter seemed to of disappered for 20 min. Maybe they have things to do in the back before their shift ends. but, the hostess walked by us several times. I think she should of asked us if we wanted refills.Not a bad place, just not a great place. It served the purpose of a quick , fairly good dinner. They are doing something right, they have been around for years.My 2nd oldest turned 21 baby!! She wanted a dinner party with family and friends and she picked the place, after all it was her night her party!  The place picked for the event was The Old Spaghetti Factory.  The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a place my family has enjoyed going to, from my grandparents to my grandkids, we have all had a nice time, the family use to go to the one out by Newport Beach, then when we moved to Phoenix, we went to the downtown location. So it was no surprise she picked this place.We were a party of 20, when we went to the room were the tables were setup my son in law didn't like the flow of it because it had  1/2 the party on one side and other  1/2 away from them, so we moved some tables around and made a upside down L shapped table, which worked and we all got to interact with everyone.We got there about 7pm, around 7:25  servers asked for our drink orders, around 7:45 they started asking us for our orders, but none of us had any menus but we were never able to tell anyone we didn't have menus because there was no one around, we ordered our food around 8pm.  By this time most of everyone's drinks needed to refilled, the bread that was out is now gone and there are no servers to be found.  I had to ask for tea 3 times.The food wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even that great, I did ignore the reviews other Yelpers wrote because this was what my daughter wanted and I wasn't going to be all Oh other Yelpers said this wasn't that great. No I wanted her to have what she wanted.    I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was bland, no flavor, but I did eat it, I was starving. By now its after 9pm everyone was done with their meal and ready to get on the 2nd  1/2 of the party, but again no servers and no checks, people starting standing up and then out of magical air our checks showed up, everyone was not happy with the service they got, had to ask many times for refills, cheese, napkins, plates, other random things one asks for.  85% of the party skipped the free ice cream SKIPPED THE FREE ICE CREAM, the kids were the only ones who went for it, everyone else just wanted to leave.  Fortunately even with the bland food & missing servers my daughters night was not ruined. Oh I also should point out, I told the server that it was my daughter's 21st birthday and I wanted to buy her 1st legal drink and she took the drink order, but NEVER ID my daughter. What if I was lying about her age??   smh

Review Text :
Oy vey! This Peter Piper has been the worst I have been to. We had to wait 15 minutes standing in the front waiting for someone to take our order and there was no one in front of us. I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.Dont think ill be making a trip here again

Restaurant name  Jamile's Cuisine International

Review Text :
First of all I'm shocked that no one has written a review yet as it was part of the Crossroads Charlotte Taste of the World bus tour. The location is near Ben Thanh on Central between Kilborne and Sharon Amity, so it's not a stretch I frequent. Anyway I was a little nervous as I walked up and the sign above the door is in corrugated plastic.As I entered, the place has tables with glass tops over the tablecloths and basic chairs that were comfortable enough. It's a no nonsense interior - think Meskerem Ethiopian but less homey and less interesting.  You don't come here for the ambiance.However their menu has about 30 options on it luckily with photos for each item in a grid. While the owners are from Somalia, not all of the food is Somali. There is a selection of dishes primarily $8-10 mostly chicken, beef or goat. Jamile prefers chicken, and I have a thing against eating animals my family has kept as pets, so I won't eat goat.  (RIP our beloved nubian goats, Bravo and Symphony) I got something Jamile recommended that is of course not on the menu, but basically it's the Chicken with canjeera (Sp?) which is really similar to the Ethiopian injera flat pancake bread but less zingy. It came with spinach and potato (room temp but very good) and a side salad that was nice. It also came with water and mango juice all for $8. I told her it wasn't enough. So what the heck was Somali food like you ask? It wasn't nearly as unusual as I expected. The chicken which was spiced, yet not spicy was pleasant and mild. I couldn't identify any of the spices but it definitely wasn't overtly curry yet it was orange- possibly turmeric and some berbere?  It wasn't as similar to Ethiopian food as I had thought it might be except the bread.  Most of the dishes came with rice (which I heard was nice and moist), pasta (spaghetti) or a combo of both, or another bread called chapatti that was kind of like somewhat crunchy pita bread. I recommend the rice or my canjeera bread. It was a great value, and something out of your comfort zone yet not weird from a culinary perspective. Why not try it? The service was friendly and Jamile was lovely and was amused by our fun loving group. She even agreed to take a picture with us!  I will go back.Jamile's, a Somali restaurant, prepares their goat according to East African tastes. It comes in both soup and suqar. A crystal chalice of goat broth soup precedes every meal, and is served with a wedge of lime on the side. It's very fragrant and light, with a distinctive meaty flavor, though no discernible goat or vegetables float in the broth. It's the perfect dish to rev up your appetite. The suqar, on the other hand, is a hefty portion of goat that has been chopped and saut√©ed. It's not overly spicy, allowing the almost delicate flavor of the goat to come through, and very tender, owing to having been first boiled, then marinated before finally hitting the pan. All the meat is halal, or prepared according to Islamic law, which stipulates a humane and hygienic method of slaughter.Jamile's owners are from Mogadishu, and they cook according to Southern Somali tradition, which is less fiery than the in the north. But the house-made hot sauce on the side can fool you. It's cucumber green, cool, creamy-looking and hotter than the devil's daughter. Made of cilantro, onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic and vinegar, if you can handle the heat the symphony of flavors will set your mouth abuzz.The federation is also good; a split plate of spaghetti--left over from Somalia's 19th century Italian colonization--and fluffy, jasmine-like rice dotted with raisins and carrot shavings. This fantastic dish, and nearly everything else on the menu, rings up around $10.

Restaurant name  Otto Enoteca Pizzeria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.The pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).Otto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.The complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.We ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust. The flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.We also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.In addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.Before ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).The flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.For dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.Despite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.Service was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.After having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.Complimentary parking (including valet) is available at the Venetian Hotel.I wish I could give 2.5 stars.  Jim G. and I frequented this place when it was Enoteca San Marco.  Even when we previously enjoyed this place, we recognized that this was a snacks, wine, dessert kind of place.  We were never blown away by the dinner plates.  Now, with the change, things seem to have gotten worse.We started with a salad we had loved before, the Buratta Pesto Caprese.  The cheese is excellent, as are the pine nuts.  The pesto was lacking and the tomatoes were stewed instead of fresh! What?!?! Weird.We also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.We shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.  Waste of time.I did not expect fine dining here, but damn, this was disappointing.  Usually Batali places offer a minimum of quality.  Otto is sad. Too pricey for such mediocre food and service.I was impressed with this place. The wait was not very long even though it looked like every table was completely packed.We decided to hit the bar for a few beers. I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!We were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!I made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!Here is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, "can we get grated cheese?". The food runner then said, "I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!" I looked right at this girl and said,"Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!". I then looked at the food runner and said,"Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!I had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!We also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again. You gotta love Vegas!!!Decided to drop by & grab a pie (pizza). I love Joe Bastianich, but haven't tried his restaurants so when in vegas why not? This is a restaurant partnership w/ him & Mario Batali so I thought the food would be great, but was disappointed. We got the Proscuitto Arugula pizza as recommended by the waitress. I LOVE proscuitto and the ingredients for the pizza sounded simple yet delicious especially w/ fresh mozarella.Took about 20 mins for the pizza. I liked the crust, it was thin and crispy. The ratio of ingredients to sauce was on spot. However, I felt the pizza was way too oily. Proscuitto was drenched in oil and very salty. The arugula was good and didn't have that bitterness to it. There also weren't too much mozzarella :( Overall I don't think I'd come here again to pay $20 for the exact same pizza I could get at pieology. Well you can't get proscuitto at pieology, but the crust and everything else tasted the same.The summer I lived in New York, I visited Otto as often as possible, taking advantage of the $4 vegetable pots that combined to make excellent light take-out dinners. I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.Otto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.We drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.Dinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile. The food, service, and atmosphere were all on point, and I'd recommend Otto to anyone looking to sit down to a good Italian meal.It was time for a happy hour snack which starts at 3. We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few small plates. They have a sampler that is 3 for $5, so we had a little bit of everything.  Tasty Salami, Mortadella, Olives, Bruschetta, deep fried bread balls stuff with cheese and roasted beets with Saba. After the small plates it was some some deep fried squash blossoms filled with delicious ricotta cheese.  Excellent choice I must say. We wanted to try something a bit heartier, so it was the short rib ravioli up next. Very tasty and a generous portion. The only drawback is the ravioli could of had more short rib meat inside, but still flavor tasty. The final course was some tasty cheese with cherries, apricot and black truffle honey. An enjoyable afternoon and tasty snack at this Batali restaurant.

Review Text :
This is definitely a hidden gem not only in Henderson but within the actual building itself since all you can see on the outside is the signage for "Island Sushi" and there is a door to the right and a door to the left which has a screen on it which gives the appearance that they are perpetually closed.  Choose door on the left and from here, you will first see a counter up front with desserts and a menu above you. To access Poke Express, you must go further down the hall where there is a counter with various poke priced around 10 dollars/lb and one has the option for sampling their bounty of poke in a variety of flavors.  Whoever came up with the term "food porn" probably envisioned poke as its monthly centerfold.  I mean seriously, it's pretty much glistening flesh that is scantily "dressed" with options including but not limited to wasabi, spicy mayo, limu (hawaiian seaweed), and shoyu (soy sauce)...quite a thing of beauty I must say.   Since I biked as a marshall for the Rock and Roll Marathon, I was feeling particularly hungry and needed a carbo-boost post-ride, so I went with one of their Poke bowls, which has a substantial bed of sushi rice underneath the poke, but unless you're one of those folks from an Asian background where your parents threatened that if you didn't clean your rice bowl since the residual pieces of rice would pretty much resemble the pock-marked face of your future spouse, feel free to leave some of that rice behind.  Options for Poke rice bowl include the regular, with avocado (add 1 dollar), and DO NOT confuse the spicy ahi tuna bowl as poke....it is pretty much mushed up tuna mixed with spicy mayo that would likely get a 5 star yelp review if yelp existed for cats rating their food.  I went with the regular Poke bowl and requested they add some chili sauce (the one with the green cap and rooster on the bottle, much more intense than Sriacha), since I was concerned the spicy mayo would overpower the natural flavors of the poke.  The bowl is served along with fresh sliced cucumbers, some marinated onions, and a few fried taro chips.   The poke had a very pleasing texture (chewy but not gummy), not overly seasoned, and tasted very fresh (may not be as good right off the island since the tuna was obviously frozen en route to Vegas).   My advice would be to stop poking your friends on facebook with flying sheep or watching that episode of Pokemon which induced epileptic seizures in young Japanese kids, go poke the person sitting beside you and come down here for some high quality poke.One final note: for Spam Musubi fans, theirs is loaded with way too much rice much like their Poke bowls."I want to try poke (as in to jab or prod, pronounced p, long o, k)" my Chi town poker bud tells on the way to the cashier holding racks of checks that once belonged to me."Huh?" I reply"Yeah, you know, poke, the raw fish stuff you guys from Hawaii eat" he attempts to clarify."I don't get it.  The hell you saying?" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side."Poke made with fish, you know poke, poke, poke" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side.Yes, were talking ahi limu poke, wasabi shoyu poke, etc. Is it as good as back home?  No.  But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste.  Cultural sharing through food is a good thing.The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish.  The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated, the flavor does not permeate it, just coats the outside.  Limu (fresh, raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect.  Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion, green onion, soy, sesame oil and sesame seeds) and  ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it's name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good.Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12.50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected.  It's a poke shop in the desert after all.Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home.As for my bud, I never corrected his mispronunciation.  Payback for poking me in the side and bluffing me out of a huge pot.So I was feeling blue one day and if you knew me (which most of you don't on a deep personal level...so take notes!), then you'd know that on my darkest, gloomiest days, the only thing that could lift my spirits is SALMON SASHIMI! And I definitely needed a good cheer-er upper. I decided to try Poke Express with the help of a friend referral (thanks Helen W!). First off, it is **LOCATED INSIDE ISLAND SUSHI** which is perfect because another friend of mine mentioned that Island Sushi was her favorite hole-in-the-wall sushi joint, and I've been wanting to check it out. So I went straight to the Poke bar and was seriously spell-bounded by this amazing concoction of chopped up sashimi. We don't have many Hawaiians in TX so this was pretty magical in my opinion. So many variations I had no clue what to do! Well I'm assuming I met the owner since he was referred to as 'Papa'. Let me just say, I might just repeatedly come back just to visit Papa. He was the sweetest man ever! He let me sample pretty much everything and got me full before I could even get to my order! If you're new to Poke like I am, it's basically chopped up cube-sized sashimi marinated in different variation of sauces. I saw a lot of variations of tuna, but also squid and shrimp choices. You order it by 1/2 lb, 1lb , and so on.Of course I went for the salmon. I asked him to do whatever he wanted to it since I wasn't sure which sauce I would really prefer. Well easy enough the salmon already has it's own special sauce. I wanna say it's the Shoyu but not sure. He mixed it with green and yellow onions and sprinkled it with sesame seeds. LOVED IT. And the most important factor.. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRESH.1/2 lb cost me about $7.55 & it was definitely a good portion for just one person.LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I FOUND MY FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS! *crowd roaring*Really like that place!!!Cheap, Healthy, Tasty, great variety (best in Vegas by far) and super conveniently located for Anthem/Green Valley locals. We REALLY need more good and Healthy Local spots like this in our neighborhood I am freakin tired of Wendy's and other chains...Very Friendly service.BUT Closing time is way too early around 6pm... Perfect for an healthy lunch but not recommended for dinner, too bad, I would love some Poki on my way back from workMy favorite: furikaki poki, kim Chi cucumbers, Salmon Poki with special sauce, Ocean (seaweed salad), Dried fish slices (can't remember the name)The pieces of Tuna are cut a little bit too big for my taste but nothing that a sharp knife cant fix.Also they mentioned that the Tuna is previously frozen unfortunately but it actually taste very very fresh. Extremely surprising.The prices are also surprisingly low for the quality of the food, you would pay 20 times more in any sushi/seafood restaurant by the Strip.Definitely a great value for what you get.There is a Hawaiian grill in the exact same location that stay open later (10pm I think)and I would highly recommend their stir fried saimin noodles and the oxtail soup with freshly grated ginger and cilantro.Their coconut flan is pretty good too, one of my fav dessert of all time but in my opinion you cannot go wrong with coconut anyway ;)Their assortment of cakes behind the window look Absolutely delish and beautiful, I have too look away every single time! I didnt like their homemade kim chi that much taught... Its not bad but I had better.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is not scared of raw fish and that is looking for a healthy yet tasty meal.Very close from the LVAC on eastern and 215 :)Super good and super fresh poke.  I like getting a 1/2 lb of the spicy combo poke (mayo, avocado, and other delicious goodness), a 1/2 lb of the poke w/shoyu (regular poke w/soy sauce dressing), and a 1/2 lb of their seaweed salad and I'm all set!The poke here is absolutely delicious and I will keep going back for each poke craving I get.  The staff are really friendly, they let you sample the stuff before you buy it, and the poke just really speaks for itself and delivers.Hawaii in Las Vegas, Aloha!!One of my yelp friend (Sandra S) raved about this place on her last visit to sin city. I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December. Fast forward a few months and I'm in Hawaiian Heaven. Here's the run down:Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter. It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside. It was cheap too. $2.45 for 4 big pieces. Delicious We came here for the Poke, we got:Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite, Delicious. Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen, but still good. Spicy Ahi Combo w/ Crabs, Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A. DeliciousTako poke w/ Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender.  The Ahi's were big chunks of raw tuna. So fresh, so good. You've got to try this place if you like poke. We also got some hot dishes.Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish. The best loco moco I've ever had. The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties. The gravy is just money. With two eggs & two scoops of rice. Oh man, this alone made the trip here so worth it. Delicious. Must order here. Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner. Authentic Hawaiian dish. No fake smoke, tender, juicy goodness. Yum yum yum. Kalbi - Delicious, fall off the bone tender and  the marinade was spot on. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything. A piece of spam, pork cutlet, pork teriyaki, beef short rib, noodles, pickled radish and all on a bed of rice. This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good. It's a special, so they might not have it everyday, but if they do, get it. You won't regret it. The service was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a lot of  food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us. The place is small. A few tables (for 2 only) line the wall. Get your food to go. I need a nap now after that luau we just had. Hawaiian food done right. Sandra, thank you for the recommendation!!I'll definitely be backIt's always hard to find a good poke place.  I know here in California I have to jump through hoops and drive distances away just for some good poke.While I was in Vegas, my friend suggested Poke Express.  They have a display full of several kinds of poke.  There's also a display of the different kinds of poke they offer, so if it's not on display, ask, and they may have it in the back.I tried the spicy ahi and wasabi poke.  The spicy ahi definitely has a kick.  But I don't like sauce on my poke, and this was my friend's choice.  What I did like was the wasabi poke.  Definitely has the potential to clear out your sinuses, so beware.  The wasabi is for sure in there.  I loved it.  The fish tasted pretty fresh, and the flavor was on point.  I will very likely be coming back here to get my poke fix again.I also tried their Saimin Deluxe.  It's a huge bowl with all the fixings.  So good on a colder day.  In addition, the spam and egg masubi was a great snack to take with me before I went clubbing that night.  Not too much rice or sauce, so I could actually taste the spam and egg.  Glad, because some places love to just pile that stuff on!!Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas.  Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away.Tip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties.If you're looking this place up, just go. But know that it's INSIDE of  Island Sushi. Don't spend ten minutes arguing with your GPS in their parking lot. There's a sticker on the door. Poke is delicious, and these guys do it right. My favorites are the ahi-avocado or the salmon poke, but they also have a spicy crab dish that is tasty too. They also offer "ocean salad" AKA seaweed salad, which is simpler but also one of my favorite things. I haven't worked up the courage to try the raw tako yet!Pricing is fair for the great quality. If you live on the other side of town like I do, buy twice as much as you think you want because driving across town is a pain in the butt but you'll do it for this poke. Speak up and ask to try before you buy, the guys are friendly and want to make sure you get something you'll love.As a big fan of Poke this is the best place in Vegas for Poke.  It is Hawaiian style and remind me of Ono Seafood in Waikiki.  They have several to chose from which can make it tough to choose.     I got the spicy Avocado Ahi which was fresh and delicious.  The spicy Ahi with masago and mayo was perfection.  The taste was to die for and the Ahi just melted in your mouth.  We got a 1/4 pound of the seasoned dry skipjack tuna which was also amazing.  We got the seasoned garlic bulbs which were not overpowering at all.  I really enjoyed their unique flavor.  We also got the Kimchee cucumbers and imitation crab which were both a tasty treat.   The staff is excellent and helpful.  They had run out of the spicy Ahi but they quickly made us a fresh batch.  This was my 2nd visit and I will definitely be back.  The quality of their Poke s truly amazing.  The freshness made me think I was in Hawaii!I wish this place was in Los Angeles!  Located in a strip mall, there's tons of easy parking.  Three restaurants in one place means you can get some sushi, poke, hawaiian, and yummy desserts too.  There are tables & chairs, and I think you can order grill items from the poke counter too.We had lunch here before we hit the road to drive back home, & I literally did not need to eat til the next day.  (Ok, well except some of the leftovers haha)Everything was GREAT:Poke - sold by the weight, they had like a dozen different choices, as well as kimchi cucumbers, seaweed salad, and whole garlic clovesLoco Moco - mmmm, fatty pork, short grain rice, runny eggs & a meaty gravyTres Leches cake with guavaGuava layer cakeMalasadas filled with custard, coconut or chocolate creamButter mochiThe sushi restaurant that's attached also does ayce.In LA, there are a lot of great poke places, but I don't know where to get loco moco with slices of fatty pork instead of the hamburger.  So the next time I come here, I'd get the poke again, but the loco moco would be what I'd make the special trip for!The fact that there are three restaurants under one roof is genius.  This place does some awesome fresh poke.  The Island plate counter has loco moco and other hawaiian goodies, and to the right there is a sushi restaurant that was popping.  Soooo Many options!I want it all and then some.  It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table.  Speaking of which this would be awesome to pick up stuff to make a picnic :)Why are there no good hawaiian places in LA?I want the whole combo of roasted pork loco moco and fresh poke...Soo good...If yall are going, bring me back some ya here.

Review Text :
I got asked on a Valentines day date (hold your awwws) but he refused to tell me where or what we were doing. Creepy. When we parked in front of Villa, I found out that were coming here. To my date's credit, I am Peruvian and moved to the US when I started college (errr 7 years ago). He picked a Peruvian restaurant on Valentines day- where they had a Peruvian traditional folk band playing (enter cue to Awwwww away).Now that you are done awww-ing, let me share with you that I kinda, sorta, maybe, definitely freaked out. First of all, authentic and decent Peruvian food is very hard to find in the US- different ingredients, imported stuff, not-equally-tasty substitutes, etc. Secondly- a Peruvian folk band? Dear god, this has the potential to be one incredibly embarrassingly cheesy night.So I sat my ass down and proceeded to explain to my date (basically) the entire menu. I ordered the Anticuchos (grilled beef heart on a stick), Ceviche and Lomo Saltado. I also ordered 2 Cuzque√±as beer and the Chicha morada- a juice made from boiling purple corn, fresh fruit and sugar.Food wise, Villa Peru is a decent 3.5 stars. The Chicha was made fresh and it tasted exactly like it is supposed to: fresh, sweet and refreshing. The Ceviche was a solid 4.5 stars as the fish was fresh, the corn was Peruvian (we have a different type of corn, people), the sweet potato was soft and it had tons of citrus and onions. It just lacked some spice, so I had to ask for some Rocoto (our spiciest pepper) to add to it.The less successful dishes were the Lomo Saltado and the Anticuchos. The sirloin was sauteed with soy sauce which is not how its supposed to be done, The fries were a bit soggy and there were no fresh peppers (aji and rocoto, traditionally) sliced thinly and sauteed with the meal. It was decent and tasty, but it lacked spice. The Anticuchos were grilled well, but the pieces were very thick as traditionally, it's supposed to be thinly sliced squares. This made the meat dry and harder to eat, but the sides (potato, onion salad and some fresh herbs) were very nicely done.I understand that the place was full on Valentine's day, but I hate to say that the service really sucked. I was constantly looking around to get the server's attention for more water, the rocoto sauce or even the check and receipt.  2 stars for service. boo.Now that the boring yet actually useful parts of the Yelp review are completed, let me get back to my super corny story. The band started setting up while we were eating, to which I thought "oh god maybe I can eat really fast and get the check before they start playing". Nope. No dice. They started and they kept it going for the duration of our stay. And they were... awesome. For real- great voice, traditional instruments (like the Cajon- a form of drums), all traditional songs I grew up with and mad Spanish guitar skills. It's as good as I would find at any creole bar in Lima and that was ratified by all the (Peruvian) guests that were loudly singing along (maybe it was the booze) and shaking side-to-side in their chairs. Adorable.I think at one point towards the end of the night, the date asked me if I wanted to dance. Dear date, don't push it, I'm too sober to go there. All in all, it was a decent Peruvian restaurant that with some service improvements (and spice enhancements) can be a great great spot. They definitely delivered on Valentines day, and I guess so did my date.  As I went home, my anti-romantic self stopped and thought "crap. I just ate a heart on Valentines day. I hope this wasn't on purpose". Shucks.

i went here for a friend's birthday brunch! it was located behind the denny's and in the same center as peter piper pizza. google maps takes you across the street just FYI :) everyone loved the monte carlo sandwich. it was a hit! our server was super friendly. they had a huge assortment of GF options and also listed other potential allergens in their food on the menu (egg, soy, etc) in addition to their menu, they had a bakery to take home some goodies as well as pre packed mixes to make the bread and I assume other GF baked goods yourself. they also sell their GF flour.apparently, if you have a gluten allergy...according my friend this is the best and most delicious option she's been able to find!

Review Text :
We really enjoyed our meal at 8 Seasons Grille! We just moved nearby and it was an easy place to meet a friend for lunch. I really didn't expect much since I don't see many people in here, but I think it's just a bad location and usually an afterthought -- I have been walking by for two years and would always think "Oh, I should go there!" but then it's never on my radar.The only bad thing to report was the coffee was burnt; it had this sour taste to it. It was also a little strange to be the only people in the restaurant, but it was also right during a Badger game.My friend ordered a side salad with the grits. She enjoyed both a lot. We were impressed with the dressing -- some sort of pistachio mixture. Yum! Derek got brisket with frites on a pretzel bun. He thoroughly enjoyed that, and it was good he was hungry. :) I had huevos rancheros, and UGH SO YUMMY. Everything was perfectly balanced and full of flavor.I'm excited to try something new, though pretty disappointed that their only vegetarian lunch entre√© was a grilled cheese sandwich. Hopefully they serve breakfast foods later in the day so I can choose from that menu, too.Last thing: I think they need to school their servers a little more on potential allergies or intolerances. My friend is severely gluten-intolerant and had a question about where a "GF" was positioned because it was hard to see, and the waitress really didn't know.

I have to boycott this place for ethical reasons. I've never been here before so I might be biased but past co-workers have said that the owners don't treat their staff very well and only pay them in tips under the table. I hate to be a bother but when I hear things like that I never want to go here.

07/14/11Since I hadn't eaten here before, when the opportunity to buy a groupon to Zaytoon Kabob Bistro presented itself, I elected to purchase only one.  After experiencing a wonderful meal there, complete w/ terrific saffron-rosewater ice cream (with wafer cookies!!), Mom and I wished I'd bought three (the max offered)!  It's a a step or two up from being a dive, but I was completely ready to get an earful from Mom-- I DIDN'T, which still surprises me now just thinking about it.  I immediately looked up at the wall menus to see what Mom and I would like , while Mom sat at the table sulkily flipping over the paper menu.  I decided on trying the steak kabob wrap, while I chose the lamb kabob platter for Mom, especially when I saw that it included saffron rice.As we sat waiting for our food, we noticed that it was very cold in there due to all of the ceiling fans running on full blast.  I had to retrieve my sweater from the car so that Mom could stop shivering.  I didn't think it was necessary to have all the fans on, but I didn't complain.  We were ooh'ing and aah'ing from our first bites!  I haven't seen her so happy w/ a meal out for a long time...  I couldn't try the lamb (allergy), but her plate looked delicious, w/ a huge skewer of tender lamb cutlets, perfectly grilled, a generous serving of saffron-sprinkled basmati rice, a roasted tomato, and onions.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ#uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ  Adding more veggies would've made the platter better, but Mom really was happy w/ her meal.  I loved my steak kabob wrap-- the steak chunks could've been a little less fatty, but they were tender and juicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg#AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg  I wished there were more pieces...  I'd ordered the wrap instead of the platter, bec. I wanted the bread, but I kept wishing there were more veggies in my wrap, so I'll have to try the platter next time and just order a pita on the side.While the entrees were delicious, it was the homemade ice cream that stole the show!  It's listed as "Saffron ice cream," but it also contained rosewater, tiny chunky pieces of almond paste, and pistachios. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw#ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw  It was PERFECT!  I was very tempted to buy a pint to take home, but it's so delicious, I didn't want to binge on the stuff!  It's an excellent ending to a terrific meal.  (We would go back just to have this- it's that good!)Zaytoon was a bit price-y, especially w/ its cafeteria-style atmosphere- Z's certainly not a place you'd like to take a date to!  Spiffy up the place a bit, Z!!  However, we'll be back, w/ or w/o a groupon!p.s.  Mom's already told me twice after meals eaten after this date "We should've just gone to Zaytoon's!"This place is so fresh and so green green!!! :)   I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy John's and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!!  How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! I truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! Way to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!11/19/15Had a Groupon that was to expire last night, so took Mom for dinner.  I've been enticing her to go since buying the coupon in July, but she could not remember ever dining here, so she kept saying no.  She certainly remembered after taking one bite of her lamb entree!  All she kept saying was "Oh, wow" and "So good!," over and over, and soon I began to chime in canon.  But I am getting ahead of my updated review...When we entered the restaurant, I almost did not recognize the place, since the atmosphere has certainly changed.  The kitchen window is still there, but it's now fronted by two tables, in the shape of an L, upon which the register is on one end, and styrofoam food containers and baklava and other pastries in to-go containers are on the other end.  Three walls have pretty mural photo wallpapers of lush green scenery and ruins on them, and there are lovely new plum/burgundy cushioned booths installed.  Perhaps the owners will open up the kitchen a bit more, to let us see more of the kitchen action.  Being able to only see the kitchen staff's faces gives me the willies, for some reason... Hehe!  :)After Mom had a few bites of her lamb entree, with half-saffron rice and half-salad, she asked me to find more ZK Grill Groupons to use in the future. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=OKlzf5ZnGDgzy53noOlAzQ  I already knew that she loved the food here (so did I), so I am always looking out for ZK Grill deals.  Have I told you yet about the Chicken and Filet entree I ordered? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=XTjf8HfYHfWdU0OYLWBWhw  I also went with half-saffron rice (yes, I still am allergic to rice, but I can't say no to saffron rice, especially buttered saffron rice!) and half-salad-- you MUST try the champagne vinaigrette here, oh my goodness!  Great portions, and even better still, great flavors and textures (meat, salad, and rice).  I'll forgo the chicken next time (nice color and slight grill flavor, but the texture was ALMOST on the tad-dry side) and just go full-on filet, but now that I think about it, I don't think that's even an option here (??).  There's lamb, lamb with ground beef (a la koubideh style), chicken shawarma, chicken and filet, but I don't think there's lamb and filet nor just filet.  Hmm...We ended our meal with Saffron ice cream, but instead of a scoop of ice cream and a cookie wafer placed on top, it's now made into an ice cream sandwich between two wafers and pre-packaged. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=849LmOk-UwUvmTvx3is6jg  Same great ice cream flavors (rosewater, saffron, and pistachio) and little bits of pistachio bits for texture, but the wafers aren't crispy anymore-- the refrigeration has caused them to lose their crispiness.  I hope the owners/staff revert back to serving this dessert item like they used to, a scoop of ice cream with one wafer on top, and perhaps a second one upon request!

Restaurant name  Super B Burrito
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Finally, Henderson (or the border with Henderson) has a good taqueria. Super B Burrito brings the simple, fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the Vegas suburb.  The guacamole: fresh and oh so good.  The pinto beans: fresh and tasty.  The salsa and hot sauce: fresh and spicy.Super B Burrito does the classics right.  A carne asada super burrito (around $5 plus tax) comes with rice and beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream.  And it's good.  Real good.  Even the tortilla is well textured and chewy (i.e. not out of the freezer).  You may have noticed a repetition of the word "fresh".  It's a simple, but necessary concept for a great burrito.  Super B Burrito understands that and it's a solid taqueria because of it (and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1-2 day old tastes of Roberto's, it's revolutionary). But don't think that Super B Burrito only offers the classics.  If you're a meat eater, this is your place.  They prepare pork, steak and chicken in a variety of manners.  I had the coca-cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet, but not over-the-top sugary.  Here's how good that pork is: I always (always) order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria.  But when we stepped into the place, the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats.  The pork in green chile was spicy and delicious.  But there was no challenger to the coca-cola fried pork.  It's what will keep me going back again and again. Unfortunately, one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar.  Super B Burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option.  They do add in some lettuce, but it needs a little more oomph--either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely.  Without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition.  So four stars for the pork burrito, two stars for the vegetarian.  How did we get back to four stars overall?  The customer service is exemplary.  Friendly, quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria's specialties.  The guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito.  I will definitely be back as a repeat customer.  Hopefully, they'll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try.The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.

Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!"You are an artistic person - let your colors show."That's what my fortune cookie said during my first meal at Sunshine Moon Peking Pub the other night.  I say "first meal" because I  know there will be more... (and hopefully better fortunes than that one too!)Rich and his team did a great job renovating this restaurant where Bacon used to reside.  It's now got a cool Asian vibe while still casual and welcoming.  Service (from Kelly and James) was friendly and attentive.  We took their recommendations and ordered the following:*Veggie Spring Rolls*Chilled Cucumber Salad*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)*Mushroom Purse*Shrimp in Lobster SauceI know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!Well, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  I really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper "purse" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other "shrimp in lobster sauce" dish I've had in the past.The one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  SMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.Oh... and the point of me starting this review with my fortune? There was none; just wanted to share.  Feel free to share yours too!

Restaurant name  Five Guys Burgers and Fries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a "fast food" spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I won't choose a "fast food" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time.I seriously cannot recommend the food served here. I was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because I had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south Phoenix restaurant.The fries served here were terrible. My dining partner commented on how soggy and unappetizing they were and took them back to only have them replaced with equally depressing pile of soggy, soft fries. His experience in fast food restaurant management told him all he needed to know by watching them cook the fries. They overload the fryer baskets and never account for time required to bring the oil back up to the proper heat. The result is a soggy fry that tastes more boiled than fried.A real disappointment and an expensive one at that. Most of my fries remained uneaten and the burger was greasy and flavorless. Quality control is not a priority here, but they are quite efficient at taking your hard-earned cash.

Dropped in for a lunch one day and decided to order a #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Dressing) w/Pasta Salad and a Coors Light.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=gI5V2uJFJoVdCc6CMlojqAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=MyzQ7VsZ8W4vxMXJxyyERwoUB0n2Jl76BxGXDUpj3BgQSince I was dining alone, I sat at the counter.  The food was prepared pretty fast.  I only had a few sips of my Beer before the waitress came out with the Sandwich.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is soft and crunchy....the crunch comes from the toaster.  The Sandwich is served hot from a toaster....which makes the flavor of the Meats come out.  The only complaint I have about the Sandwich is that the Dressing makes the Bread too soggy....if you don't eat it fast, it will fall apart on you.The Pasta Salad is OK....too much Cheese and Dressing on it...I would have preferred it with a little less.Overall, it was a nice lunch experience.Return Factor - 84%

Restaurant name  Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill

Review Text :
I have always been a big fan of all things teriyaki. Unfortunately, im not a fan of this place. Let me explain.Any time I go to a teriyaki place, I always get the chicken n beef combo because come on, you get two kinds of meat and you cant really mess that up right? Here they kind of did ok. You have two choices of sizes. Regular and Large. The large is only 50 cents more so might as well right? So here's why im not too fond of this place. The chicken was dry. I had to douse it with teriyaki sauce and sriracha just to make it edible. I wanted brown rice instead of white. They charge you 40 cents for that while some other places don't. The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.So I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.  I have actually been here twice. Once with company that wanted to go here and this second time around because I thought the first time was a fluke. Unfortunately, this second visit verified what I thought all along.Get your $2.99 bowls on tuesdays and thursdays. I defintely take advantage of that deal on a weekly basis. hehe overall experience with this place.. I can't complain. I normally get the all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl. it's about 8 bucks for a bowl and it comes with veggies and rice you have the option to choose brown rice. Customer service is great everyone is greeted and they are polite. I am a regular at this place if im craving for something healthy and quick.

Review Text :
4.5Happiness. Pure happiness. On my plate and in my mouth. From the outside, Omnivore's not much to look at... but this is a good thing. It means that rather than concentrating its efforts to look hip and cool, tptb behind Omnivore concentrate on good food, nice service and an authentic experience. This is not to say, however, that Omnivore looks shabby. It doesn't. It's comfy, welcoming and fits the neighborhood nicely. I was particularly enamored with the mosaic tables.In the proper frame of mind, I looked over the menu and made my selection. A chilly day in a chill restaurant demands tea. Fresh tea. Fresh mint tea... as in, mint leaves, simple syrup, water, and a cup. Boisson (much like poisson, one of my favorite French words) out of the way, I was ready to order the rest of my combo. Yes, combo. For $10, you get a kafta sandwich, soup and drink. For my soup, the green garlic-type soup was filling, deeply-flavored and wonderfully-made. Eating it was like eating warm joy. The garlic wasn't overpowering but it was, certainly, the star of the show. I decided on the Bombay kafta: chicken, sumac onions, cabbage, and pineapple chutney. Tell me that doesn't sound incredible. You can't. You can't tell me that. Because it *was* incredible. The sandwich was generously-portioned, spicy and textured so that every bite had a nice crunch as well as plenty of meat & seasoning. Although I was tasked with working after lunch, I much rather have found a nice corner in which to curl up with a book and take a nap. Omnivore serves comfort food from a Mid-East perspective that's sure to delight. It made me fall even more in love with Montreal.

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!Wickedly Awesome!There are a lot of cool things about this buffet that no other place has but most of it was pretty average or subpar.  Having shawarma on a spit is an awesome idea but it wasn't that good.  Risotto is something different but it was pretty meh.  Crab stir fried in some kinda butter sauce might sound appetizing but I would rather just have a plate full of cold crab legs and crack them myself.  They had the most lamb I'd ever seen in a Vegas buffet including ribs, leg and mini chops (prob my favorite thing in the whole place).  I also enjoyed the different individualized portions of pasta.  Wish I had more room for dessert.   And what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.  So the servers can deal with other stuff...like taking finished plates off the table.  Some of our plates sat there for a pretty long time before they got picked up.  We also had to repeatedly ask for more water and coffee before they actually brought it.  I can think of at least 5 buffets in town I would rather go to than this one for the price though.  Might be a one and done for me.I went into Cosmo hotel to grab an early dinner after CES and was blown away by the decor and ambiance of Wicked Spoon Buffet. We got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. Affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.I loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. Definitely an A+ for looks. Too bad the taste fell way short.At first, I though that it was pretty tasty, but alas I was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. But after my first plate, I noticed that nothing really stood out. I had no favorites to go back to...and I just ended up trying a little bit of everything. Which is almost IMPOSSIBLE to do.Remember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes I would only want a bite or two, but because I had to take the entire serving, I ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. I felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because I didn't like it all that much. Plus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. By then, you just end up getting full before you can get your money's worth. Boo!The meats were a little dry, and WHAT...no crab legs?? Instead they had some kinda peeled crab (I THINK) in some butter sauce. Of course I wouldn't really know because nothing is LABELED. But regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. My favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\ Whyyyyyyyyy is life so difficult??My favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. Again, everything here looks stunning. Miniature works of art. Although looking individual and unique, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. Nothing spectacular. They also have chocolate covered strawberries which I liked, but my favorite was the gelato. The salted peanut flavor was my top pick.Service was also on the slow side. It took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out. By then I already fell asleep from the mediocre food -_-Pretty face, but lacking in quality substance.Why must I "rate" this place, damn it. The idea is so original, new, trendy, and seemingly THE dream buffet of a gourmand. Unfortunately, I guess the common phrase is true, "looks aren't everything."Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's a long, weird and windy walk. You will be easily distracted by odd objects: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=q-Ckm0qluUvbReCUhCWYrwThe buffet has different selections of dishes served in buffet style trays and some items were presented in mini pots, pans, and your own mini deep-fryer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=g0AI7zRDTe5M-Oac7z4wbQ).  The dishes were labeled with detailed descriptions; instead of your typical "arugula salad" sign, it was "arugula and candied cashews with blackberry vinaigrette salad." It kinda gives you a clear idea of what you're eating, sans playing the guessing game.Although the dishes were attractive, I've had better buffets on the strip. I can think of maybe 1 or 2 memorable dishes, and the rest were just passable. Hm, I guess that's what you would generally expect at a buffet..I was a little disappointed in the dessert section. The colors and presentation of the desserts selection made me so excited. Come on, dessert cups topped with edible silver flakes?! Unfortunately, the only thing I really enjoyed were the mini apple pops and gelato. Everything, all in all, was sort of a hit or miss. (a "miss," as in, hell to the NO)This place has so much potential! I have mixed feelings about this buffet, so I don't know how to accurately rate it. So, why is this so hard? Well, that's what she said.I had to try it.  We were tired of the M (except I really like their cider, and when they serve it to me in a wine glass) so we wanted my brother to be the first in the family to try the Cosmo buffet (since my parents already hit up the M years before he could visit me again).We went on a Sunday night - line was nonexistent, price reasonable, ambiance great.  Our server Will was fantabulous - attentive, sense of humor, super fast on drink requests and refills.  He gave Eric R. three sprite refills at one time since he was unusually thirsty for soda, something he never drinks.  The iced tea was good - definitely brewed and not Lipton.  It was sort of oolong ish.  Will was the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.Yes, the plates are awkward.  You can fit like 3 or 4 items at a time, they are clunky and sliding everywhere.  Will told us he can only clear one person's mess at a time, which slows down his progress.  The worst for me was the lack of signage.  Personally, I don't like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguishing characteristics.  What the heck were in half the dishes?!  I honestly have no idea.  I wasn't in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.The shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn't enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.The desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn't know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn't get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn't labeled.  He said lots of people ask him that, that the management is aware, but that the "signage is delayed on order."  I would hope the Cosmo has its own printer.  Oh well.  Not coming back here.there's a saying in korea, "10 years can move mountains and rivers", but it seems like 1 year is enough to change vegas. since my last visit back in late 2009, many new hotels have been recently added to the city's directory, and one is always trying to outdo another. the hubby and i were informed of these hip, ritzy and stylish new additions, and how they were now "must's" in vegas, cosmopolitan being one of them. in fact, on our way to vegas, my sis (on her way back from vegas!) told me about her new fascination with wicked spoon buffet at cosmopolitan. i normally despise buffet, but the moment my sister said "ice cream station", i knew i was sold. after a good night sleep, we woke up at 8am and mapped out our itinerary for the day that evolved around two feasts. we exercised vigorously (see the review of encore's fitness center below) and walked about a mile in cosmopolitan hotel before we reached the buffet. at 10:30am on saturday morning, there was no line and the dining hall was not too crowded. there were the standard breakfast items (hard as brick waffles, soggy pancakes, made to order omelets, fresh fruits, miniature boxed cereals, assortment of breads and edible yogurt) along with carving station (ny steak, some sausage, some pork part and other protein thing), cold seafood section (smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail), italian food (pizza, pasta and ravioli stuff) and asian food section (sushi, dumplings and korean kalbi). obviously, i didn't bother to inspect the meat station too much, but i sure frequented the seafood and asian food stations multiple times. the smoked salmon was surprisingly fresh and tasty. we also liked the shrimp dumplings although the skin was a bit dried. however, their kalbi was the worse i had in a while with overly sweet and burnt flavors. the show stopper of wicked spoon buffet was the dessert station, specifically the ice cream bar with 14-16 different flavors. i tackled small scoops of pistachio, strawberry, amaretto, oreo cookie and tiramisu, and they all seemed decent, although a little too sweet for me. there were decadent dessert offerings such as mini madeline cookies and french macarons which sadly did not live up to my expectations. the usuals such as chocolate covered strawberries and apples were good, but again, not great. many of the food were served in individual sized pots, cups and dishes (probably will reduce waste and keep the food fresh) so lines moved really fast and the stations were kept clean. the overall look of the dining space is modern and comfortable with some big tables to accommodate large parties. the waitresses wear some gloomy, tacky brown plaid shirt dresses which literally made me feel depressed to look at them, but they were some of the hardest working bunch. the hubby felt bad how other tables left no tip, so we went the other route and left them a generous amount. by now, you should know what to expect from a buffet...mediocre food, high price tag and looking like 5 month pregnant! as long as you don't compare the food to your "favorite" sushi, steak, pizza joint or authentic home cooked meal, wicked spoon buffet might satisfy your edacious nature. actually, $25 brunch buffet in vegas is not a bad deal at all.I love this place! AYCE brunch for just $23 at the Cosmopolitan! Nice. It's cheap. It's good. It's artistic.Dishes are small and dainty, beautifully arranged tapa style dishes. I think you either like it or you don't. And I really liked it...it was different and fun! Little saucepans and individual dishes, it was just too cute to pass up. See for yourself:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=XpWiM7EYchGqenNiq1c2vQPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=aX2HFOd1sQa3v4UAUftTYQPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=uTxWe05t_qtnpIxVwPmErQIn the meat section they had your usual, chicken, beef and slab of bacon!! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=7GAJvXufLfnCjIXK-avn7wI loved everything! Except the eggs benedict, which looked good but didn't taste good. But please please please save room for dessert! I think the dessert section was by far my favorite part! Everything was yummy. The ice cream choices were awesome, I tried the mango and the salted peanut! Both were delish...if my tummy could have handled more, I would have tried more flavors. But I had to save room for the chocolate covered strawberries and the small chocolate covered crab apples!! They were so cute. Definitely give Wicked Spoon a try if your in Vegas!I don't think this buffet is for everyone, but it's definitely for ME!!!  Oh how I dream of going back... and going back OFTEN!I would say if you are the kind of person that likes to go to a buffet to load your plate up with a mountain of fried shrimp or other standard buffet items, you won't like this place.Buf if you are the kind of person who likes to try all kinds of different foods, made in all kinds of different ways... this will be your kind of place!  Nothing here is just "plain."  The polenta isn't just polenta.  It's "creamy mushroom and marscapone polenta."   The stromboli isn't just stromboli.  It's "pulled pork stromboli with roasted red peppers." The scalloped potatoes are "scalloped potatoes baked in a rich truffle sauce."   You get the idea.So if those kinds of things intimidate you, rather than excite you.... The Wicked Spoon isn't for you.  The last time my husband and I were there, as we were walking out, a couple who was also leaving turned to us with disgusted looks on their faces and said "Did you like that?"  We responded "yes" and they shook their heads and said "yuck.  We didn't."  So it's obviously not for everyone, but I can tell you that if you have adventurous taste buds and like to try a little bit of everything.... you won't be disappointed.So when two Filipinos end up near the strip deciding on lunch, it almost feels natural we'd end up at a buffet to nosh, sit and kill time. I think I will get to the strongpoints first:MEAT, especially pork dishes. Seriously, the steamship pork they were carving, miso glazed pork loin, char siu, pork belly steam buns were all tasty and perfectly cooked. Pork is usually a buffet fail, but these are juicy and perfectly cooked. The steamship with a bit of the onion marmalade and chimichurri was worth a 2nd carving. The other meats like the turkey, kalbi ribs and linguica was good too. If I just want to sit and gorge on meat, I would consider going here for $22 than go to a Brazilian rodizio for $40. Salad- I know, it's just an effing salad but buratta cheese with crushed pistachio served with frisee in red wine raspberry vinaigrette is a winner.Gelato- plenty flavors and well madeDecent- cured pepper salmon, cheeses, farro tabuleh, goat cheese roasted tomato salad, creamy polenta with mushrooms, pizza, clams in a stew (but they really should have just left them plain in butter since the clams were fresh but the sauce isn't good), already peeled shrimp cocktail. Now onto the fails- The concept of little serving plates seem cute and different, but it simply doesn't work especially on the items they are doing. Covered or not, these are items that shouldn't sit so they really need to consider thats in them. They also seriously need to give you like a cafeteria tray. Two of them fill a plate. Risotto- seriously? Rice seizes into itself and gets mushy. Gnochi turns into a gummy mess like a mochi. Cappelli pasta looked mushy so I didn't even try. Mac n cheese got hard on the top. Seafood like poached cod was gross. Desserts were very pretty but some were spit out worthy. Gelato was the best thing there with plenty of flavors and good consistency. This little mousse chocolate cup was decent, the strawberries dipped in chocolate were sweet. I saw macarons with fruit and I was expecting them to not be great, but they were inedible. It tasted like the purple food coloring and rusted chlorinated water. Some desserts didn't even make fucking sense like a very tart mango puree with chocolate mouse and pearls and fruit jelly on top. This was where the majority of food wastage was since a lot of it wasn't any good. I rather have a big bowl of ugly looking bread pudding from Sams Town buffet than aesthetically pleasing but palette scaring desserts. Service was alright. Plates didn't sit so long, but we didn't get many plates for the time we sat around. I like that they do give you water for the table since sometimes you just need something to drink and don't have anything. They weren't bad on the refills of my tea though. It's not a buffet I would recommend for that pricepoint, but I suppose it wasn't terrible. I'm a pork meat person so the large amount of pork cooked right was a definite win. Maybe if I had tourist friends going there anyways, I wouldn't mind going, but I do not think it's a place I'd seek out.BONE MARROW!!! Need I say more???Thank goodness a friend told us about this place otherwise we would have just continued to go to disappointing buffets. The cost, about $31 after tax (not bad at all). Came here for dinner with friends and thankfully it wasn't packed (because the Lord knows I don't like people getting in the way of me and my food). Decor was beautiful and like "Liza T." said, very modern and contemporary. This is one of the very few buffets where I was actually excited about the food. Why? Because the first thing I saw and grabbed was the huge slab of bone marrow sliced in half and cooked to perfection, I swear it called out to me and I answered!! *Yummm* Great selection of foods, I wish I could remember everything they served but I totally blacked out and grabbed anything and everything and by the time I sat down I had a mountain of food sitting on top of my plate! The desserts were VERY cute and not only appealed to the eyes but appealed to the taste buds as well. =D Definitely will be coming back to this buffet when in town again. 5 STARS!!!Ever since the Bellagio opened up on the Strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.Now, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!What's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).12:11..err, 12:14 am.. i think.. to be honest, im not sure.i just stumbled my way back into my apartment after a 7 hour drive, From Las Vegas, back to Whittier. A victim of my own gluttony, and self-torturing habits. head still buzzing from the effects of No-Doz, chased with tiny "5 hour Energy" bottles. i find myself awake, and, yet dead on my feet. with really only one thing lingering in my mind. i write these lines with hope, that by purging my experience, i might actually get some sleep tonight..ah, my friends.. a circle of people that can only be described as "Family" When i learned that two of my friends(who's pending nuptials will not be recognized in CA.) decided to have their Bachelorette party in Vegas, i knew what to expect. our group Vegas trips were legendary. Fast-Forward to late morning, Sunday. The hazy fog is just starting to lift. i sit there, blinking into oblivion, trying to figure out what the heck transpired in the past 44 hours. surveying my surroundings, i gather that i am in some type of restaurant, a Buffet! but which one? speaking slowly, i am able to obtain that we are sitting around a table at the Wicked Spoon Buffet, inside the new Cosmopolitan hotel. little by little, my head is clearing. i am sipping at some really tasty water, decanted out of the coolest glass bottles. then, a smiling waiter slides a large glass in front of me. wait..i know what that is! its a bloody mary!! thank god! not wasting any time, i toss back the delicious concoction, and begin to gather my wits. food is what i need, and i am in the right place. being somewhat of a Vegas Buffet Veteran, i decide to take a surveying lap, before committing to selections. the spread seems well organized and very extensive. i grab a plate and begin my systematic buffet destruction. first round: Korean-style grilled short rib, Pork belly slider with cilantro salad, Fresh orecchiette with crimini mushrooms and braised short ribs. the Korean rib was excellent! perfectly grilled, and oh so tasty! the Pork belly slider was a fresh boa bun stuffed with tender pork, cilantro, and a tangy vinaigrette. it was so good, i had two more after. the mushroom and short rib pasta was served in a quaint little saute pan, and was absolutely amazing! each one of these dishes was of top-restaurant quality. this couldn't be mass-produced buffet-fare. it tasted like a well trained chef prepared these dishes just for me. The things i found here, were not the types of food often found at your run-of-the-mill Vegas buffet. Mascarpone Polenta(omg!), Dashi broth, Roasted curry cauliflower, Cypress Grove "Drunken Goat" cheese, Red Velvet Pancakes, and heirloom tomato salad. in the 48 hours i was a temporary resident of Las Vegas, NV. i slept not a single wink. okay, maybe a cat nap here or there. i drank, i gambled, i drank, i danced, i drank and drank some more. there are many of those 48 hours that are lost to my mind. from witness reports given to me by my good pals, maybe its better that way. but thankfully, the memories i have from the Wicked Spoon are fresh and vivid. This place will perpetually be on my list, every time i choose to destroy myself a little bit, just across the state line.Been to the Wicked Spoon Buffet a few times since they opened.  First time I went was during lunch during their first or second week of opening, where there were many kinks still needed to be worked out (lack of labels for the food served, bussers/waiters having a hard time clearing plates, etc.).  But I am glad to say that since my first visit, all of these issues have been addressed, and the experience of dining here has vastly improved.The selection of food served have also undergone a lot of changes, with items that are not popular or not being executed well being removed and replaced (crab apples is no more and replaced by chocolate covered marshmallows, dim sum items are gone - I wish they were still able to make the xiao long baos, some desserts are changed or simplified).The wait is a complaint for some visitors, but it hasn't been an issue for me during the times I have dined at the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  With the most recent visit being at 7pm during the weekday.  Price for lunch is $19 and $27 for dinner, which is pretty fair for the quality and selection of food served.  There is also a bar where you can order alcoholic beverages for an additional charge.The buffet itself is pretty organized and traffic for the most part flows smoothly.  The salads and appetizers station is located on the left side (facing the buffet) and entrees in the middle, Asian section on the right side near the dessert station.  The dining area is decorated nicely, although it is not that large.  Finding the buffet can be a A lot of comments have already been posted about the food, so I am not going to bore you with my thoughts and preferences, as we all have different tastes, likes and dislikes.  But I will say that occasionally they serve whole suckling pigs (each weighing about 100 pounds and feeds about 30 people) so if you do see it on the buffet consider yourself lucky and enjoy the special treat.From very reliable sources, the Asian station is one of the most popular station at the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  The Chefs there have plans to roll out a seasonal menu starting Easter, while continuing to serve the some core items throughout the year, so guests can experience the food at Wicked Spoon without getting bored of the same menu.About the service, I think it is excellent.  The waiters/waitresses are all doing their best to offer a great service to the guest.  And if you have special dietary needs, you can ask the cooks and they will do their best to accommodate you.  If you have other special requests (i.e., craving for a specialty cheese that may not be on displayed at the buffet, wanting to have your prime rib grilled), from personal experience I know they will accommodate you.  Which is major kudos in my book.Anyway, for the price of admission, I think you are getting a pretty decent value and food here.  4 stars!And if you have the Cosmopolitan IDENTITY card, present it to the cashier to accumulate points towards the rewards program.---Promotions---On "Plateau" Mondays, guests can upgrade their dinner with a Fruits de Mer Seafood Plateau served directly at your table for only $10 per person. Minimum of 2 people.This is probably one of the best buffets in Vegas!We got there just in time before the crazy line started.  Lucky us!As I started down the line, there were so many choices!  Loved the grilled asparagus salad, mini pot of creamed corn (its really cream & corn, delish!!), fresh fruits, & dessert island with a gelato case (MMMMMM).The atmosphere is great, very open seating and serving stations.  I didnt get to try the carving station as there was so much to try!  They had a sushi section too.  I loved that lots of items were served in individual pots/plates/cups, they have great presentation!!  I wanted everything!!Can't wait to come back!  We even thought about going back to brunch the next day!!  YUMS!!!!!!!I AM HUGE!  This would be another great opening for a "that's what she said" zinger. But, at this buffet there is no denying that my stature was indeed grandiose.  Everything's served in miniature crockery, pans, fryers, cones, and cups.  I truly felt like the jolly yellow giant in jack's miniature string bean kitchen. This however is where the rubber meets the road and smaller in this case is not necessarily a good thing.  Because the portions are served in smaller individual servings, they tend to dry out pretty fast if you fail to get things as soon as they're put out.  While there were numerous items to choose from, over half of them were just too dried out or hard, which included:- The pork belly sliders.- The mac 'n cheese was too dried out and not cheesy enough.- The al pastor tacos were quite disappointing and also very dried out (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=bTym4e_dO56vo_I-X0jVSw).- The Prime Rib was a bit rubbery.- The Korean short ribs were chewy and in par with the quality of a young dong tofu house.- The salads a bit wilted and torn.The miniature dishes that were really good:- The miniature fryers of sweet tater fires (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=jeUB9sk3TPj5gLBViw6WFw).- The creamed corn and red wine braised mushrooms were surprisingly tasty.- The Pot Roast served in a miniature Dutch oven (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gQSN3CUgWdMXuDi814bwRA).I think the highlight were the desserts. And they were numerous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gYly1GSdQl1ivFLbLUS2FQ).- Metallic-colored egg shells that were filled with egg cr√®me and topped with miniature macarons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=F4Tl5-voNvQV2OnOP_m1Vg).  - Gelato, gelato, gelato - so many flavors to choose from and taste.- Hundreds of cups of filled purees, creams, and genache of vibrant colors and tastes.  Some good, and some bad (almost like what were you thinking kinda bad).- Chocolate covered strawberries were great.I think we caught the dessert guy in his off day; very grumpy and stern.  However the help switches out often and you'll probably never see this guy anyways. So it was great to finally experience this miniature world and truly feel like a giant.  The prices are actually quite reasonable; $21 for Lunch and $29 for Dinner.  Food wise, this was a solid 2.5, but given the price, it's a 3.  But this is Vegas and Buffets are numerous.  So on to the next one!In competition for the 2nd or 3rd spot of the "best buffets in town" list!The first and last time I hit this place up was on my birthday! I was getting so many referrals about this place, that I had to try it with my friends and family (who've all been dying to try the spot out as well).This buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino!! Dinner was $22 if I can recall? It was 18% more for each of us because of the larger party (they charge gratuity with a party of 6 or more fyi)So, one of the cool things I loved & learned was that they have their own water well, so their water comes in this beautiful glass bottle, and you serve yourself (which is convenient for me because I absolutely love H2O!) I asked the beverage server what was so great about the water, and he said that the water is purified 3 times! No wonder it felt like the best water I've ever tasted!Another part to this experience was the beauty of it all.  The food looked like the type of food you'd find on the food channel. It was more of the gourmet-type dishes, and the presentation of it all was an A-plus! I loved how the dishes were served in little pots =). The chandeliers & paintings on the walls were creative too!There were a variety of good dishes, but only some Great dishes. One of the best parts of the buffet was the mac&cheese bar, where you were to choose the ingredients, type of cheese, and macaroni shells.  The chef was absolutely hilarious & made my mac&cheese just the way I liked, which was also a good thing.And so the desserts... there were plenty of tarts, and cups of many pleasant sweets, but the best in the dessert-end (if I had to choose) would be the white chocolate covered strawberries, even though it wasn't so original. However... try this place out if you're curious, be prepared to eat your money's worth, and bring friends =DI've been going to Vegas buffets since I've been five years old and I haven't seen anything quite like Wicked Spoon.  It's a special buffet with inspired entrees and I hope that they will be able to maintain their creativity as time passes.What I love about this place is that they had entrees like skirt steak w/ apple fennel salad and chimichurri sauce.  They had Bone Marrow, Pork Loin, and Korean short ribs.  They had a mac and cheese bar.  They offered Louisiana grits with shrimp and braised short ribs.  I loved that they put out entrees that you'd find on the menus of legit restaurants.  I love that they plate those dishes on individual sized plates.  I love that I was able to get these dishes seconds after they were on the grill.  I thought that the entrees were really good and enjoyed them a lot.Unfortunately, seafood wasn't on the same level as the meats and their desserts are a little overrated.  The desserts were lacking a little in the flavor department.  They did have chocolate covered strawberries and gelato and chocolate covered marshmallows, but I was a little underwhelmed with them.Also...if you're the type of person that likes to load up on crab legs and shrimp when you go to buffets, then this place isn't for you either.  These items are plated on individually sized portions, so that's how they handle portion control.  I definitely would come back because I loved the entrees I had.  I really enjoyed this buffet and I think it's worth trying, especially since it's $10 cheaper than Bellagio and Wynn on the weekends.Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling... I had been drooling over the pics posted by friends weeks in advance and I found myself enjoying it, but 5 days later, i can't really think of too many dishes i would go back for... But no surprise to SY, i would still give this place 4 stars. Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!Things i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkASalad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDAThat they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Qand surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. Loved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTgCrunchy tacos were good.Sad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. The desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBwand i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEwBut the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. I did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)A little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!On the way back stateside, while somewhere over the Atlantic, I had an epiphany. I was tired of eating bangers and mash. I asked the pilot to drop me off in Vegas. I was heading back home from Jolly Old England where I was invited to some Royal Wedding. Other than the fact that I was indiscriminately throwing up dubs in the air through out the procession, shit was mind numbingly boring. I think I developed restless leg syndrome because of it. Talking mad shit to Oprah, who I guess snuck in, was fun too. That Kate girl is pretty. The prince, though, homeboy isn't aging very well. He did real good in locking that chick up. Kudos. Game respects game. I give it 3 years. I'm an optimist. It's fancy inside. Tap water served in fancy glass bottles. Very Chic.Some of the nice looking  individually served tapas style dishes at Wicked Spoon were like the wedding....bland and a pain in the ass to sit through. But, some of the other things, were so good, that I forgot about the wedding.The selection did seem somewhat limited, however.   That's just a heads up for you Vegas buffet fanatics that like to sneak out food from.  I'm looking in your direction, Filipinos.  I got eyes on you.I was really happy to finally be able to get to try this place, but only to be a little disappointed. Their pricing is pretty good compared to most of the other buffets. ( 25 for lunch, 35 for dinner ) Most of their food is whatever, it's basically alot of exotic food  with weird names I never heard of.I saw some different food such as the lamb and pork meatball ( which was the most horrendous meatball that has ever touched my tongue), cauliflower puree ( sounds pretty gross so my friend and I didnt even look twice on it) and those were the only exotic things I remember. There was also prime rib, fried rice, many asian cuisines that i'm just totally sick of. Their sushi tempura one was pretty good though. I hate the fact that they tried to decorate some food by putting it in those silver cups because I only get one spoonful servings of each food just to try every food and if a food is bad, I wouldnt have to worry about wasting food which me and my friend did on every of those silver cans we got. Their mac n cheese bar is a cool setting where they make it in front of you, but the mac n cheese wasnt even that great.Desserts was the one thing I was looking forward to for this place, but they didnt have macaroons that I was informed of. Most of their desserts are not even that great. The best one would have to be their dark chocolate covered strawberries. I tried many of the little ones and none of it really stood out to me.overall, it was okay. I would rather pay 10 more dollars to hit up the bellagio buffet.2 of the best things that could possibly happen when you have dinner is that its a buffet (lots of choices) and its free.  Well not exactly free but it was a celebration of my niece's graduation from HS (Congrats Megan - Valedictoria and future Hoya alumni).  The location for this buffet is inside the Cosmopolitan (a James Bond glossy new casino in the strip).  this is my second visit to the Cosmpolitan but it was not a destination for me for gambling (too pricey) or partying (bit old for that),  Back to the buffet,  Our group was seated in a section separate from the rest of the Buffeteers(?) but we still had to go to each station like a normal customer.  The choices were varied like most buffets. I often stay away from the more common items I can get anywhere else so I tried mostly stuff I normally would not find on a my daily fast food meal hunt.  There were a lot of choices that I would enjoy and also was good for my partner who is a pescaterian (he eats dairy, seafood but no red or white meat).  I agree with the other comments on the little pots for some of the dishes.  It really is designed to share and takes up most of the space of your plate.  I found the Gen Tso's chicken good and crunchy.  The ratatatouille was pleasantly steamed without being overcooked but needed a base sauce.  The shrimp miso salad was fine.  The ceviche passable.  The gazpachos bearable.  The prime rib was great with a little salt and the bone marrow as the sauce (yes bone marrow).  I am not a big buffet eater but thoroughly enjoyed the availability of many choices.  Truly the dessert choices was really good but too much sugar for someone who has to watch his sugar level.  The gelatos (esp pistachio and mango) tasted great.  The custard/flan was fine.    Overall the service and food deserves 4 stars.  The best part was that the place was not overcrowded.  I think the pricing is higher than most buffets but if the selection is good then its worth it.The Wicked Spoon was Wickedly Good for the Stomach!No buffet is going to be able to keep the quality as high as a sit down restaurant. Trying feed that many people at one time is difficult and you are going to loose a little bit of  intimacy and personal attention. That being said, Wicked Spoon was delicious! I loved the little individual servings of pasta, desserts, etc. They had innovative food in a buffet.  Dishes that the average joe might be afraid of and yet they had them out like "try it, you'll like me!" :) I would definitely go back. The only thing I kept thinking was "I feel bad for whoever has to wash each one of these little sauce pans and dishes." :P haha!I'm kind of torn between this buffet. We came in for lunch and the price included a free glass of champagne of Mimosa for a little less than the Wynn or Bellagio which was nice. The buffet itself wasn't overly packed and the ambiance was surprisingly very nice inside. Now onto the food..The buffet was not really large or anything and it offered a good variety of asian inspired dishes, though unfortunately, I can't say any of them tasted right or were made right...The Kalbi (Korean spare ribs) were just too tough to eat and way to chewy/thick, while the little Vietnamese sandwiches made in steamed buns with pork belly and pickled veggies seemed a bit bland and had more peppers in them than actual meat or veggies. The rest of the dishes looked good but were very dry for example, the fish entrees were rather bland and dry. They offered a soup station with Vietnamese vermicelli noodles but what was odd was that there were two pots of broth but it was only Miso and not "pho" broth which completely beat the purpose of having noodles there at all. What I must note about this place was that everything was already portioned for you into little cast iron skillets. The general taos chicken, fish, vegetables and mac & cheese for instance. Now, after having only "nibbled" on most of what was on my plate, I was excited about the dessert options as they still had a decent amount and most of it was very well made. Here were some of the stand outs in my opinion.Gelato:They even had the option of tiny cones and as with most gelato you just can't go wrong with this dessert. I especially loved the chocolate and pistachio flavors.Macaroons:Only go for the mango macaroon which has a nice mango/passion fruit puree and fresh berries inside. This was the first to go and was very delicious. There's a raspberry one but seemed to have a funny after taste.Chocolate covered strawberries:These were by NO means those tiny ones but the large long stemmed variety that Godiva often charges up to $11 per berry for, while here you can have as many as you want included in the price. They had two kind, one with chocolate dipped orea and the other chocolate dipped with peanuts. I am not a fan of peanuts so I stuck with the oreo cookie dipped one.Scones:The lemon scone was perfectly soft, moist and delicious.Molten lava cake:This was served in a mini cast iron pan and although it was not bad, it would have tasted better if it were warmer.And last but NOT least my FAVORITE dessert here:The strawberry shortcake station. You basically get to build your own little shortcake with however many pieces of pound cake, whipped cream and fresh strawberries. As simple as this was, the cake was amazingly moist and the berries and whipped cream were very fresh.For our one glass of alcohol, we both went with a Mimosa which wasn't bad, luckily it wasn't too strong since I don't care for alcohol that much.Overall, I liked the dessert options here better than the Wynne or Bellagio but the food selection kind of disappointed me in that anything Asian did not taste the way it was supposed to and this is coming from a girl raised on the stuff here in SF. However, if you just want to stick to a few of the better dishes, I would recommend filling up on salmon, any vegetable dish and the red velvet pancakes (if you come earlier during breakfast) which unfortunately, I missed but heard were all the rage,  the Mini steamed pork belly sandwiches and the on things like Mac & Cheese were not bad at all.Just be sure to save most of your appetite for the dessert selections, which even beat out the Wynn and Belaggio by far as they definitely were not cheap tasting by any means.I think I will have to come back for those red velvet pancakes next time!Oh Wicked Spoon, you are so wickedly delicious. Why did I decide to stuff myself at Wicked Spoon before hitting the pool? Who knows... but I definitely don't regret any bite of it! Located in the gorgeous Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon gets my vote on best buffet in Vegas! What sets Wicked Spoon apart is the quality and taste of their food. Not the widest selection offered but everything tasted fresh and gourmet. Yums! Best dessert section I've ever seen! Gelato! Cakes! Cookies! Scones! The list goes on. I wish I came for dinner instead of brunch.. that way, I could've stuffed my belly more! If you're looking for a buffet with good food, look no further!I'll be honest, this place scares me.It scares me enough to be reluctant to return to Vegas, a city that I love.It scares me because if I return I'll probably eat til I burst...or literally die.I haven't eaten at a buffet, much less a Vegas buffet in years and after a while, no matter how much you dress or class them up, they all seem the same; mass produced, cookie cutter-food meant to feed the gluttonies of an overweight, diabetes-ridden America.  So when friends of mine who i consider to have serious culinary tastes started to rave about this new buffet in Vegas' Cosmopoliton resort, I had to be skeptical.I mean, c'mon, can any buffet really be that good?So on my recent trip to Vegas I went with a large group for dinner and with all the hype, I went in with a pretty open mind.  Yes the entrance and decor is flashy and fancy as fitting for the new flagship casino/resort on the Vegas strip.  Ok cool, but what about the food?It only took me a few minutes of browsing the buffet aisles to realize what the noise was all about.  While some dishes are still served in large 'serve yourself' dishes and pans, the majority of the buffet items are presented in a tapas, small-plates style.  Everything from the salad bar, to seafood, to asian dishes were presented in individual dishes and tins which one, looks better and two, encourages portion control so you can avoid overloading on one dish and finding yourself running out of space for others.  I was like a kid in a Toys R us store at christmas holding a blank check given by my parents.  Basically I was paralyzed with endless choice and didn't know where to start.Some highlights:The Mac & Cheese station - Like an omelette station, you pick your noodles, cheese and fillings and the cook will make your own custom style mac & cheese with results for better or worse and I tried a swiss-gruyere combo with vegetables thrown in for color.Carvery - aside from the usual roast chicken and prime rib, they also had roast lamb and *gasp* beef bone marrow!  Dessert - full gelato bar and and array of colorful and cool looking premade desserts.Best of all, this buffet ran $40 for dinner, no more expensive than any of the other top level buffets on the vegas strip.  $12 all-you-can-eat sirloin dinner at the Golden Nugget this is not, but I wouldn't even compare the two.I may or may not be back depending how much I want to punish my stomach again.SO disappointed by Wicked Spoon!  I was reading all the raving reviews and drooling over the pictures for weeks before my trip to LV.  Boy, was I in for a sad surprise when I came here on Friday.  My friends and I each paid nearly $40 for dinner and were promptly seated at a booth.  I would recommend that you sit at a table instead for easy in-and-out privileges.  Ugh, we had quite a time getting up and scooting around for each other.Anyway, the food was OLD.  Seriously, a majority of the dishes that had sauce on them already had an ugly, old, crusty or filmy look and texture around 6:30PM.  That should be like the prime time for dinner, but they didn't put out fresh food for the longest time.  I get that sometimes business is slow, but if you keep leaving gross looking food out, who will want to eat it?  It's just a never-ending cycle, you know?I was super unimpressed with the variety of the evening.  A lot of the good food I saw on the Yelp albums were not available and nearly everything I ate was super buttery.  I like butter as much as the next person, but shouldn't there be a variety!?Also, for some reason the food made 3/4 of my girlfriends ill for the rest of the night.  NOT.  COOL.  We came to Vegas to stuff our faces, not to cleanse our colons!In terms of parking, try to park on the WEST side of the lot.  We parked on the EAST side and had to walk about 5 minutes to the buffet.  This is not an issue for me, but it's fair warning for those who are lazy or are with people with mobility issues.Still hung over from a night of drinking we strolled into the Wicked Spoon with one idea in mind, stuffing our faces. I hadn't really slept much and still had a headache but I figured that an all you can eat paradise would get me back on track.  That and maybe a couple more drinks...Now while waiting in line to gain entry into the promised land, I did what every bored fat kid does when waiting in line at a buffet.  I left my friends to sneak a peak at the goods (and maybe have a taste or two).  Best idea ever!As I walked around I noticed that they had a dope carving station with my all time favorite item...ding ding ding PORK BELLY, which was resting beside a giant leg of lamb and a perfectly cooked tri-tip. I began to drool...Honestly at this point I didn't care for much else.  I was planning on eating my weight in pork fat and slabs of rare beef and lab.  I was sold. I then grabbed a few pieces of humbolt fog and headed out to meet my friends and pay.Once in I b-lined straight to the carving station and filled my plate up like I hadn't eaten in days.  Heck after leaving the carving station I didn't have much room for anything else, which worked out well because I had gotten what I came for. MEAT MEAT and more MEAT!And we lived happily ever after...Other notable items were the salads, cheeses, and mini appetizers.  I wasn't a big fan of the pastas, or fish item I tried.  Wood fired pizza was good, and I loved pureed potatoes. The Asian section kinda sucked, but the Asian section at most buffets usually suck so lets call that a wash.  The desserts are kinda wack, minus the gelato and the tiny dessert thing with the mini macaron on top (so cute).Overall I just wasn't that impressed with anything except the carving station, but like I said above it was love at first bite. In fact I'm still dreaming about that succulent pork belly and perfectly cooked beef.  #beingfatrulesbeing a  Cosmo hotel guest, it was annoying having to wait in a long ass line for the brunch. we were HUNGRY!even  Marquee had a separate line for hotel patrons. ugh. anyhow,...they served a complimentary champagne/mimosa for brunch.=) we definitely stuffed our faces!the ham was good, eggs benedict, gnocchi, ribs ...geez i can't remember what all I ate! I ate 5 full plates. desert bar was heaven for me.         SUPER HEAVEN! chocolate covered strawberries, mango gellato, chocolate covered marshmallows,..all my faves!  I ate until I was no longer able to breathe, for my stomach had expanded and almost raptured my lungs. next I will try their dinner. I read something about bone marrow spread. I like bone marrow =)i usually am NOT a fan of buffets.. but this place really puts other buffets to SHAME!they have a lot of individually-sized portion items & some not.. if you want to try everything.. your table should just get one of each & then decide what you want 2nds of!AMAZING DESSERT SELECTION.. especially the humungo chocolate covered strawberries!!!WAY BETTER than the wynn buffet & cheaper too!!!Thank you vegas for having a buffet FINALLY worthwhile!! Okay people!!! For those of you who said the M buffet was the "best" you guys NEED to get here asap! Everything in this place made my mouth water. I went here for the brunch buffet and oh man, my breath was seriously taken away right when I stepped in. The presentation first of all is great. Everything looked as good as it tasted and they came in organized little containers as well so it was so much easier to get what you wanted. There were a lot of good selections of foods here. There might not have been a TON LOAD of food choices like some other places but they had a decent amount and they ALL were worth tasting. And this place actually gives you the OPTION of paying more if you want free alcoholic drinks (more than just beer and wine too) unlike the M which just automatically charges you for the alcohol even if you don't drink. But enough of  the comparisons, this place is just overall the best buffet I've been to in vegas and I feel like I need to inform everyone that if they're really hungry and want a buffet that won't let you down then COME HERE!I'm not a huge fan of buffet's in general, but this one stood out for me. It was pretty, and their presentation, at least for me, was a first.At $35 a person, it's not cheap, but their quality and selection, was pretty impressive. They portion out a lot of their food here, in small, personal sized sauce pans. They're freakin adorable! Also what's nice, is that, every portion looks perfect.The dessert section was good too. Try their bread pudding, I don't even really like bread pudding, but their's is great!Food: 4Ambience: 5Service: 4Value: 2This is not your standard buffet. Located in the Cosmopolitan, the interior design and the food match the rest of the casino -- modern and sophisticated. The vibe was really chic and service was quick. The dishes came in little silver pots that allowed the food to be sizzling hot. For $35 I ate $350 worth of food:* Beef Ribs - Seasoned perfectly and very juicy. * Prime Rib - A perfect medium rare. Meat was tender and juicy. * Breaded Mac & Cheese - Nice cheesy taste but the breading was just too much. * Cheese Spinach Dip - had a very nice flavor.* Mashed Potatoes - Creamy and properly seasoned mashed potatoes.* Truffle Potatoes - This has a great truffle flavor to them. * Salmon - Nice and tender and not overcooked.  * Pad Thai - Noodles were mushy and the flavors did not work.* Shrimp Grits - Very flavorful Cajun flavored shrimp with grits.* Skirt Steak - Nice medium rare, but was under seasoned.* Shumai - Tasty but lukewarm. * Yellowtail sushi - The sushi was acceptable for all you can eat.* Tuna Sashimi - On par to the other all you can eat sushi places.* Braised Beef - Very moist and flavorful that just fell apart nicely.* Tri Tip - Perfectly cooked! Hands down, the carving stations were my favorite. While I still think the Bellagio and Wynn buffets have much higher quality food, the Wicked Spoon Buffet  isn't far behind.Hanging out in our hotel room bf asked what would I like to eat, looking through my yelp app, trying to figure out what to have I came across this gem of a buffet and remembered Michelle T's review on this place plus all the delish looking photos. Well since it was way past closing time for this buffet, we decided to hit it up for brunch before we left town to go back home (le sigh).Here are some very helpful hints to getting ready for the massacre at the buffet! *A good brisk walk before is recommend to fully wake your stomach up and you as well. *Yes, wear your most loose fitting shirts and comfortable eating pants because unlike any other buffet in Vegas you stuff yourself silly and then go straight into a dessert coma after eating everything that you see. * Wicked Spoon is not location anywhere close to the main entrance; rather you have to zigzag to get here. Located past the two famous high-heeled shoes (yes I wanted to take the black one) you finally stumble upon this awesome place. * People it's a popular buffet in Vegas, so don't complain or whine that you have to stand in line, if it means that much to you then get up early and get your booty there.* And don't complain about the prices, would you rather have them charge you $10.00 for the buffet? At least paying a little more you know you get better quality food. However, if you want to spend less then I can suggest some rad buffets on Fremont Street (warning they are sketchy and I would not eat there unless you have a stomach made of steel).* After you devour everything in sight, dont go back to your hotel room to sleep it off, rather walk around the hotel. We did that and found The Kidrobot store and another store that was selling The Hundreds. We arrived about an hour and a half before they stopped serving brunch (eek) no worried they told us, they do not start cleaning up until 2:15-2:30pm. Brunch is served from 8:00am-2:00pm (Monday-Friday) Their weekend hours are a wee more different. $ 22.00 gets you AYCE plus one Mimosa or Bloody Mary. Our hostess was nice as she took us to our table; this dining room was beautiful. In addition, keeping with the Cosmopolitan theme, they had chandeliers in the dining room as well swoon!Bf and I looked at each other and I knew what he was thinking (let's get it on.... Food people, food!!)He went in one direction and I went in another!!I made a totally of 2 trips back for more (I tried to force myself to keep eating but I wanted to save room for dessert since our table was within step to that station and I kept eye balling everything.)-Breaded Mac & Cheese -Pork Buns -Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese-Kimchee-Grilled Korean short ribs-Bacon!-Garlic BreadDessert:-Chocolate covered strawberries-White chocolate covered marshmallows-Macaron with assorted berries -Fudge (it was on the dry side)What I really liked about this buffet is that they had smaller portions, so you are able to sample almost everything they have to offer including desserts.Our waiter was okay, he came by to take our drink orders we opted to have ice tea instead. Plates were taken away pretty much as soon as you set them aside. I was hoping from the photos that I saw there would be more macarons but sadly the only ones I found were the sugar free with berries. I hope that they have them when we come back for dinner soon!With that being said, This is my new favorite buffet!!Wicked Spoon, like the Cosmopolitan Hotel it is housed in, is a welcome breath of fresh air in the culinary buffet scene.  While buffets like Wynn and Bellagio have long dominated, Wicked Spoon does things entirely differently....and succeeds.  It is easily the best new buffet in years.For $29 ($37 with unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne), the weekend brunch presents the following:- selection of cooked items across more ethnic cuisines than any other buffet can match.  Fried chicken, korean short ribs, Vietnamese Shaking Beef, Thai curry, and dim sum to name a few.- excellent presentation and an attention to flavorful and delicious food, not just quantity- the best dessert selection of any buffet.  Rather than soft serve ice cream like many places, they have a full on gelato bar here.  Wow.- Prime Rib, slab bacon, linguica, Rack of Lamb, and Prime Rib Bone are just a sampling of the excellent carving station- more high-end pasta dishes and artfully presented in small metal pots than I've seen anywhere.  If you like pasta or carbs, Wicked Spoon will clearly win you over.  Gnocci, butternut squash ravioli, Smoked Mac and Cheese and Cavatelli are among the top choices.  - great salad and fruit bar, again with innovative and new items like gazpacho puree, blt salads, endive salads, and dipped strawberries that look more like a high end restaurant than a buffetThe only thing keeping Wicked Spoon from 5 stars and possibly not clearly being the top buffet in Vegas is the following:Sushi - California and spicy tuna rolls.  No nigiri, no other rolls, and no sashimiSeafood - they had cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon, but no crab legs, jumbo prawns (Aria, Bellagio), or lobster claws or any other notable seafoodSoups - could only find a miso soup.  Missed the rice porridge from Bellagio (for the Asian high rollers) and other soup options.  Overall, I was thrilled with the value and the variety of Wicked Spoon.  I will clearly be coming here again, but for true seafood lovers, I can see them liking Bellagio, Wynn, or Sterling more.  Nonetheless, while not every item was great, so many things were done right and so differently that Wicked Spoon will be one to bookmark for a long time.Wicked Spoon accepts credit cards, including American Express.My Buffet Rankings:1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  2) Hakone, Oahu - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.  3) Sushi House Goyemon, Las Vegas - great nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked appetizer and dessert selection for an unbelievable $26/pp.4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.  5) Wicked Spoon, Las Vegas - great cooked selection, variety, and high end presentation.  Unmatched desserts and gelato. $29/pp6) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab, sushi $35/ppMy NEW favourite buffet!I KEEP telling myself I have sworn off buffet. i am a picky eater and I am SO OVER buffet. HOWEVER, I will come back to you wicked spoon! Listen up!! I have tried all the ones worth trying and here are the rest of the list in order:Wynn (my old favourite) 2XAria (when it first opened)M ResortBellagio (brunch)Mandalay Bay 2X (brunch and dinner)Paris (brunch)RioNew Orleans (brunch, cheap for the price)The following are disgusting, i would not go again even if it were free:Monte CarloMGMPlanet Hollywood (brunch)Harrah's (brunch)Excalibre (brunch)SO i consider myself making a pretty darn informed decision when i am saying this is THE best buffet.I went for dinner and at $35 a pop, the price was just right. The decor is classy and modern with a vintage twist. All the food I had was pretty well made. Everything actually looked appetising. and i LOVED the fact everything was single serving, making everything look more appetising. Plus less wasteful! If you want more, just get your butt off the seat and grab more!!!Shots of WATERMELON Refreshing, basically like thick watermelon juiceShot of AVOCADO/CUCUMBER/ETC was interesting...I felt healthy drinking it!COCKTAIL SHRIMPS were alright. a little small and lemon was sliced too thinlyCOD Not bad at all. Tender. NOT OVERCOOKED!!! even has asparagus in it.CEVICHE, well made but I am not a fanSNOW CRAB LEGS kinda meh...didn't feel too fresh, there's melted butter too.PRIME RIB Best prime rib I've had at a buffet. medium rare. DONE RIGHT!LEG OF LAMB tasted kind of funky. Do not like. BONE MARROW first time seeing this in a vegas buffet! It's alright...it's a buffet so i didn't expect much...but i would pay for a better bone marrow.TRI TIP It was medium rare, more on the rare side. It was a little salty. but not bad at all. I just prefer prime ribMUSSELS best ones I've had at a buffetCRAWFISH yummy!!!! CREAM PUFF it was ok. Tasted a bit like these asian buns I ate as a kidLEMON TART, it was ok, not too sour like most lemon tart. But i don't like lemon tarts in generalCHOCOLATE COVERED YUMMY!!!! even has oreos on themSLICES OF WATERMELON my favourite to end a buffet!CHOCOLATE CONE yummy but the cone could be crunchierThere's a ton of salad to choose from, some sushi rolls (no nigiri), mac and cheese bar, truffle mashed potatoes, gelato station, fudge, OK I NEED TO GO BACK SO I can eat that stuff. They might have more over the weekend too!***Tips: get the crawfish, load up on seafood, do the meat station but skip the leg of lamb. or ask for a small piece.Favourites: wide variety, GOOD quality for buffetDo not want: It is actually the same price as wynn buffet.... I feel bad taking so many individual servings of cocktail shrimps. Bone marrow was staleLast words: zee best!Normally during Thanksgiving my mom and I go over to my sister and Tom's place to have dinner.  This year my sister wanted to mix it up a bit.  They really wanted to go to Mexico, but it's peak season there so cost was an issue and the whole beheading tourist thing was not optimal.  Viva Las Vegas!!!Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - $40.00/person for dinner.Seafood - Yes, mussels, shrimp, crab, fishMeats - Yes, chicken, pork, beef, turkeyVegetables - Yes, salads.Dessert - Pastries, gelato, cookies, etc.Fruits - YesOther - (1) Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Be prepared to wait so I recommend coming early.Buffet Summary:The Meats - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - I tried the lamb, prime rib, turkey, and bone marrow.  The lamb was excellent--very moist, tender, and flavorful.  The prime rib was really good too--perfectly cooked.  I really liked that they liberally let you have as much horseradish as you want since I love to slather my meat with the stuff.  The turkey is pretty standard and is good with cranberry sauce.  The unfortunate thing is that is cranberry sauce was extremely light and did not add much sweet & tangy to the white meat.  The bone marrow was the least to be desired--extremely oily and felt I was eating fat leftovers.The Seafood - A-Okay (3 Stars) - I had cod, shrimp cocktails, Cajun shrimp, crab legs, mussels, and sushi.  My favorite is the shrimp cocktail and mussels.  The shrimp were all a nicely sized even though there was only 2 per cup.  Shrimp tasted perfectly with the cocktail sauce--perfect amount of sauce per shrimp as well.  It is the morning afterwards and I wish I had another plate of mussels.  What is great about this dish?  It's all about bacon bits.  I'm not talking about bacon bits from the bottle.  I'm talking about bits that you could fling and take out somebody's eye.  Every bit of the mussels were tender and the pairing with the fatty and moist bacon got me all shooked up.  FYI - the sushi section is quite embarrassing.The Dessert - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My soon to be brother in law said "The dessert section looks dangerous."  If most of you know me, I do not have a sweet tooth--sweets ARE dangerous to me.  However, maybe it was the desert (or dessert) air that made me want some sweets.  Amongst the cheesecakes, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, and pastries ... I chose the gelato.  I chose mango, biscotti, tiramisu gelato.  The server gave me three medium jawbreaker sized scoops per flavor.  The biscotti and tiramisu were good.  The mango had the taste and consistency of mango.  The sweet fix was over.I'm a season veteran to the buffet league and after a while everything seems homogenous.  Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions.  The un-appeal is the wait--it took us +1 hour to get in.  Whichevers, it was Thanksgiving Day so I guess that is expected.  Wicked Spoon is A-Okay.  Happy Thanksgiving Yelpers!!  I've finally made it to 100 reviews.I'm not a buffet person but when it's complimentary why not? I ate here twice once for lunch and once for BF.  What a decent spread for brunch during the week! Started off with a Bloody Mary which was included on the brunch. Some of the items in the buffet - Korean short ribs, Dim Sum, Sushi, slab bacon, shrimp cocktails, mac and cheese, Ham, turkey, fried chicken, cooked to order omelets, pizza, salads and yummy Tri Tip just to name a few. My favs in the dessert area the peanut butter cookie and Gelato. I did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing. The waiter we had was friendly and really accommodating.Only con here I felt was that the brunch buffet should open earlier for the working people like myself. Hours are from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm Monday - Friday.Wicked Spoon is indeed Wicked! She pulled us in with her outstanding, beyond delicious, out of the world dinner, only to crush our spirits, abuse us, and kick us out the door with her Brunch. Dinner Saturday night was AMAZING! Our server was so attentive, the food was delicious and we couldn't get enough! The stars of the show were the Prime Rib sandwich, the mac & cheese bar and the gingerbread gelato. 5 STARS! On our way out of the Cosmopolitan I was awarded a free brunch for the next day, which I considered a tremendous blessing. We returned for brunch only to find an hour long line, followed by another hour long line, followed by the WORST service in the world and food that we swear had been sitting in the bins since we had left the night before! The star of that show was the gelato scooper from the night before and his winning smile. Our server was so rude and  he completely ruined our experience. The only advice I can offer is that if you go and there is a long line for brunch, to have half your party wait in the paying line and the other half wait in the "waiting to get a table" line. It will cut your time in half, and you will look incredibly rude. Welcome to Vegas. Enjoy your spaghetti.Just like every restaurant, bar & bathroom housed in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, the Wicked Spoon Buffet is decorated so avant-garde, so posh that you forget your own name just looking at its chandeliers. I LOVE that food is pre-portioned in its own single-serve bowls & dishes. This eliminates my biggest fears about buffets: contamination from multiple hands touching ONE serving spoon & piling on portions I'll either waste (boooo!) or eat with reckless abandon (boooo x2!) Wicked Spoon keeps me in check! My favorite eats were: * crispy chicken with cabbage kim chee * fried chicken * shrimp & grits (I got two portions!)* chocolate-covered strawberries * pulled pork tostada* red wine cheddar cheeseOther grub that I probably wouldn't repeat:* short ribs: too fatty* maple glazed pork loin* macarons: tasted like meringue w/ jam inside. Not chewy enough. * beignets w/ chocolate & raspberry sauces (cute presentation sitting in its own tiny deep fryer!) * mushroom risotto* all their desserts: gorgeous to look at (see pic), but taste was not worth ALL them calories.The guys loved the hot crab legs & carved meats. $35 per person for dinner (no matter what day of the week.) The wait to be seated that Thursday night was no more than 10 minutes. Probably the only buffet I look forward to eating at again!Me: Are we going to a buffet later?Her: "We could" spoon later.Me: ummmm, ok! (amazed and happy)Her: Yeah, it's at the Cosmo....Me: Oh shucks, you meant "WICKED" Spoon buffetHer: Yeah, what buffet were you thinking of?Me: ummm....yeah, wicked spoon (frown, walks away quickly) I don't go to buffets often...due to control issues.  I have been to several and usually get disappointed because they don't meet certain criteria that I look for in buffets....cleanliness, selection, and quality of food.  WSB excels in all areas. Personal servings are great and presentation adds a wonderful touch.  You can tell they take extra care in preparing their food.  I was a major fan of their carving station and impressed with all-you-can-eat bone marrow and fresh beignets in little deep-fry baskets.  I did expect more dessert items, but they did have a good assortment of gelato flavors.  WSB is one of the hottest buffets in town.  And their reputation precedes them.  For someone who normally hates buffets, this place is so worth the experience.  We went early on a Sunday evening and there was no line.  I also wanted to get back to the room early. wink wink.I love you Wicked Spoon! ugh...they are my favorite buffet of all buffets! My sister got to experience it for the first time, for her birthday. That girl can eat so this place was perfect for her! The set is so upscale. At least to me. Pretty upscale for a buffet. Upscale buffet? Nice...We also got a nice bottle of red wine as well for $20. We just had to celebrate that way. I tried their mushroom truffle, their lobster pasta, and I freaked when I found out they had a mac and cheese station! Yes, i went a little crazy at the mac and cheese station. This time, I was able to REALLY try the dessert table. The ice cream and pastry chef was so friendly, fun, and enthusiastic! He helped us pick an ice cream and suggested some great things. So here's the scoop on the ice cream flavors (haha! scoop! pun was intended):blood orange-if you like grapefruit it tastes like grapefruit. Not strong grapefruit. a mild grapefruit.biscotti-tastes like a biscotti and is super delish! it goes GREAT with their molten lava cake.almond joy-need i say more? i thought so..that's it! get crazy here guys! it's well worth it!Came here for brunch on a weekend and surprisingly not that long of a wait. Unfortunately the food was disappointing. LOTS of options from pho to omelets, but the saying "less is more" definitely applies to this situation. Instead of offering a ridiculous amount of flavorless food, the kitchen should eliminate some dishes and focus on making the food taste better. I literally had a bite of everything and the only things I enjoyed were the lox bagels (unless the salmon is bad you really can't go wrong with this) and a few desserts.wow. the coveted 5 star review. i dont give out these willy nilly....especially for a buffet. i mean i think maybe outside of the M, the highest a vegas buffet would get from me was 4 stars... (and thats even after living in hednerson/green valley/silverado ranch/las vegas for 7 years before moving back to san diego)here's why the wicked spoon stands out IMO - the GRUB:- tapas style portions! genius concept IMO - because you wont have those peeps at the buffet shoveling mounds of shrimp cocktail and mac n cheese like its going out of style - the portions are reasonably prepared, presented and tastefully done in deliciously satisfying tapas dishes. if you want more, you would need to get up and get another serving.... imagine that, an all you can eat buffet without peeps thinking that they should get it all on just one run...- highlights: herb crusted tri tip, blackened cod fillets, korean bbq short ribs, angry mac n cheese, grilled corn cobettes, sushi, and shrimp cocktail shots- desserts were awesome - my faves: chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato from the case, and petite dessert cups- bottles spring water table side was a nice touchthe JOINT:- clean and very modern art decor- plenty of friendly staff to seat and serve you- open kitchensthe SQUEEZE:- $22 p/person on a saturday lunch. not bad at all! actually it pretty much is a steal for a vegas buffet of this caliber.- cash and card accepted- love its location at the cosmopolitanFINAL SAY:the very low price, the flavorful food, and the tapas concept and presentation are all ingredients IMO for a stellar vegas buffet experience - 5 stars!The Wicked Spoon Buffet is located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  Just take the escalators nearest the check-in desk to the second floor and follow the signs......or the aroma of food, I'm sure either one will lead you to this food mecca.My friend and I decided to to skip any breakfast completely and went to directly to Wicked Spoon for their brunch buffet.  Priced at $22.00, the brunch buffet is available Monday thru Friday from 8am till 2pm.The selections for brunch were quite diverse, and I truly appreciated that since it was 10am....a little too late for breakfast, but perhaps for some, still early for lunch.  Breakfast foods included sausages, fruits, cheeses, breads, bagels, and parfait.  Other standouts and favorites included the sushi, pizzas, ravioli, and fried chicken.  The food was very satisfactory, but for me in particular there wasn't that "wow" factor that took my breath away.  However, I think Wicked Spoon makes an impression with their presentation, such as the fried chicken served in miniature deep fryer basket, whilst the ravioli was served in tiny fry pans.  BEST:  The most memorable part about brunch:  dessert, of course.  I wish I had saved more room for dessert because the choices and selection would have satisfied any and all sweet tooth cravings.  Not wanting to over indulge, I made sure I chose only what I knew I would finish.  I ended up with 2 raspberry macaroons, 1 cheesecake, and 1 pecan pie.  Loved dessert.SERVICE:  Good.  Not excellent....but good and satisfactory.  The server was friendly enough, but we had to wait for what seemed like a century before we got refills for our soda.Bottom Line:  I thought the price for brunch was reasonable and the selection was satisfactory.  I wouldn't rule out another visit to Wicked Spoon, but perhaps for dinner next time.This is a really nice place! The Wicked Spoon Buffet has got my vote as one of the better buffets in Vegas. I was really impressed by the entrance to the buffet. It is really modern and the decor impressive. If you get there around 6ish, you should be able to get in without an extra long wait. Our group of ten waited maybe 15 minutes. Once seated, you are immediately met by the server who will take care of you during your dinner.  We sat at a long table with high bar chairs which I really lThey bring you flasks of water so no need to keep asking for refills. Once you decide to get started you are literally met by a barrage of different stations offering up so many different delectable food selections! I especially enjoyed the salad bar and the BLT salad, it was really good. The shrimp cocktail was refreshing. On to the meat! You have a selection of prime rib, lamb, bone with the marrow in it, yes, seriously. They also have BBQ ribs, fish, chicken, the crispy baked chicken was tasty. As for us crab leg lovers, well, I wasn't overly impressed, it was standard buffet fare and if it were true Alaskan King Crab Legs, I'm sure the price of the buffet would have been stiffer! They didn't have that natural saltiness to it, maybe they were boiled? There is a sushi section where you can have custom rolls made or just sample the different varieties. There is an extensive selection of desserts, from pies to cakes, gelato, ice cream, chocolate bars... Would I go back next time? You bet!Yelp Challenge 365 # 174/365On the reviews of Dave F, Michael C, Chau V and last but not least Kevin P, I decided to give this place a try. Let me preface my review by saying I am not much of a buffet person... okay, call me a buffet snob and based on my being a buffet snob, I am compelled to write a review of what I found to be1) a new concept of buffet. Why? because each course is served in its individual dishes; portioned just right for the tasting2) a beautiful place in a sassy hotel and casino3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it. The 2nd floor is designed such that you can simply follow the signs and you will find it.4) reasonable in cost; the dinner buffet is $355) a great place to taste wines you can pair with your selections of food. You would have to purhcase a wine card for $25. Take the card to the wine chill, select your variety of wine with a 1 ounce minimum.... and you're good to go. You will be able to pair your food with the wineAnd the list goes on. For the most part, if I had to do a buffet in Las Vegas, I would definitely go back to the Wicked Spoon.By the way, my favorite course was the lobster mac n cheese, veal sliders, followed by their fresh seafood bar and then.... deserts!Finally after a few trips to Vegas, I got to try out Wicked Spoon!  I already had a pretty good idea what to expect from this buffet since all my friends have been here already and posted positive reviews and delicious food pics.  My first foray with WS was for Friday Brunch.I liked how everything was served in small portions so you could try things without picking up too much.  The best things I had for brunch were the Kalbi Ribs, The Smoked Salmon, Beet Salad, Eggs Benedict, their Mac N Cheese and a good amount of stuff from the Dessert Station.  I wasn't too fond of the meat selection from their Carving Station though.  The Bacon Slab was pretty bland and the Tri-Tip was tough even though I had a medium rare piece.I'm not a big buffet person, but Wicked Spoon was a really fun buffet.  I can't say it edges out the Wynn, but they're both pretty close overall.  I wouldn't mind going back again to see what they have for dinner.Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!Wicked Spoon is simply over-rated. The desserts are the best part and do leave a good last impression, but compared to the elite buffets of Vegas, Wicked Spoon doesn't have the quality, service, freshness, or variety to be considered 5-star. It's a-ok which is totally a-ok.Sunday night dinner: 3 - 3.5/5 starsThere were no stations for fresh, made to order items like pasta, crepes, salads, etc. Instead portions are placed into small bowls like a cafeteria. There were no fresh sashimi or sushi offerings except two California rolls. The Snow Crab was average frozen fare. Salmon was meh. No XLB. Asian food looked like Panda Express.On the positive side, Bone Marrow was cool (though not spectacular). By far the most spectacular section is the desserts. 2 flavors of macarons were chewy fun and Red Velvet Cookies were worth a try. Save room for the Gelato and get a couple of the huge Chocolate-covered Strawberries.Service was fine. Our waitress brought drink (Mojito) re-orders and cleared plates as expected. She earned her tip.If you are at the Cosmopolitan or nearby hotel then the Wicked Spoon is an a-ok option when in the mood for an AYCE BuffetSorry Wynn, but I have a new fave buffet! I first attempt to eat here for lunch was thwarted by the fact that on weekends it only runs til 3PM. I got there at 2:30 so I didn't think it was worth it. The people who stayed in line begged to differ though and now I can see why. This time I got in line a little before 12 on a Sunday and the line moved pretty quickly. It only took about 10 minutes for my group of 3 to get a table and start doing some damage.Ribs - Fatty, meaty, and 100% delicious!! I would have gotten another if it weren't for the fact that I had so many other things to try.Korean BBQ Ribs - Too tough. Took a bite and gave up on the rest. Can't waste precious stomach space on food that isn't bomb. Chicken Wings- These come in an adorable mini-fryer. Honestly I got it for the presentation, but the wings themselves were crispy and amazing all on their own!Gnocchi - Good, but wasting stomach space on carbs at a buffet is an amateur move.Salmon - A nice and strong lemon flavor that accented the fish very well. Corn on a Cob - With one bite I felt like no corn I will have from now til my next Wicked  Spoon trip will ever measure up.**Crispy Pork** - DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS DISH ALBEIT IT'S UNAPPEALING APPEARANCE, FELLOW YELPERS!!!! It was hands down the most amazing dish I've ever had in Vegas. I originally got it for the single fried plantain chip because the dish hardly looked appetizing. The pork itself is dry and I'm not a fan of black beans. I was about to cast it in the rejection pile but for some reason I dug past the beans and came upon rice. THE RICE WAS SO DELICIOUS THAT I FINISHED THE ENTIRE DISH minus the dry pork. It soaked up all the fat from the pork and sent me straight to fatty heaven. Macarons - There were 2 different flavors: berry and mango, both of which were good.Chocolate Dipped Chocolate Cake Pop - Thick and moist and a lot better than it looks.We left in solid food comas a little past 1 and the line was pretty bad. Come before 12 to avoid the madness! Don't sleep in! Vegas isn't a place to sleep anyway!Wicked Spoon, at $31 for Sunday brunch, was well worth my money. I look forward to my return. GET THE CRISPY PORK!!!!!!!So good that we had to come back 2 days in a row.  True testament to how awesome this buffet place is.  It really does stand out from other buffets on the strip, which is a herculean task since Vegas is THE mecca of buffets and since everything in Vegas is so over the top extra, just like this sentence.Food: Most of it was good, some not so much.  But you're at a buffet - if you don't like it, keep it moving, there's more food around the corner. Notable mentions and nods to the following: -Yogurt parfait with blueberries and walnut granola crumble: easy to pass this one by and you would think, why would you fill up on this but I'm glad I did. - Angry Mac & Cheese: angry because this mac & cheese has got both bark and bite.  They use sharp cheddar (yum) so you definitely get a kick of flavor unlike most mac & cheese served anywhere else which is boring, lacking flavor and suffocating in cream.  The best mac & cheese I've had.  Nothing else is needed to make this dish better.-Eggs Benedict: filling yet still light enough because they used shaved ham and not canadian bacon.  -Coffee: yes, I said coffee.  I was prepared to drink coffee flavored water because I thought they wouldn't pay much thought or attention to their beverages, but they do!  Piping hot, which I could just hug them for, and actually good.  -Desserts: the island is mesmerizing and a feast for the eyes.  Don't get too excited though...only some of the desserts are good.  The chocolate covered strawberries dipped in toffee and nuts are serious.  Literally, the only bad thing I really can complain about is the gelato.  We tried 2 different flavors and both made me want to gag.  Thinned out gelato that has the consistency and taste of sweet mucous.-Complimentary mimosa or bloody marys - the blood mary is mean.  Super stiff drink and generous pour of alcohol in this drink.  Prepared to be lit beyond measure if you actually can finish it. Presentation: This is what truly won me over.  Most, not all, of the dishes are in individual portions.  Such thoughtful execution that brings sophistication to a buffet.  Service is stellar.  Seriously, how is everyone so cheerful and helpful?  I appreciated this so much because it really is such a nice accent.  And because of this customer service, I felt like I was at a restaurant, not at a buffet. We encountered several different employees here from the register lady to the hostess that seats you to the server who brings you your drinks to the line cooks serving you the meat of your choice.  The service is seamless and smooth.Overall, it's a great buffet that indeed offers less variety than other buffets but there's no way you will leave feeling jipped. Location: a walk to get to because they tuck this in the far back in the corner on the 2nd floor of CosmopolitanPrice: $22+tax  from 8am-3pmMy new favorite buffet in Vegas!  Here's the thing, I've kind of burned myself out on buffets, especially after once doing all of the buffets on the Buffet of Buffets in 24 hours once, but my tried and true, hands down best has been The M... until now.  Don't get me wrong, I still think The M is awesome, but Wicked Spoon upped the ante.I'd heard the lines can be crazy so I made my husband check in on Foursquare for three days in a row at Cosmopolitan hot spots so that he would have the badge that gets you VIP line access.  No worries there, since we went early... they open at 5pm and we were there at, um, 5:10, there was NO line.  I was surprised since it was Labor Day, but yea for us!  No wait to pay, no wait to be seated and quick access to the AMAZING food.I was a little exhausted after the five mile hike to back of the Cosmo property to FIND Wicked Spoon, but luckily sustenance was mine.  What impressed me the most was that the food was presented beautifully AND it was very good.  A lot of times buffet food is just cafeteria food, but I did not get that at all from this one.  I liked that they had your staples, prime rib, pork roast, etc at the carving station and crab legs and asian fare, BUT that they also had unusual items as well, like the General Tso pigs feet and I'm still kicking myself for getting too full before I tried the roasted marrow!  The selection is just a huge wow.  But, I noticed some things would run out quickly and I'd miss out... I never got to try the roasted beet salad, which is a favorite of mine.  My favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!), and this one strange little chocolate shot dessert thing that I can't describe for the life of me except to say, YUM.  I really enjoyed the "salad/appetizer" section because they had so many little interesting crostinis, cheeses, salads, etc.  I could graze there all night... oh wait, I did.  Oddly, my husband LOVED the dessert bar.  He seriously had three helping and this man does NOT have a sweet tooth.  STRANGE!I feel like I missed out on a lot because I just get full too fast!  What I didn't care for was the chocolate lava cake - um, no lava, and the gnocchi I had was okay, but too soft for my taste.  Surprisingly, the angry mac and cheese did not wow me.  The flavor was good, but the one I got was super dry.  Darn it.The staff was all very friendly and attentive.  It was $41 per person on Labor Day evening 2012.  I think that is pricey, but we all felt it was an acceptable price to pay to splurge for a buffet of this caliber. I'm guessing we'll be back.WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?~the food, which I loved, was a little inconsistent - not everything was cooked correctly and that dropped them a half star.~removal of used dishes more quickly would be a plus.  We found it odd that they would come by and remove plates, but never took our glasses away when a new one was brought so we had quite a collection of glasses - another minus half star.This place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies that I follow. And there are PLENTY of damn good reasons why it's hyped up. For one, it's the best damn buffet I've ever eaten at! We literally had less than 40 minutes to grab a quick bite to eat before heading over to The Orleans to watch the prejudging show for The 2012 Mr. Olympia. So me, being stubborn about the main places I wanted to hit up while we were in Vegas, still wanted us to dine here even though we wouldn't have enough time to even enjoy all the wonderful food they offer here...I paid about $82 for the both of us. Yep, the dinner price here is quite high but here's why I feel it was still worth it. 1) The seating arrangements are super fancy schmancy including the silverware, glass water bottle and cloth napkins on your table. 2) The waiter service is exactly like the service you would receive at a Michelin starred restaurant. 3) The FOOD! Delicious and quite fancy too.I really enjoyed the seafood selection they had here. Some of the items that I devoured that stood out to me was the bone marrow, yes! bone effing marrow at a buffet, the duck confit ravioli, the seared raw fish plates, the fried oysters, the shrimp ceviche...and oh gosh, so much more...but I can't seem to remember much because I literally devoured 7 full plates in 30 minutes. I'm a binge eater, and effin proud of it!The best station hands down here would have to be their dessert station. OMFG! Macarons, freshly baked red velvet white chocolate chip cookies, chocolate dipped waffle cones, fruit tarts with chocolate mousse, cheesecake, gelato, pecan pie and so so much more! I had 2 full plates of desserts. If we seriously had at least an hour or 2 to dine here, I would have ended up eating 10 plates of desserts alone. Amaze balls!I really really love how most of the food items here are portioned out into "spoons". Even though I have no portion control, I like the fact that I don't have to wait in a line to scoop any food out of a tray.Wicked Spoon, you won me over with your wicked wicked sweets! :DOne time I read a review that said, "You know you're a glutton when you're reading reviews of buffets." Yeah, pretty much. We went here for the weekday brunch and definitely ate our way through $22/ea. Mmmmm okay, I guess you can twist my arm into a free mimosa. After that, $9 per person for unlimited! That sounds like a belly and a head ache to me, but I'm sure many take advantage of it.I'm not sure which I like better--the newly redone Bacchanal Buffet or the Wicked Spoon. Both had exceptional quality, and I suppose I can't adequately compare the two since I have only had dinner at Caesars' and only brunch at Cosmopolitan. The brunch at Wicked Spoon was a lot more lunch than it was breakfast, though both meal offerings were delicious. I caught the tail end of biscuits and gravy in its own little bowl with onion strings on top. It was fantastic with its house-made sausage. Probably my favorite breakfast item--though like I said there weren't as many breakfast items to choose from. I missed out on the famed red velvet pancakes! It was sad, but I got over it pretty quickly with all the rest of the things I had to choose from.Lunch was awesome--sushi, angry mac and cheese (so good, SO GOOD), duck confit ravioli, pizza, carving stations. I will say that there aren't as many made-to-order stations here than at Caesars. No matter, though, I usually like to see what creations the chef has come up with with unlimited resources.And then, of course, are the desserts. I need to just start here next time. There were also breakfast pastries here, and I'm sure they get sad that they often get overlooked because everyone is busy with savory breakfast fare. I made up for whatever slight they feel by having two croissants, in addition to macarons, chocolate mousse cones, cookies, cakes, and my personal favorite of the day, a pumpkin cheesecake. Give me anything pumpkin or anything cheesecake in general--but when you combine the two, it's pure magic.I always feel like a bad person when I eat at a buffet, mostly because of all that food waste. I guess it's just something you have to accept (especially living in Vegas). However, I will say that Wicked Spoon, among others, has tried to curb food waste by serving the small individual portions, making me feel slightly less horrible about my first world existence. I would definitely recommend Wicked Spoon for its value only--still a week or so later I'm comparing the price of other meals I eat out to the $22 brunch. ("What? I paid $9 for this crappy mall Chinese food? That's half a buffet!") I want to try the dinner next!This is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas! It is why the line is so long for Wicked Spoon!A lot of the dishes are portioned in a small bowl or plate. I feel really bad for all the dishes that the dishwashers have to deal with everyday! The appetizers and main dishes are really good and there is a wide variety to choose from. So everyone can find a favorite dish here. Another thing I like about Wicked Spoon is the decor of this place. It is romantic with dim lighting. It feels like you are dining in a restaurant rather than at a buffet. The best part about Wicked Spoon is the dessert selection! I made sure I saved enough room in my stomach for it! I love the gelato, raspberry cheesecake, apple cobbler, and the chocolate dipped strawberries. The only thing I did not like were the macarons. But overall I think Wicked Spoon is really good!I definitely have mixed feelings about this buffet after coming here for lunch with the lady.WICKED DISLIKES:I found the carving station...seriously LACKING for a carnivore. Marrow...and bacon...and sausages...with a "chef" that tells people to wait all the time to the point that people grab stuff themselves? What a joke. [Look, I'm not complaining that there is no prime rib or slow cooked ribs or a rack of awesome hotness being unavailable...it's pretty sad for a meat carving section when I pass by more than 10 times to find the "chef" cleaning his area like he has OCD because he has nothing to serve]Salad and greens...where are thee? You are missing just like the meat in the meat section! Little-overkill-on-the-dressing-Caesars-salad-in-a-bowl is the only leafy green available?Chinese food...OMFG...you fall under the definition of CRAP. The packaging, which used mini-Chinese-paper-take-out-little-boxes was freaking awesome though.Korean BBQ [their version of galbi]...easily has the highest turnover for any meat at the buffet since I'm sure people are trying to get their meat fix one way or the other and have been clearing this mound of meat within 1 min after the "chef" piles it on...well, tastes NASTY [overmarinated, 50-60% fat...just saying]WICKEDLY AWESOME:Steamed clams. You'll find these beauties in a bowl...lusciously presenting the inner-selves to you with hints of tomatoes and garlic. This became my staple dish during lunch here...and I RAIDED that section (with the assistance of the lady as well)...they put 20 out, we grab 5 bowls...GANGNAM STYLE. It wasn't long before the "chefs" got the hint that their clams were a hit at 2 pm and replenished it repeatedly all the way to closing time.Now here's the thing that prevented me from DINGING the crap out of this place when it's priced on average higher than most other buffets...It seems like Wicked Spoon Buffet forgot to add one word to their name and that is DESSERTS.I don't even eat DESSERTS. I remind most people that I don't care about DESSERTS. But I found myself eating a LOT of DESSERT here.WICKING VERDICT:Definitely not a meat-eaters paradise...as this place was created for you freaking SUGAR ADDICTS.I'm doubling down on this hands down!! One of THE best buffets I've been to thus far in life. I'm not one for buffets either so this actually coming out of my fingertips is definitely something to pay attention to!Real.Talk.There is food of all kinds, textures, colors...it's blatantly amazing.  There's a breakfast/omelette station, carving station, sushi station, etcetera etcetera...Plus a full blown dessert galore station including Gelato...Oh Man!  I had to pace myself and count out my bites just so I didn't get too full too fast.  I wanted to try everything!  We topped off our brunch with some bottomless mimosas - like the food, the servers kept them mimosas comin'!  Good job!The restaurant is fabulously decorated, spacious and clean.  There was adequate seating and space for large parties.  Be sure to make this a restaurant to experience before leaving Las Vegas.  You will regret not going here, and I'm so not even playing...This is probably the most creative of all the buffets, but dishes are hit or miss.  There are two main things that differentiate this buffet from most of the other "nice" buffets in Vegas.   1. Exotic Ingredients/Creative Pairings2. Portioned ServingsIf you consider yourself a foodie or an adventurous eater, you'll want to give Wicked Spoon a try.  Where else can you get Sweetbread Dirty Rice (not bad), Fried Oysters (pretty good), Crab Legs, Braised Short Rib over Creamy Polenta (very good), Wild Mushroom Risotto (tasted great, but they need to cook the rice an extra 15 minutes, a few grains were still gritty), Butternut Squash Raviolis with Duck Confit (surprisingly too doughy, not enough butternut squash taste, and not good), and Bone Marrow?  I went for dinner.  The day you go they'll probably have totally different dishes.  They have your standards, like a well seasoned tender prime rib.  They have a build your own mac 'n' cheese station.  The Asian foods, like the sushi look unappealing.  They have quality cheeses, like St Agur Blue Cheese (Or was it Stilton? I forget), really good shrimp ceviche.  The night I went they did not have the sweet potato fry station up and running.  The food variety is all over the place, just stay away from the Asian foods.  I'm a fan of their portioned servings.  No, they aren't trying to restrict how much us piggies want to eat, because really, how much food can one piggy eat?  Things like risotto get served in their own cute little stainless steel cooking pot.  If you love the dish, sure you can grab two or three pots for your plate, but if you just want to taste some, the portioned servings are perfect.  How I see it is... it saves you from over spooning and overeating, when your efforts can be better spent on other dishes.  Alcohol here is extra (not like the free beer and wine bar at the Studio B Buffet @ M Hotel). What you cannot pass up is the dessert bar.  Want to make a girl happy?  Bring her here!  Vegas has stepped up the dessert bars over the years with Wynn, M Hotel, and now the Cosmopolitan.  They have macarons!  The French kind!  Like salted caramel and passionfruit macarons!  There's an expansive gelato bar (looked like maybe 16 flavors?) that is a must sample.  Jumbo chocolate dipped strawberries, covered in nuts.  Mini tiramisus.  Red velvet cookies.  The dessert bar is probably the most impressive part of the overall buffet... there's no better way to tap out!  Best buffet?  It's pretty close.  I still think I like Wynn's buffet the best, with Studio B and Wicked Spoon running neck and neck depending on what you prefer that day.  All of those are way ahead of Bellagio's buffet.  I have not tried the new Caesars' buffet, so I can't compare it to that.For $40 I thought this was a pretty darn good deal. Nice ambiance, service, and best of all, really good and interesting food. You won't find any gross giant chafing dishes of buffet food here; instead, most items come on their own individual serving plates/dishes, which contributes to the high-end feel of this place. While they have your prime rib (excellent), pasta, and all the other usual dishes you expect at a buffet, they also offered some some out-of-ordinary fare which I greatly enjoyed, like the roast bone marrow (accompanied by toast and sea salt, yum!), sauteed calves liver, and beef tongue shepherd's pie. They had a kale salad that was divine, and there was very little to fault with any other offerings I tried. I thought the Korean BBQ galbi was a little on the fatty side, but not bad. Their dessert selection was pretty outstanding as well, with a Thai Iced Tea ice cream that was out of this world! My friends and I had a great time and was appropriately stuffed by the time we waddled out of there. This changed my idea of a buffet forever, and I am looking forward to my next visit.I have never wanted to try a Las Vegas buffet as much as I wanted to go to Wicked Spoon.  The concept of individualized containers and high-end items really appealed to me. After a couple of failed attempts and massively long lines, I got my chance.  The individualized containers were all that I could have ever hoped for.  Little ramekins, bowls, and cups of pasta, meats, and salads were so cute and portioned for grazing.  Those containers also made handling a plate really difficult since you could never put more than 2-3 containers on a plate at any one time. A major disappointment was how quickly Wicked Spoon ran out of "the good stuff."  Someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.  When I returned for the first seating of dinner, they were still out of bone marrow.  I managed to try the salmon and beluga lentil dish, which was delicious.  They one measly plate of macarons which I later discovered they had no intent of refilling.  They udon noodle bar never seemed to have any noodles.  I enjoyed the prime rib, fried oysters, gelato bar, marshallows, kale salad, and variety.  It was very heavy in carbs - lots and lots of pizzas and filling pastas as per buffet usual but they were well-done too.  My major gripe was that it didn't seem luxurious or interesting enough.  No bone-marrow, sweetbreads, lamb chops, macarons, rilletes, pork belly, xiao lung bao, all of which I saw in other yelp photos.  One of the more unique items on our visit was the calves liver and onions.  Just because it's offal doesn't make liver and onions a desirable dish! It's still up there as an interesting and delicious buffet but at $42 dinner and $37 lunch plus the long lines...just know what you're getting yourself into.If you are looking for a midweek discount to do buffets this is the place to go.Located at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Wicked Spoon offers small scrumptious servings - a shot of ceviche, a creme brulee - in cute mini pots and baskets.Pass on the sushi - meh. The prime rib was juicy and tender, the raw salmon is delish yet not fishy, and the best part of all are the desserts, the ice cream was fab!plus a complimentary drink of your choice - besides coffee, soda and juice you could also have either champagne, mimosa or a bloody Mary.The weekend brunch costs $30, but weekdays it's a steal at $22.***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.Not many places are worth an hour and a half wait (in line), but Wicked Spoon is.Yeah there will be a ridiculous wait. First you'll have to wait in line to pay (about 45 minutes) and then when you're all stoked that you get to eat....there's another line to be seated (another 45 minutes). And the entire time you see people rolling out of the restaurant. Too stuffed to walk. The price was just under $40, not cheap, but well worth it. You can also upgrade to bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's for a few extra bucks.   So this isn't your run of the mill buffet. This buffet is whats up! It is a perfect hangover cure because it has got everything you could imagine. All sorts of brunch items (my personal favorites were the french toast and eggs Benedict). There were also vast quantities of bomb meats, chicken. pasta (the gnocchi was just wow), sea food, ...everything damnit! The service was a bit slow the day I went, but apparently they had understaffed that day. The waitress was also super nice and really apologetic. The weakest link were the desserts. The assortment wasn't great. The best part was probably the thai tea gelato. Which was crazy good.As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: Standard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. ::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::Due to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: Perfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.::: [ SERVICE ] ::: Only experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.::: [ DRINKS ] ::: Wine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don't forget to ask for coffee when you're ready to move on to dessert!::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: I've dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.____________________________KEY:(-) Skip This(+) Try This(++) Love ThisI have either 1.) never tried or 2.) feel indifferent towards the ones that have no symbol next to them. ____________________________DATE/TIME: MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 // 7:30PM::: [ SAMPLE OF THE SPREAD AT DINNER ] :::[ ASIAN ]Egg Drop SoupCabbage SaladWok Tossed UdonHar GauBeef Stir FryCompart Duroc Pork Ribs (+)Korean Kalbi Short RibsSushi[ ITALIAN ] Duck Ravioli (++)Italian Sausage Pappardelle (++)Spaghetti w/Smothered Cherry TomatoesAsiago Gnocchi w/Lamb Ragu (++) / sometimes chewy, good flavorBraised Beef Short Rib w/Polenta (+)Margherita PizzaChicken Garlic PizzaSausage and Roasted TomatoProsciutto Stromboli (+)Prime Rib Pannini w/Truffle AioliBroccoli Rabe w/Pine Nuts & Garlic Roasted Red PeppersCrispy Chicken Thighs w/Pancetta and Romanesco[ MEAT ETC ]Shepherd's Pie (+) / too much potatoTruffle PotatoPotatoes au Gratin (++) / not there yest but usuallyCreamed Spinach (+)Roasted Sweet Potato w/House-Made MarshmallowCarnitas w/Black Bean & Salsa FrescaGreen Garlic Roasted TomatoesPotatoes O'BrienVeal Sweetbreads "Dirty Rice" (-) / missing sweetbreadsWicked Fried Chicken (-)Roasted ChickenPrime Rib (+) / good quality & textureLeg of LambBone Marrow (++)SAUCES: Au Jus, Chimichurri, Horseradish Cream, Red Onion Marmalade[ RANDOM ]Wild Boar Sloppy Joe's (+)Citrus Glazed SalmonBBQ Shrimp & White Cheddar Grits (+)Crab Legs (+)Crispy Corn Tacos[ MAC AND CHEESE ]* This station is always either a Design-Your-Own Mac & Cheese or Shrimp Station.[ COLD FOODS ]FRUITS: Bananas, Apples, MandarinSquid Chili Gochuchang (+)Egg and Candied Bacon SaladChopped SaladBlistered Vegetable PanzanellaSmoked Trout Salad w/Frisee (++)Marinated Mushrooms w/Burrata & FoccaciaShrimp Ceviche (+)Shrimp CocktailDeviled EggsWhite Bean and Tuna Crostini w/Truffle Oil & ParsleyRoasted Beet Salad w/Arugula, Goat Cheese, & Sherry VinaigretteKale Salad (++)Bocconcini SaladRoasted Garlic SoupSoup Du JourOlivesCold CutsSmoked Salmon (+)Pickled Cornichons (+)Maytag Bleu Cheese, Brie, Manchego, etc (+)Crunchy Pita BreadHummusTomato and Chickpea SaladBaba GannoushTabbouleh (+)Tzatziki (+)[ DESSERT ]Molten Chocolate Cake w/Caramel Sauce (+)Peach Cobbler (+)Chocolate MarshmallowFudgeCarrot Cake (+)Opera Cake (+)Cheesecake (+)Godiva Lolli CakesFreshly Baked Cookies: 4 TypesSweet Potato Flan w/Toasted Marshmallow & Rosemary Shortbread (+)Gingerbread Shortcake w/Eggnog Whip Cream & Milk Chocolate SauceChocolate Covered StrawberriesSmores Chocolate Pudding w/Graham Crackers & Melted Marshmallow (+)Caramel Apple Streusel Tart (+)Tiramisu Chocolate Cup (+)Chocolate Mousse BerriesSugar Free Chocolate Custard w/Raspberry Compote (+)Low Sugar Vanilla Cream w/Blueberry CompoteStrawberry Gazpacho (+)[ DESSERT: GELATO + SORBET ]Mint Chocolate CrunchSalted Peanut CaramelVanillaCoffee White Chocolate (++) PistachioCaramel Candy BarAlmond JoyOreoThai Tea (++) Nutella (++) TiramisuStraciatellaStrawberry BalsamicRaspberry SorbetMango Passion SorbetBlood Orange SorbetLemon Sorbet (+)Sugar Free Chocolate____________________________3/27/13: Tried Bacchanal - amazing selection. Will still be returning to Wicked Spoon for my fave dishes, Bone Marrow, & better gelato. Crepes at Bacchanal, tho!There are some things that are worth waiting in line for ... like Niners Super Bowl tickets, tickets to la Galleria Borghese, or an Adriana Lima kissing booth ... but Wicked Spoon Buffet is NOT one of them. The line here is depressing. Not only is it long, it moves slower than a TSA security check point. Worst of all is the mirage ending, once you think you've finally come to the end you realize that was just the line to pay. Wait ... there is a.. a ... second line?!?!?.... just kill me now.Once you finally get inside the food is disappointing at best. The only real highlight was the bone marrow. If you decide to come here make sure you upgrade to the bottomless drinks ($9 for bloody mary's mimosas which can be mixed and matched). They are the perfect way to fight back a hangover while also creating your next one ... Cheers!To be entirely honest, I'm not really seeing the hype. While the concept of a tapas style buffet sounds amazing, my excitement towards eating here didn't quite equate to a superb dining experience.My group and I arrived around 1PM and although the line didn't look super long, the wait seemed agonizingly slow. We didn't get seated until around 2:30PM. After we were shown to our table, my group dashed to the food to check out the selection. While there were many chic and modern dishes that you would find at a hip, fancy restaurant, there wasn't really that large of a selection. Compared to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, the choices seemed barren. Oh well, I told myself. Hopefully the quality of the food will make up for the lack of selection. From the meat section, I tried the bone marrow, kalbi (Korean beef short rib), five spice pork belly and ham. Now I was ecstatic to try the bone marrow and I've never tried it before. However, it just tasted really...weird? I don't know how to quite describe it, except for the fact that I'm not convinced that the flavor was what people usually went gaga over. The five spice pork belly was AMAZING though! Layers and layers of greasy, fatty, pork goodness will lead to feelings of immense satisfaction. And perhaps a little guilt afterwards. Wicked Spoon had some of your standard buffet finds such as a meat carving station, crab legs, salad bar and pizza station. The Chinese station had a pretty cool concept, with some items stuffed inside a little Chinese takeout box or a dim sum basket. There was also a mac and cheese section that I didn't get to try because I thought it was an omelette station. For that, I want to cry a little. Dessert was definitely the best part of the experience, since I ended up stacking my plate full of macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, small slices of cake and double scoops of gelato. Everything was quite tasty and sort of made up for the rest of the food. In fact, the macarons were so delicious that the Asian in me compelled me to hoard a few macarons into a Chinese takeout box. Shhh. Overall, I'd give this place more of a 3.5. This wouldn't be my first choice upon returning to Vegas for buffets since I've been to places that had both great food and dessert. But the rest of the girls in my group loved this place, so whether or not you like it is pretty much based on your own experience. As for me, I kind of wish Wicked Spoon was a little more wicked so that it could've really unleashed the glutton in me.For someone like me, a foodie with absolutely ZERO self-control, this buffet is PERFECT. High-quality, fancy-schmancy foodie-food...served for the most part in little individual containers....so you don't take too much!!!You know how it is: when faced with a vat of buttery whipped sweet potatoes and a ladle, the urge is overwhelming to pile it onto your plate a la "Close Encounters." Here, the potatoes are pre-portioned into precious little stainless steel mini-saucepans. Sure, you can still take too much...but you'll feel like a total ASS with all those saucepans clanking around on your plate!!!The deal is the same with many of the offerings here: pre-portioned, in cute little Chinese takeout boxes, pots and ramekins. Awww, Cosmo -- always thinking of your customers' waistlines! I found the spread here to be among the best in Vegas. Decent Mediterranean selection, great salads (kale with cranberries & pumpkin seeds...YUM!!), and all the rest of the usual lardass buffet staples: glistening slabs of quivering meat, mac & cheese, tacos, pizza, sushi, etc. The ambiance is upscale and chic, and like everywhere else in the Cosmo, the staff is great. And wine is available for purchase at a very chi-chi little wine vending machine. (I must get one of those vending machines for my kitchen!!!)Overall, I found this buffet to be right up there with the M Resort and Caesars Palace -- best in town!After hearing so much about the Wicked Spoon buffet, I FINALLY got to try it on my most recent trip to Las Vegas....and the verdict is: 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best buffet I have ever been to!  The most impressive thing about the Wicket Spoon buffet is the presentation.  Everything was exquisitely prepared and presented.  My mouth was salivating walking past all of the counters and looking at the many different, exotic things they had.It is not the biggest buffet, but they did offer several types of ethnic foods to choose from.  They had Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, and American selections.  Everything was tasty, and I greatly enjoyed my dining experience here.Wicked Spoon was fairly pricey, but well worth it.  No buffet can compare to a great restaurant dining experience in my opinion, but Wicked Spoon is about as close as I have had.  I look forward to coming back the next time that I visit Las Vegas.This is officially my favorite Vegas buffet!Wicked Spoon is also wicked expensive so major thanks to the sugar daddy BF for the multiple trips to this yummy buffet :)Even though we dined for both lunch and dinner, we were lucky enough to show up during non-busy times. No line to wait in, no crowd to compete against for food, and plenty of empty tables around us so the wait staff paid plenty attention to us.My biggest gripe about many buffets are the lack of creativity and taste for the dishes that don't contain animal products. As a vegan, I'm often stuck with something boring. But in my first plate alone, I was wowed by three specific items: Kale Salad, Green Papaya Salad, and Sweet Potato Pur√©e.The Kale Salad had this citrus-y sweet vinaigrette mixed with pepitas and dried cranberries. Very bright in colors and taste! I could eat a full plate of the Kale Salad and be so happy :) http://su.pr/1lzRQBThe Green Papaya Salad was perfectly al dente in texture and mixed with green beans, green onion, tomatoes, and peanuts. The dressing had a hint of sweet and a bit tart which marinaded well with all the ingredients. I even opted to add tofu to soak up some of that delicious flavor. http://su.pr/3imgLqThe Sweet Potato Pur√©e was like candy! Smooth and vanilla-y, I definitely went back for seconds on this one. http://su.pr/2qgxuvThe only less than great items were the avocado rolls and the veggie rolls offered at the sushi area. It wasn't bad, it just was the standard mediocre buffet-style sushi.I really appreciated that the dessert area contained non-dairy options. The Mango Sorbet and Raspberry Sorbet were super delicious! http://su.pr/2C6VL6During our dinner visit, many of the lunch items were still available but I was happy to see that they added more vegan friendly things including:- A garbanzo bean, tomato, and cucumber salad- An Israeli couscous salad- An artichoke and hearts of palm salad- Hummus, baba ganush, and pita chipshttp://su.pr/290JjfAll items were good but I might note that the hummus and baba ganush was a bit on the thin side. But I do wanna point out the olive bar which had these amazing tasty olives. Specifically, the bright green ones which were more sweet than tart. There was also these super large red olives that tasted like they have been smoked...almost like salami. Yum!So the price is kinda up there, especially for someone who doesn't take take advantage of all the meat and seafood offerings. But out of all the Vegas buffets that I've been too, Wicked Spoon is definitely at the top of my list!Also, beware of the mimosas. One sip and it's like "geez, would you like any orange juice with that champagne?" Still good though. You just gotta be prepared for it :)I was so excited to try this place because of all the press and photos I'd seen. Sadly, I ended up being a tad underwhelmed. I love the individual servings as opposed to big messy trays where people duel to the death for certain items or use whatever tongs they can get a hold of. However, there just wasn't enough variety to make everyone happy.Meat lovers have tons of enticing options, such as duck ravioli, bone marrow, and braised boar ragout. Seafood lovers have less to choose from. The menu was very shrimp-heavy-shrimp cocktail, shrimp ceviche, Spanish-style garlic shrimp...Maybe this is the Asian lady in me, but I was wondering the whole time, "Where are the clams? Mussels? Calamari? Fish?" There were one or two fish dishes, which were rather cookie cutter and nothing exciting. Crab legs were offered, so you might be happy if that's your thing. I never cared much for crab legs, so I was left wanting more.Vegetarians are even less well-represented, unless you count the salad bar. And vegans? Forget about it.This all-you-can-eat is pretty awesome for people who have a sweet tooth; I'll give it that. Desserts range from macarons to strawberry cream puffs to a dense chocolate cake. For me, the desserts were the highlight of my dining experience here.We came at dinnertime, supposedly when buffets put out the best of the best. And we were in Vegas, known to be a buffet heaven. Despite all that, I failed to be impressed by this newer restaurant. The Wicked Spoon, though it serves some decent (not great) meat dishes with decadent ingredients, didn't meet my definition of a great buffet.This buffet is GOOD and I still want to show them some love but after I found a SPIDER crawling in their beloved chocolate-covered strawberries (you know, the ones everyone writes about), it completely put me off and ruined my meal. Imagine taking a bite out of your strawberry, and then look down to see a spider drop down onto your plate from the strawberry you're holding. Pretty much a sure fire way to completely lose your appetite for the rest of the day.But I think I was more put off by the way the manager handled the situation. The server sends over the manager who just stands there as I explain (I wasn't that annoyed, I was just trying to make them aware because no one wants to eat a damn spider). But then he just stands there, doesn't really say anything and makes it really awkward. Like....was I supposed to make a bigger fuss so I can get something comped? I think it was his really quiet demeanor and just standing there that made me think "okay so....really, you don't know how to handle it". You could have just confidently told me you're sorry and will inform the staff about the issue. I think I was more put off by the clueless manager who didn't really know how to handle the situation. The other staff is great though.Hopefully this was just a one-time occurrence but pretty sure I won't be going back for a long time. Bleh.It's funny. I had breakfast here a few months ago. The food was fine, but I walked out thinking that the staff just seemed....well, dickish. My server brought me one water and I never saw him again. I stopped a different server to ask if perhaps my guy was on break. He said, "no," and walked away. Not, "I'll get him for you" or even the ideal answer: "How may *I* help?" But Wicked Spoon has a bunch of solid reviews, so I held off on writing mine until I could go back for a second opinion.Today was that day.I walked in with three friends and approached the cashier shortly after 2pm. Her greeting to us? "Did you hear what she told those people?" Huh? Did we hear what who told whom?Rolling her eyes to the next cashier, the bundle of hospitality sneered, "she SAID we're closed. We close at two." Well excuse the flying fock out of us. Maybe someone could post a sign to that effect at the entrance? Maybe you could get off your lazy ass and click the velvet rope thingy across the entrance to the zig-zag waiting line chute? Either of those would work since you clearly do not have the personality necessary to communicate the information verbally.I hadn't told my buddies about my first impression of the service here. But every one of us left with a lasting impression this time. The cashier could have used fewer words and, frankly, done her JOB by simply being, oh, I dunno...polite. She could have said, "I am so sorry, gentlemen. Buffet seating ends at 2pm daily so we can begin setting up for dinner service. Please come back and see us." But she'd rather be a bitch. No, not just a bitch. A bitch who was so goddamn lazy, she tried to get us out of there by relying on the other cashier's verbiage to some other guests that we never saw.Cosmopolitan? My ass.Actually, I'm sorta happy things went down this way. The bitchy clerk managed to confirm everything I walked away feeling the first time. And I didn't have to blow $25 on the buffet this time.I looked at lots of reviews for various buffets in Vegas and determined that this was what most Yelpers had talked about and indeed they were right.  This buffet was in fact one of the best that I've been to anywhere.  It's like a high end restaurant and elegant dining experience, at least again as far as buffets are concerned.  The best part is the small plates and the individual servings to that you can sample lots of different foods, not feel guilty about wasting anything, and not have that buffet feel of scooping out of a big bowl or tray of food.  Lots of choices and everything tasted great.Best buffet in my entire life. The buffet is top tier. I give this a marvelous 5 stars rating from my personal experience. No bias and no gimmicks. There are lot of places you would have to wait about an hour or so, but WIcked Spoon is far the only place I could wait all day, because it is so simply worth dining here. Modern atmosphere to blend with the Cosmo hotel's ambiance. Process: -You wait in line, pay at the cashier then get seated. Price is about $35~, add $9 for unlimited champangne/mimosa/bloody mary.  Love the champange! I made myself drunk here to get my money's worth, haha. -Serve yourself with the best Las Vegas food on the strip.-They basically have everything, from Italian to Korean to Chinese to Mexican to American food. -The salad bar is amazing. Love the shrimp shooters. -Gelato........ so bomb. 'Nuff said! A lot of options here and it's pretty much no limits. My friend is a vegetarian and there are a lot of vegetarian options! Yup, we both stayed here for 3 hours.I was very VERY VERY underwhelmed by this place. Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.The Good: Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called itKalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portionsBACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.The OK:Prime Rib au jusBlue cheeseCream corn with red n green peppersMost of the desertsThe unimpressive:Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oilyLinked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interestFried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the pastThe asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one outThe five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derri√®re!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!The epitome of blind gluttony. There is something about being in Vegas that makes it justifiable to over indulge and shamelessly stuff your face. I arrived at Wicked Spoon at 11am and by the time 11pm rolls around I was still full. So maybe I over did it a little but I felt obligated to eat my money's worth since I already paid $42 and I also had practically starved myself for the previous 3 days in preparation.There was barely any wait when we arrived at 11am but by the time we left at almost 1pm, the line was quite significant. The service was good and they were fairly attentive. There were a lot of people working so you can easily find something to ask for things from. They also have optional bottomless champagne/mimosa for just $10 but we were sufficiently libated the night before and opted out of it.This is going to sound a little crazy but I was disappointed in the lack of selections. So they did have 5 stations of food but each station only contained 5-6 selections. I did enjoy the small plates they presented everything on because it's pretty but it's not all that practical. If it was in one large pile, I would have taken 1 piece of fried chicken and not the 3 that the basket contains. The same goes for the pasta dishes that came in a miniature pot. I ended up wasting a lot of food.The taste was just okay for most items. I really wasn't impressed in the dishes that the reviews and my friends hyped up like angry mac n cheese, fried chicken, and bone marrow. The salad bar was also salads in individual cups. I enjoyed the wedge salad but the caesar salad was quite disgusting.The best part has to be the dessert section. There is a large variety of desserts to pick from and a full gelato selection. I really enjoyed the dulce de leche cheesecake and the chocolate raspberry tart. The gelato was also amazing. I had the salted caramel and it was creamy and delicious with the right amount of saltiness. My friends had the Thai tea and that was great too. I'm a little sad they didn't have a hazelnut flavor.You can ask for coffee, juice, or gelato in a to go cup to walk out with. I asked for an orange juice with ice and the girl was extremely nice in saying that it's of course something that they do. Love the awesome service.I kept hearing great things about this place so I caved in and tried it. I actually enjoyed it and was quite impressed with the presentation, quality and variety of foods. The deserts and Asian food selection are probably the highlight of this place~! Some reviewers complained about the small portions due to the presentation of the food (i.e. coming in small plates and a basket for the chicken) but  I think it's fine because it let's you really try everything.I experienced the brunch menu only and haven't had a chance to try their dinner menu. My favorite entrees were the Pork Belly (very surprised to see that there but it was fantastic), Fried Chicken (very moist inside and crunchy skin), and sushi which was pretty fresh and tasty. In terms of desert, I was most impressed with the gelato bar which had a great variety of flavors.The environment is very modern and clean, and we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes when we got in around 2pm for lunch. The service was also fantastic and the bathrooms were spacious and clean.Overall, i would highly recommend this place even though it may be on the steeper side of prices. My only complaint would be that you pay for tip on the front end...which I've never seen before. What happens if you have crappy service?Price for Brunch on the weekends: $33Price for Dinner on the weekends:$41You know that annoyingly pretentious guy or girl who goes to Vegas and is all "I don't do buffets; that's for amateurs"?  He or she hasn't been to Wicked Spoon.  And don't tell him or her.  Let's try to keep this a secret for as long as possible ;)  Husband and I came here RIGHT when it opened for dinner on a Friday night and there was NO LINE.  We hear it gets pretty packed later on in the evening though so if you hate the waiting game, go early bird style like we did!  The location was a little hard to find... it's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but we had to wander around the shopping area for a bit before we spotted a sign that pointed us in the right direction.  It's a bit of a schlep from the main shopping area through the hotel to the buffet (a warning to ladies heading out in those sky-high stilettos!).The space itself is visually stunning and really does not look like the other buffets in LV.  Wicked Spoon has worked really really hard to distinguish itself from the other Vegas buffets and refers to itself as a "bustling culinary food hall."  Honestly, it can call itself whatever it wants.  It's awesome.  The quality of the food was excellent and about 70% is offered in individual tapas-size portions, which helps if you're the kind of person who typically overdoes it with the heaping spoonfuls of food at buffets.  For the Vegas buffet lovers (i.e., for that person in your party who really had their heart set on going to a traditional buffet), there's still the standard Vegas all-you-can-eat staples like crab legs and prime rib at Wicked Spoon.  Bone marrow?  At a buffet???  Yes, you read that right.  This is typically a $20-30 appetizer plate at some of the nicer restaurants I've been to, so after having a few bones to myself I knew I'd gotten my money's worth.  The salad and cold items section had some of the freshest offerings I've ever seen.  Octopus salad!  Shrimp ceviche!  Nom nom nom!Service was excellent.  Our servers were very attentive, and they refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly.  The dessert selection was impressive.  There were even some sugar-free options (that did NOT taste like your usual sugarless desserts!) and so many gelato flavors to choose from!  Too bad we were too full from sampling everything else at the buffet to really try much of the dessert.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  There's plenty of kid-friendly options to pick from too, so parents don't have to worry about it being too sophisticated for a young palate.  Can't wait to go back!When in Las Vegas, Vegas-sized buffets are never my food stop of first choice.  However, it was late-morning, the fianc√©e was hungry for breakfast and I was hungry for lunch.  Conveniently, the Wicked Spoon Buffet was serving up brunch.  The Wicked Spoon is tucked far away from the bustle of the casino floor in the Cosmo's West End Tower.  After doing a walkthrough past its assorted food stations, I came away impressed with the wide selection of freshly made breakfast items, lunch items, fresh salads, and delicious looking desserts.  Italian, Asian, and Mexican cuisines, as well as American comfort food staples, were represented at its buffet stations.  Perhaps, its most distinctive feature, though, is the Wicked Spoon's gelato bar.  While it may not have 31 flavors like Baskin Robbins, it's comprehensive with flavors ranging from plain vanilla and chocolate to salted caramel and tiramisu.  The Wicked Spoon may not compare with the 800 lb. gorilla that is Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it does the buffet thing quite well and is certainly in the discussion as Las Vegas' second best buffet.$54 for brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's! All 10 girls were GAME ON! We arrived on Saturday pretty late into brunch (it IS a bachelorette party, who gets up that early!!) but there was still a good amount of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks which arrived at the table strikingly fast. I was overwhelmed by the variety of food and how beautiful each dish was presented! I loved how each dish was portioned for one person to try. I tried the salads, muscles, chicken wings, cheese and bread, mac and cheese, while mushroom spaghetti, and a few other dishes. Every dish was delicious. There was not a dish that I tried that I did not like. The flavors were rich, so super rich.Our waiter was very nice and got all our drinks on our table in a timely manner. Those girls kept ordering the mimosas and the drinks kept on coming! The buffet area was super clean and everything was presented so neatly and pretty. Every dish sparkled. Not really but to me everything in Cosmo sparkles :)I wasn't feeling well the day I came here because I was running off a total of four hours of sleep in two days and I had nothing but Crown and greasy junk food in my system. After my second small plate at Wicked Spoon and only my third glass of mimosas, I threw down my napkin. I was really; really SAD I didn't get to try EVERYTHING. That's what happens when you play too hard, you miss out on GOOD food!! :(Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: Wicked Spoon - THE buffet of buffets.Let me first begin by stating: I am NOT a fan of the buffet.Well, I'm a fan of the IDEA of a buffet- endless food, endless desserts...mmmmmm.The problem? Well, take your average buffet - the food is plentiful, but the taste, quality, and presentation echo that of a prison scene from a movie, or from the hallowed past of your elementary school cafeteria days.Wicked Spoon takes those images, chews them up, and spits them out into something modern, very tasty, and quite enjoyable to look at. (How did I equate spitting with enjoyable??)If you've ever sat on the couch watching Food Network's Iron Chef, Chopped, or any other show on their lineup that uses verbiage like, "bla bla bla compote" "with a reduction sauce" "pared with a something or other" and your mouth just waters...wondering in your limited restaurant experience what any of those foreign terms taste like- then GO TO WICKED SPOON!!! They've got all kinds of bla bla bla compote reduced with a something or other sauce pared nicely with a snippet of something that is PRESENTED to you as if YOU were one of those celebrity judges on Iron Chef!!!I felt like a SUPERSTAH as I repeated MANY trips to the salad, desserts, main courses, and even to the MACARONI area where like many buffets with an omelet area, you can choose to have the chef add whatever ingredients in that you'd like (several cheese selections, crispy bacon, veggies, onions, sausage...so many choices) and then he cooks it all together right there. Macaroni with Cheddar, Parmesan, and bacon was my personal favorite.Their cheesecake was practically divine. The only thing to remember is that the portions are super tiny. Very elegant. Very fancy. That's a good thing though. If you get something you don't like (which is virtually impossible at Wicked Spoon), you can mix it around with your fork and it looks like you've eaten most of it. That way you don't have to feel like a wasteful pig when the server comes to clear your dirty dishes.I did think it was very expensive. It cost a little over $200 for me, my wife, and our 5 children (1 was under 3, so he was free). However, we have paid close to that in Vegas for other buffets and not been happy at all with the quality.On a side note- I finally got to try bone marrow! Completely nasty. I'll never eat it again. BUT, at least I got to try it!!! :-)I've been to Wicked Spoon a couple of times, and while the first visit was spectacular, my most recent visit left me unsatisfied.  Every Vegas trip, we choose one brunch buffet to visit on our last day.  Our last two trips, we chose the Wynn buffet, but since we were gambling at the Cosmopolitan, we decided to stay local.$25/person for a brunch on a Friday is totally sensible, especially for one of the more highly rated buffets.  The 15 minute wait was also very reasonable for a Friday at around 11:00AM.Wicked Spoon has a wide variety of foods separated by stations: breakfast (omelettes, biscuits and gravy, french toast, etc), meats (italian sausage, prime rib, bone marrow), spanish inspired, asian inspired, light appetizers, and desserts.  The variety plus the creativity offered in a lot of the dishes are much to be admired, however this visit, I felt like Wicked Spoon delivered more simplistic and stale foods.  The chocolate covered strawberries though, omg.  So delicious.  In my opinion, the desserts alone are worth the price of the buffet.I'll probably skip Wicked Spoon on my next Vegas trip, but will return soon after for a follow up.  Hopefully I just came on an "off day".I'm pretty sure that the Cosmopolitan realizes that it is losing too much money and thus has cut its budget on the already loss-leader known as the Wicked Spoon.From the previous reviews, it seems that the Wicked Spoon has come a long way from being a 5 star experience to a 2-3 star experience (for its price).The first problem encountered was at the entrance when we saw that a gold brick had fallen off and thus left a giant white hole on the wall where it was supposed to be. This means that they have reduced the amount of maintenance workers for the restaurant. This also should not happen in a five star resort partnered with the Ritz.The second problem was that there was almost no variety when we came this time. The worst part of it all was that the sushi was "FOR DISPLAY ONLY". REALLY? The third problem was that they started to clean up at around 7:45 PM (they close at 9 PM), meaning no more fresh food after that, save for a couple of dishes. NO MORE DESSERT TOO. Basically that means I was unable to eat any of the supposed good stuff.By the way, they I believe they save those desserts for the next morning. I'm serious, I saw them neatly stacking them on a tray obviously not intending to dispose of them.Some of the food was pretty good though, but this isn't close to being a value for its price. The gnocchi with a sweet corn emulsion was really good. I do believe that they purposely try to use sub-par ingredients.I happened to ask our waitress for her opinion and even she said that it isn't worth it for dinner, although breakfast seems to be a better value. She also happened to hint that chefs here are constantly replaced.Service is impeccable however. Our waitress was literally superwoman. The path for the waiters and waitresses to walk through was poorly designed. They are forced to walk through a maze.This place really is total hype. From a pure business standpoint, I would've cut the budget on this buffet too. $4 billion is a ton of money to repay to Deustche bank. Analysts have calculated that this hotel will not reach profitability in this decade. That means more cuts are expected.Living on lost reputation is okay, but you can definitely see that some people realize what has happened. There weren't as many low ratings (i'm not sure if they even had any!) in the first two years they opened but lately the low ratings have been increasing.The parking here sucks too!!!!!!111!!11!!1!1iPad review*Dear ladles and gentlespoons,My last biz trip to Vegas was my first trip to Wicked Spoon.  It was a treat that lived up to its hype -- a beautifully appointed setting, with a wide array of culinary offerings that were presented artfully and executed deliciously.The scoop on this year's return to the Spoon however deserves some dishing of the wicked (or at least not the most flattering) kind. To echo a few other reviewers: what happened, Spoon? You've raised your prices but have had a very noticeable drop in food quality and quantity from last year. A few service stations were completely closed. Much of what was left was hardly in the higher-range quality that was the resto's hallmark of the last visit. And, of the few higher-end items that remained, most seemed to fall a notch in quality, like with the skinny crab legs or overlooked shrimp. (I know ... not exactly third-world problems)Beyond this ... this trip's buffet offerings vs. last year's seemed to show a mere shadow of, what could best be described as, a loving attention to detail in presentation.  When my server came at meal's end to ask how my dinner was, I was earnest and said that the food offerings seemed better last year. They said they hear that a lot. Maybe lunch or brunch is a better value?Last year the rating danced between five and four stars; now it's between two and three. It's still a beautiful setting for a buffet, and the service is friendly and earnest, so rounding up to three stars. But I won't be making a third visit unless this Spoon gets a handle on its current tarnish. For over $50 before tip, don't we deserve a little more polish in our cosmopolitan buffeting?*  i.e., two-finger reviewing is better than none.Wicked spoon, yes. It's a pretty cool fusion-y buffet with a HUGE selection. Hmmm what can I say..It's honestly not mediocre. They have some FANCY stuff like shrimp ceviche, crab, etc. But if you're tryna OD on some fresh oyster, shrimp, SEAFOOD...not really the place. All the food doesn't seem like it's worth $50. I probably ate until I almost passed out, but I filled myself with maybe $20 worth of food. They got macarons though! My friends and I TOGO-ed hella haha...to use up the $30 I wasn't able to accomplish with all the chinese food and italian food, which isn't really worth that much money. I think the buffet at Caesar's palace is way better.They change up their menus and sometimes they don't have certain stuff so BE SURE TO CHECK.The second time I went, I REALLY didn't get my moneys worth. They kept running out of EVERYTHING. They had NO MACARONS, so goodbye $30! They seriously had nothing but King Crab legs, which became tiring after a while to crack open...I just don't think WICKED SPOON is worth the money. Its super fancy schmancy and pretty. High quality? yes. But they don't have the BIG stuff like OYSTERS, SHRIMP..etc. They had salmon, but it was danky and AITE... Dessert selection is AMAZINGGGGGG and super well presented in their decor, but taste wise it was aye-okayy. Good for the whole experience since it is in cosmopolitan hotel and it's super nice. Saw Matt Barnes DOEEE which was pretty cool ;DHands down the best buffet on the strip. We have eaten her so many times that it's become a tradition to visit every time we are in town. The ambiance is great with contemporary decor. The waiters and waitresses give top notch customer service. Great food selection no matter what you're in the mood for. They also get bonus points in my book for presentation. I love how they portion their food into little mini skillets and fry baskets, perfect so you don't overcommit to a single dish. They are reasonably priced for the vast selection of foods and desserts compared to other buffets in Vegas. And the icing on the cake, you can add $10 on top of the cost for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Here is a breakdown of the cost and hours: Daily Brunch: Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. ($26.00)Weekend Brunch: Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. ($34.00)Daily Dinner: Monday - Thursday, 5 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($38.00)Weekend Dinner: Friday, 5 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Saturday, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($41.00)They have a very good selection of goodies. I appreciate that most of their items are portioned out so not of lots of people going through the food like at other buffets - where serving spoons fall into the food in the trays yuck!It's one wicked buffet indeed! Hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic Cosmopolitan Hotel. I've frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. My last visit was over Thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up Bacchanal Buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the Caesars Palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2PM. Sorry, I'm not THAT crazy to stay in line that long. Wicked Spoon here we come! Ohhhh yeah!!45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! We paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in Bacchanal for their Thanksgiving rate. You have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. So among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why I love Wicked Spoon. FOR STARTERS, I WENT CRAZY OVER THESE:-Pumpkin Soup---Not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it's hearty and addicting! -King Crab Legs---Fresh and sweet! -Shrimp Cocktail---Succulent! FROM THE CARVING STATION:-Bone Marrow---I ate this like there was no tomorrow. I probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. "A moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!" -Roast Beef---Yummm...-Lamb---Cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...Need I say more!?-Turkey---Not a turkey fan but it was Thanksgiving so I had to eat some. It was great! SEAFOOD ENTREES:-Shrimps---Cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. I got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. Delicious!-Mussels Mariniere---I had 3 bowls of these. The sauce was fantastic! I was literally slurping it down. ASIAN CORNER:-Roasted Pork Belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful! The crispy skin was a nice added touch. CARBO LOADING:-Paella-Mushroom Risotto-Mac N Cheese---Dude!! They have a MADE-TO-ORDER STATION for this! It's amazing! You get to pick what you want in your Mac N Cheese. Sooooo goooood!DESSERT:-Chocolate Covered Strawberries---This is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. A must!-Gelato---A myriad of flavors to choose from...you'll go crazy! Thai Iced Tea and Nutella were my top two favorites! -Macarons---Last but not the least, these are not to be missed. They had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! Sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones I've had. All's well though because I may have had as much as my heart's content before the 2nd batch came out.   SERVING:Most of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. It's nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. I like their concept: unique and practical! SERVICE:-From the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. Our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. Top-notch service! For now, I think Wicked Spoon is the best buffet in Vegas. Quality food and service. Then again, I have yet to try what Bacchanal has to offer. Until then...After hearing all this hype on how amazing Wicked Spoon was, I was eager to try it out. And after trying it for myself, i think the consensus (not only mine, but the entire group I had gone with) was that wicked spoon was just A-OK. A buffet is a buffet and I maybe a had a one item that really stuck out. Everything else was pretty medicore and typical of a vegas buffet. Now the decor of the place is nice. You do absolutely get that fancy feel, like I am in a fancy place. Service is pretty good also (but is service really an area of focus when you're on at a buffet??).Price can get pretty heft during the holidays ($42.60 for LUNCH on holidays. not worth it) and for dinner (which is close to like $50 I think). ADVICE #1: IT IS NOT WORTH THE DINNER PRICE! (I capslocked so that it could catch your eye). Go for lunch/brunch for $27 bucks! They have breakfast items AND lunch items. They also have different stations, like a salad station, the breakfast station, the meats station, the asian section. ADVICE #2: If you want to save space in your stomach, skip the asian section. It's whatevers. My favorite item has got to be the short rib cavatelli. Holy crap it was good! The meats were also pretty delicious. Another plus, they have a gelato station in the desserts station which is pretty cool.Not worth it at all!Unless you have a half-off coupon, Wicked Spoon was barely par with the $20 buffets at the cheap hotels. Sure they have some fancy "looking" items, but they all fell flat. And at the premium price point, you'd expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQAIt was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I've been to.Let me just preface my review by saying that I don't like buffets. I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach. That being said, I was won over by Wicked Spoon. It featured food in new and creative ways while preserving quality over quantity. Needless to say, it wasn't the most remarkable dining experience you will ever have, however it will make you think "did I really just go to a buffet?"Set in the recesses of the Cosmopolitan resort, getting there can be a challenge in itself. Whoever designed Las Vegas resorts to get you to set destinations clearly set a slot machine or a poker table in your way. Be prepared with some comfortable shoes, because no matter where you park your car or if you valet, the trek is clearly enough to burn off your first plate of food (I'm exaggerating here for the record). Yet if that isn't enough to deter you, the line to pay followed up by the line to be seated might be. Don't give up. When you finally are seated, you are greeted by a diorama of epicurean treats that are hard to be rivaled. From the lighter fare to the more delectable treats, our brunch buffet was among the best I ever had. The smaller plates encourage variety and expanding your taste palate with bites uncommon to the normal buffet. Forget the mass produced scrambled eggs, the cold pancakes and such. Bring on the mushroom risotto with truffle oil, thick cut slow roasted bacon, or perhaps the desire for the gelato bar might arise. The smoked salmon mousse in a cone could be passed up, the watermelon with feta and balsamic reduction right next door shouldn't be passed up. While simple, the crisp flavor of the watermelon is complemented with the salty feta and the sweet tart of the vinegar. While it might be over in a bite, I guarantee you will be back for a couple more of them. The bacon was heaven. Not too fatty or oily, but still offering the silky saltiness to go with your made to order omelet. Be sure to save room for dessert because the gelato was extremely well done along with the other small morsels set away enough to avoid the drool that will escape your mouth. Service was good. Who would have thought I would be talking about service at a buffet!? Yet here I am including the fact that the staff quickly cleared plates, were incredibly pleasant, and never let the water glasses go full. Service usually is tolerable at a normal buffet, Wicked Spoon clearly takes it up a notch.While the buffet has become an integral part of Las Vegas cuisine, don't skimp on the $9.99 buffet that might dote the landscape. Let the wallet be a little loose and skip the slots for an hour and check out the Wicked Spoon. It is definitely worth the experience.What a cool place- and man do I wish I had taken a Grandma sized purse (with extra ziplocs) and a bigger appetite as neither the husband nor I had seen a buffet quite like this before. I have been out of the swing of life for a bit so I haven't done any entertaining for much longer than I would like to admit but this place got all of my little foodie serving gadgets and gizmos ideas working. I loved the concept of this place-and though there were plenty of things served "buffet style", most offerings came in individual serving sized containers or portions. Mini fryer baskets with fried chicken, mini take out Chinese containers with noodles or fried rice, cast iron skillets with mac and cheese, a risotto offering in a small cassoulet dish and the list goes on. The dessert area was one like I have never seen including a full gelato station with several flavors offered. The husband imbibed in the dessert offerings quite a bit but sadly, I was too full. Since we were in Vegas celebrating our 5th Anniversary, it didn't dawn on me that we would be in town for Chinese New Year AND the Super Bowl. Due to this, there were a lot of very pretty but not for me types of offerings either ingredient or textural wise. There were some hits and some definite misses on some of the "regular" items but this is the genius thing about a buffet though-lots of offerings for all different taste buds.I will try this place again in a heartbeat and hopefully will get to feel a bit more Wicked!3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris. However, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA - Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ - No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. You would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. The saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg  At least I can say I've dined here.

Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest "bangs for the buck" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  Unable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of "China Buffets" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.I finally tried the brunch here and it was delicious. The dinner was so so. At our last stay at the Cosmo, my gf really wanted to go to Wicked Spoon but we had to check out, so on our last day, we went to the Wicked Spoon for brunch.I was previously disappointed by the dinner here so I was hesitant to try out the brunch. So the selection here isn't as large as Bacchanal but it was great overall. Everything I tried was delicious minus the indian cuisines. Way too much spices for me. Some of the notable dishes for brunch included bone marrow, the Asian porridge, dubuki, and duck eggs benedict. Overall, the dishes were all pretty decent. The dessert here was really good as well, I liked the thai tea gelato, chocolate oreo strawberry and coffee cake. So why the 3 star review? It is an average between brunch and dinner, the brunch was 4 stars but the dinner was 2 stars for me.Overall, come here for brunch but go to bachannal for dinner.I wanted to love this place but we had a horrible experience last night. At first, I was impressed with the selection of food and the presentation. I took several pictures excited to share them with my social networks...But then things got ugly!We were a ladies group of 10 instead of 13, we thought they were kind enough to reserve the table of 13 for us because we were celebrating a bride-to-be, but really it wasn't out of kindness, it was a CONTRACT. This was thrown in our face several times by the server and the manager at the end of our meal demanding payment for the 3 extra heads. We tried to explain what happened with the extra people but they weren't hearing it, why? Because we signed a CONTRACT!Regardless of what we signed, we are not professional event planners and the CONTRACT wasn't explained to us properly to begin with. As we tried to straighten this out and explain things and ask for some understanding and flexibility, the manager became increasingly irritated and threatened to charge us several hundred dollars for being at the table for more than 2 hours..why? Because we signed a CONTRACT! And CONTRACT groups only get 2 hours at a table. So I asked him, "If we just waited in line, instead of reserved this table, would we be charged for 10 heads instead of 13 heads and be able to sit here as long as we wanted?" He said yes, but YOU have a CONTRACT!" So our beautiful bride-to-be who flew all the way from Italy for this special week said "Wow, you kind of have a bad attitude" then he got all worked up and threatened us and called security. And we were "escorted out". Even the security guards, while still doing their job, thought this was silly. Seriously, a bunch of 30-40 year old professional women including television producers, military women who serve this country, and hard working mothers, are THAT threatening. It was ridiculous, embarrassing, and unnecessary...But apparently, we signed a CONTRACT! I have dined at many many many fine restaurants in Las Vegas, with many groups of women, where I gladly paid $75, $100, even $150 for a nice dinner. The bride CHOSE to try the Wicked Spoon buffet so we went there instead of a normal restaurant, and she ends up getting booted?!?!?!?I have never ever dealt with such an unprofessional and inflexible establishment. The whole fiasco was utterly ridiculous.Summary: Attended Wick Spoon for a wedding so really I don't know how much it is per head and I don't intend to find out. The setting was dark which I don't understand why, do they not want us to see what we're eating? But after sampling majority of their food I assume the darkness is so other guest doesn't see me split out the food.Food: Their weekend dinner selection was below average. Nothing stand out or mind blowing. The only thing I can actually compliment on was their salmon which wasn't bland and their shrimp cocktail. The sauce was different. It was sweet and sour at the same time and the taste wasn't too strong on the palate. I would avoid the desert section, flavorless and full of sugar. Service: The staff was very friendly though. I don't know was it because we book a private room so we have personal server but they were very attentive and always on time to refill our beer and wine. The staff was very professional throughout our stay which I understand can be tough at times especially you know, asian and their endless alcohols. Overall: Of all the buffet I experience in Vegas, I think I'll stick with Bellagio for the time being until someone recommend we try a new place. But definitely Wick Spoon is off the table permanently.This buffet definitely deserves the accolades it's been getting over the years.In all my visits here the past few years, I've noticed that the quality has been maintained, which is good.  What's good about this place is that they offer a terrific variety of dishes and don't just rely on the old standards like crab legs and prime rib to keep customers happy.Some notable dishes - the tuna poke appetizer was great and the meat section (prime rib, sausages, pork etc.) was impressive.  I wasn't as thrilled about the Asian section as the food there didn't taste as good as the other selections.I am a huge fan of the dessert section here and would argue that it was the best among all the buffets I visited on this particular trip (compared to the Caesars and Wynn buffets).  The Thai iced tea ice cream was pretty awesome, and the white chocolate mousse was excellent as well.  I ended up enjoying dessert more than any part of my meal which is unusual for me in a buffet.If you only have time to hit up one buffet, this isn't a bad choice.  The ambiance here is also more like a restaurant than a buffet, which is nice.Our server pissed me off.  I ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  It came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a Moscow mule. We asked to have it changed on the bill, since I ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  Rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim I've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! As for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  The mashed potatoes were good, I'll give 'em that. A couple of the pastas were serviceable.  Everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  And a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  Not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  Hmmmm.  Overall, pretty disappointing.  You think you're paying more for unique menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish.Let's just sum it up pretty quick all you can eat.Pork Belly Bone Marrow, and all the great flavor selections of gelato. I'm happy with that ,but they do have other great gourmet food selections.For 20 something dollars, I could understand some of the 4/5-star reviews detailing brunch. But for $50 at dinner, it fell short.  I'm certain I didn't eat $50 worth of food, my fault for not eating everything!!!  If I tried a bite of everything they had, I would totally pass out from a food coma without really savoring and enjoying (that's why I'm a bad candidate for buffets).  Plus, we had seafood on our brains, wanting everything under sea, especially a variety of crab.  Failed!  All they had were snow crabs. I suppose AYCE lobster is out of the question for $50.  Stop being so unrealistic, Gigi!!!I did like the shrimp cocktail shot glasses!  Very convenient, tasty and cool spin to a just pile of shrimp as I've seen at other buffets.  Bone marrow was another yummy treat, haven't seen that anywhere else.  I love bone marrow (and clogging my arteries)!! Gelato station was a nice touch.  No white chocolate covered strawberries, only dark chocolate!  Booo!!!  Prime rib was just ok.  Nothing else really caught my attention.  A few other complaints from my table were, not a wide variety and items like bread/pastry were stale and even hard.Our server was friendly and attentive, I appreciated that.  Didn't appreciate the attitude from a worker at one of the stations. Too long to detail the incident, but I wasn't being out of line.Will definitely opt for Bacchanal instead next time.If all buffets were like Wicked Spoon, I might become a buffet guy.  The thing about me is that I don't like to gorge.  Eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money's worth doesn't appeal to me.  I prefer to taste, not gorge.  I like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.And if you're a taster like me, Wicked Spoon is heaven.Wicked Spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  This made me a very happy boy.Aside from this unique quirk, Wicked Spoon is a fairly conventional Las Vegas buffet.  On the other hand, it's quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  There's typically a line to enter, but I managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  (Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  But expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.)The foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  The strengths lie in the desserts, I think.  I loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  Every single cake and tart was perfect.The savory foods were a little more mixed.  The vaguely "Asian" foods like the General Tso's chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (Also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  Same with the Mexican foods.On the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  The various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.I could spend hours detailing every dish I tasted, but that would be pointless, since Wicked Spoon's selection of foods changes on the reg.  You'll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!  Just be sure to bring your appetite.I've eaten at most of the better buffets in Las Vegas over the years (Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Rio, Caesars, Mirage, Wynn, Paris and others) and I would rate the Wicked Spoon very highly. The main difference between the Wicked Spoon and other high-end buffets is the way they present the food. For the most part, each entree is prepared tapas style and served on a small plate or pan. You won't find the mountains of food on display like other buffets. Personally I liked this method and found that each entree was better prepared than at most other buffets where the entree is typically served in a large pan and you scoop up as much as you want.The downside of this method is that the large plate that they give you is not an even multiple of the smaller plate which means that it's fairly awkward to put a few small plates on the larger plate. Also, at some of the stations the small plates sit on a warming plate and they can get a bit hot to pick up.I thoroughly enjoyed the first dinner that I ate here, especially at the bargain price of $40. The entrees were very well prepared and I was very impressed with the quality and variety. A very nice selection of up-scale dishes were available. The salads and desserts were plentiful and beautiful as well. What you won't find is ordinary dishes which was fine with me but might be a problem if you bring your kids and they're looking for fried chicken or other basic dishes.I liked the place to much that I returned the next day for brunch for $23 and many of the dinner items were also available but several breakfast items were added. The brunch entrees were not prepared as well as the dinner items were, IMHO. I almost passed on the pancakes and french toast after a couple of disappointing entrees but found them to be some of the best I've ever had.Overall they seem to prepare dishes with rich and robust flavors which I really like. They are certainly not the largest buffet in Vegas but one of the best if you're more into quality than quantity. Worth a visit if you're looking for something different. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!So this is one of the better buffets in Vegas (Wynn's Jazz Brunch, Jasmine's Fountain Brunch).  But at the end of the day its a buffet and we all know that buffets involved inferior product.  Plus the food sits under heated lamps or on top of heating mechanisms.  So really how good can it be?Anyway this one was okay.  The decor is great and the space is very open and inviting.  There is ample room to move and it's not overly crowded.The dishes I enjoyed were the bone marrow, thick cut bacon, prime rib, and roast pork.  These dishes were pretty good.  If you want a solid buffet, then Wicked Spoon will do you right.  There are tons of choices.Wicked buffet selections!I was all over the seafood and meat delights!  Per say, the loads of shrimps and endless slices of prime rib!  Then, came the crab legs, but that took a bit of effort on digging.  Then, off to the lamb meat and other savory treats!To quench the thirst, I drank some homely bone marrow soup.  Do drink cups of lemon tea to quicken the metabolism and to make room for more munching!Service and decor went hand to hand!Bottoms up and eat up!This is one of my favorite buffets. My friends and I came at 5pm on a Saturday for dinner and we waited only 10-15 minutes in line. When we left around 7:30 the wait was still the same. We paid $41 plus tax per person. I love the seafood area and ate plates and plates of crab legs. These crab legs are better than the ones at Bacchanal which are known to be super salty. I would also recommend the custom-made seafood stew. You choose your seafood (salmon, scallops, shrimp etc) and they cooked it cajun style in front of you. One downside is that I wish they had oysters, oysters would've made this buffet alittle better. Their meat area is also good, they have juicy sausages and amazing medium rare steaks. I love that they have a sauce section for your meat, you can choose from sauces such as creamy horseradish to chimichurri.The dessert section was okay. I recommend that you try their gelatos, those were the best. I wish they had creme brulee or a custom crepe station like they do at the Wynn Buffet but alas, this buffet is cheaper than Bacchanal and Wynn and I was still super satisfied. This buffet was the highlight of my most recent trip to Vegas.This place is so wicked!! There are so many buffet places competing against one another, but this place wins for their originality! We had brunch for my cousins Bachelorette Party. There was a bit of a wait because since we partied the night before, we couldn't get up early enough to beat the lines. But it wasn't so bad.As we got seated in an oversized booth, the waitress walked up to our table right away and took our drink orders. I ordered a cold water and a pineapple juice, which was super delicious I might add! The we walked up to get food. This was my first time here and I was amazed how everything was set up. There were things on these cute little dishes and there were other things you put on a plate. I guess this way the restaurant can control people's portions so they end up not wasting any food. They had a variety of different types of food and stations which consist of a meat station, fried foods, comfort food, seafood, italian, pasta, asian, mexican, salads, and desserts. The quality of the food makes you feel you're getting value with your money. $38.00 a person for all you can eat high end food is pretty cheap! I was told that this place had bone marrow at the meat station. When we arrived they didn't have anymore. I thought the Mac and Cheese was incredible. The pork ribs and the short ribs had a lot of flavor. The desserts I chose was light and decadent. This place is great and I hope this place doesn't ever sabotage their reputation by taking short cuts. Buffet places in Vegas do that after 2 or 3 years being in business.It probably wasn't the best idea to come here a couple hours after leaving a day club and still pretty tipsy.  But it's Vegas.Someone suggested to go eat at a buffet and Wicked Spoon was an obvious choice for us since we were staying at Cosmo.  There was no line-up waiting to go in around 7pm on a Saturday which is always nice for a group of 5 people to eat anywhere at this time and day of the week.I started and finished with dessert, because hey I'm adult and can do what I want.  I was super happy to see all the delicious flavours of gelato they had in mini waffle bowls!  My obvious choice was thai tea flavoured and I feel in love.  It brought me straight back to my memories in Thailand last year where I always had a thai iced tea in my hand.  In between dessert, my husband told me I had to eat all the snow crab legs I could.  The seafood man was constantly filling up the snow crab leg container because people were going nuts for it.  I liked it - it was nice and sweet.The variety they have at this buffet is amazing.  All sorts of good stuff, including food that I don't eat too often like the southern food.  The little pot(s) I had of shrimp and grits were pretty god damn delicious.  I've never had it before, but that's probably what I'd request for in my last meal if it ever came to that.  Excited to come back in a more sober state and update this review.IMO, Wicked Spoon (Cosmo) and Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace) buffet are the best on the strip.  There's a hefty price tag attached per person ($41 pre tax/tip for dinner at Wicked Spoon), but if you wanna treat yourself and go to one buffet while you're in Vegas choose one of these.  Both are pretty excellent.$26 a person for unlimited brunch. Add $10 for bottomless mimosas/Bloody Marys. Done.It would take way too long to go into detail, but overall Wicked Spoon is one of the best buffets I have ever been to... and I normally don't even like buffets. Why? Because buffets usually mean quantity over quality. BUT at Wicked Spoon... mmm quality quality qua-li-tyyy!!!! While most buffets offer trays of food and serving spoons, a lot of the food at Wicked Spoon is pre-dished and portioned. I appreciate that.A few notable mentions are definitely the BONE MARROW (DUH, I must have had like 10 of these), the Asian section overall was just insanely good... nigiri quality on point!, and the gelato. MMM, the gelato.I usually don't leave buffets feeling great, but I actually felt satisfied without feeling overly stuffed when I left Wicked Spoon. Worth every penny.My sister suggested we try the very elite Wicked Spoon Buffet for dinner at the Cosmo in Vegas. I didn't really know what I was in for when I walked in - but it was immense! Even upon the waiting/payment area, this place just oozed with class. Classy buffet - kind of an oxy moron, I know.But it's so true. Wicked Spoon is seriously the king of all buffets on planet earth. I mean, theremight be a better one on Mars or something - but this one definitely wins the title for this planet.We were well aware that the food here is of top tier, and the selection mighty - so we wanted to arrive as hungry as possible. We ate nothing all day and came around 6 o'clock ready to devour. There is no way we weren't going to get our $44 worth. That is the most you will ever pay for a buffet, but at least it's actually worth every penny.After paying, we were guided to our booth by a pleasant hostess. We were glad we didn't have to wait in line to be seated (sometimes they do have a line, occasionally the length of a theme park ride line.) On the walk to the booth we passed SO MANY different types of mouth watering food. I had to take mental notes on what foods to get back to as soon as we got our drink orders out of the way.I first hit up the sushi bar. The sushi was of top quality! Nothing like your typical buffet "sushi." I even had to take a bite before I got back to my table. Then I hit up the American food selection and went for savory kalbassi sausage, delectable mashed potatoes and creamy mac n' cheese pasta.The salad bar was a whole buffet in itself, featuring an assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables, soup shooters, even a yummy caviar caprisse salad.These are really just a few personal highlights. The above doesn't even cover a tenth of the enormous A+ food selection they offer.Dare I even dive into the desert section? Talk about feeling like a kid in a candy shop! More like a fat ass in a gelato shop.Yes, they literally have an entire gelato selection and a chef there to serve you as many scoops as you desire. I went for the mango sorbet and split it with the blood orange gelato.I had no room left in my stomach to try the gold speckled sweet treats, the "brookie" (brownie cookie) or all the other savory looking pastries tempting me nearby. We spent 3 hours there and were sad to leave once we could physically no longer take another bite. It was our only meal of the day and definitely sufficed. I highly recommend trying this buffet next time you're in Vegas. It's not dinner. It's an experience.I don't know where I got the idea to eat at a buffet before I wore a fitted dress to a club. Well, good thing that dress is stretchy, and it still fit... fit right over a bump that looks like I've been cookin' a baby for four months.So chances are you are looking at reviews to pick which buffet(s) you want to eat at when in Vegas, and the answer sometimes just can't be "all of them."Some people say they are disappointed. Honestly, these buffets have lotsa food options, not necessarily anything super crazy! Just lotsa options, and some stuff is staler than other stuff. So now that you know what to expect...I'll compare Wicked Spoon to Bacchanal like this: Bacchanal has a million options. If you aren't a bottomless pit with eating powers equivalent to the Rock or Michael Phelps, Wicked Spoon might be a better choice since it's significantly cheaper. One edge Wicked Spoon does have is dessert- presentation is overall tighter with better flavor and precision than Bacchanal.Weekday dinner was $38 a person. (They do have military discount, btw!) As with any buffet, you can expect food to die under heat lamps, and some of it dies hard here. (Beef Au Poivre was more like Beef Au Jerky.) They have an all-you-can-enjoy mimosa dealio with brunch or red/white wine for dinner. Both are about $12 extra, which is pretty dang amaze if you can put some booze down! Non-alcoholic beverages are included into the price, including Cokes, juices, coffee, and tea! Wicked Spoon kinda does that weird thing where you pay up first and can include your tip on there before receiving service. I'm glad I left a tip on the table since the guy Bill was phenomenal and so kind, and that way I could leave my server extra! And last, my personal tip for being able to eat dessert like a champ: saving dessert for last is for rookies and grandmas. Eat one or two different desserts between plates so that you break up the sweetness and can eat WAY more of them!Enjoy!What a difference a year makes.  We headed back to the Wicked Spoon, anticipating the Dionysian food experience we had last time.  I thought that if we went a bit later, the midwest tourists accustomed to eating dinner at 6:00 p.m. would be tucked into their hotel beds or out getting drunk on the Strip.  So I figured that getting there about 7:45 would give us plenty of time to stuff our faces before the 9 o'clock closing.  Not so fast, cowgirl.The line to pay was long and slow; not as long as at Disney, but long enough.  And this was a Thursday night.  Still, if we'd been seated right away, or after a reasonable wait, we still wouldn't have to eat fast and run.  But the line to get seated was as long as the line to pay.  Why?  Because clean, empty tables stayed empty, and staff was not bothering to clear obviously vacated ones.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to determine that when all chairs are empty and napkins are atop dirty plates, those diners are dearly departed.While everyone was grumbling about the wait and the tables, no one, as usual, was speaking up except Ms. Bigmouth, yours truly.  But the manager gave me the usual song and dance and doubletalk. At last, we got to eat.  And the manager came to our table shortly after to say that she decided to keep the food out for an extra half hour.  Still not enough time for what should have been a rather leisurely meal.It turned out not to matter much.  The heretofore brilliant offerings were mostly pedestrian.  Oh, the usual crab legs and sushi were there.  Many of the dishes were still served on individual serving plates or bowls.  The lamb soup was excellent.  But beyond that, there was nothing outstanding to choose from.  We sampled enough of a variety of items to come to the sad conclusion that the food was basically tasteless.  Salmon was dry and way overcooked.  The Chinese dishes were among the most uninspired, ordinary food ever to grace a pair of chopsticks.  Even the gelato was missing flavor.The room itself is lacking atmosphere - not elegant, nor even hi-tech like Bacchanal.  It's just a room, not even as pretty as the one at the Red Rock Buffet.And speaking of Red Rock, the food's better, the service is better, and with a player's card it'll set you back only $14, instead of the outrageous $41 at Wicked Spoon.  Time to go home.Like the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino where it's situated, the Wicked Spoon is a hip, trendy buffet in classic Las Vegas style. It definitely has a high-end flair, all the way from the silverware and plates, to the food itself.We were here on a holiday weekend and it was quite pricey - $$$ - but the younger kids under 4 were free so it did have value.This buffet has a brilliant solution to portion control and avoiding food waste - virtually every food offering comes in its own small stainless steel or ceramic bowl.  Now, you might think this would be annoying but having experienced it myself, the bowls look really cool and the amounts in them do not really seem to small once you get them back to the table.  The food offerings here are mostly standard for Vegas buffets: salad bar, crab legs, sushi, dessert bar. Nothing to special or outstanding. However, there are a few brilliant standouts that bear mentioning here, which makes this place worth trying. First and foremost, and probably the best part of the whole buffet, is the fresh seafood you can get cooked to order.  It is set up similar to an omelette station at a brunch. They have fresh shrimp, scallops, red snapper, mussels, and various other things you can get custom made in a tomato or scampi broth (mixed is best), with a bit of spice.  And my god, is it good!  I'm tempted to go back there just for this.Secondly, they actually have RARE prime rib, which is a "rarity" in and of itself.  Ha! Virtually every place that serves prime rib has it medium or well done, so this was a pleasant change of pace. We likes it raw! (If you want it more well done, they will grill it up for you on the spot.)  For desert, beyond the standard carrot cake, chocolate-covered strawberry, and custard offerings, they also have fresh-scooped gelato of many different flavors. They again serve it up in relatively small cups, so if you want a lot, you need to order multiple scoops. But the bright side of this is that you can try many different kinds - and let me tell you from personal experience - they're all good!Overall this buffet was a slam dunk and really good in my opinion.  I was totally satisfied and would go back again. And again, and probably again after that.This is a great dining option if you don't want to wait in long lines for a good Vegas buffet. We came here last week for lunch and had terrific dining experience. The lunch buffet is modestly priced @ $35 (diiner - $50), outstanding selections and quality of the food made it a good value. It's located on 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. From the 1st floor, just take the escalator on the right of registration area, next to chandelier bar.We only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Dining area was spacious and atmosphere classy. Service was terrific too. Our server was very friendly, plates were removed and drinks refilled promptly.When dining, they say that you eat with your eyes first. This is definitely true when you eat at the Wicked Spoon. Food Presentation was immaculate and visually appealing. Though family style offerings were present, there main focus were on individual small plates and customized containers. All creatively presented, portioned to right size and ease to get to. Not only did they looked fantastic, they tasted great as well. I took a slight pause at my plate, then dove straight in for the assault. A bounty of deliciousness was at our disposable.My favorites includes -Bone marrow - was like butter, scoop it out with a spoon and spread it over crostini bread. So wicked good! After two bites in, I gave up on bread and went full assault eating it like ice cream. Oh Yum!Five spice pork belly - perfectly crispy skin, succulent meat and fatty goodness was all she wrote. Expect irregular heartbeats after devouring an entire plate. Roast chicken - cooked to perfection, juicy and very flavorful.Salads - Caesar and cobb salad - beautifully presented and on point.Honey and Sriracha chicken wings - sweets, spicy and amazing.Grilled Asparagus - great texture and delicious. Always good going in, going out is another problem. Hahaha!Eggs Benedict with shredded pork and a spicy hollandaise - excellent!.Fresh juice section - small bottle of fresh juices. The fresh squeeze orange, carrot and lime juice was refreshing,Sauteed vegetables (located in Chinese section) - fresh and delicious.Shrimp Cocktail served in shot glass - good size shrimp and not drowning in cocktail sauce...very yummy.All in all - Wicked Spoon did not disappoint. My only complaint was their limited seafood selection and there was no prime rib served during lunch. Instead, they had beef culottes (top sirloin roast). It was tasty, but the meat wasn't tender and slightly chewy. Not a show stopper, the beauty of a buffet is you can get other items if you don't like what you got. Great for picky eaters, especially kids. Bring your appetite and no diets allowed.Oh yes, make sure to save extra space for dessert. Chocolate covered strawberries are so, so good! Gelato section is a winner - pistachio, salted caramel and tiramisu were my favorite.We've been to a lot of buffets in Vegas and wanted to try this one out.  On a Sun brunch at about 1pm we waited 30mins in line before being seated.  There's a line to pay at the cashier.  Afterwards there's a line to the left to be seated.Food- Presentation is everything here.  The portion sizing is fantastic so you get to try a lot of things without wasting or overeating- Check out my pictures but in my opinion the best brunch items were:  watermelon sriracha, beet coconut salad, shrimp cocktails, spicy mac and cheese, chicken piccata, lamb bolongese rigatoni, prime rib- What to skip: fingerling potatoes were very sour, pho- Desserts were amazing.  Best is the full size gelato bar.  Notable flavors: nutella, pischachio, strawberry balsamic, thai ice tea.  They put it on a mini chocolate waffle yumm- Coffee/ice tea/coke etc is included in the buffet price.- For $12 extra can add unlimited mimosa/bloody marysService- fast service, attentivePros- Amazing presentation- Refreshing to see innovative offerings that you might not get elsewhere.- Good variety of American foods- Weekday brunch $27 and weekend at $35 is relatively good deal compared to other buffetsNegatives- selection of seafood surprisingly sparse.  Sushi meager options (only unagi, yellowtail, shrimp and california roll)  No oyster or crab.  Do not come here if you want a lot of seafood.- Asian food selection very small- Few soups (just pho and chicken vegetable soup)Overall this is a new fresh buffet and good addition to Vegas.  The chef put a lot of attention to presentation and providing innovative offerings.   Not a lot of seafood offered but good value.  I would definitely check this place out again.I have been back several times and I'm dropping my rating a star.  Some of the dishes I like a lot are still there.  The kale salad is always very good as is the pork belly.  One of the things I've noticed has been the lack of temperature heat to many of the dishes.  They are lukewarm at best.  This is especially true of the individual portions in small pans or other style holders.The dessert bar has suffered some and the selection of cheese has become almost dismal.  I'm still a fan but I'm sorry to see the downward trend in the pricey buffet.  Wicked Spoon is pricing itself too high and while it may have a good section, the quality has suffered.I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is the best. I guess we came on a weekday so the variety isn't as good as the weekend. The service was good and the food quality was definitely better than other Vegas buffets but I wasn't really sure if it was a 5-star worthy. I liked the dessert selection but I didn't love it. I liked the different stations they had but nothing I ate really stood out.Maybe I'll come back next time on a weekend?I planned a trip to Vegas with my husband last year purely to visit the Wicked Spoon. I bought a new pair of buffet pants for the occasion and booked our flights! :) I also wanted to see the Cat Circus perform while we were there, but they were out of town. We settled for Jersey Boys show, and that was good, but not as good as our dinner at this buffet.The buffet was seriously the highlight of our trip. We spent almost two hours eating our little hearts out. So, so good! I thought I was done eating at one point, but as my husband made round after round to the dessert table, I decided not to admit defeat and had to try a couple sweets of my own. It felt like an accomplishment to walk out of there without assistance when it was all over; fat and happy!For all the variety though, I felt like they didn't have very many seafood options. There was a delicious shot of ceviche that is very memorable, but I like seafood the most and I was surprised they didn't have more fish plates. All in all though, I'm a buffet person and this place is doing it right!I love this place.  The quality of food here is really so much better than any other place I've been to on the strip.  The portions are perfect, the selection is endless and you'll never be able to try everything.  The dining area is beautiful and clean and even the drinks are on another level.  Clean, clear awesome tasting water was probably the most surprising. I also ordered bottomless mimosas which was an extra $12 in addition to the $35 I paid to get in to brunch.  The food, like I said was above my expectations. There was croissant french toast which was the best thing I had there.  Just to name a few other things: cheese platter with dates, nuts, etc. fried chicken, pork belly, rich mac and cheese, omelette bar, piles of bacon, sushi bar, chocolate covered strawberry buffet and gelato.  This place gets busy so you need to be aware of the time that you go.  There is a line to pay and a line to be seated and if you go during the rush you may be waiting for two hours.  Here's the fastest way to get in:  If you are going Saturday or Sunday the lines will get long starting a 10am when the party crowd from last night starts getting up.  10am-1230 was the busiest.  You'll need to go earlier or later for the least wait.  If you are insistent about the 10-1230 time, split your group.  I waited in line to pay and I sent my sister to the line to be seated.  This way you are waiting in two lines at the same time.  I paid and she was next to be seated so we hacked the shit of the system, we saved an hour wait time and that made my food taste better.  Try it next time and you're welcome!Wicked Spoon is my go to buffet when I go to Vegas and is probably one of my favorite buffets of all times. When you think of buffets, you might think of piling a lot of food onto a plate and then all the flavors are mixed together so it really doesn't even taste all that great. At wicked spoon, everything is so beautifully presented in individual dishes. On top of that, everything comes in petite size which is perfect because it helps limit your intake so that you can try more foods. The quality of each dish is superb and there is a wide selection.Asian station: there is always an Asian station where you can find your typical foods like sushi rolls, chinese stir fry and fried rice. What's so special you ask? They pack the fried rice in these cute to go containers size of your palm. MIND BLOWN. IT'S SO CUTE! Not only that, but the rice is vegetarian and is delicious. Oh yeah this place is very good for vegetarians too!!! They also have bone marrow which is to die for. Also oxtail pho which was pretty decent. The kung pao chicken was actually quite good instead of your usual bland kinda soggy chinese food at buffets. Sushi rolls weren't too great though. Meat station: omg meat galore! There are huge pieces of ribeye that the chef will cut for you and you can put sauce on it. There are also sausages, fried chicken that come in this cute little basket.Breakfast station: there are pancakes, benedicts, omlete station that you can request the chef to make the omlete for you. Everything is individually presented as well. There is a whole bread and cheese and random stuff station that include fruits, yogurt parfait, shrimp cocktail, juices and salads. This once is esp. vegetarian friendly. I wish I had room to eat cheese and bread. Dessert Station: I DIE..... you basciallyhave to come here for dessert if nothing else. They have an extensive gelato station with very unique flavors like thai iced tea, blood orange and you can get however much you want. All their desserts are super beautifully made including gold flakes and everything is fresh. This is definitely one of my favorite stationsThe service here is also superb and they always check back to see if you need anything. They give you free beverages including tea, coffee, juice, and soda. Everything cost about 44 dolalrs for lunch including gratuity which is super worth it if you think about the amount of food you eat and the quality of it. I always stay for almost 3 hours and eat slowly and enjoy everything. Everytime I come to wicked spoon, I leave happy and very satisfied and wishing I had a second stomach.#400:"Don't expect life to serve you what you expect. Just enjoy the buffet." ‚Äï Manoj VazDedicating my 400th review to a buffet!?  Hardly!  Well, actually, it *is* what I'm doing but it's mainly because I just got back from an amazingly memorable trip out to Sin City!So, Wicked Spoon.  What can be said after 4,506 reviews?  For starters, I'm still full from Saturday's dinner here at Wicked Spoon.  I had eaten so much bone marrow, sans crostini because I'm a fattie, and dessert, I'm surprised I didn't throw up.  And this was before we hit the bar for some libations!  Matt C. was the best dinner companion for Wicked Spoon because he seemed to enjoy his food as much as I did.  I got to admit though that I thought there would be more variety.  They had a carving station for pork shoulder and prime rib, duck a l'orange, homemade Italian sausage, a fish cooking station, a tiny selection of sushi, a pasta station, some pizza, an impressive salad bar, an even more impressive dessert bar, et cetera.  They even had crab legs!  Yet I still wanted more variety.  #LifeAsAFattie  Dinner was $50/pp and it was definitely busy.  I was disappointed that they were out of pork belly but having some mac & cheese made the disappointment a little better.All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in again!  Decor is nice, service was speedy, and the food was hot.  Take me back to Vegas, please!

Review Text :
Best food you've ever had in Madison? Really?I wanted to like Merchant. I did. I dine on the square a fair bit and as far as I'm concerned, the more options the better!However, the space feels very much like the restaurants I took great pains to avoid when I lived in L.A. (because they were too much of a scene). It's smaller, but I get the same negative vibe.I've seen a large bar share space with a dining area and work very well (Bar La Grassa in Minneapolis, for instance), but Merchant just feels cold to me -- warehouse-like. Like a bar that serves some food, as opposed to a restaurant that encourages you to eat at the bar. The waitstaff seemed very aloof on both of my visits, and charging $9 for cocktails just tips the scales further towards pretension. Maybe hanging some art would soften it a bit? And hiring some nicer people?I sampled the craft cocktails and was left wanting. Same with the food. Maybe I'll try it again in a few moths and hope they're able to make some improvements, but they've quite honestly not given me much of a reason to give them another chance.*** This review has been edited from it's original content. After my initial (frustrating) experience with this establishment, I decided to give it another try and re-write the review with a clear mind. Unfortunately my second experience only echoed my initial let down.Note to other recent reviewers: PLEASE only leave a review if you've actually been to this establishment. The point of this site is to leave reviews based on your experience there, not based on your politics.Here's why I'm giving it 4 stars: Went there to "grab" a tasty treat with a limited time frame. Their sandwich area was closed, but the hostess immediately offered to go back and check to see if they could whip up a to-go sandwich order for me.  They even ushered me to a table and poured me a glass of water while I waited for my take-out order.I picked the procuitto and arugula sandwich - very good, yet light. Ambiance is classy/romantic: think dimly lit, dark but modern woodwork, and an underneath the radar bourbon tasting in the corner to boot. Staff was friendly and extremely accommodating, even though I was in such a hurry.I will definitely come back for a more substantial meal soon.Two months ago I would have given Merchant two stars. The menu read like a United Colors of Benetton billboard crammed with Thai, Mexican, Indian and good ole fashioned American. There was a note about chefs shopping the farmer's market for what was in season which apparently meant more flavors from across the globe than MJ's Heal the World video. A cornucopia of flavors that was really hard to read and make sense of. Bartenders were green and pulled out little black books to remember cocktails they themselves created. It was a mess.BUT, I'm happy to report the times they are a changing! Merchant was AB FAB tonight, so much so that I was crafting a review in my head while I was eating (rare that I mix work with pleasure). Get the mussels. TOMORROW. They're in a creamier broth than I typically prefer but tasty nonetheless. Served with a garlic rubbed bread it's a perfect way to start your evening, especially if you plan to share some stuff with friends and need a little nosh early on. I also recommend you get the patatas bravas, a more American take on a classic Spanish tapas, but flavorful for a potato. Hangar steak tonight was a little overcooked for my tastes, but it had great char and a nice flavor, albeit a little less pink than I prefer. We subbed the taters out for frites and couldn't believe how long they stayed warm in the middle. I hate... HAAAATE cold frites, even luke warm frites, so whatever these guys are doing to 'em rawks, they're magic frites. Super awesome. Any place that freshly squeezes their juice ranks high in my book, and these guys are doing it with grapefruits, even though it's 2 bucks a pop at the store right now. (Makes me think they won't cut corners when prices rise). Bar area was slammed so service was a little slower, but I didn't have anywhere to go so it didn't matter. Know that when they have music there are usually killer tap specials, so the place will fill up. Grab seats early like we did and don't be afraid to get all up in someone's face. I did at one point and at the end of the night the bartender helping us out said thanks for being patient and flagging him down when we wanted. All in all, this place is miles better than when I was there over the summer. If you haven't been recently give them another try, and as soon as I get back there and try more of their concise and easier to read menu, I'll let you know how it goes!Merchant is where I go to hobnob. The atmosphere is dark with a smidge of swank and the drinks are on point with a smidge of expensive. They often boast solid live music on Thursdays and DJs for grooving late nights Friday and Saturday.Do I giggle when bartenders refer to themselves as "mixologists"? Yes. Will I refer to them as such with a straight face in order to get my hands on a Jack Rose (aka my favorite cocktail in town)? Of course. And I knock off a star because the Jack Rose is only made available when their house-made grenadine is in stock. I'll bring in my own store-bought grenadine if I have to. Girl's not too proud to lug syrup around in her purse.Most recently ordered their brat sliders and get.outta.town. Delicious. Next up, I've got my eye on their late night brunch menu. Brunch...10PM-1:30AM...that's my kind of crazy.I've been back to Merchant more times than I can truly count, and it continues to impress.+ By far and above all others - the finest cocktails in Madison+ Always a solid selection of micro brews on tap+ Sit at the bar and engage the bartenders; they're fun, informative, and helpful- Yes, it's noisy at times, but it's a big, open space with lots of hard surfaces+ Cheese curds are awesome+ Brunch is amazing+ You can buy your favorite booze on-site and take it home with youMy husband and I were first timers at Merchant this past Saturday. Around 8 O'clock the bar and dining area were packed. I automatically fell in love with the design and d√©cor which was a combination of industrial rustic and prohibitionThe host politely greeted us and we were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait which was fine with us because after all it was a Saturday night. A few minutes later a server walked by and asked if we would like anything to drink while we were waiting. My husband order an Old Fashioned and I ordered a Side Car (at the servers recommendation). Five minutes later he came back with the best cocktails we have ever had in Madison. They were strong but not over powering. We found two lounge chairs in the back and relaxed until our table was ready. In the mean time the same server came back and checked on us and brought us water. After about a 20 minute wait we were seated in his section. He gave us a run down of the restaurant and it's history and recommended another round of superb drinks. He even went as far to explain exactly how the drinks were maid and gave us a recipe! Talk about going above and beyond! Fast forward to the food. We ordered the scallops and Olives as appetizers and they were at our table in less than 10 minutes. The scallops were perfectly cooked, crispy on the top and bottom and flaked easily with a fork. The sauce was mouth watering and the cabbage and bacon complimented the dish perfectly. The olives came in a huge portion with ricotta on top and warm bread and again were fabulous! Around 9 they started playing old school rap (Biggie, Tupac etc.) which is the way to my heart! The DJ was setting up around 9:30 just was we were leaving which is a major bummer because we probably would have stayed until closing if we hadn't had previous engagements. Overall I would have to say this is my new favorite bar in Madison! We will definitely be going back in the next few weeks!Headed back to Merchant with a crew of 7 lovely ladies. I have to tip my hat to the wait staff. They know their stuff! Ask them anything about their extensive drink menu or food menu and they know the answer! Seriously, they describe flavors, make recommendations, tell you where things are from etc. It's borderline insane! They are also all about the guest! They were happy to make me a custom mocktail, not on the menu, just something crafted just for me. Talk about feeling like a queen! They also let another in our group swap out a dessert special for an appetizer instead. Our server brought extra bread to dip into the sauce the mussels were steamed in. First class, 5 star service!The food is also amazing! I sampled the perfectly seasoned fries, ooey gooey cheese curds, and couldn't pass up the warm olives again. My steak frites entree was amazing and cooked to perfection. Perfect crust on the peppery steak. Served with amazingly seasoned fries and a bed of lightly dressed greens. I sampled the date night fish which was also delicious and the perfectly citrusy mussels. That sauce... Oh that sauce! I understand why my friend ordered extra bread, it's drinkable! Merchant is just one of those places that does everything right! Thank you to merchant and our stellar server for an exceptional meal!Can you give six stars? I'm giving six stars.If you ever meet me, you'll know within an hour that merchant is one of my favorite restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Everything about every meal and drink I've had here has only been positive. To start: service is always top notch. Chefs and cooks are competent and accommodating; if you have any questions about diet or ingredients, servers are always willing to find out for you. Speaking of servers, ask for Kristin if she's available. I wish I could give her a review too, but I'll just say, most honest, competent, and one of the best servers I've had the pleasure of being served by.In my last review, I went into deep detail of every meal I've had here. Overall, I love the mussels here. Decadent, creamy (no dairy!), almost tart perfection with mussels and onions cooked just right. Mussels weren't my favorite food until I came to Madison.Drinks; I've had many and let me say, they're all amazing. Go with your gut; if you think you'll like it, you'll most likely love it. My favorite is the sharknado, and pear's sake is a close second. Desserts; red beet chocolate cake, hand's down. It's a large dessert, so I definitely recommend sharing. Surprisingly, I've never had to wait for a table. Most of the time I have a reservation, but the few times I've come here without one, I've been seated within ten minutes. I can rave about this place all day, which i do to many of my out-of-town friends. Come here for a drink ($2 off for happy hour), or come here for the fun servers and the good food. You can bet you'll run into me here!Okay Merchant, you're up to bat. Several Yelpers highly recommend you so we showed up with high expectations. Specifically we heard a rumor that the buffalo style cheese curds were incredible. Were they?We showed up to Merchant around 8pm for a slightly later dinner than usual. It was quite packed and loud by the time we showed up. The host was sitting and disengaged, but he was able to have someone seat us immediately at a 2 person table wedged in the corner by the kitchen.The decor can be described as a pirate ship cabin that has been redecorated by a hipster. The walls have fleured wall paper and the light fixtures remind me of something out of Pirates of the Caribbean between the paper lanterns and the lamp covers made out of old carboys with the bottoms cut off. Even the drink menu had an old canvas map feel to it. The entire north wall is lined with craft liquor for sale, which is nice because sometimes you just need to run out and get a bottle of Pastis but can't find it in a liquor store. I'd describe the atmosphere as a very trendy, kind of hipster bar. Unfortunately, it is quite loud so don't expect to have a good conversation inside.During our visit I had the opportunity to order a fantastic porter that was on rotating tap, the buffalo style cheese curds, the Friday night special (fish fry), and a key lime pie.Let's start with the cheese curds; I was sorely disappointed. The cheese curds were fairly standard but when ordered buffalo style they come with buffalo sauce DUMPED all over them. The first one I put in my mouth honestly reminded me of a buffalo boneless chicken wing, not a cheese curd. The breading was mushy, and you couldn't really taste the cheese. We were so disappointed by the addition of this sauce that we ended up asking our server for a cheese curd without it on the side. The curd without the sauce was quite good. We're going to have to come back again to truly get a feel for the curds at Merchant because we cannot judge them on their buffalo style curds. If you really want to try the buffalo curds, ask for the buffalo sauce on the side.Merchant also offers a HUGE list of craft cocktails. My wife ordered the Lee Ralph, a rum and fruit based cocktail. It was quite smooth so much so that it didn't taste alcoholic. If you're a Yelper, make sure you check in to get $1 off the cocktails!The main course, my fish fry was very well done. It was fresh water perch, served with a house tartar sauce. I do not really like tartar sauce so I can't say much about the sauce, but my wife said it was really good. I ended up asking for a bottle of malt vinegar, which is the only way to truly eat fried fish, in my humble opinion. The fries that came with the meal were VERY salty, but the acid of the malt vinegar paired well, toning down the salt. I really liked the coleslaw, surprisingly. I'm not the biggest fan, but this slaw was very good. It entirely lacked balanced by having tons of vinegar on it, but it paired well with the salt from the fries. I actually liked the overpowering acid in this case.For dessert I ordered the key lime pie. I'm a bit of a key lime pie snob, and this pie has HUGE potential. The filling was incredible, and it had the right about of whipped cream on top. Sadly, there was way too much crust on the pie. The ratio of filling to crust was weighted toward the crust. There should always been more filling than crust. Either the crust needs to be thinner or the filling needs to be thicker. I don't want every bite to taste just like graham cracker.The service at Merchant was fantastic. Our server was very attentive in refilling water, asking how things were, and asking if we needed anything like more drinks. She even took care of my ridiculous requests for a single cheese curd and a bottle of malt vinegar. Merchant, kudos on quality service. We felt very taken care of, even when I was being slightly ridiculous.I also have to mention, Merchant, props on your wine list. It is rare to see such a diverse, interesting, and well put together wine list. It's even rarer to server so many of the wines by the glass. I appreciate this touch.Overall, I really liked Merchant. It had some short comings, but I think I will be a repeat customer. We need to give the cheese curds without sauce another try and explore more of the menu. It pains me a bit to only give Merchant 3 stars because I want to like it. I appreciate the atmosphere, menu diversity, drink quality, and the service. I cannot over look all of the small flaws in the food. The food left me wanting a little bit more.

Review Text :
I am going to start off by saying that I am a fan of BWW, but this location is lacking bigtime in the service department. I love the wings, and I always have...but the other food was bland.The service was HORRIBLE. The waitstaff were very unprofessional...even for a bar setting. The host, Craig...I think his name was...told us that if our server wasn't good that he would "Strip her and stretch her out"...how disgusting is that? Oh, and we didn't go at night...we went for a BUSINESS LUNCH.We weren't given menus.The people who brought our food carried on conversations with one another that were of the sexual nature that I really didn't want to hear...one server with blonde hair and too much eyemakeup was very vulgar and too PDA-y with her coworkers.There was also another server texting on her cell phone.I wish this place had better service, we will never be going here again!I normally only review businesses where I have positive statements to make.  I feel that my bad experience at a location does not necessarily mean that the restaurant should suffer for it, because your experience might be better than mine.  However, I am so put off by this place and multiple bad experiences that I truly feel the need to warn EVERYONE from going there.  There are LOTS of other choices in Charlotte, no need to support this business that treats customers so poorly.We had a reservation to start my Bachelor Party here, due to the convenient location of being next to our hotel (not due to positive experiences in the past, that's for sure).  The reservation was made weeks in advance & would have been between 10  - 14 adult males all drinking alcohol and devouring wings and appetizers, etc for a few hours before moving the party to a more adult-oriented location.. The tables were not ready on time.  Not really a problem, that's ok.  We can work with that.  The hostess showed us a small table (8 top) that was ready immediately, as well as the table(s) where we would prefer to be located, but we needed to wait 10 minutes.  We chose to wait for the larger table.  We stood at the front for over 30 minutes.  Those of us made to stand at the front and wait included my fiance's 75 year old father and my 65 year old father!  The hostess offered (again) to put us at the smaller table (8 top), or we could wait for the big table.. Again we chose to wait for the larger table, as we knew that the 8-top was too small. They told us our table was ready after 35 minutes of waiting, and the manager was there helping to set the table.  The problem was:  the table was the smaller table that we were offered over 30 minutes prior.  When I questioned the manager about it, and pointed to the tables behind us where we had been promised, he said that larger set was going to a party of 20 that was a WALK-IN behind us (a group of teenage volley ball players). I explained what we just went through, all the waiting, and the communication with the hostess, that we had a reservation for weeks - and they were not ready for us, and we had been waiting over 30 minutes for that particular table, and now he was suggesting he was going to give it to the party of 20 teenagers who cannot even order a drink from the bar?  He said, "no I am not planning on giving it to them, I AM giving it to them".We left, as I would not let any of my friends or family spend single dime in a location that would talk to us that way; and we spent over 3000 dollars in food and alcohol at the Wild Wing Cafe around the corner (located in the Epicenter).  I sure hope those teenagers were able to order a LOT of wings to make up for the loss of income to the bartenders!! Do yourself a favor.  Do not eat here & support businesses with poor customer service in today's economy!  There are plenty more deserving businesses in Charlotte that deserve the patronage, because they care!

Restaurant name  South China BBQ Hong Kong Style

Review Text :
This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.

Review Text :
I love BBQ and this place is located near my good friend's house.  So when he suggested we try out the new BBQ place near his house, I jumped at the opportunity.They recently opened, so there isn't even a sign there yet....but they have a huge banner so we knew we were in the right place.  It's tucked in the corner of the shopping center, so you have to look for it.Looking at the menu, which has no beef, I was tempted by the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Hot Links sandwich.  I couldn't decide, so I ordered both!While we were waiting for our food, the owner/cook gave us samples of his Baby Back Ribs, Fries, and Hot Sauce.  What a  nice guy.....the samples he gave us were awesome too.The first dish to come out was the Pulled Pork Sandwich.....the thing is huge!  I was beginning to regret ordering 2 sandwiches...lol  Anyway, the Pork was tender and juicy and had the right amount of BBQ Sauce.  The sandwich is topped with Coleslaw, which added to the overall flavor....very good.A few minutes later came this huge Hot Links Sandwich.....I got in over my head this time....but I wasn't going to let that sandwich beat me.  The Hot Link was very good and again the right amount of BBQ Sauce was in the sandwich.  It is also topped with Grilled Onions & Cheddar Cheese.....yum.  The only thing that could have made it better was if it was spicier.....I like blazing hot Hot Links.The staff was very friendly and helpful too...and greeted us with smiles and when we left said goodbye....nice personal touch.  I took plenty of pics, so check them out.  They also deliver....Will I come back?  Absolutely.I've hungered and gone to Hog's Heaven! I can't believe I haven't reviewed this heavenly place yet! Silly of me! Thanks to my ever so lovely and tasteful girlfriend, I've had the pleasure of partaking of such delicious southern style grubbage! I should warn you that eating here more often will cause addiction and once addiction sets in, you will experience bad withdrawals from the overflowing BBQ sauce!The homestyle greetings from the front cashier, Marsha, already take you out of Las Vegas and into the flavorful and intriguing customs of the South! The walls are covered with components and shout-outs to Hog's Heaven for their return to the mountain side of Centennial Las Vegas. I called in the order one night and spoke extensively to Marsha about what I felt like sinking my teeth into and she suggested the full rack of ribs. I was a little apprehensive on $19.95 for a rack of ribs (12 bones) but the half rack was just a few dollars cheaper and I thought, "If we don't finish it, I'll eat it tomorrow anyway!" Can't have ribs with no sides so I went with Mac n Cheese! My girlfriend and I love their hot link sandwich so we decided to half that as our other side (hey! when we grub, we grub!) and she said their fries were pretty good so we got that with a side of hog sauce (YUM!). My girlfriend remembered that there was a discount for yelpers for 10% off so we smiled even bigger. We phoned in our order so we told them to start cooking 15 minutes after we hung up. Marsha asked about dessert but I politely declined because we had our own waiting. Marsha joked she wanted some of our homemade pumpkin gooey cake but we were serious about sharing :)When we picked the food up, we were kind of sad Marsha was out on a delivery because we wanted to share our cake with her. We also asked the cashier (forgot her name!) if Marsha included the 10% off and she said she wasn't sure and told us to wait for her to do that. That almost threw the positive experience out the door but when Marsha came back, her winning attitude and Southern hospitality totally kicked it back into positive! Not only did she give 10% off, she gave a little bit more for the wait. I hope she enjoys that cake cuz it is SO GOOD! We destroyed half the rack (saved the rest)! Enjoyed the hot link sandwich as always and discovered a new sauce I like: Hog Sauce.I will not only return here, but I will return with an appetite for the rest of their menu! Thanks again, Marsha!

Past 10pm?  Looking for some cheap food that isn't fast?  From 10pm - closing, you can order off of their lunch menu, where the most expensive item was only $7.50.  When we were initially seated, we were given the regular dinner menus and had to ask for the lunch menu, so be sure to do the same.Our group of five ordered six dishes, totaling $52, and we had left overs!  Salt and pepper shrimp, ribs, chicken wings, hot and sour soup, an eggplant tofu dish, and a noodle dish.  All were delicious and came in generous portions.  Be sure to have friends with you if you're ordering more than one dish!  For any late night dining needs, this is truly one of the better deals I've come across.Not that I hit the nightlife much nowadays, but if my partying cuts short before 3AM (when they close) then I'm for sure making my way to HK Seafood Garden!Nelson & Sylvia Q. tipped us in on the secret reverse happy hour. You won't see it advertised and they sure as heck won't tell you about it. But after 10pm, you can order off the lunch menu. When our group of 5 was seated, they handed us the dinner menus. After inquiring about the lunch menus, I discovered the lunch menu is the dinner menu at lunch prices. Specifically, cheap lunch prices. Dinner entrees wavered around $12-15 and nothing on the lunch menu was over $7.50. Step aside Pho Kim Long, HK Seafood is officially my new spot for post-drink eats.My Chinese of preference is Yunnan / Sichuan style but HK Seafood makes some of the Hong-Kong style classics amazingly. The salt & pepper shrimp, ribs, and chicken wings are awesome. The shrimp are pretty large and fried head-on. We also ordered a hot & sour soup, eggplant w/ tofu pot (my favorite!), and HK-style seafood chow mein. *yum*This is the spot for lunch specials and late night specials. I didn't catch until when is the lunch special offered, but at night they let you order the lunch specials after 10pm. The menu is quite large and all under $7.50. I've never been as it doesnt really stand out outside and is in a shopping center that's easy to drive by and not know what was in there. I came with a group of friends who have been here for late night eats after going to 2nd Chance Prom. We ordered family style - Crispy noodles with seafood - the noodles and veggies were good, but I found the calamari a bit fishy. Eggplant and tofu with garlic sauce hot pot - this had great flavor and liked how the tofu surface soaked up the sauce quite a bitGeneral Chicken - this was actually really tasty. It was prepared in a way that reminds me more of sweet and pungent than most places Tso's and has a nice light crisp to it. Salt and Pepper Shrimp - these were cooked to a crisp to where you can eat the shell and all. I can eat a lot of these. Greens steamed with garlic - simple but good. Gotta have some veggies. It fed 5 people well for under $50 - not bad! I did appreciate that items weren't as greasy as some other Chinese spots open late. It's no frills, quick and cheap food that's pretty decent. If you're looking for a cheap lunch or late night meal then try out this spot. I will be back!A friend told me to check out the Chinese restaurant in China Town.  You know, the one on Spring Mountain.  It's in that strip mall with the Vietnamese place--the one by the Asian Massage Parlor.   The white folks I know seem to be pretty divided on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing when the vast majority of the patrons of a restaurant order food in a language other than English.  One camp argues that the food is more authentic in these establishments.  The other group is downright scared.  With that in mind, some of my friends would be terrified...but don't worry... HK Seafood Garden has a welcoming staff, they serve several American friendly dishes such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, and they'll even offer you a fork if you seem out of place.I recently came in with a group that ordered entirely in Chinese.  That happens often with me these days...the best part was that one of individuals from our table took it upon themselves to walk back to the kitchen, check the cleanliness, and later returned after we ordered to let the chef know not to mess up our order.  If you ask for it, they will bring out house soup for your table.  HK has one of the better versions of this soup that I've tried.I've enjoyed most of what I've shared here a great deal.  Some of my favorites include:Scallops with string beans in spicy xo sauce!Ong Choy w/ Bean CurdHouse Special Stir Fried Thick NoodleChaoZhou ShrimpWhole Fried FishDried Scallop & Mushroom w/ Snow Pea LeafThe group agreed that this is one of the best places in Vegas

Review Text :
Cheffinis little hot dog cart is just past the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas. It is the perfect place for a late night rendezvous to stuff a hot weiner between your buns, get it all juiced up with extras, and then open your mouth wide and take as much as you can in to your oral orifice! You may briefly have a gag reflex, but after you relax those throat muscles, the hot splash of flavors in your mouth after a  night of imbibing in adult beverages at the several nearby saloons is like an orgasm in your mouth. You can ask for everything on it, and there is no extra charge, even for pineapples, to sweeten up the flavors gushing in your pie hole. Just a $3 hand job in the mouth. Hard to beat it!Four stars for flavor, two stars for service, averaging to three but they have the potential to improve. CLASSIC CHEFFINIS: Grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalape√±os, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. $6 for a gigantic dog overflowing with toppings that didn't sound like they'd work, but somehow harmonized. Didn't expect to like the pineapple sauce, but I did.MOSHI MOSHI: Grilled frank, caramelized onions, seaweed, jalape√±o, wine sauce, spicy mayo. I love a good Japanese dog, this one was simple. Asked for it sans jalapenos and received a rather sad-looking dog with very few onions, but flavor was good. $7 price tag seems appropriate for the area and toppings.Now for the service. Walked in to one person in line waiting for a drink refill. Through the kitchen window we could see the cook hard at work, but the cashier was nowhere to be found for a solid five minutes and the cook never acknowledged anyone waiting as the line grew to five more people.Eventually the cashier popped up and started handling the customers, but she seemed overwhelmed and flustered, forgetting to box takeout orders and other minor oversights.While walking around downtown, I decided to grab a hot dog from here for hubby and I to share. After placing my order I was told it would be just a few minutes. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for just 1 hot dog because 2 employees were making food for themselves first. El Mexicano ($6.99) - A bacon wrapped hot dog with avocado, tomato, onion, cherry pepper relish, green sauce, chipotle guava and garlic aioli. This hot dog just had way too much going on for me. Everything on it sounded good, but it didn't work all together. The bacon that was wrapped around the dog was very hard and dry. All I tasted once I was able to chew through the bacon was onions and plain mayo. Apparently sides of sauce are .25 cents each and after looking at my receipt I noticed that I was charged .50 cents for 2 sides of extra sauce. I didn't even ask for anything extra I just wanted the hot dog I ordered. Like the bacon, the bun was hard. My total with tax was $8.10 and that's too much for just one hot dog that didn't even taste good.After all the glowing reviews I figured this hot dog joint was going to be my new favorite place. I had a bacon wrapped hot dog and the bun and bacon were both hard. How in the heck can a hot dog alone with no drink or side cost over $8? I could see if it were a footlong hot dog but this was just an average size hot dog. The girls working were nice but I have definitely experienced better hot dogs other places for far less in price and much better in taste.Cheffinis is the stoner's answer to the Hot Dog. Located in Downtown Container Park, attached to the Black Cup Coffee shop. This tube steak eatery provides a different style of dog with available toppings like chorizo bits, pineapple sauce, chimichurri, crushed potato and chipotle guava. Now of course this isn't all on one dog, but a taste of the difference they offer. I ordered the "Grandfather" which is ridiculous. A grilled frank and pork belly, red bell peppers, caramelized onions, crushed potato chips, spicy mayo, basil aioli, pickle mango, topped with a fried quail egg. This was amazing, I loved the pork belly paired with a runny quail egg and the crunch from the potato chips was also nice touch. This was stacked with toppings and I do suggest trying to eat this classic way for at least for one bite, but then grab the fork and knife because it gets messy. The other dog I tried was the "Classic Cheffinis" with, onions, tomatoes, jalape√±os, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. A classic dog, but on steroids, there's no way really to eat this with your hands, there's just too many toppings, but they all taste great together. I really enjoyed the Pineapple sauce with the jalapenos and the fresh tomatoes. The one thing I didn't enjoy was the mozzarella, I usually love mozzarella on everything, but the cheese was cold and not close to being "melty" which would have been much better. Cold cheese and hot food, not a great mix. Good dogs and great area for seating and people watching. Also, the sweet potato fries and fry sauce are the business!

The Valley could use more fresh in and out options like this! While in Downtown Phoenix for a meeting this weekend, lunch hour hit and I needed a healthy meal on the run. Enter GreenMix! As I walked in, I experience a bit of menu anxiety since it was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, the staff was friendly and once they learned I was a first timer, the guy walked me through the steps. I decided to go with a salad, so I first choice the type of greens, followed by four additions from the bowls filled with veggies and cheese. This salad would be $5.99. They also had other bowls full of avocado, eggs, etc. However, those were 75 cents extra per topping. I'm a sucker for avocado so I decided it was work the three quarters. I also ended up adding chicken which was another $2. I ended up walking away with a hefty salad and soda for under $10. It's not cheap, but worth it for a fresh salad topped with added items! I will definitely visit again and keep my finger's crossed that they will open up more locations in the Valley.

Review Text :
Sometimes it is the simple things in life that are 4 stars. Take In N Out Burger. They have turned dining out into a simple experience. In N Out specializes in three sandwiches: a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheeseburger in addition to fries, Coke beverages, and shakes. It is simplicity in dining that is delicious. In N Out burgers taste freshly made. Missing from In N Out are microwaves and warmer lights.  This past Saturday after exploring Craig Ranch Regional Park and hanging out in The Cannery my brother and I were up for a simple 4 star meal. The Cannery failed at that. It was now 11 p.m. And so we decided to meet up at the In N Out Burger a couple of lights from the Cannery and off the Interstate 15 exit. The abundance of parking and lighting gave me a simple first impression. It was an impression that would develop into a 4 star rating. The restaurant met my standards in cleaniness. The cashier was welcoming. In back of the cashier, the people cooking the burgers were in plain view. I appreciate the fact that customers can see the food being prepared. The time between ordering and picking up the food was 8 minutes. Yeah it wasn't exactly fast food, however, the taste exceeded fast food. An In N Out cheeseburger and fries is worth waiting for. The cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was thick and tasty. I could believe that the burger was not frozen and microwaved. The fries were good, but in my opinion they cannot hold up to Chick Fil-A's or Nathan's.  When it comes to eating out, sometimes I am a fan of  simple dining. I will be checking into an In N Out Burger in the near future.Let me start by saying I love In-N-Out Burger it was love at first bite many years ago when I first discovered these guys. This location was a little disappointing but they still managed to put out a great product. The drive thru seemed to move at a steady pace but the inside was extremely slow compared to other locations I've frequented that were much busier. The inside of the restaurant was about 30% full so the wait time was ridiculous in my opinion I understand they make the burgers to order but 15 minutes for a double double was frustrating. The floors were in the process of being mopped by several employees and were slick and greasy the tables needed to be wiped down and the trash needed to be emptied after all it wasn't like they were trying to recover from the lunch crowd it was about 3:00 PM on a weekday.  No manager in sight so no one was directing the employees or managing the operation. My next trip I will stop at the one off the strip at the bottom of the I-15 ramp off of Tropicana Drive ( I think that's the correct location of the great In-N-Out Burger). I just hope this is not the trend of the In-N-Out Burger chain.

Restaurant name  Pork On A Fork
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
These little piggies come from a small farm in Nebraska still run by the family of one of the co-founders of Pork on a Fork.  Of course, the prices are higher than that you would pay in the mega grocery stores today.  But for me, not only do I get better quality, I get peace of mind in knowing that the little piggies were raised humanely with fresh air and exercise, and they were not pumped full of growth hormones.I ordered the premium package for $50 and received 4 boneless chops (about 6 oz each), a package of 2 ham steaks, a pound of bacon, and a pound of pulled pork (smoked over pecan wood).  Everything is frozen, so you can just pop it in your freezer until ready to use, and everything is delicious.  The pulled pork is the winner for me since all I have to do is heat it!You can order and pay on-line and specify which farmers' market you would like to pick up from (their calendar is on the website).  Couldn't be easier.  Although my first order was put in the wrong freezer and sent to another market, they quickly made up my package on-site and took my word for it that I had already paid.  They also have a restaurant opening this month, I believe, at 15th Ave & Deer Valley Rd!~This is for the restaurant, not the market~ The newly opened building has the wonderful aroma of smoked pork. That alone deserves 4 stars. It is a order at the counter, they put together the meal and you pick it up. They can fit about 25 people and it is clean and inviting. The pulled pork was as great as expected. $ generations of hog farmers know how to raise them pigs. The sides were choice of: beans, Potato salad or coleslaw. The beans are doctored up canned beans with real hunks of bacon....yummy. The Potato salad is said to be homemade but had that strange sweet taste to it. While good it was not great. The slaw looked but but I did not try any. 2 sauces Hot or mild... go for the heat, remmeber they are from Nebraska...it was not hot. LOLThe prices seem reasonable, the staff is excellent. The food is great. Look out for breakfast and Swine and Dines... they are getting a beer license. SUUUU WEEEEE.Reviewing their food for the first time at their new restaurant location in far north phoenix (Deer Valley Airport only USED TO be the boonies), but i've been hearing about their meat for some time now.A delicious smoky aroma gently smacks you around and lulls you into submission once you enter.  A simple menu offers the lunch selection (soon to offer breakfast too). I knew i wanted pulled pork as an entree, and honestly didn't notice what else they had.  The usual side offerings of beans, potato salad, and coleslaw never appeal to me, personally.  I don't fault them for that, but a pickle spear being my only other available side left me feeling less than satiated.  Maybe some french fries, or at least chips?  The pulled pork sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, and the meat was juicy without being fatty.  The bun was simply generic.  Maybe these guys could get into cahoots with a local baker to put their special meat on something a little more worthy?  The sauces offered were "Sweet Mild" (which was both) and "Hog Wild Hot" (which was neither, but still tasty).  Both had a distinct molasses sweetness in a thick tomatoey base, the Hot with a little more spice flavor to it, but not much heat at all.The atmosphere is simple and clean.  Ribs, breakfast, and "Swine & Dine" nights are on the way, according to the owners.Look forward to many more days of coming back to work smelling like a meat smoker !First off, this place is not easy to find...  But that made my trip to find some "porky on a poke" even more interesting and some what of an adventure.  I've been looking forward to eating at their Pork on a Fork dinner after sampling some of their delicious pulled pork at the Town and Country Market. Thanks goodness for that little foldable road side sign stating "Pork on a Fork" ~~ this way...  I found them! You open the door and you're blasted with the awesome aroma of slow cooked pork, smoking in a wood burning oven/smoker.  "What a smell!"  The place is no frills, simple yet very accommodating for people wanting to dine their.  They are a take out or dine in.  They have a small selection of menu items for both breakfast and lunch, mostly pork products.  This is what makes this place unique and awesome!  They are able to focus their efforts on perfecting "porky on a poke" via pulled pork, bacon, ham, brats, polish dogs and beef brisket.  They do offer a variety of side items as well but "no salad for you" here.  Important factoid: They are not open for dinner ~ 7am-3pm only.The service was excellent and ready to answer any questions you may have concerning their menu. I had their pulled pork sandwich which brought the biggest smile to my face after eating it.  In fact I think I'm still smiling and it's been a couple of days ago since I was there, lol! There portion of smoked pork-to-bun was definitely in favor of the smoked pork hands down.  It was a big sandwich and full of tasty, smoky, moist porky goodness which I topped with their Hot BBQ sauce. The side if waffle fries and beans were average at best.  We also had their Spicy Polish which was good but no comparison to their pork. We also had their potato salad and coleslaw which were again just ok.This is a fantastic place for smoked pork sandwiches, ham and beef brisket!  I am looking forward to trying their bacon, BLT or their pork burrito on my next visit. If you're near 19th Ave and Deer Valley, head east about 4 blocks on Deer Valley until you see a little "Pork on a Fork" road side sign and turn in.  You won't be disappointed.What shall  I tell you first?Another great strip mall non descript place hidden in an industrial area. I do have to say they did a great job making the restauarant look clean , inviting and very functional for a very small space. I definitely will be back ...love the smoky flavor of the meat, sweet and throughly washing the meat with flavor  and the sweet pink ring  that makes the meat  and you know its the real  smoky deal. they have lots of choices of sauces but it was juicy and flavorful enough that I could have eaten it without sauce. The flavors were great  all around even my daughter's waffle fries was really tasty. We loved the smoky sweet white BBQ beans. Our friends Paul and Paula ( see Paul I mentioned you ...now write your own darn review)  had brisket and a tasty smoked sausage which looked great and the bites I had were delicious.  Prices are very reasonable and the service was perfect. Look for them at local farmers markets , Friday night dinners (prime and ribs mmm)  and hopefully a bigger site s I can bring my friends.Unfortunately, it's time once again to drop my rating of what used to be one of my favourite restaurants. If this happened at any other place I'd give it a 1 star and permanently avoid on principle, but because PoaF have pretty much the best barbecue I've ever tasted it'll get a flat 3, accompanied by a giant frown of annoyance.So what happened? Did the prices increase like they did at Loving Hut? No. Food quality dropped? No. Still cramped as a sardine tin inside with less than a snowball's chance in hell of getting a seat at lunchtime? Well, yes, but that isn't the reason. This time it's due to false advertising. Several weeks ago they came up with the idea of a loyalty card. Buy 5 meals, the sixth is free. Here's my photo of it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/825nC-s-cQG6Hsul5Gm2cA?select=sSvKMJtwYvgp3PuNafyBsA). Seems pretty obvious how it works, right? Well, last time I was there I reached the free meal marker. I usually get their "Smokin' Meal" menu item - two types of meat, plus two sides and half a sausage. However when I tried to claim the free meal the counter girl informed me that they don't give that particular meal out as free because, quote unquote, "there's so much meat in it". Which equates to about two fistfuls of meat, half a sausage like I said, plus maybe eight ounces in canned baked beans and sweet potato fries. She then tells me that I can get any of the other items on the menu for free, or else she could give me a free drink OR, "say.. three dollars discount". The card didn't say "excludes Smokin' Meal". They brought me there six times and told me the card was frickin next to worthless. Get another menu item for $7 for free, or get $3 off my smokin' meal which is only a couple of bucks more than the items they classify as free? Wow.I'd have been happy to show up here forever and pay their asking price for a meal. But the fact that they pushed off a loyalty card on me then told me to GFY when I tried to claim on it is rank as hell. Fail, lose two stars, Seacrest out. Oh, Seacrest back in for another ten seconds. Went there today, bought the usual, girl didn't offer me another card or mention the concept at all, left. Still delicious; still pissed at them. Seacrest out again.It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)======Smoky Goodness Alert========Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!  Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!  You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning. If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there.I had forgot how long it has been since I have updated a review. Pulled pork piled high on a fresh bun with some good bbq sauce...sounds like a good lunch to me. I have been cutting the amounts of food I eat and opted for the PPS with no sides. There was plenty of meat and bread for a lunch. They have opened the suite behind them to allow for additional seating. To be honest It looks like a kick ass place to have a get together or small party!The staff was great as usual. I appreciate that most of all.My wife & I ordered take out tonight from here we both ordered the BBQ pork burrito with the cornbread as a side. Upon opening the box the aroma of the BBQ pulled pork permeated the room right away. The burrito was very large with a tortilla that was bulging from the pulled pork inside. As my wife & I took our first bites we both looked at each other acknowledging our approval of how delicious the burrito was.  My pulled pork was juicy, well seasoned, incredibly moist and tender with a whole lot of awesomeness. It had an amazing Smokey flavor and the extra side if BBQ sauce was really good. Both meals came with cornbread which was the perfect addition to the burrito. FOOD: Great BBQ - Love the tangy/sweet sauce , The food is incredible. I really enjoyed my meal.  SERVICE:  The staff is always very pleasant. PRICE: The price is entirely on-point.  For the quality of food you receive, which is one of the best BBQ places I've tried in Phoenix. The food is worth every penny...and probably a little bit more.  I have never been disappointed here. CONCLUSION: One of the best BBQ places we have tried.  RETURN FACTOR 100%.       ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH

This has got to be one of thee least well known out of the very few michelin star restaurants in Edinburgh and I really don't know why?!?! It is set in a lovely big ol' townhouse on Calton Terrace. The interior is understated elegance, which was a relief! Didn't leave me thinking I was massively under-dressed (silly, I know). We sat in the drawing room with a G&T whilst waiting for our table. Lovely surroundings but I was slightly underwhelmed by the Gin selection. Good. But not great.We were then later sat. The dinner room stuck with understated elegance. Big windows infront of the kitchen are always a nice touch. I liked it.I shall not recount every single little thing we ate. But I can tell you one thing - every morsel of food we had here..... was.... incredible. 5 courses of truly incredible food..... with a couple of wee treats inbetween courses. As you would expect. The portions are not massive. But we left feeling very satisfied but not uncomfortably full. There is no better way to end the review. We recieved our bill -  2 years ago I would have been gobsmacked by the price of it. But..... my response was, you know what, that is very reasonable considering it is without a doubt some of the best food I have ever eaten. And that makes it worth every penny. A great treat.

Review Text :
Taco Mac, seems like an Applebee's menu, wings, sandwiches, burgers and salads.  In fact, those are the words out of Billy's mouth. I thought to myself and said aloud, I do not want to eat here. But we were pressed for time and couldn't go anywhere else.  I joked with Billy, watch the food be fantastic, since I was judging it without even trying it. I realize this is not fair, but it totally seemed like a chain restaurant menu.We ordered a couple of beers off the expansive beer list, where is the Dewey Decimal System when you need it? The beer menu is alphabetical, so if you want to try something new, you have to read the whole column to find the type of beer you would like.  Maybe it should be divided by style, then alphabetical.  No drink specials, booooo.  They only have pint night one week night. We weren't on the right night, so I did not process this information.Billy ordered chips and salsa and a Monterrey chicken salad.( I was going to a movie so I was just going to eat some of his salad.)Copied off menu:Grilled marinated chicken atop crispy romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes, cheddar-jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, black beans, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips.Surprise surprise, the salsa had a nice kick and the salad was really good. The ranch dressing served with the salad was fattalicious! YUMMY.Judging from the remarks from other Yelpers, seems like a place, that you might want to avoid at peak hours.  But to meet a friend, sit outside, drink beer and have a snack, I was pleasantly surprised.Dear Corporate people at Taco Mac, let your servers untuck their t- shirts. Please and thank you.This is bad. This is really bad. I have a place barely a mile from my home that offers 200 bottled beers and 140 beers on tap. They have food. They have outside seating. They have inside seating. They have so many TV sets tuned to sports that you might never miss "a" game, forget about "the" game.None of the distractions like at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, this place is about the beer. Yep, the food is good too. So far, my favorite salsa in Charlotte. Also, the Turkey 'Cue sandwich is good.Parking can be a bit of a pain, since it's Piedmont Row. But that can be conquered. (It's the idiots who put their Chevy Tahoe in a "compact" space that bother me.)Let me know when you're here - I might be here too. :-)

Review Text :
Muy bien Spotted Donkey! It was by chance that I realized they opened a second location much closer to my house and I couldn't wait to check it out and see if I could finally save gas and still get the same great food. The answer is yes, yes I can! Once you enter Spotted Donkey, you'd never realize you were actually in a strip mall off Hayden. It's cozy with dark wood and a Spanish feel and it's roomy so that you don't feel cramped and like you're on top of your neighbors. The lounge to the left houses several tvs and comfortable seating and the dining room to the right houses several tables for dining. I think this would be a perfect option to bring a large group. The food was excellent and absolutely up to par with the north location. They brought out chips with three different kinds of salsa. Be warned, have your water before you take a bite because if you are a sensitive sally like me when it comes to hot sauce, you will need a sip! For a meal, I went with the Fajitas. I wish I had shared because they were hearty and filling! The only thing that would have made the meal better is if it came with beans and rice, but they did get an extra point in my book for including guacamole with the meal without charging more or having to order it on the side. The traditional margarita was spot on and one I could find myself drinking one too many of. I think the Spotted Donkey is a great option for visiting to have a couple drinks on a weekend night in the lounge, or if you want to have a dinner for two or ten in the dining room. But before I go, I have to mention the only catch of the night. Not a catch enough to make me lower the five star rating, but one worth mentioning. We went there for a leisurely dinner and were definitely not in a rush. We lingered over the menu, ordered a drink and then ordered food. Literally 5-7 minutes after ordering the food, it came out...we literally were in and out in 40 minutes. So...if you are going for a casual lingering dining experience, take your time ordering because if it's anything like my visit the food will come out fast! However, if you need a quick dining experience without sacrificing your food quality, Spotted Donkey is...spot on!Was looking for a Mexican joint on Yelp and stumbled across this place.  Since I was dining solo, I saddled up to the bar to grab some dinner.  I'm so glad I did.....here's why:+ The Cheese Enchiladas rock!  Priced at $14, they're not cheap, but they're damn good!  They have 2 sauces on them....Green and Red....they each have a distinct taste that make the dish explode with flavor in your mouth.  Awesome!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=8bxEWo47aCR19UIK3eh8DgThe sides of Beans & Pickled Carrot Salad is unique and flavorful!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=c_fS-JOQv__lXA4lLY3BRwThese were easily the best Enchiladas I've ever had.+ Decor & Atmosphere.  From what the bartender told me, it's only been open 6 months or so.  The decor is unique...I have no idea how to describe it, otherwise I would....it feels upscale and modern, let's just say that.+ Friendly employees.  Everyone was really nice and offered suggestions on the menu.+ The Chocolate Lava Cake, $8.  Ok, I wasn't going to eat dessert, but the bartender talked me into it....I'm glad he did.  It was freakin' awesome!  However, I will warn you....it' a big portion, can easily feed 2 people.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=hUdZO9aFRVVBbR_9IxQg-Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=fViTAdL3HGNICqHPwuWx9wServed hot and moist, the Chocolate Cake melts in your mouth.....when you slice your spoon through the Cake, the hot Chocolate Lava center oozes out....together with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it makes for an awesome combo!Overall, it was a great experience.  I was told they have 2 happy hours, but forgot the times....it's an early and late schedule for them....so it can cover both early birds and night owls.Return Factor - 100%I was almost ready to give Spotted Donkey the coveted 5 stars, but it occurred to me that I was most likely wanting to give that 5th star because I had not eaten anything resembling Mexican food in over a month!  So reason won and I'm going with a very strong 4.Not your typical menu of tacos and enchiladas smothered with a cup of melted cheese and swimming in grease.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Nothing beats good Sonoran fare in my book.  At Spotted Donkey you will find chimis and enchiladas on the menu, but also cornmeal crusted mahi mahi and pan roasted pork tenderloin.  We started with the chips and salsa.  I have to say I was not all that impressed with the chips.  They reminded me more of a bigger version of Fritos than a thin and crispy chip I prefer.  Served with a trio of salsas, my favorite was the charred tomato followed closely by the green tomatillo.  The pineapple habanero may have been tasty, but one bite and my tongue was so swollen I lost all sense of taste for the next 15 minutes.  My husband managed to eat a fair amount of it, however.  I attribute that to his southern roots and exposure to moonshine at the age of 6.His entree was the chipotle honey-glazed grilled salmon tostada.  With a black bean mango salsa and avocado vinaigrette, it was quite good.  The only thing negative...it was seriously undercooked in the middle.  Had it been mine, I would have sent it back.  I know there seems to be a trend of rare fish being served, but if this was intentional, the server should ask how you would like it prepared.  I smartly chose the mesquite roasted port antojito...like mini tostadas but served on a thicker corn "cake" that is fried.  The pork was perfectly lean, perfectly seasoned, and quickly devoured.For dessert we shared the ancho chile brownie sundae which was served with both hot caramel and hot fudge sauces on the side.  Expecting to prefer the chocolate sauce, I actually did not.  Although it had good flavor, the consistency was off and there was a little separation.  I am not usually a fan of caramel, but this sauce was ridiculously good, with a strong hint of salt coming through.  Had it been served with nothing but a spoon, the dessert still would have worked for me.  The ancho chile brownie was fantastic, although I maybe would have preferred just a touch more of chile in the background.  I would be hard pressed to go back and have any dessert other than this one.I loved the atmosphere at Spotted Donkey, loved the food, and had fantastic service.  The underdone fish was the only reason it didn't make the 5th star this time around, but I would definitely return.

Yummy Yummy Asian Food is now sitting in my tummy tummy.  I thought for sure I'd get the FTR on this one, but Adam and Norman beat me to the punch... I'm always excited to see new restaurants open up in my hood, especially ethnic restaurants.  So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.And when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said 'no' without even entertaining the idea.When I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn't include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn't have fortune cookies?  Anyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the "Health Food Section" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as "yummy yummy," but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  I would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie's, or Lao Thai if you're wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.

Review Text :
I have been stalking 9091 Taco (a play on the Korean "gogi") since they first started revamping the old Sexxxpresso location.   I noticed that they finally looked open for business today when I came into work, so naturally I had to stop by for lunch.Right now, it's walk-up or drive through (possible seating area to come) and their menu even says that they deliver!They do tacos, burritos, tortas, and bibimbap (listed as Bi Bop Salad on the menu).  Some items (at least the Bi Bop and Torta) appear to be served with a side of sweet potato fries.  And to clarify, I mean sweet "potato fries" not "sweet potato" fries.... more on that later.All items come with the protein of your choice (beef, chicken or tofu) and can be regular or spicy.  I asked about the veganness of the bread for tortas, but the guy wasn't sure and suggested I get the tofu Bi Bop Salad, which definitely had no animal products.  (The burrito has sour cream and cheese, but that could probably be left off.)  So, several vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. lots of meat choices, of course.The Bi Bop came with rice, lettuce, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, sprouts and marinated cubed tofu.  Served with a side of gojuchang and a sweet soy sauce and oddly, salsa.  All sauces were very good.  The "salad"didn't look like a whole lot of food, but along with the side of fries, I was pretty full at the end ($8.99 for Bi Bop, comes with fries).  So, the fries - tasty but weird.  They are super super thin cut, like matchsticks.  They are pale yellow like regular potato fries, but very sweet.  Almost like they took regular potatoes and added sugar.  It's probably some kind of yam or something though, because that would be really strange to just sugar up some potatoes.  My friend got the meat torta ($6.99)and gave it a thumbs up.  Bottom line - it was tasty and provides a nice vegan option for a quick lunch that is within walking distance for me.  I will probably be a regular customer.This is what Korean fusion should taste like.I usually like to moderate my expectations for a place that has high reviews. That wasn't the case with 9091. I was expecting great things and that's exactly what I got.They seem to have a pretty simple menu. I went with the Spicy Korean Chicken Burrito ($5.99). It was cold out, so after about a minute there waiting, the guy asks where my car is. I point to the other side of the trailer (is that a trailer?) and he says to wait in my car and he'll bring it to me. Nice!Long story short, that burrito was supremely good. Wow. Like I said, this is what I was expecting Korean fusion to taste like. I'm sorry to say (coz Ron is a nice guy) but it provided that little bit of extra flavor that I was missing from Hanshiktaco.I must return.Wow! It took having my initial review as ROTD to remind me to update.   So, yeah.  I am definitely a regular here.  The tofu tacos ($1.99 ea !) are my go-to quick lunch.  Two tacos (comes with the sweet potato fries) are enough to fill me up.  Sweet soy marinated tofu + lettuces, cilantro, and green onion in two little soft corn tortillas.  Served with the same trio of sauces (soy, gojuchang, salsa) as the bibop salad.  The guys who work there are always so friendly, and it only takes a few minutes to get my food.  Bonus, if you call ahead, they'll have it ready for you!I was happy to see something good took over the old Sexxxpresso location, which I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.This place is so good and so hilarious!  I'll explain.My first trip, I tried the spicy chicken burrito.  It's actually kind of sweet, which I wasn't expecting, but they gave me a bottle of their excellent hot sauce and that solved the problem.  It's super yummy!  It comes with avocado and a big chunk of cotija cheese in the middle.  I know the cotija cheese may sound weird, but is actually really, really good.  I talked to the nice man who took my order and he said they can make the burrito more spicy next time.While I was there, they blasted I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston, More Than Words by Extreme, and the theme song to Annie!  Crazy!  I Will Always Love You has been stuck in my head since.Next time, I tried the beef tacos and ordered them actually spicy. Which apparently means you order them regular but spicy. The tacos were also very, very good.  Overstuffed tacos with lots of cilantro and cabbage.  You can't possibly keep everything in the taco but it makes a nice little salad when stuff falls out and they give you a fork so it's all good!  The friendly man taking orders came out and gave me a mixture of jalapenos, celery, and soy sauce to put on my tacos.  Very yummy and not overpoweringly spicy.The music... they blasted Creep by TLC and, again, I Will Always Love You!  Nooooo!  Just when I got it out my head, now it's back.  :)They are open 10am until 10pm... 9pm during winter.  Closed on Sunday.  This would be a great late night drunk place.  I can totally see myself trashed at 3am belting out I Will Always Love You while eating beef tacos.  But alas, not open that late.  I'll have to start getting drunk during the day.The only thing I didn't really like is the sweet potato strings that come with each order.  Maybe I'm on sweet potato overload since it seems to be so common now.  But the sweet potato strings definitely are not the focus.  Go for the tacos and burritos for sure.  I'll definitely be back. As often as I can.

Review Text :
And now, a love letter. Dear Nostrano, I'm in love. Your space is architecturally stimulating and brings together a carefully thought out blend of wood, metal and glass into a cozy destination right for any engagement. Sitting at the bar is bomb, but the tables are equally pleasant. As for cocktails, your fall tonic is everything I love about autumn minus the crunchy leaves and oblong gourds. It's spicy. It's sweet. It's refreshing. It's deep. Please keep this little guy around. Your orecchiette, ohhhhh your orecchiette. It's firm but not tough and stands up to the amazing blend of brussel sprouts, parsnips and fennel sausage. The fact that it's finished with shaved goats milk cheese makes it (apologies to my favorite house-made pasta and sausage making machine Chef Ginny Wooters) the best... THE BEST I've yet to encounter. And dessert? That's when like turned into love. Take two acclaimed pasty chefs from Chicago and put them under one roof and YOU MUST GET DESSERT, it just has to happen. Priced higher than one might expect, but for good reason. They are visual works of art, and from a taste perspective, dynamic and intriguing. My caram√©lia chocolate cream with raspberries, toasted brioche gelato, hibiscus and smoked almonds was pretty much one of the best desserts I think I've ever eaten. It was incredible. Just incredible. And so Nostrano, I hope this is the start of a beautiful relationship. Keep making unbelievably tasty things and I will forever be in love. Yours today, tomorrow and forever,Corey DI love lamb. Not to be confused with I love lamp.But let's start at the beginning. The marinated olives and sourdough focaccia was the perfect starter. What looks to be normal bread is actually a tasty homemade loaf of deliciousness that you can dip in marinated olives. Who needs a plain plate of olive oil when you can dip it into actual olive juice with tasty olive treats.I was very excited to see Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb rag√π. The pappardelle noodles were fresh and al dente, just the way they should be served. The lamb ragu was incredibly flavorful with the whole dish looking small but being incredibly filling to the point where I couldn't finish it all. But then there's dessert...I was full, but that didn't mean I couldn't indulge in a little sweets action. I mean, c'mon. We ordered up the Affogato (caramel gelato, sea salt, espresso, bombolini). I would have never thought to put gelato in a pool of warm espresso, but hey, that's why I'm an awful baker (and cook for that matter). The gelato ran into the espresso and made a dreamy concoction that could satisfy you alone. But no, there's more. Served on the side are four tiny sugared donuts. Added dipping bonus round! I also thought it was nice that this restaurant doesn't scream Italian. It doesn't have pictures of granny's making pasta or vines of grapes hanging from the walls. It's modern, sleek and clean. Perfect for lunch, dinner or dessert. Like... you should go in for all three because you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't!Truly a fine dining experience here every visit. Madison is fortunate to have such a lovely restaurant.Locally sourced ingredients, and a nice balance of interesting dishes that include rarity items like wild game sausage. I love that they make every dish a unique blend of ingredients.Really, though, don't we all visit here for the desserts? I've read the chefs are married and the better half of this dynamic duo is baking her amazing creations downstairs while he runs the main kitchen, which you can catch glimpses of from the bar.I have but one complaint, which is they do not have decaf espresso. I realize this is an oxymoron for many who may read this review, but there is a famous dessert with caramel gelato, swimming in espresso, in which I would love to indulge, but the caffeine would put me over the edge. My server says many patrons request decaf. It is unfortunate they cannot oblige.Oh, and we also visit for the clever craft cocktails and creative mixologists.A recent visit during Madison Restaurant Week, winter 2015, proved to be a lovely way to spend part of a dreary afternoon enjoying a 3-course, perfectly portioned lunch, for only $15.Finally, I will mention some folks will find the menu a bit intimidating. I admit I usually Google at least one listed ingredient during each visit. I suggest jumping into the menu with both feet. You will not be disappointed!Returned to Nostrano last night with part of the ladies progressive dinner. I picked Nostrano because of the excellent experience that I had before. This time, I was embarrassed that I suggested the place. While the dessert was as good as I remembered it, the service was odd and occasionally downright rude. Our server did not know the menu and all we were having was dessert and drinks. He couldn't answer questions about drinks, such as "What is this?"  He recommended a drink for another in our party and described it as smooth and extremely palatable. When it arrived, it was anything but smooth, instead it was extremely medicinal and sharp. This is fine if that's what you were expecting but she was not. We also had people in our party that has some dietary restrictions and they were really unaccommodating. For example, I ordered the Affogato and asked to go easy on the espresso as I'm pregnant. He told me flat out no. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes. He did offer to serve it on the side, however I was just stunned. For such a lovely establishment to be so unaccommodating. It was more like the service that you would get a Dick's Last Resort. You know, where you pay them to be mean to you.When I have been to Nostrano on a weekend night, when they are much busier, I have received exceptional service. It seemed as if they have their B squad out on week nights. I'm still disappointed thinking about it. In short, I felt like an inconvenience the entire time I was there and like they don't want my business.

"RED VELVET PANCAKE?  OH...HELL NO!"The menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=L04CYf9iZEDwFairvDQFIQWhen I saw that popular item on the menu, I did actually shout out loud and created a troubling scene in front of many patrons and a dirty look in front of the owner, who was also there dining with her family.After that unnecessary outburst, I settled down and ordered the full stack of the Red velvet Pancake for $7.95. The full stack of the red color pancake had six red slices with mini chocolate chips, a thick cloud of whipped cream as the topping and two cups warm cream cheese syrup on the side. My pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=3ms4kj7wayMeLFKfxJpb1QI got to tell you that this cute little caf√© is one-hour away from downtown Las Vegas; the red velvet pancake is definitely worth the drive. I have never had any pancake as good as this. The whipped cream is thick and the cream cheese syrup is very unique and adds the exciting taste. This caf√© is only open for breakfast and lunch. The caf√© is also located west of the Las Vegas medical facility. The one-hour drive is definitely worth it. And I might do it again and try the other flavored pancakes and American and Filipino cuisines.I was skeptical this place would live up to the hype, but OMG did it ever! The 30 minute drive from my house, the 40 minute wait, all freaking worth it. This will never be a regular spot for me (5000 calories for bfast isn't a habit I need to get into!), but for a special breakfast this is the best place I've been off the strip in Vegas (sorry, Bouchon is still my overall fav!). They get major props for letting you pay a minimal charge to upgrade to the "specialty' pancakes when ordering any of the egg dishes. Honestly the smaller (2?) portion of these sweet things is perfect and it's nice to have an egg dish AND a dessert to go with it ! I had the breakfast burrito (special from the chalk board) and red velvet pancakes. The breakfast burrito wasn't much of a burrito (well not in a stupidly huge Chipotle sense), but more of a large taco. This was absolutely perfect for me - huge burritos are a turn off and I don't like the ingredient ratio you get with this burrito the size of your face. Burrito (bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes) was perfect, but the red velvet pancakes did steal the show! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Ridiculously fluffy, perfect red velvet flavor - you must try these !My husband has a certain fondness for chicken fried steak and sausage gravy. He's tried it everywhere here in town from Tiffany's to all the casino diners. He's always bummed that it's not nearly as good as what he's used to from TX. This place was by far the best we've had in Vegas and might be better than any in TX as well. The steak was tender (not chewy and gross), the batter was nice, and OMG the gravy was perfect. It seemed to not be frozen, or they buy an incredibly high quality frozen product - either way, they fooled me. Tasted homemade! He had the smores pancakes that were tasty, but not nearly as good as the Red Velvet!!I never thought I'd find a local place with BETTER pancakes than my favorite (Oreo Banana Pancakes at Bongo Room in Chicago, btw), but honestly they were! I'd put this breakfast spot up against any diner, anywhere. I'd love to see them add some coffee drinks to the menu (oh and expand to Henderson!).Came to pay another visit to this up and coming spot!  I kept blabbing about the red velvet pancakes to my girl and  convinced her that it was worth a try (she's not much of a foodie.. yet!) Got here before noon and was seated right away. I couldn't help notice this lady that was seated right next to me. She looked so familiar.. Well, it was my first invited friend on Yelp! She provides some of the most interesting reviews: Blair B.! Hi Blair! And Megan S., nice meeting you as well! What a small world..The Belly Pleasers:Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Came neatly plated, corned beef was the typical canned stuff but for being canned, it was satisfying. I must note that I do prefer the real stuff (shredded/chunky) but their stuff did have a slight advantage over almost identical looking corned beef I've eaten at other places before. There maybe something with the oil the cook it in or some special seasoning they throw on there?! I also decided to try their seasoned potatoes. They looked plain but once again, they were tastier than I expected. Results, Nothing over the top but I was happily filled up!*Chicken Fried Steak with Hash, still Reigns Supreme!Carrot Pancakes: I wanted to try something different, since my girl ordered the obvious red velvet pancakes that she wasn't gonna finish and scoot over my way anyways.. The carrot pancakes came with the same cream cheese syrup, nuts sprkinkled on top, had the same texture as the velvets and tasted good, borderline great.. BUT in no way compared to the Red Velvet Pancakes!!Red Velvet Pancakes: my girl ordered the short stack (3 pieces). She took a few bites but didn't really express her emotions much but I could tell by her facial reactions that it was captivating! She finished more than half the order, more than I expected and said "they were delicious! I really liked the little sprinkled mini chocolate chips and the whipped cream".. Another happy customer :).. Round 2: Everything was pretty much as Great as the 1st Time!Oh my it was brunch time and still crackalizing! If you didn't understand that, it was packed! I wouldn't really suggest coming here in groups bigger than 4. Although, I'm sure you can it'll jus be a longer wait. I ordered the Kalua pig Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the adobo omelette. And together we ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes as a dessert. That's how we get to try a little bit of every goodness. The kalua Benedict was perfect the way it was made. The yoke breaking over the meat and the crispy edges of the meat added a smokey hint to it. I tried some of the adobo omelet and it was good, but I've had bigger for the same price at aloha kitchen. On the other hand, the macaroni salad that came with it was unique with it's hint of crab meat. The red velvet pancakes was the perfect puzzle piece for my belly's satisfaction with it's sweet cream cheese syrup. The service was on point and friendly. The parking is plenty. Be aware, it's disguised in an industrial area.I am most certainly filled and ready to come back to try the s'more pancakes.I am not usually a fan of pancakes, but this changed my mind wholly! The best breakfast place I've ever tried, and the most creative! Everyone must try the Red Velvet Pancakes once in their lives! It's a must!!! Ps. Be sure to have patience on the day of because there might be a waiting list for a table!Stopped by to grab some lunch with my Mom the other day.  I've read many of the Yelp reviews raving about the Red Velvet Pancakes and had to experience this for myself.  Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.I ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).The food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.I then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.Mom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.Our server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.Will I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me.....When Babycakes Cafe first opened in October, we were invited to join the Husband's cousins in experiencing this new breakfast joint.  Unfortunately, we couldn't make it out that morning but heard raving reviews from them and soon after, it was blowing up on Yelp!  It's been on our radar since, and when a groupon for Babycakes showed up, we scooped up on this coupon!Yesterday was the big day - most importantly, we wanted to avoid the weekend rush.  Reviews about an hour long wait weren't something we were interested in, and luckily, it was only a ten minute wait for our party of three on a Wednesday around noon.We decided to share three items that were unique to Babycakes Cafe than other breakfast joints in town.* Red Velvet Pancakes "Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles.  Served with cream cheese syrup." (Full stack $7.95, Short stack $5.25) - First off, I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes and it's not my first choice in breakfast.  But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice! * Kalua Pig Benedict "A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce." ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though. * Rick's Adobo Fried Rice "A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions." ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.Overall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.Service - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups.The cousins and I ordered:1.)  RED VELVET    7.95 (FULL) 5.25 (SHORT)Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup.This tasted super delicious.  It wasn't too fluffy nor was it heavy.  Normally when I eatpancakes from other establishments, I feel very heavy.  The combination of the whipped cream with the chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup blended well together.2.)  RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE  8.50A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.I thought it was just okay.  I wasn't too much of a fan with the egg since it had no flavor to it.  My cousin said that because the Adobo Fried Rice already has enough flavor, to add sodium to the egg would just possibly be too salty.  I think I would just like the Adobo Fried Rice without the egg wrapped around it.3.)  KALUA PIG BENEDICT  9.75A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and our delicious hollandaise sauce.This was my favorite.  I would come back here for this because I just love Eggs Benedict.  The taste of the Kalua Pig gave it a flavor that matched well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  A lot of people on Yelp felt that it was too bland.  I found adding some salt to the dish pepped that up.  4.) NUTELLA CREPES  8.25 plain or 9.25 (with seasonal strawberries)Nutella mixed filling spread topped with fresh whipped cream and almonds.  This was definitely a great way to end our meal.  It wasn't too overpowering with the Nutella and had the right amount in the crepe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but this was well done.  It doesn't look too hard to make.We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)-Red Velvet-S'Mores-PB & Jelly-Lemon Ricotta-Carrot Cake-Bacon Pancakes-Whole Wheat~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself "Why cabbage?" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!! A Hui HoRED VELVET PANCAKES with whip cream and mini chocolate chips!! I'm a sucker for red velvet pancakes!Finally went to Babycakes this past Friday :DMy friend/high school classmate was visiting from Florida so I wanted to take him to a yummy breakfast spot! I've been wanting to try Babycakes for the last 2 months and have been waiting for someone to visit me in town so I could experience Babycakes with someone else. I didn't realize that Babycakes is 8 miles north of me... but it was worth the drive!Came in around 10am... no wait.We both ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice... I got the red velvet pancakes and my friend got the white chocolate chip mac nut pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and you can't go wrong with the local favorite portuguese sausage eggs and rice.I would love to come back again... when more friends visit me in town again. Pay your bill at the counter. casual dining. stress free parking. good customer service.If you're visiting Vegas or a local... make Babycakes on your to eat list!I'll be back for more!!!Aloha...-Miss Yelp 2011Are you of Filipino or Asian descent....and you want some pancakes? Well then, Babycakes Cafe is for you!  The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?Babycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your "What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.We meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!I just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.On to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  The food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!Babycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!We'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?Go here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.  Another reason to visit sooner!Bookmarked forever.  Read a ton of reviews.  It's like a group mantra.  RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP.We were so excited to finally come here and it lived up to the hype.  Got the large stack of RVP and an order of their homemade corned beef hash which came with eggs and home fries along with a short stack of S'mores.  Is this breakfast or dessert?Holy pancake overload, Batman!  Everything was delicious.  My wife said it was the best corn beef hash she had ever eaten.  We finished everything and went into a  total food coma.  3pm turned into nap time and I don't think we had dinner that night.  Not sure if it was the carb overload or the sugar crash or both but wow.I'm gonna do something eggy next time with a short stack so it doesn't kill me for the rest of the day.  This place is definitely worth the trip though.  Friendly staff!It's too bad my new favorite breakfast place is in Nevada.  I'll have to visit this place every time I'm in Vegas.  It's worth waking up for.  It's worth driving to.  And it's worth the wait.  Everything I tasted was phenomenal. The Red Velvet Pancake was out of this world!  The cream cheese syrup with buttery whipped cream really made this velvety pancake unforgettable.  I can have this for breakfast everyday! I thought their Rocky Road pancake would be too sweet.  It was perfect! Impressive that almonds and marshmallows were inside the chocolate batter as well as on top.As a peanut butter fan, I went bananas for my PBand??? pancake.  With peanut butter in and out of the pancake, I can taste how any topping would go well with this pancake.  Elvis would be proud!  He'd probably be here everyday too!  I had an omelet with ground beef, bacon, cilantro, and green onion.  It was like a marriage made in heaven.  Every flavor came out and I enjoyed every bite!  The Adobo Fried Rice was amazing too.  With marinated shredded chicken mixed with rice AND wrapped in four eggs, this unique omelet is definitely something to brag about.  Service was flawless, even with a long wait.  Their large size cups are ingenious for less frequent refills (for water, orange juice, soda).  But the coffee kept coming.    Can't wait to come back for more of their fresh pancake creations and other breakfast specialties.I've been a few times with the BF since my initial review and it's slowly crept up into a favorite breakfast spot for us. Firstly, I'm a Filipino so any place that has steamed or garlic rice is cool by my standards. This is a cool inbetween middle of Hawaiian breakfast and American style breakfast that is similar to what we would have at home. It's the varied options that bumps this place for us. I cannot eat pancakes alone for breakfast as it just is too much, too sweet, so it never seems worth it for us to get a full order at many places and they don't do short stacks of flavored ones. Here, many of the breakfast come with a option of a "babystack" (2 pancakes) and you can upgrade it to the many gourmet flavors for just $1.50 more. That amount with a savory breakfast seems perfect and costwise is great to get breakfast AND the flavored pancakes for under $10. Most places we would have to basically order pancakes as our third entree plate and that's usually too much to eat without others sharing.I tend to favor their omelettes, as they are pretty fluffy and a good size or I let my Filipino all hang out and get a simple breakfast eggs and sausage type plate with rice.Our go-to pancake flavor is the lemon ricotta. This one is a bit more crepe or german pancake like and is just very light in flavor. Lemon flavored sweets is a new thing for me, and this place definitely has helped convert me We normally get another rich flavor to contrast. However, the chocolately type pancakes here are not overly saccharine and dense. We had a almond joy flavor recently off their specials and it was fluffy, and just deliciously balanced. Nothing richly sweet like the chocolate bars. Chocolate pancakes is one of my least favorite kinds, but theirs is highly enjoyable for me. I've had their famous red velvet before, and honestly, every other flavor I've had surpassed that one so don't be afraid to delve out of the box. Service has been pretty decent of a range of acceptable to great. It's always at least friendly consistently. We go during the afternoon mostly, so it's never been a wait but is busy. I'm not sure if this place is packed with a waiting during usual breakfast hours on weekends, but I imagine so. If you don't like waits, well breakfast at breakfast time is maybe not a good thing to do.I have yet to try some of the specialties like the kahlua benedict, but mostly because I have trouble thinking about coming here and not getting a pancake. They sound great though that it just might be worth it! In fact, I think I may go this weekend again. I've been on a big breakfast kick lately since we've been waking up early.I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the "Banana Cream Pie" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on "Carot Cakes" and "PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested "Portuguese Sausage And Eggs". He said they have a "Garlic Rice" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. They have a great kids menu at affordable prices.Please don't hate me, but I think BabyStacks is a bit over-rated.  It is a good diner but I don't think it blew my socks off at all.I have heard a lot about BabyStacks and I am always reminded when I drive past it at least once a week.  I am a devoted patron to a different local breakfast dinner and usually go there for breakfast.  We wanted to try something different, so we headed over to try BabyStacks.Our first mistake was getting there at 10:30am on a Sunday.  Oops and here comes a 45 minute wait.  That was self-inflicted pain, but we dealt with it.  Since we had a long wait, we had already checked out the menu and figured out what we wanted.  The menu has a lot of variety and definitely something for everybody.  This is always nice because I know we can never agree on food at my house.  They have your normal breakfast items like egg dishes, biscuits and gravy, and of course a multitude of pancake choices.  They also have a decent lunch menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  On top of all of that, they have Hawaiian food on the menu.  Like I said, something for everyone.I wasn't in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat, so I went with Loco Moco.  It was good, but not great.  It totally hit the spot for my craving, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It came with a side of mac salad and it was really pretty bland, in my opinion. The first time I had Loco Moco was in Maui, so I am probably ruined since I compare everyone's version to the first one, and few compare.   So it was good, but not great.My hubby got a breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage.  It was a huge burrito and he was only able to eat about 2/3 of it.  It also came with a side of regular pancakes.  The pancakes were ok, but again, nothing special.  Overall, his breakfast was ok and pretty average.My mini me got the kid's grilled cheese and it was an awesome grilled cheese.  It was super gooey and overflowing with cheesy goodness.  Now I know what you are going to say, "Why didn't you try the fancy, smancy pancakes?" Well, I wasn't in the mood, so there.  Maybe this is why I am only giving it a 3 star rating and didn't get my socks blown off..  We do plan on checking it out again when we are craving pancakes and maybe it will be better next time.  For just regular breakfast food though, I think I will stick with my go-to place around the corner.  Based on this experience though, everything was ok.  The service was ok, the food was ok, and the prices were ok.It's been a while since my last visit so I was enthusiastic to return to BabyStacks Cafe. I was headed  west to visit a client so this was the ideal to have some bfast. I was greeted and seated immediately but unfortunately I had to flag a waitress down to finally place my order for coffee and a Kula pig Benedict. When my entree arrived I sampled the benedict which was stellar! The kula pig had a smoked flavor and contained green cabbage which harmonized superbly with the medium cooked eggs and hollandaise sauce.I also noticed they offer Loco moco on the menu. My mouth is watering while writing this and looking forward to returning!Don't be scared off by the ridiculous wait times: we were told it would be 45 minutes, but we were seated in 15! Service is friendly and quick, but once they give you your bill make sure you head to the front to cash out- the servers don't do that part.KAHLUA PORK BENEDICT: Didn't care for the cabbage, found the pork itself a little bland, but somehow all the flavors together really made a great dish. Wish the potatoes had just a touch more seasoning, but they were perfectly crisp.HUNTINGTON SKILLET: Seasoned potatoes topped with over-easy eggs, bacon, cheese, pico de gallo, AND avocado?! It's a party in your mouth, no additional seasoning needed. WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES: These are so sweet, you wont even need the syrup. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish a short stack they were so sugary. Didn't detect any macadamia flavor or crunch, though.GARLIC RICE: Love how fragrant this dish is! Smelled it cooking and had to have some, definitely tempted to upgrade to the adobo fried rice next visit.The thing that really amazed me was that none of the food we received was unnecessarily greasy, a common issue with breakfast/diner food. If you want to come here, better to go early (before 10) or wait til lunch- the place really cleared out by 11:30AM. Really liked the friendly island-style service, want to come back for the Kahlua grilled cheese.

Y'all don't know good eatin' 'til you stopped at Jamburritos!  My tastebuds died, went to heaven.  I'm a southerner.  I DO NOT, I DO NOT, order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south.  It just doesn't happen.  Something about folks in other states putting beer batter or breadcrumbs or  flour based breading on it that runs me outta the restaurant.  But I figured, this Mex-Cajun fusion way would  be something to try.  I ordered a fried catfish jamburrito... that's fried catfish, with jambalaya (2 staples in my kitchen) and all the other fixin's of a burrito.  I got the fire hot sauce on the side and I also ordered up the hush puppies.  They had Faygo pops (yep, I said "Pops", that's cause I'm from the South.  If you're from other southern regions, you might call it a "cold drink".) That took me back years to my childhood and I ordered up the orange Faygo.  Whoop Whoop!  So, what does this southerner say?  They killed it.  The hush puppies were absolutely delicious.  A bit on the small side in comparison to what I'm accustomed to having back home.  But exactly the taste you want in a hush puppy!  WOW.  I'm bringing my mom to the truck, I bet she hasn't cooked hush puppies since I was a kid.  The Jamburrito was something out of this world.  The taste of the jambalaya in every bite of the catfish was an amazing mixture of spiciness with the delicious cajun flavor of the rice.  And don't forget that there's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito.  The lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce.  if you don't like spicy, don't get the hot sauce on yours. Here's a pic of my plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix?select=xh1Ac9X35EPQywGj9QZbnA#7gSc9b6Jr19CHMRtb40tmAWhat a creative fusion of the Mexican burrito and cajun food.  I was so satisfied and  thrilled with the tastes and flavors.  I have to go back and try their friend crawfish and perhaps some other things that will take me down the Mississippi river of memories... Bravo Jamburritos!  Bravo.

Review Text :
The wife and I dined here for dinner on 8/9/11. Ordered Fried Pickles ($4) and Pork Buns ($6) for appetizers, the Graze Burger ($19!!) and the Burger of the week ($15), fries with both entrees.This was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity-est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal.First impressions- No reservations needed- cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy- very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor- seemed like they were trying for an artsy/modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. Service was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry & we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally.  After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good.  The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet (on Broadway) back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again.  The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'.  At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees.After what felt like forever (but was probably about 30 more minutes), our burgers & fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries.  My burger was the Graze burger (fresh ground sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche) The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun & caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese (even though we are in the dairy state), but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste & texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the $19 hamburger. $19!! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way.The wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast.  She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. I know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do- the french fries were very good. So there you have it. $46.42 (after tax)  for some darn good fries. Not what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. An expensive lesson learned.Oh Graze.Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze. When we met, I was certain I was going to like you. I needed to have brunch, cocktails, dinner then lunch, cocktails, cocktails and cocktails, but I was pretty certain after my first trip we'd be close. And we are. I love the space; modern, but not annoyingly so. I love the situation behind the bar; boozy drinks that are "spirit forward" (heeeeey Tom). Bevies please those with a hankering for sweet or spicy and they don't cost an arm and a leg. (I mentioned they're boozy, yes?) Oh, and the food I've had their has been ta-heh-sty.Burger = YUM. YUM. Perfectly cooked, hard to find... I find in Madison. Corned Beef Hash = Hash yeah!Fish Fry = Panko? Yes, please. Chicken Skewers = Perfecto!Anything on the cocktail menu! Anything.Fried Pickles = Huuuuuuuuge deliciously breaded fried bits of joy. Service is always awesome. ALWAYS. And although it can be a little while for a table at din-din, staff is super nice about keeping you informed re: the wait sich. I'm going to miss sitting outside on the patio while it's cold, it's lovely out there.As an out-of-towner whose knowledge of Wisconsin is confined to the Mars Cheese Castle, (where you'd think there would be a king and queen, but nope, not even a prince) A&W Root Beer, (in the tall frosty mugs of course) and Culver's... this trip to the midwest is to discover some of the best the region has to offer (and to attend a wedding).Upon the recommendation of a college buddy of mine that now resides in Madison, I decided to check out Graze.  With an impressive dedication to local sourcing and regional ingredients, this restaurant across the street from the capitol is clean, chic, and well-managed.I checked in at the hostess stand and requested a table for two.  They did a good job managing expectations, let me know it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  We were seated in about 30 minutes.We got a booth and were immediately waited on and served water.  Our appetizer order was taken right away since we knew what we wanted, a very good sign.  Our waters were never less than half filled and the service was impeccable.  Not too much attention, not too little.Coming into Wisconsin, I had two must-haves, cheese curds and fried pickles.  This meal would satisfy both those cravings.We started with the Fried Sassy Cow Cheese Curds, a quintessential Wisconsin food.  Deep fried and ooey gooey delicious, these vodka battered treats hit the spot after flying for 12 hours.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7EbwThen came the fried pickles, always a winner.  Although not spears, these were very thick cut chips, good enough.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ybbedyV4NXfunWXFYd4QZQOther yelp reviews guided me to the seasonal punch.  This did not disappoint.  This season's concoction is peach mixed with Door County Vodka.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ndQ7vK4Ilig01Tt0eNlnKQNext we had a taste of Korea in Chicago.  Wait. What. Korean food in Chicago? Dat don't make sense.  But it was pretty good.  I feel the regional ingredients really help this dish out (and a generous helping of kochujang sauce).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#qEI2dTuN_t_7AbVR0wO35ABut let's be honest.  The star of the show here is the $21 Graze Burger.  Yes, you heard me right, I paid $21 in the midwest for a burger.  Ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye and short rib, with caramelized onions, a cabernet jus, a sesame seed brioche, and some fries. Daaaaamn this was delicious.  Call me a heffer, I will GRAZE on this all day.  Although the price was steep, best burger of my life.  Hand's down.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#bxmvvO3M7cCWfgMaH_2kSwA great way to start off #ChuggyEatsMidwest2013 on IG and Twitter.  Off to the next recommended eatery!Graze is one of the most acclaimed restaurants in Madison, with very good reason. It's the less formal (and less expensive) sister restaurant of L'Etoile, which is right next door, and just steps from the Capitol. Graze (so named for the farming aspect as well as what the menu inspires guests to do) is less formal, but just as much creativity and attention to detail go into everything on the menu. It's the kind of place you'd go just for drinks or food, and stay for the other. During a recent thirty-six hour stay in Madison, we went twice; once for early-evening cocktails and snacks, the other for a mid-afternoon nosh. It was close to our hotel, but proximity aside, we went back because we just enjoyed it that much.I can't say enough good things about the fantastic food and terrific cocktails. Over the course of two visits we were able to sample quite a bit of the menu and there wasn't anything we didn't love. On the evening visit we tried Sassy Cow cheese curds with a vodka batter; deviled eggs, house-made pickles (beets, cucumbers, escabeche, daikon, kimchee), truffled popcorn, frites with garlic aioli, and fresh oysters with just-grated horseradish. Everything was eminently enjoyable. My cocktail of choice was the 'Herb 'n Cruise,' a tasty concoction of New Amsterdam gin, Lillet, basil simple syrup and lemon. It was so smooth and drinkable. Later on I switched to a non-alcoholic seasonal lemonade and this week's flavor was blueberry-rhubarb. So fruity and refreshing!On the second visit, they were still serving their brunch menu so we just shared a lox and bagel plate (and more of that delicious lemonade!) and that too was top-notch. The bagel was an "everything," the cream cheese was flecked with bits of fresh lemon zest and dill, and the lox was in the shape of a rosette. On the side was a tiny dish of capers and red onion. It was a lovely presentation and tasted as good as it looked.The servers here are some friendly folk and took great care of us on both visits. The menu changes seasonally and it goes without saying that all the ingredients are locally sourced.Graze is now on our "must-visit" list for frequent trips to Madison.My go to spot for brunchGraze has won me over.  My first couple visits were less than memorable - I could see the potential in the menu, but the execution left something to be desired.  But over the past year, the consistency kitchen and the service has improved considerably and Graze has been coronated as The Emperor of Madison Brunch until further notice.  After a recent trip to the Madison Farmer's Market, my wife and I decide the dodge the rain drops and grab some morning vittles (and libations).  There are a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to set up camp at the bar.  The bartenders promptly welcomed us and took our drink order.   I tried the Retox (Cacha√ßa, Maple Syrup, lemon juice, cayenne) and my better half went with the Bloody Mary.  At first I was neutral on the Retox, but it eventually won my over as the Cacha√ßa (a liquor made from fermented sugarcane juice) cleared the fog from a soggy slog around the square.  The Bloody Mary was a little heavy on the horseradish for my taste, but my dining companion was very impressed.As for the culinary component, I elected to try something new and ordered the Chicken-Fred steak.  Instead of the usual cream-based sauce, this version had a excellent brown sauce with a hint of sage which complimented the steak, which was top notch, it had a nice crunch, but not greasy.  The rest of te dish was satisfying as well.  Some lightly dressed grape tomatoes, crispy hash browns and two eggs easy over that were perfectly executed.    Portion size was just right - I cleaned my plate and felt satiated, but not bloated.  We finished off our brunch date with an order of the beignets, and their pillowy goodness was the perfect finish to an excellent meal.While the meal was a bit on the pricey side for brunch ($55 for two drinks, two entrees and a dessert), we both felt the value of the meal exceeded the price.There have been some complaints about the service at Graze, but the bar staff was courteous and attentive during our meal.  Despite a full house in a relatively open space, the noise level was not too bad - it was easy to carry on a conversation.I also appreciate how Graze uses locally sourced products from area farms to create its menu.  As long as they can continue to effective execute the vision of Chef Tory Miller, they will continue to be my go-to option for brunch.We were here for lunch on a Thursday, right when they opened at 11 - first customers! (We were literally standing outside the door waiting for them to open shop :)I went with the Korean Rice Bowl, which consisted of a glazed pork belly, kimchee (fermented Korean-style vegetables), mini cool cucumbers, and peanuts. It tasted decent. I think that I may have liked how it looked, more than how it tasted. The kimchee was a little too pickley/salty-tasting for my liking.We also ordered their famous Pub Burger that's served on a house-made english muffin with bacon and cheddar cheese. That was definitely yummy.The farmer john's sandwich of ham and provolone cheese with sliced apple, spinach, and basil pesto mayo on sliced baguette was pretty good, as was the soup that came alongside (can't remember what it was...it was the special of the day).The overall atmosphere of the place was great. Very clean, updated, and cheery with the natural light from State Street shinning in. Their hot tea selection is plentiful and the Rishi brand that they sell is quality.  Our waiter was very accommodating and considerate as well.I hope to try out their offerings for brunch sometime soon as I hear that's pretty good!A big fan or Tory Miller and what he's done for the Madison foodie scene, I was pumped when he opened this place!  Killer spot on the square with awesome views and fresh urban "farm to table" type decor.  The focus is just good quality seasonal food!  We had the pickle sampler for an appetizer and it was fantastic, inventive, and fun.  The graze burger was out of this world, and I had the pulled pork macaroni and cheese which was equally amazing.  The last time we visited I felt like they were short staffed so I will give them a little lee-way on timely service, but the quality was there.  The bartenders are always great with an ever changing drink menu...and the bar area is a great place to see and be seen!Corey D and I headed here for a late-ish dinner during my quick trip to Madison and boy, this place was hoppin'! With good reason I see... The food is delish, the service is friendly, the drinks are creative, and starting at 9 pm Sundays through Thursdays they have a buy 1, get 1 happy hour. I had fried pickles, cheese curds, and a beet salad and I would be a happy camper to return here and eat again. Bonus: they have wine on tap which is always a good thing in my opinion.Definitely well worth a try if you are in Madison and looking for good food + good drinks.Best cheese curds in Madison. Hands down.Best brunch in Madison??? Perhaps!Man, I'm lovin me that fried chicken and waffle. Chicken. Waffle. Perfection.But dude the seasonal fruit pancakes with apple cherry compote and cinnamon butter....umm, I'll take an extra order to go...If you're feeling traditional, don't worry you can get your eggs and bacon. Uh huh.I was feeling indecisive amongst my Madison bookmarks and proferred the wife to make a selection amongst my selections. I hardly had to spit out the word Graze and its connotations before she made that her choice. I didn't complain; a bit of homework led me to understand that Graze is run by a Bearded chef. That's Beard, as in James Beard. Shaken, not stirred.Graze sits a modest, modernist glass case of emotion directly across from the Capitol. It's connected to its sister restaurant, the starry-eyed named L'Etoile. The view from either is quite spectacular.Of course, a place that calls itself Graze screams farm to table, though exactly what farms are left unclear by the menu. The menu, like the chef-owner, has a Korean slant to it, with Wisconsin farm overtones. It also has a $21 burger purported to be one of the best in America.It is perhaps unfair that I had just eaten the best burger in Chicago, the meticulously simple concoction at Au Cheval. So, and especially for a Jackson plus Washington, there was barely a chance for Graze's burger to equate. Graze's burger is good, and there are parts that are great--the tangy caramelized onions, the delicious on-the-side aioli, and the wonderful fried egg I stole from my wife's bibimbap bowl.Here's where it falls short. The first is the at times delicious and at other times overtly sour-acidic patty. It's a combination of bacon, sirloin, ground beef, and short rib, and if you just drooled on your phone or computer screen a little, it's OK. That all sounds as mouth-watering as it should, but the patty was a little too big, didn't hold together well enough, and was splashed with just too much Worcestershire-cabernet jus, killing the proper taste of the meat. The second is the fact that the burger plain done fell apart, whether from too much jus, too much meat, or my daft idea that a stolen fried egg would be the cherry on top. Burgers. Shouldn't. Fall. Apart. Period. (And if they do, as in they are meant to, you had better dang well wrap the sucker in white paper first.)Extremely high expectations for the burger aside, the meal went really well. The cheese curds, a delicacy we had to order, this being Wisconsin and all, were fantastic. Special kudos to the house ranch that tasted a mite like tartar sauce, a plus for me. The pickle board was also a great deal of fun, with six different pickled plates ranging from kimchi to beets in a citrus vinaigrette. Yes, kimchi--remember the Korean thing. As we hadn't had Korean food during our duration in Chicago, now approaching eight months, the wife narrowed in on the bibimbap bowl. The gochujang and its spiciness set her back a bit, but the bowl was chock full of fresh, delicious vegetables and marvelous blocks of crispy fried rice. Even at its price point, the bibimbap was tasty and impressive.Too full for dessert, I'll call the night here. Graze is a great space with charming, inviting decor and a solid wait staff. If the burger had been mindblowingly good and worth the price tag, this would be a five-star review. But like I said, it was a high bar to reach, and a fantastic meal nonetheless.Fresh. Local. Seasonal. Delicious!Graze is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. I love the emphasis on supporting local farmers and using fresh ingredients.The food is flavorful and nicely plated. Everything I've tried has been great. The burger is juicy and delicious.  The bibimbap was superb and spicy. Every bite is like a party in your mouth!  The drinks here are amazing! My favorite drink at the moment is the springing in the rain drink. The cucumber is very refreshing.This is also a great place for brunch. The scramblers are delicious, and the Bloody Mary's are loaded with goodies!Dear Graze, I am SO mad at you! We have encountered one another twice so far--and you never meet up to the hype. No one would write a letter to another person like that, so continuing... I haven't heard a bad thing about Graze from any of the locals. It's beautiful, everyone seems to love it. The first time I went, I had the bibimbap bowl. It tasted like kimchi and that's about it, so if you like kimchi then go for it! I don't crave fermented cabbage on the daily, so it would have been more appetizing to me if there were more flavor profiles. Aside from this, the rest of our experience was pretty "meh." Nothing to write home about. Service, cheese board... Meh.The second time I went, the food was better, but the service was out the window. We sat for upwards of 25 minutes before being greeted by our server, who I had been watching the whole time to see if she would notice our empty table. (Yeah, I'll creep like that when I've been waiting for 5 minutes already.) I had to go back to the host table to get the ball rolling, and then we waited for another 7 minutes before she came over. Not sorry--this is inexcusable. If you go for brunch, order the bibimbap burrito and some cheese curds, but have fun waiting an hour. I am just not going to deal with it again...Things that don't make me sad: five-star lunches.I am pretty obsessed with Graze even after just visiting once... I can see myself stopping here every time I'm in the beautiful city of Madison. It's such a gorgeous restaurant, and the natural light is bound to make any day better (so is that cocktail list, am I right?)Speaking of cocktails... I tried The Claire ($10). It's a pretty pale pink and made with Graze watermelon basil shrub, Tito's vodka, lillet, and quince & apple citrus syrup. So fresh and delightful. The Farmer's Market caught my eye as well... it's an "elderflower sparkler" with elderflower blossoms and sparkling wine, two of my favorite things.I made a rookie mistake and showed up only just a little hungry, so I ordered only a creamy tomato soup. It was so good, but I had so much regret I couldn't try more. The deviled eggs are certainly on my list for next time.As you can see, I really love this place. Can't wait to try more of the menu soon!

Review Text :
First impressions are lasting impressions right? Some might say it's ludicrous to grant 5 stars to a restaurant that you've only eaten at once, but these guys are on point. Not just with the service, but also the fantastic food. I have never been giddy for a restaurant before this. Ironically, the couple that came in after us was just as giddy. The kept talking about how their friend raved about the place and I can assure, it's not all hype.Everything is made to order so expect a wait for crabs and chat it up with the owners. Live crabs are delivered on Wednesdays and boy oh boy are they good. I can honestly say that the garlic crabs were some of the best crabs I've ever had. They were seriously Orgasmic with a capital O. What's KFC's slogan again? Finger licking good? Heeeeeck na, this place is so much more deserving. I seriously sucked every single one of my fingers. Crab cake kinda guy? The crab cakes were made just how I like them. Little filling, lots of crab lumps, cooked to a golden brown on both sides and amazingly tasty. Lemonade kinda person? They have some good homemade lemonade. Don't do crab? Okay how 'bout shrimp. The fried shrimp, OMG, seriously? My new, absolute favorite shrimp. And they tell me the steamed shrimp is even better! If you're worried about looking cute while you gnaw on a claw, don't stress too much, it's to-go only ATM. They do plan to expand next door and add seating though. The Crab Shack is just that; a Hole in the Wall. There's a counter, a kitchen, some benches, and two awesome owners manning the register and kitchen. Upon entering, you'll be happily greeted and they might ask how you heard about them. It seems most of their customer base is due to referrals and word of mouth. So if you still haven't heard, let my big mouth be the first to tell you. If you like crab, fish or shrimp, you must check out the Crab Shack!Well well well, Hole In The Wall Crab Shack...nice to meet you! I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it. I'll be back to try more of the menu very, very soon!

Cafes sind ja eine Kategorie f√ºr sich.Es gibt die gem√ºtlichen und die schnieken, die mit eigener Konditorei und die die eher auf Kleinigkeiten setzen. In manchen gibt es sogar selbstgemachte Pralinen.  Und Omas am Nebentisch. Andere wiederum sind eher mit WLAN ausgestattet und bieten im Home Office arbeitenden eine nette Abwechslung.Das Cafe J√§ck ist eine f√ºr sich. Der Kuchen in der Vitrine sieht verboten gut aus, gleiches gilt f√ºr die Pralinen und Kleingeb√§cke. Das Interieur quietscht dagegen zwischen allen Stilen. Gem√ºtlichkeit will nicht so recht aufkommen, aber daf√ºr f√ºhlen sich hier unterschiedlichste Menschen willkommen und schaffen gemeinsam eine Atmosph√§re des aus der Zeit gefallenen Oase f√ºr diese Momente, f√ºr die noch kein Ort geschaffen.Mein ortskundiger Begleiter tat gut daran, mich hierher zu f√ºhren und sorgte f√ºr seine Bestellung "eine heisse Schokolade 66" f√ºr mein Erstaunen - ja, hier kann man seinen Kakao in Prozent bestellen von milchschokoladig bis dunkelzart. F√ºr Leute wie mich, die der Milch und dem Gluten fernbleiben d√ºrfen fand sich auf Nachfrage in der Vitrine ein Florentiner. Der war eher unspektakul√§r und ich beneidete die Begleiter um ihren saftigen Himbeerkuchen.Der Service - well, der Service w√§re das Argument, das f√ºr mich gegen einen Besuch spricht: Muffelig und alles andere als den prallen S√ºsswaren gerecht werdend, wurden wir begr√ºsst, bedient und abkassiert. Schade!

Restaurant name  Lee's Sandwiches
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.(UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for "less ice and more coffee" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.Don't quite understand the Yelp hate. I won't try to get into a battle of words with my fellow Yelpers, because I trust their opinions on many places, but on this one...I respectfully disagree.Let me set the scene. It's 4:30am. I'm on my way home from the club. I had NOT been drinking, so I was able to judge my food with an able tongue.Lee's is like your typical Fro-Yo Shop on crack, because it's 10x as big and is actually a Sandwich joint (with Fro-Yo...Yo). I ordered the #11 combo, and my sandwich was out within 4 minutes. The baguette was PERFECT! The lunch meat they used was tasty, and I just LOVED the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to the sandwich to give it that extra Asian flair :)I can't wait to come back. I most certainly was not disappointed. I did not have the horrible experience that some of my friends did. I say give it a shot and judge for yourself.Yeah baby...bumped up to a 3 star rating now!I was just not satisfied with my 2 star rating that I had to issue in my first review.I wanted to give Lee's Sandwiches one more shot before I crossed them off my list forever!This visit was a lot better and I am pleased for that. I ordered the same a BBQ pork bahn mi and asked that they put extra sauce since last time the sandwich was a bit dry. The sauce they put in the sandwich is a yummy sweet special mayo, very flavorful indeed. This time the sandwich had more filling in it like it should, more BBQ pork and pickled veggies which was really good.I also ordered a passion fruit italian soda with the chewy gel cherry and fruit bits at the bottom as well as two chicken egg rolls which were delicious!Although I ordered the same BBQ pork sandwich as last time, it was much better today! Lee's seems to lack consistency which is important, not good when the way your sandwich taste or is made depends on who makes it. Really do not like to have to make a 50/50 bet or roll the dice on whether or not it will be hit or miss. Not a good factor!I will return and hopefully my order will come out and taste the same as today did rather than on my first disappointing visit.The only thing that could have been better was the wait for my order. There were only a couple of people in front of me and I waited for awhile in line and once I placed my order. Service could be faster that is for sure, there clearly is no urgency to get the orders out.Lee's we have come a long way baby, you and I have really got something going on.I am hooked and crave you constantly. Why do I have a constant simmering need and want for you? Your baguette bread is delicious chewy and always fresh, your BBQ pork is very tasty and your pickled veggies with sweet house mayo make my taste buds happy! Just a great combination of flavor and some really good bread just do it for me!I have been to Lee's so often that I have filled and redeemed the buy 10 get 1 sandwich free cards a few times now.I feel bad for my sweet boyfriend because my craving for this BBQ pork bahn mi sandwich is so often that he is tired of the sandwiches. :( He has tried them all, meatball, combination, BBQ pork etc and all are great but he just can't eat their several times a week like I can.I am addicted to this simple delicious and filling sandwich. My first visit and review was not so good however I gave them another chance and now am glad to report the goodness is consistent!I also enjoy their spring/egg rolls as well.Hahaha. Can one write a review on a place they were at, but quite drunk at the same time? Yup, I was THAT girl - passed out in one of the booths while her friends are ordering.I remember that there were crumbs on the table, the seating areas, and the place wasn't too clean - but it was open until the wee hours of the night. Perfect for the after hours munchies. They have great iced coffee, so make sure you grab some!I'm glad they picked me up a sandwich - it was great the next morning. But what can I say? There's nothing that totally stands out with this place. So... A-ok. Lee's is located on Spring Mountain Rd - the "Chinatown" "Asian" area of Vegas. There's plenty of parking, no valet needed. Cheapie food, open til the wee hours.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!!!!!! Being open 24 hours is probably the only thing that's good about it, but everything else just blows. It's in the Pho Kim Long parking lot, so beware of parking. It's in an Asian plaza (if you get my drift). The employees are not friendly whatsoever. The one chick who took my order even got annoyed when she gave me someone else's food. Like hello? You handed me the bag! Sorry for being an inconvenience to your life. Anyway, on to the food. The watermelon smoothie was disgusting. They don't use fresh fruit, so it was that super fake watermelon syrup tasting crap. Mixed with boba that turned solid after 5 minutes of being in the smoothie, just awful. It got thrown away after 2 sips. What a waste of $5! I hate their baguettes here because they are seriously like break-your-teeth hard. So, I opted for my sandwich on a croissant. Instead of the light and flaky croissant that we all know, what I got was bread baked into the shape of a croissant. Effing deceiving people! If you look at my picture, you can clearly see its bread and not a croissant. The meat was boring and tasteless. My bf had to put Sriracha on his sandwich when I brought it home just to add flavor to it. He also said the baguette was hard, which I already knew.Ok, and they have this stupid policy that states any purchase with a card between 9pm-5am will be charged an extra 25 cent PER ITEM! WTF!!!! I'm pretty sure they make enough effing money to suck up credit card surcharges. If not, go back to being cash only. Don't be cheap and try to suck up any bit of money that you can. I used to like eating here when I was younger and didn't know the difference between food and good food. After eating so many bahn mis throughout my years of living in Vegas, I can strongly confirm that I will never eat here again. Garbage, just garbage!Lee's Sandwiches is definitely the place to get your snack on. It's located in a shopping center in the middle of Chinatown, which most of the time, sucks driving in no matter what. Lee's is definitely a go-to at any time of the day simply because they have affordable food that's a little above average in quality. I usually come during late night hours after work or class because it's not really busy and it isn't too pricey to break the bank.The interior is bright. There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing. It literally looks like a scene from iCarly or some other show on Nick LOL. Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!If you don't want to drive all over Chinatown for decent boba and cheap snack-like food, then Lee's has got your back!When did Lees get so corporate??? I used to go to a Lees when I was younger and it was the best bang for your buck... But I guess either massive inflation hit or because this Lees is in Vegas... $4.50 for the number 1 special! That's nearly $5! What is this? A Vietnamese subway?! Banh mis are known for their value... Cheap eats, usually a banh mi would cost you like $3 or even buy 2 get one free... It might be this location? But if that's the price, Lees sandwiches have gone up. They also don't have nem anymore... But they did have cha lua and if you buy it they give you a loaf of bread... Great deal but you're paying $6 for cha lua... I guess I'm used to paying $1-2 less. Maybe it's this location... We made a pit stop to eat breakfast and got some sandwiches for lunch. It was okay...

Restaurant name  Thai Style Noodle House 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
First things first: this would be a five star review, however they were out of panang curry when I visited last...this will easily be bumped that extra star if this was an isolated incident.  I loved that panang!Thai Style Noodle House was a real treat.  This location is a few suites down from Waffles Cafe on Fort Apache.  During one of my visits to Waffles Cafe, I saw that the staff was ordering Thai food; within 20 mins the food was delivered.  After some investigation I saw that Thai Style Noodle House had recently opened this location.Later that week I stopped by for dinner and ordered a chef special, panang curry with avocado and salmon.  This was simply...awesome.  For my curry fix I've been going to Archi's...if only I found Thai Style sooner!  The avocado was a bit hard, but the flavor of the panang brought a smile to my face with each bite.  I ordered it at a 5 out of 10 on the hot scale, and it was what I expected.  After a second visit, they've been consistent with their scale through the four dishes that I've thus tried.Since then I've had the papaya salad, red curry, and the pad see ew.  After adding some chili powder to the papaya for a little more kick, it became a great side dish to the entrees.  The red curry was good, but I enjoyed the panang a lot more (they were out of panang this night).  And the pad see ew was a very pleasant surprise!  I've had this dish before at other restaurants, and it came out oily and bland.  But here the noodles were cooked perfectly and mixed in with egg and beef, creating a lovely texture with the soft egg and noodles giving way to the thinly sliced beef.  I've been expanding my tastes recently when it comes to Thai cuisine, and I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Style!I'm becoming a Panang addict. I have to try it wherever I go. Tonight was no exception. After reading Anthony M's ROTD, I figured this would be a good place to take my Dad for a little birthday dinner with my brother.Panang Avocado with Salmon. Doesn't that just sound awesome? Well it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. Honestly, I still prefer Archi's Panang overall, but I love the fact that it comes with ample large chunks of salmon and avocado. It's kind of a perfect little marriage. You take some salmon and avocado in with your rice on each spoonful. The combination works swimmingly.As it turns out, my Dad no longer eats spicy food. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for him. He ended up going with the Seafood Wonton soup. It looked delicious and had plenty of seafood. I like the uber-wide bowl they use to serve the soup. My brother went with the Yellow Curry with Tofu. I didn't ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it.As a side note, it was strange that the place was basically empty when we got there, but within minutes, the place was full. It's like after we sat down, a constant stream of customers just kept walking in until all the tables filled up. Also, I found the TV programming to be interesting. I used to love home improvement shows and seeing an Asian version was definitely entertaining.Thai Style Noodle House was worthy of two visits within a week - lunch specials are a great deal here so we couldn't resist returning!From 10:30 am to 4 pm, lunch specials are in full swing.  (This applies on weekends too!)  For $5.95, you choose one item from their list and you also get soup of the day, steamed rice, and choice of appetizer (fried tofu, egg roll, or fried wonton).  For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!Soup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.  First visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.  On our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.Be sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.Their version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.Service is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.Overall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.Minimum $15 for credit card use.I'm usually never on this side of town so thanks to my fellow Yelpers for convincing me to try this place out. There were many other great choices I had near the area but so glad I chose this one.Small, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.The noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew. The panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.I would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.The great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here. Next time, I'll be going to either the Chinatown location or the one in Summerlin.

Review Text :
Zink is the new M5.Thought I would pop in for a little bloody mary on a beautiful October day and check out the new location of Zink. Their lunch menu offered a Five and Dime special, 5 entrees to choose from for $10.Choose one of five entrees for $10served with caesar or wedge salad-Smoked Tortilla Soup & Chicken Panini-Roasted Tomato Bisque & BLT-Angus Mushroom Burger & Onion Rings-Curry Chicken Salad Pita & Spicy Feta-Wild Mushroom & Goat Cheese PizzaI thought that was interesting and I asked my server what he liked on the menu and he liked the idea of a small salad and a choice of entree. So I decided with the BLT & tomato soup. Service was good, the food is top quality, but the reason for only three stars is because they served refrigerator cold tomatoes on a BLT. Really? A restaurant with chefs has tomatoes in the fridge?  They should be ashamed of themselves.Great patio! It might be one of the best patios in CLT.I've been to Zink many a time and most of my visits have fallen on lunch. However, this time, our most recent visit was of the dinner/evening variety. Saturday evenings in Southpark are not typically on our radar, but we ended up meeting some friends and we were thrilled with our experience. We made a reservation for the evening on the patio. The weather was great and live music was filling the patio. We had a seat in the rather quiet and intimate setting on the patio. The patio setup they have here is so great at night. Much more quiet than you would expect. We ended up ordering some drinks, but then the weather took a turn for the worse. We asked our server if we could switch to inside whilst waiting for our friends. She happily obliged and scored us a great seat in the large dining room. A great courtesy without even batting an eyelash. I ended up ordering the cucmber gimlet and loved it. I switched for bombay saphire gin and enjoyed it very much. A nice cocktail to sip throughout the meal. The bread they served pre-meal was focaccia and it was fantastic. A nice change from the standard pretzel bread (which is divine). One aspect of their menu that is so attractive is the adaptability for vegetarians. My wife had no problems with the menu and if she wanted something sans protein, they were happy accommodate. Thanks for this!I ordered the new "Nacho" brisket burger. This is the first time I've had a burger med rare in Charlotte and the second time I've had a burger made from brisket. All I can say is WOW. The flavor of the beef was so intensely smokey and well-balanced with guac, onion straws, jack cheese, and that incredible brioche bun...A homerun for sure. Glad to see these guys are not joking around with their burger(s). I've had the Wagyu burger on occasion and I've always left happy...and so full. It's definitely not a burger for the faint of heart. Another small not, but huge props for having Northcoast Scrimshaw in a bottle. My favorite Pilsner and so stoked these guys typically have it. Dear Zink,Thank you for your incredible staff, accommodating dining areas, flavorful menu, miraculous beer varietals, and adaptability. Sincerely,Ben.

I cock-blocked with a pita . . . . =(I discovered this place during my trip out here for work.  I went in to order a pita and as the girl at the counter was making it, a guy walks in and she gets really excited.  They chat about their plans for the night because apparently he was going laser tagging, but she has to work until 10:30pm.  She abruptly has to kill the conversation to finish my order.  Pitas should never stand in the way of love.Like subway, but 100x better!White or wheat pitaMeat:  spicy chicken, beef, falafel, badger special!!!! (potatoes, bacon, cheese, jalape√±os, oinions, green peppers,nspicy sauce) and a bunch of other choices.Add ons: everything and anything:  spinach, romaine, alfalfa, tomato, hummus, olives, taziki, pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, etc.9 diff sauces: mayo, sour cream, spicy chipotle, ranch, etc.I hope I can find one in California . . . and not cock-block.

Review Text :
My daughter took me to Long John Silver's, (attached to an A &W BTW), at my request for a belated Father's Day lunch. Boy...what a terrible mistake! I should have known better because several years ago I had pretty much the same experience. Thinking it was old oil to blame for the grease laden sponges they called fish and shrimp, I was sure this different location would be better. WRONG!!! Absolutely identical. I got the 2 piece meal which included 2 pieces of fish, cole slaw, fries and added 3 shrimp. The fish, shrimp and fries probably began previously frozen but hey...if you use old oil that you fried french fries, onion rings, hush puppies, fish and shrimp in, all day and night  long in, well.... YUK! I could feel my arteries hardening with each bite! The once 3oz. fish fillet was transformed into an 8oz. slab of battered lard as well as everything else that was fried. I know that economic times are tough but come on...use fresh oil and your customers will return in droves. There were only 2 other customers in the dual type restaurant.  Neither of us finished our meal! Total tab was $14.08 with 4 coupons received in the mail. (would have paid almost $20 without coupons) Needless to say, definitely my last visit to LJS ever. Hope I live long enough to continue to avoid them and hope you all do the same!

Review Text :
I admit (with shame) that I delayed eating at Doodles until just recently.  The location is set in the greasy pit of campus-town, where I hesitate to venture unless compelled to by some supernatural force (like the lure of hot noodles in winter).The interior space of this tiny shop is not exactly comfortable, but this is the unfortunate case with most campus businesses (i.e., furniture and surfaces should be able to withstand physical punishment from college students).  For those choosing to dine inside, there's a picnic-style bench and a counter with stools.  I guess I can't hold the lack of interior design against them because the restaurant is not attempting to follow a conventional theme.  The manager explained the primary concept behind the place is "food-to-go" (so students can eat something while running around campus), and all the food is packaged for such a purpose, including the noodles.  Next to the front counter is a cooler with various drinks (both American sodas and Asian fruit juices) and "snack" foods.  From what I observed, the same snack foods aren't served each day, though I haven't gone often enough to figure out the pattern/rotation of the different foods.  These were a few dishes I noticed during my visits: glutinous rice balls (classic snack served in Taiwan and other parts of China), Chinese steamed buns, edamame, various sushi rolls, vegetarian gyoza, and spam musubi (a Japanese-Hawaiian invention that probably deserves a certain skepticism from most diners). Of course, the main feature of this shop is ramen.  When I mention this, most people respond indignantly, "What!?  You can buy ramen for 40 cents at Wal-Mart!"  The ramen-eating experience here is NOT the same as boiling noodles and adding sauce packets in your own home, though.  Your ramen bowl is fully customizable, from the available broths (sesame, miso, kimchi, beef, seafood, etc.) to the toppings you can request for your bowl (baby bok choy, nappa, egg, fried tofu, wakame, Thai fish cakes, beef meatballs, etc.).  At around 50 cents per topping, I was initially expecting pretty skim offerings, but I actually get a pretty decent ratio of noodles to vegetables.Maybe this little restaurant appeals to me because very few places can offer me a reasonable lunch for $3 (and student debts are the primary constraint on my dining options).  Probably real adults with real jobs would be less impressed by Doodles, but this is an ideal restaurant for most college students.

Restaurant name  Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli

Review Text :
Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli has finally opened just a few doors down from 168 Supermarket. And on its first day being opened to the public, it has already attracted a very nice crowd of eager patrons.From the hand written signs near the cashiers counter, it states that it is open everyday except Thursday. This little restaurant with seating capacity of 48 has a Breakfast Menu which is served from 7am to 11:30am, and a Lunch Menu served from 11:30am to 9pm. Since I was coming from work, by the time I had arrived it was already 11:36am and most of their breakfast items were sold out. Meaning no freshly made soy milk (or Iced Soy/Bean Juice as it is called in their menu) for me, which was the primary objective of this visit and the reason for skipping the free lunch at work. So I ordered the Beef Roll with Preserved Vegetable (it was that or the version made with pork), which was pretty much the only item available from the Breakfast Menu. And it was quickly served to me on a red china and still wrapped in the plastic wrap.  It is a sesame crusted thin bread stuffed with slices of braised beef with Chinese preserved vegetable.  It was alright. A little on the dry side, but a good experience to try their version thousands of miles away from the original in Taiwan and China.As I ate and looking over their menu I see that they also serve various handmade dumplings (such as "Steam Bao" aka Xiao Long Bao, which was also sold out), Spicy Beef Noodle (which I ordered), various Taiwanese Deli, Shaved Ice (which they don't currently serve), cold beverages and hot desserts. The back of their business cards also states in Chinese that they served Taiwanese style hot pots, but that is not in their menu, just like the breakfastitems are not listed in the menu. I also ordered "Temple Meatball" and Fish-Ball Soup (should be more accurately called Fuzhou fish ball).The first item I ordered arrived quickly, since it was premade and came on a plate still wrapped in plastic wrap.  It was okay, maybe too dried and lack much flavor to warrant trying again in the future.  After that it took pretty long for the items to be sent out the kitchen, since I doubt they were expecting this kind of crowd on opening day and they probably don't have any proper line cooks working in the back.  So by the time I finished everything and paid by bill it is 12:50pm already.The kitchen is definitely not ready for the better than expected turnout, but hopefully with more practice they will soon get the hang of it.  As of right now, there is no POS in use, so items that are out, must be communicated to the staff taking the orders as it comes in, and if not everyone is on the same page, you end up with customers waiting for a good long time, until they either ask about the status of their order or just gives up and pay for what they have already been served. Furthermore, the kitchen and the expeditor needs to agree on how orders are placed and executed, because the time for discussing how to handle order tickets is not in the middle of service.Food-wise, I thought it was just okay.  The best item I tried was the Spicy Beef Noodle, except I felt the beef needed to be braised longer, since not all of them were tender. There are also still a lot of things I want to try if they are actually available, so I will be back.Menu - sadly very typical of the mom and pop operations in that the English translations of menu items are 1) misspelled, 2) poorly translated, 3) utilises questionable word choice.  If the restaurant needs someone to correct their menu, I can do it. I just hate seeing simple words like tofu, noodle, chicken spelled correctly in one part of the menu and not in others. And I also can't understand why some parts of the menu is not translated at all, like the shaved ice. It is not that hard to translate select any 3 toppings, 4 toppings, etc for X price.Parking - pretty convenient since it is in the same plaza as 168 Market.Price - pretty reasonable for most items.3 stars.They also have shaved ice on the menu, but it is not available yet.We ( My date and I ) checked out this newly opened Taiwanese Deli place that's next to Lelysee Bakery and near 168 Market.Reminds me of Tea Planet without the booth seats and colorful interior. They have some snacks and health products for sale that you can browse through if you like..They have a self serve utensils and water dispenser if you need an extra bowl or cup to share food or just to drink plain water.We ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea, which was delightfully refreshing to taste. I could drink 10 of these if there were refills.. but that's just wishful thinking. This is my all time summer drink to cool my body when I feel like I'm about to experience heat exhaustion... it works instantly and you literally feel relieved.. even to say... Aaaaaaaaaaah!!For dinner, we ordered two most popular Taiwanese dishes:Spicy Beef Noodle (Soup) - Surprised it wasn't overpowering with the spices that I thought it would have. It was actually just right in giving it a kick each time you took a sip. I actually really enjoyed this broth. I loved the noodles! It had a great texture as if it was homemade. Thicker than fettuccine noodles, but thinner width-wise. It was like udon noodles texture, but half its size... absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beef was like stew meat that is cooked for many hours... unfortunately I had to minus a star for the fact that some of the chunks of meat ( the ends/corners of it ) were quite tough to chew upon. And for that reason, I couldn't even eat the remainder of the beef chunks, but I did finish all the noodles, sliced green cabbage, and some kind of pickled shredded mustard green.Rice with Pork Chop - It also came with a boiled egg, steam greens, and ground pork. The coating is somewhat similar to katsu style, but this batter they dip the pork chop into and deep fry is on point! It had a light, airy crispy crunch on the outside.. which was my favorite!!! * My eyes lit up like Christmas lights in full blast from biting into a piece. Very tasty and satisfied all my taste buds. Even the meat was tender and juicy.  Bravo!! Bravooooo!!! I definitely recommend this dish if you love meat and deep fried food. It really hits the spot indefinitely :)They also open at 7a.m.- 11:30a.m. for breakfast, which I heard was incredibly cheap, but good. Service was quick, but not much smiles... At least my tummy was smiling and it put me in a great mood. Hey I'm an emotional eater... What? *Ladeedadee skipping away.....We were fans of the Champion Gourmet on Spring Mountain and very sad when they closed down.  However, the Yangs (Bobby and Misti) were the first to tell us that they were reopening business in this shopping center and we anxiously awaited their grand opening.  What we loved most was their hot pot option - something that currently is not offered.  (Word from Auntie Bo directly said she'll be starting the hot pot business again come the new year! Yay!)We even missed out on the famous CMYE: Breakfast of Champions event, which got raving reviews and reinforced how fabulous the Taiwanese breakfast experience was there.  (We plan on hitting it up one of these days!)One day the Husband came home and said he wanted some Spicy Beef Noodle Soup from Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. Apparently someone from work had been raving about it, and yelpers concurred!  So off we went to dinner!This is what we tried:   * Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) - This is THE thing to order at Yi Mei.  Look around and you'll see every table have a bowl of this.  Every review talks about it and I can see why.  The Husband liked it and found the beef to be tender.  I was personally enjoying the noodle part more.  It had a good texture, something that Suki L. talks extensively about it in her review.  It also came with bok chopy and pickles, be sure to ask for more of those preserved pickles because they add a nice contrast to the dish.  Bring me a bowl of the noodles, broth, bok choy, and pickles and I'm good to go! * Special Fry Tofu ($4.99) - This was a long shot because we weren't sure exactly what was going to make this a 'special' fried tofu.  While we waited for this dish to arrive, the Husband asked if they had the stinky tofu still.  I wasn't sure since there was another dish on the menu called "Hot Spicy Special Tofu" and thought that may be the dish!  When it did come, it looked like before with pickled cabbage and a dipping sauce.  When I bit into it, it was definitely the stinky tofu.  The texture was a bit dried out, but the crispiness of the tofu was refreshing.* Green Onion Pancake ($2.99) - One pancake arrived and it was a bit thicker than what I'm used to getting. We needed to add some hot chili oil (and other condiments found on the table) to give it a little more of a kick.  I personally prefer thinner green onion pancakes.* Steamed Bao ($4.99) - Also known as Shanghai dumplings or Xiao Lung Baos.  They were the last to arrive.  There were eight small dumplings that were a little gummy and could have used a bit more time in the steamer.  I prefer it that way so the hot soup within the dumpling can burn my tongue a bit.This is a pretty casual restaurant where there is a self service station for hot tea, water, and utensils.  You'll find this on your immediate right when you walk in.  Take a seat and be sure they know you sat down so you'll get menus.  (Try to ignore the spelling errors on the menu.) And when you're ready to pay, head to the register and know what number table you sat on to help them out.This place is steadily busy, and not just from new customers who happen to be shopping at the nearby 168 Market.  But rather, these are long-time customers from their old restaurant.  You can tell they have a strong following.When the Husband was paying, he got a chance to meet and talk with Auntie Bo, who is just the friendliest lady.  That's when we heard that hot pot was returning come the new year and we were psyched!  You can't help but love the family-oriented atmosphere where regulars come to enjoy some quality homelike food.  She really makes an effort to know her customers!   Not only is Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli a restaurant, but it's a mini market as well. You'll find dried goods and refrigerated items for sale.  Take a look around for some interesting and unique goods!Update! 01.06.11 - I stopped by and asked Auntie Bo about the return of the hot pot. Looks like it's not going to happen anymore. =(  She said they just don't have the staff to do it.  Oh well.  But she did mention Dragon House as an option for hot pot which I can confirm!Ask a Chinese person to take you here...your experience depends on it. No one speaks English...and no one will try to understand you if you don't speak Chinese. My first experience here was great, I came with a fellow yelper, Mike C. and had him order everything. My order came out and everything fine.My second visit was a desperate one. I originally stopped by Asian BBQ and noodles but they're closed on Fridays :( So...I decided to drive across the street. I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked if they could add wontons in it...weird I know but I was craving both. First they brought out a bowl of wontons in beef broth which is understandable and forgivable because of the language barrier. They took it back...added the beef and the noodles...everything looked great until I started eating. The wontons were falling apart as soon as I tried picking them up with my chopsticks. I was starving so I ignored this and continued eating until I bit into one of the wontons and realized that it was still pink...undercooked. Gross...-_-The service here is non existent...They have a water cooler and Styrofoam cups if you need water... Feel free to walk up and get it yourself. Same goes for napkins. This experience was probably an extreme of how bad a meal could go wrong here...but I will not be back. This decision was made after considering that the first visit was decent. There are just too many better options in the area.

Review Text :
Little plates, they're only little plates which surely means I can only eat a little amount. Right? Right?! So Katya assured me after my fifth helping from one of the many little plates on our large table of 11.But really, I didn't care how much I'd eaten or how bad (read: gooooood) that might be. I was already in my little state of 'food ecstacy' as Kerrin R described it. Why? Let me enlighten. Tapas are, delightfully, little plates of food. This means you can order 2 - 3 plates per person, which means more variety. When you go along with 10 other yelpers this means that at least 25 little plates are ordered, all of which are passed around, which results in a LOT more variety.Jurgen D and I did some tactical ordering and went for the:- lamb with apricot (daily special)- sea bass with lime and ginger (daily special)- chicken with black beans and mango (daily special)- haggis with spinach and pine nuts- mixed grilled vegetablesI also happened to sample many other things passed around, up and down the table including:- garlic and chilli prawns- courgette wrapped feta (daily special)- pork ribs in chilli and honey- the goats cheese with onion marmalade- another type of pork, this time fried- the beef sausage - grilled haloumiOh my, I think I'm forgetting some too. As Jurgen and Aidan have said below me, the restauarant is whilst mainly Spanish in its style, a mix of Venezulaen and South African too. The only thing that would have helped was outlining what on the menu heralded from which cusine, but in the end it didn't matter as it was all superb.My favourites were definitely the haggis and lamb, oh and the pork. The haggis was the best I've had in Edinburgh so far - in a Spanish restaurant. It was so moist, not dried out and crusty as it often can be. And mixed up with the spinach and pine nuts - wow, flavours I've never experienced before. The lamb was a really generous serving for a small tapas plate - two large skewers. Cooked so it was still pink in the middle and the apricots were lovely. The goats cheese was epic, a whole block of goats cheese which we all sampled and agreed was creamy goodness.Oh but yes, there were also desserts. With such offerings as 'crying chocolate pudding', 'almond cake' and 'cappucino cake' it was to our delight they had the 'trio of desserts' option. For only ¬£6.95 you got a slightly smaller version of three of the desserts - fantastic value. The almond cake was so moist, although for me a little bland but then I'm not the biggest almond person. The crying chocolate cake was the opposite - rich and dark and brooding. I think it's called crying cake as it almost made me cry tears of joy. And the capuccino cake was lovely and tart and not overly sweet.But the winner hands down was the rhubarb and ginger sorbet. It was just...so...rhubarby!! Seriously. The most rhubarby flavoured rhubarb thing (apart from actual rhubarb) that I've tasted. So refreshing and brilliant to cleanse the palate.This place is an absolutely fantastic find. It has that real neighbourhood hidden gem vibe to it, one that you'd be delighted to stumble up on by accident. As Jurgen said, despite being a Monday night it was almost full by people in the know. Huge props to the staff as well. I booked the table for 11 at 5pm that night, and despite being full they accomodated us without any fuss. The staff also all tried really hard, and the front of house / owner was really helpful and genuinely nice.Oh and another favourite - the coneryor belt effect of food. Just when you'd finished one, another came, and so on and so forth. As Aidan has said, this was great as it meant it didn't all come at once and go cold. I could get used to all these many, many, many small plates of food...!

Review Text :
I am always in search of a restaurant that serves really good beef noodle soups.  So I was excited to see the interior of this restaurant being put together a few months ago.I finally came here with another Yelper for dinner and to give their food a try. The restaurant was not busy at all (I was the only in there while I waited for my friend), so service was quick when we placed our order.I ordered the Beef Noodle with wide noodles $7.99.  The flavor was good,the noodles were chewy the way I like it, but the beef could have been braised longer.  I think China Mama and even Ay-Chung Noodle has better Beef Noodle Soup, so I will likely try something else here in the future.My friend tried the Babo Mian, which he said was good.  $6.99We also ordered an appetizer that was on one of the papers taped to the wall. The chicken was good, just a little pricey for the portion.Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent.  The food was adequate. Price was alright.   WiFi is free, but there is no place to plug in your laptop.Decor: 3/5  Nothing special.  Just a fast food restaurant kind of furniture and decorations.Food: 3/5  Okay, but definitely room for improvement.Service: 4/5  Efficient.Location:  4/5  In China Town.  Close enough for the tourists staying on the Strip, and locals wanting to eat at a restaurant on Spring Mtn.Cash only, which my friend said was the reason why he didn't dine here sooner, as he didn't have cash when he initially came here.  I know it is a business decision to process credit cards payments, but it seems that it is a small business expense to cover to not lose potential businesses from those intending to pay with debit/credit cards.Want to try some quality beef soup noodles?  A few simple choices an you're there: 1.  Beef, beef tendon, or a combination of both.2.  Thin or thick (hand cut ribbons) noodles.3.  Mild or spicy soup.The hardest thing is finding the place.  Deconstructed:  Very well seasoned, deep beefy soup base with the wafting aroma of star anise, hint of ginger, and dried citrus peels.  Great noodles with just the right amount of chew.  Clean, tender, gelatinous tendons (sounds disgusting but "a rose by any other name...").  The only catch, the beef is sometimes over braised.  Tender, but dry.  Very common, I'd guess it's authentic by default.Beef stew soup $8. Beef tendon soup $9.  Combo at $8.50A simple meal doled out in a non descript restaurant with "classic" service (you got your food right?)  It is what it is and that's not bad at all.My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.Brrrrrr...... It is super cold night here in Las Vegas (12/07/2013) we're talking mid 20's. Definitely soup weather. Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated. Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow)Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot. Here's some of the rundown. Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing. Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree. Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings. The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel. I'll definitely be backMany Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. (Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pi√®ce de r√©sistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).Not a bad Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup...From yelping around in Las Vegas, looking for a place that was still open late night, and targeting restaurants that had noodles...this establishment was the one that I chose for our intoxicated food adventure.I was lured to this location not only because of the high ratings, but because of their advertisement of hand-made noodles.The noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.Im usually a PHO-type of guy when it comes to drunk munchies, but after eating here, this place isnt a bad substitute.RECOMMENDED!UNTIL THEN!! ^-^

Horchata doesn't get better than this. The consistency of the cinnamon infused rice milk at Los Gemelos is perfection. It's spiced and sugared and oh so good. Many restaurants tend to dull this drink down so it's thin as water and way too sugary. Not Los Gemelos, nuh uh. They do it way right.Get some tacos while you're here too. The steak variety is served with cilantro and diced onion and is probably best, but I've had chicken a handful of times as well. If you're looking for something a tad heartier, go for the fajitas and prepare for a lot of food. I love that smokey grilled taste on the meat and veggies, nailed it.Also, they default to corn tortillas here, which is fine by me because they're delish but ask for flour if that's your thing. Service can be bothersome at times, especially if you're pressed for time, but that can't keep me away from their horchata. I have yet to find a better glass.

Yep it's Subway with subs made your way with your choice of bread which now includes flat bread that is really good.My hubby took me here for lunch one day while we were out and about running errands around town. He decided to try a flat bread sandwich and let me tell you the bread is fresh and delicious! I think I will try my sandwich on the flat bread next time because that was a real winner!I usually get the meatball marinara, spicy Italian or veggie delight depending on my mood.The subs are standard at each Subway, what makes your experience good or bad, hit or miss really depends on the employee behind the counter at the time. There is no real consistency as some employees are more generous then others with the toppings.It is annoying to have to ask them to add more lettuce or tomato to your sub which is necessary when you can barely see it on your sandwich. On this visit I had to ask for more of everything including purple onion as I kid you not she put 3 little pieces on my FOOT LONG!I don't know why we continue to visit this location as the service sucks sour balls!. It is the same lady who looks at you as if she has more important duties to do like mop the floors. Which while we dined she was sweeping by our table at our feet. That is a pet peeve of mine, sweeping while I am eating. We were the only damn people in there at the time, she could have waited until we were gone. Well as I have come to realize in life not everyone has common sense.This particular female employee is consistent in her personality I have to say, she looks and talks as if she is giving a speech at a funeral. She has been there every time we have gone I swear she must be the only employee there. This was our last visit for sure, she just confirmed and made that decision for us. Anyhow, there are lots of Subways around town so it will be easy to pass this one up along the way.

Stopped by the Fedex Kinko's Store next door around lunchtime and was hungry for some Mexican Food.  Luckily, this Chipotle is only steps away.I went for the Steak Burrito had them put Rice, Pinto Beans, Hot Sauce, Sour Cream, and Guacamole in the Burrito.  The Burrito was solid as usual for a Chipotle.  The Guacamole & Sour Cream makes the Burrito for me.  The Rice has just the right amount of Lemon juice on it to give it that slight tart flavor.....and the Hot Sauce has a nice kick to it.I think they do a really good job because they have such a small menu and focus on providing consistent product.Will I return?  You bet.This place rocks.. they can get busy but they hammer right through and you get fresh food!The freaking cook is amazing to watch as he dices and slices. I swear he is gonna loose a digit. Fun to pass time as you wait in line!They have always been clean, quick and really nice here.

Came on a Saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately. It is a smaller place with a bar capable of seating 15 or so and about 15 tables. I'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing. It provided a nice ambiance.The menu consists of apps, salads, a few pastas, traditional entrees and pizza. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app and weren't too impressed. They weren't terrible, just nothing special. The entrees were a different story. My husband's mushroom lasagna was to die for.  Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of each ingredient. I had the veal parm and it hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading. Their marinara is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own. The portion was quite generous and was accompanied by spaghetti and marinara. Our only compliant was that they do not offer draft beers and their bottled beer selection was very limited.While many traditional Italian dishes are not listed on the menu our server informed us that items like marsalas and piccatas are available upon request.

I have learned one very important rule and it is that I'm only allowed to order bruschetta at Postino. Period. End of story. That said, the butternut squash soup was delicious as was my one bite of the Steak sandwich, which I might just order myself next time. The space itself has a much warmer, intimate feel than expected. It appeared so bright and coffee house like on the website that it was actually a deterrent. I get it, your space is clean and you want to showcase that but it really does give the wrong impression. I also understand the concept of lighting for photography purposes but it appears bright and uninviting, definitely not date worthy. Anyway, I'm glad I was wrong.The cocktail list was uninspired and I don't recommend bringing a beer geek here, but if you're into sharing some munchies and splitting a bottle of reasonably priced wine, this (and about 20 other spots in the valley) is your place. No offense to The Living Room, I will surely be back, It's just that I'd really love to see a restaurant owner bring something fresh and new to the table. I feel like everyone is doing a version of this...I too noticed the flickering light issue but being that I'm not prone to seizures it didn't bother me much. The service was on point and our server was attentive without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy ourselves. When questioned regarding wine options he actually had an opinion and some basic knowledge to back it up. That may seem sad to get excited about but hey, I've gotten used to vapid shitty service, even coming out of some seemingly 5 star establishments. We came, we drank, (a lot) we dined, (not enough) and we took cheap cab rides home. Ahhhh, the beauty of living in Mid-town.  I'll be back Living Room; I'm not in love...but you're a perfectly acceptable rebound/transition until the next best thing comes along.

Review Text :
Yelp Challenge 365 # 175/365there are several Hash A Go Go's and as a matter of convenience, I tried the one at M Casino. By the way, it's just as easy to get to M's Hash A Go Go than to stress with the traffic; park or valet your car, then walk to the restaurant.... Mihcael C is correct on the size. I don't know if any ONE person can finish the entire entree......Rod U is correct that it may appear to look like / act like a "chain" restaurant and in a way, it is....Here's my take: food was good. The portions were a little too large (very large for my appetite), service was excellent and there was no wait for seating (at least when I was there). As Rod says, you can't go wrong with the price. Averaging $15 per entree and enough to feed 2 or 3 people, really can't complain.I had the Chicken Pot Pie. By taste, it was a "chicken pot pie". By design, it was a "work of art" you may just want to look at.  My friend had the chicken and waffles. It was okay= like southern fried chicken and maple syrup I guess...I think I would go back if, and only IF, I was in a large group knowing we could have several entrees and share it for tasing purposes....One last thing! They have the best bloody marys by taste and price south of the Strip.

Review Text :
This is a tough review to write because I live in the neighborhood and like to walk over for dinner. It is a cool set-up with the open bar and the outdoor area, but this place has a real identity crisis. I went there a few times when it was Portobellos. The food was terrible and the menu was all over the place. When it changed to the Lizard the food got better and the menu more uniformed. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the food has gone way downhill over the past six months, and the service is spotty. Several of the servers and one of the bartenders are great, the rest are rude and slow. The food is either very greasy, or dried out. I sure hope they can fix this place. To the owners I say: "Figure out an identity that works with the local clientele, change the menu to something that is simple, straightforward, uniform, and most importantly GET A NEW CHEF!"

Review Text :
The Hippies thought they could fool me...the Hippies thought I wouldn't see their little trick with the profile change.I haven't been stoned in a very long time...I pay attention!So, since the hippies were good enough to change their Yelp profile to avoid these previous reviews, I think I'll post this one under the new profile.________________________________________________________A friend of mine called  and said "let's have lunch!"He seemed so excited...and then he said "hey, buddy...there's a brand new Two Hippies near Old Town!"I threw up in my mouth a little and said "but I don't think these Two Hippies joints are very good"He promised this time the experience would be better!He's a lying sack of...well, you get my drift.I went anyway and had essentially the identical experience to my last (and I do hope this is my last) experience with the Two Hippies.Not surprising that this place is identical...the very same franchisee operates it (in the location once occupied by the late,and not apparently lamented in the slightest, Desert Dogs and Dessert), that operates the other Two Hippies Joints that I've tried.Two Hippies is recycling the very same thing over and over!Oh well.And except for the actual physical location and the fact that I had a pretty flavorless burrito instead of tacos, recycling the same review that I used before works stunningly well for this location, too!And it's appropriate since Two Hippies seems intent on recycling their formula, ad nauseum.Very "green" of them (except of course for the styro and plastic everything else).Plus, I'm feeling lazy today (or green...I can't remember which).Here is the review, for those of you still reading:"I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-IBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)And, I like taco's:)And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)No beach at 5th and Camelback:(But, I digress:)I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)"

Restaurant name  Lucky Strike
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you know me, you know that I'm an advocate of almost anything Phoenix.That's why when Lucky Strike was set to move into Cityscape, I was thrilled. I've been to the Lucky Strike in LA, and have always had a great time.I've been to Lucky Strike PHX about 4 times since it opened and for the most part, the wait and bar staff have been above par in their customer service. I am particularly appreciative of waitress Nicole, who has an uncanny ability to almost anticipate what the customer needs before they even ask. She has an overall pleasant personality without being too saccharin-sweet, know what I mean?For employees like Nicole, I commend Lucky Strike. Now, here's why Lucky Strike irritates me: it's their "we're hot shit" mentality. 1. I tried to reserve one lane for a Wednesday night, and they respond with a "we only take reservations 7 days prior." IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, FOR CRISSAKES! And this is Phoenix--not Hollywood, not DC, not Miami. People are not going to be lining up for lanes on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night. At least NOT YET.2. Do you validate parking? No, you don't. Not even an hour validation. Hell, CVS does even if we just buy a package of band-aids, but you don't. So we have to pay the $12 parking fee.  Throw us a bone here! We are Phoenicians who try to minimize walking in the heat. We like convenience but not at a steep price. Phoenician women also like to wear heels so why make them walk just to go to your establishment and spend AT LEAST $14 for the first game, $10 any additional games, and some change for libations and grub. You want us to patronize you, work with us. CVS did.3. I know you're new but you gotta train your receptionists or the people who are tasked to answer the phones first. They are not rude, but they do sound clueless machines who will spew out the corporate answers to your questions. Just saying. A few almost sound as if they're "hot shit."4. On your website, the dress code states: Head gear is not permitted. But it seems to me, fedoras are okay. Last I checked, a fedora is head gear. C'mon, don't be a hatist (as in HAT not HATE). Stick your policy and be fair. If you think a baseball cap might be gang-related...just remember the Mafias of yesteryears wore fedoras. If you're going to say "head gear," mean it and don't let your hosts make a subjective decision whether a hat is offensive or not. You're not god of head gears. (But do me a favor and kick out anyone wearing Ed Hardy caps.)Lucky Strike, please understand that Phoenix is still learning that there is life after 5:30p.m. in the downtown area. We're not a tough crowd. I mean we're fascinated by flashing lights and air-conditioning. But we do need some coddling, some TLC. And when you "win us over," believe you me, we will be fierce followers. But the: 7-day advance reservation, no validated parking, the "we're hot shit" attitude might.and inconsistent dress code policy will not win us over. And I personally, would like for you to succeed here.We Phoenicians are quite different form the LA, Miami, Denver, etc. people, so don't categorize us the way you would categorize them. We are fascinated with your right now--your concept is so hip and cool, we like it! But if you don't treat us right, it won't take us long to realize that at the heart of it all, you are just a bowling alley with soft-dim lights and air-conditioning.Five stars for having the best meal value with recreational outlet during the lunch hour.  Your lunch outing will get you a great meal and a free game of bowling for only $5.50. Srsly!I've done the lunch & bowl three times and each visit was easy breezy, just stick to the following:Most people are there during their lunch hour so show up a little early to guarantee access to the next available lane. Sign up for your lane immediately upon arrival and order your meal as soon as your server checks in with you. Keep your game going and avoid stalling and lingering. Believe me, two players can get through a game and lunch within 45 minutes. Most importantly, just have fun!I heard that Lucky Strike opened downtown several months back, but I'm not a huge bowler, so I didn't really think twice about it.  However, a few weeks ago, Jared got it in his head that he really wanted to go there...  So last Friday night, while at dinner, we texted Amber and Dallas  to see if they spontaneously wanted to join us for  drinks and bowling at Lucky Strike... and sure enough, they did!  (Gotta love the spontaneity!)Unfortunately for us, we weren't the only ones in the mood to check out Lucky Strike; the place was packed with an hour wait when we arrived!  We stuck it out though, and despite being on the pricey side, we did end up having a ton of fun!  A couple of rounds of drinks later, we finally did get a chance to bowl.  I was by far the worst bowler in our lane; (bowling is not my sport even sober).  Little known fact: Amber and Dallas are pretty serious bowlers... they both have their own bowling balls at home but they didn't bring them out with us this time.  I am sure I'll return to Lucky Strike; I think it's a great new addition to CityScape downtown, but next time  I'll call ahead to reserve a lane... and I may even try to brush up on my bowling skills before I return (or not)!We had an office party here Friday for our one-year anniversary.  So, being that I didn't have to pay for the games, shoes, or food, my review is based on my experience.  Just thought I'd get that out there so nobody reams me.  We got the private room, which was really nice.  In fact, everything here was really nice: the decor, the people and, being that it's a new bowling alley, the shoes.  The shoes were still brand-new.  That's huge.We had a TON of food!  Pot stickers, pizza, veggie trays.  Everything was great and tasted fresh.  It wasn't Sysco food.The service was outstanding!  I'm not one of those people who says "outstanding" very often, but we were really taken care of well.There's a nice lounge off the main room for people who just want to...go to the bowling alley to drink.  Do people really do that???  I can't wait to get a group together to go again.  It's fun, it's Downtown and I'm excited about CityScape!Dropped in with some friends.  The lanes were all taken, so we went over to the pool tables to play some pool.  They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.The pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.There's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.Overall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.Return Factor - 90%My first experience here was short, sweet, and to the point. It was pleasurable. In other words, I had been eagerly anticipating a return.My second experience was cause enough to never return. Picture this- there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance, and mind you, 'twas about 1:15AM when we arrived. We had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular looking bar that actually showcases local artists' works (I'd give them more than two thumbs up if I physically could for this) so the idea was to grab a few cocktails. Service was lackadaisical at best even though we were the only ones at the bar itself.The epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extreme absence of management, poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartenders, and the uber extremism of the  "bouncers." Unfortunately whenever there are a bunch of guys behind me yelling at me to "get out" after the bartender has just delivered a drink, I am going to be a bit frustrated. By the way, it was still before 2:00AM.Ultimately it's a shame. As I was walking out I told one of the "bouncers" that I would never be back, to which he replied, "It's no skin off my back." For a service-based business in downtown Phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for any patronage they may acquire is simply dumbfounding. I live a few blocks away and whole-heartedly wanted this place to be a "go to" spot for when friends and family from other parts of the valley and from out of state visit, but if the "bouncers" are the only voice here then I would prefer to give my business to anywhere besides Lucky Strike.

Review Text :
If you are staying at the Palazzo, this is a super-convenient gourmet hamburger place right to the left on the second floor as you get off the elevator! It usually is not busy and the food is pretty good.  I found myself returning multiple times during my stay. Like any self-respecting modern hamburger place, they have several exotic burger options, as well as many different beers on tap.Although things can get a bit pricey, they do have a great happy hour with half-price appetizers and deals on drinks (which I enjoyed on more than one occasion during my stay).  If you order a large beer, you can bring the cup back later for a $5 discount on the next beer.  The receipt you get is also good for 25% off of a breakfast order - and although I didn't try it, I heard good things about it.  If you are looking for something quick, easy, and pretty good, this place will hit the spot!

Review Text :
It's never a good sign when you drive up to a business and the parking lot is empty. To be fair, it was 5:30 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, but still, this is an Indian/Pakistani restaurant, so you'd think the typical crowd might be more World Cup and less Big Game.It's an even worse sign when you see vinyl lettering on the window of an Indian restaurant that reads "Salon de Fiestas." And sure enough, walking into Saffron for the first time, it doesn't feel at all like a cozy Indian restaurant. It feels like a banquet room. Only two booths, the rest of the expansive room filled with round-top banquet tables, chairs covered in plastic, a little stage in the corner. And COMPLETELY EMPTY.An Indian restaurant should smell like, I dunno, Indian food when you walk in. This place didn't. It smelled like ... an old folks' home. Or something. Something not right. And it was dead quiet in there. Not even a TV or radio on.There was one person visibly working in the entire place, a middle-aged woman who was helpful enough but not very friendly. You think she'd be thrilled to see even one person, let alone a couple, walk in. Not so. She kind of just gestured toward whatever table we wanted, dropped off menus, and disappeared. Didn't ask us for drinks or anything.The menu was typical Indian fare, and prices were about average. We ordered some of our favorites -- veggie samosas, pakora, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, as well as some rice and two kinds of naan. At the same time, the host/server/whatever finally took our drink orders. Sadly, this joint doesn't serve alcohol. I hate it when I can't order a good Indian beer with my meal.It took a long time to get even our drinks (water and iced tea) out, which came with the appetizers. The samosas were OK. The pakora was weird. I'm used to pakora being similar to tempeh -- just vegetables dipped in batter and fried. These were more like spongy batter balls with diced veggies inside. Maybe they're more "authentic," I don't know, but they sucked.The entrees were solid. Nothing to write home (or, um, on Yelp) about, kind of weak-flavored, but decent. The naan was good enough. We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate to use, and when the lady first looked at it, she said, "That's not us." She said this because their logo didn't print, and she thought the "missing image" graphic was someone else's logo. I had to point out to her the NAME AND ADDRESS AND PHONE of her own business. She did eventually take the discount off our bill.Interestingly, at some point, a man and his child walked in during our meal, heartily greeted us, and I assume he is the owner or manager at least, which leads me to believe our host/server might have been his wife. Maybe she was grumpy that she had to work by herself while he was watching the Big Game or something. Had he been there when we first arrived, we might have felt better. But either way, we're never going back here, which is a shame, because it is literally walking distance from our house.There's another review here which describes Saffron's interior as being more like a banquet hall than an Indian restaurant and I have to concur completely. When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.After being instructed by a small child to "just sit anywhere" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.The restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.After a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).Our host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd "ketchupy taste" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.Despite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.This is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.I got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate. Finally, after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there, lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home TWICE in the time we waited to pay for our meal.The food here is great, but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay, including 30 minutes after you TELL THEM you want to pay is just unacceptable, especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow.So upset! After buying a groupon we decided to finally give this place a try. Even after reading the reviews I took a leap of faith on this place. First off we drove 20 mins to get here to be ignored at the door when we entered that WE had to ask after standing there for 5 mins if we should just seat ourselves. An unpleasant lady said sit anywhere and tossed some menus on the table. Without an " I'll be right with you". We waited 15 mins without someone even bringing water to our table!! We got up and left. Now I know why I stick to my five favorite restaurants. If you want good Indian go to taj palace. That's where we're driving now where we know we'll get awesome food and great service.

Review Text :
What can I say, I really like this place.  It's not traditional Thai, but what do you expect with Thai tapas.  Everything I had was really, really good and inventive.  My husband and I were starving so we started off with three "tapas" - the shrimp patties, stuffed angel wings, and spinach salad.  I love the spinach salad!  It's tempura spinach leaves served in a big cone (like French fries) with a yummy dressing on the side.  The shrimp patties and stuffed angel wings were also very good, but the spinach salad stole the show.  The shrimp patties were pretty much what you would expect.  The menu says "Thai spices" but the patties aren't spicy at all.  Decent size and the plum sauce drizzled on top tasted great. The stuffed angel wings are a little different than what I'm used to, but still yummy.  A lot more chicken than "stuffing" and with cilantro.  For entrees, we had the spicy green bean pork and the basil beef.  Their spice rating system is from 1 to 5.  The spicy green bean pork can only be made a "2" or higher.  Hence the word "spicy" in the name.  We got the pork as a "2" and the beef as a "4."  The "2" was just perfect for me and the pork with green beans was delicious.  The beef was also good but I could tell it had more oil on it and I would probably break into a sweat if ate too much.  The entrees come with white rice, which was cooked properly.  All the plates come with little orchids on them and are served family style.  I liked the presentation of all the dishes, especially the spinach salad.For beer, they have Peroni, Blue Moon, and Coors Light on tap. We ended up having two Blue Moons, which went really well with the food. They do have some more interesting beers by the bottle, such as a Joseph James stout.  They have a very nice selection of wines but all the red wine is stored on shelves, so it might be too warm.  But they did have a sign outside offering 50% of wine by the bottle on Thursdays so I may have to check that out.  They also carry some sake.  Most of the desserts have coconut.  It's a Thai restaurant so I expect that.  We ended up having the Thai donuts, which were really tasty.  The caramel sauce is supposed to have coconut in it, but I didn't taste it.They took my restaurant.com certificate, no problem.  Service was great - very attentive and helpful.  Small, cute place.  A little dark, especially in the bathroom, but the d√©cor is nice.  Looking at the reviews, I think this restaurant has been paying attention and making adjustments because I didn't have close to the same experience other reviewers had. This restaurant is definitely going on my regular rotation.I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Thai tapas, what a unique idea, but I'd probably still stick with ordering a main dish and some tapas as appetizers to try. Every dish I tried was absolutely amazing. The spice levels were right on point and the ingredients were fresh. We ordered the egg rolls and firecracker shrimp to start. They were delightful. I highly recommend the shrimp. They were seasoned perfectly and had a great spicy flavor. I ordered the panang shrimp curry and my fella tried the green curry with catfish. My panang was pretty good, but the star of the dinner was the green curry. It was incredible and there was avocado on top that complemented the flavors perfectly.The interior is TINY. A little cramped, but decorated nicely and the staff is extremely friendly, warm and attentive. Our water glasses never went unfilled. Our waiter was fantastic. He was incredibly friendly and funny!I'll definitely be back to try some of the other intriguing menu items despite living kinda far from Nittaya's. I highly recommend this place! It's not authentic Thai food, so if you're looking for that, you might be disappointed, but delicious nonetheless.Honestly, the place is a bit pricy, so I'd definitely recommend checking out the restaurant. com site for a discounted gift certificate.A beautiful restaurant in Summerlin.  Great ambience and perfect for date night but but BUT, make a reservation as this place is tiny and has limited number of tables.  I went here for our lunchthey're not too busy for lunch. We got a free sangria with our Yelp check-in.They have a great lunch special menu which comes with a salad with ginger dressing, pot sticker and entree for about $11.  I got pad thai spicy 3 out of 5,drunken noodles spicy 5 out of 5.  My pad thai came out really spicy and the drunken noodles were milder so we swapped towards the end when I was covering my nose with tissue.  Despite that, I thought the food was delicious.Service was great.  Our server was attentive.  The food is more expensive here than other Thai restaurants but this is more upscale Thai cuisine.  I'd have to come back here for their tapas and I know I will be back.I am teetering between a 3 and 4 star review and because of the rocky start to our evening, I am going to have to go with the 3 star for the moment.When we arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 5:30p, this very cute and intimate restaurant was pretty much empty. However, the host asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and said that he wouldn't be able to seat us because it was 1/2 priced wine night, and they'd fill up. Um..okay.... (looking around empty restaurant)... Well, can we sit at the bar? Long pause. How about outside? They hesitated, but said they'd set up one of the outside tables. That was a process that took awhile. Because it was a bit breezy outside, we asked if they could set up the outdoor space heater. Another process.  That finally being settled, we sat down at the somewhat shaky table.From that point forward, things went well enough. The sangria is delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the fried avocado, the veggie potstickers and the mango bacon wrapped shrimp. All of these offerings were very good and again, the presentation was lovely. Service was friendly and pleasant. As the evening progressed, the wind picked up, and even with the space heater, I was downright cold. I asked our server if it was possible to move us inside to finish. We went inside, and while it was busy, there was a small table right by the bar. She said that the reservation wasn't until 7, so we would have plenty of time to complete our meal. So...why weren't we just seated there in the first place?The seating issues did put a bit of a damper on the meal, but I am willing to give Nittaya's another try.I didn't think I'd find a massaman curry better than the one at Chada Thai. But, I did at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Located in a small strip mall on Rampart, this is definitely no secret. If you come on the weekend be prepared for a long wait. The interior is tiny with tables too close together and a bar area that has almost no separation from the dining room. The massaman curry ($16) is excellent, as is their "World famous" spinach salad ($11). Crispy, light tempura batter covers a heaping mound of spinach. Add the chicken  and lime dressing to it and it's unforgettable. For more subtle flavors, the coconut soup ($9) is the way to go with a thin, smooth broth bathing chunks of chicken, tomatoes and mushrooms.If you can get a table, dining at this modern Thai place is worth the trip to the westside suburbs. It may not get the press that other popular Thai places get, but they are more than capable of challenging the heavy hitters in town for the title of best Thai restaurant.The "Not So Secret Salad" is one of my favorite salads in town! It's more of an interpretation than an actual salad, but I don't let that pesky detail get in the way. The dish is tempura-fried spinach leaves with a sweet-and-spicy dressing slash dipping sauce. You can dip the leaves as you go and eat it like nachos, or dump on the dressing and attempt to use a fork. Either way, your taste buds will be quite delighted. You can share this as an app or order it as your main, like I do.Nittaya's Secret Kitchen has $11 lunch specials that include a salad and potsticker, as well as a Happy Hour (Mon-Thurs, 3-6PM). The Not So Secret Salad is also $11 though, so I find myself ordering that instead of branching out to try new things.Small neighborhood place, classy d√©cor and local art, lots of wines available. They have a small section of patio seating, and some day I'll actually try something else on the menu.

Restaurant name  Nobuo At Teeter House

Review Text :
Nobuo just knocked one outa the park ! Tonight was an open house and food tasting of the new menu at Nobou at the Teeter house. The place is a small historic home renovated and sits just across from Pizzeria Bianco.  The evening was $15 and we sampled everything on the menu. Is was a full house and the food kept coming. The servers passed Asian Hors'd ouvres to our tables. Every bite was succulent with the freshest of the fresh. A piece of salmon wrapped around a very special little almond drizzled with a unique basil sauce. Pork buns that melted. A square of watermelon with cap of goat cheese, refreshing ! I absoulutely loved the tasting and can't wait to go back for dinner ! This cuisine if something out of the ordinary and very SPECIAL ! This is fine dining in a cool hip place !I should be disqualified from reviewing anywhere that Nobu cooks. My love runs that deep. So I'll just drop off this 5-star and continue to post photos of every delicious meal.I don't do sexy well. All of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness. Drunk on sake from Nobuo, I attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes. He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening. My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption. We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait. While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself, we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns. Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff. The Teeter Tots, Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce, were so good. I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now, but nothing has come close. Now, I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns. But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure, so I gave these guys a shot! Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision ever!Get frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance!Lindsey here, reporting to you live from a self-induced food coma thanks to the delicious cuisine courtesy of Nobuo. Let's see...where shall I begin? I finally had the perfect excuse to check a visit to Nobuo off my list: Yelp Eats! So tonight, fellow yelpers and myself sat in the adorable Teeter house and dined on master cuisine. I began with the refreshing watermelon and goat cheese salad. It was like a never-ending bowl of melon that was perfectly matched with creamy goat cheese. As our table laughed and chatted about everything under the sun, I ordered another appetizer: the teeter tots. Holy tots Napoleon! At first glance, the idea of tofu teeter tots didn't appeal to me too much, but I'm a sucker for anything fried so I decided to give it a try. Well, the fried tofu was smothered with mouthwatering sweet sauce and after one taste, the rest of the table ordered a dish for themselves! In fact, they were so good, Dave N ate them again for dessert! Even if you aren't a tofu lover, I still suggest you get them. They are heavenly. Now let's move on to the entrees. I had half of the soft shell crab sandwich dish and half of the pork belly steamed buns. Both were crafted perfectly. The pork belly steamed buns come on a rice bun and the pork and sauce are complimented perfectly within the bun. The soft shell crab sandwich comes with two small sandwiches. The crab melts in your mouth and the sauce is the perfect addition. If you go with a friend, order both dishes and share! We ended the night with a sweet goodbye known as the orange almond fritters. Imagine four donut holes with ice cream on top and covered in a thick Carmel/orange-like sauce. Perfecto! The atmosphere here is wonderful as well because it's situated in the historic Teeter house. In fact, tonight I learned that this house was occupied by the owner until her death in the 1970s. It's truly a piece of Phoenix history and worth stopping into even if it's just to see the house. But do yourself a favor and stay to dine as well!Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 3:07/14/11My first visit and I already love this place!  It's got everything:  great location in Heritage Square; easy access to nearby parking (w/ validation- sweet!); classy, understated elegance; amiable and demure staff; and the gorgeous and terrific food!  What makes Nobuo stand out from all the downtown eats I've had the pleasure to try, though, is the low-noise level-- one would think that in such a historic building such as this, with wooden floors, wooden furnishings, and many small rooms that can easily fill up fast w/ lively diners, that it could get very noisy indoors, but in the two hours our group spent there, not once did I find it too noisy.  On to the food!  Still satiated from my late lunch, I decided to skip the apps and ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich, since I also wanted to have the Dark chocolate tofu mousse for dessert later.  From the adorable beverage booklet, the iced teas begged to be tried, so I ordered a Lychee red iced tea, which came unsweetened.  [Other selections were Hibiscus oolong iced tea, several varieties of green tea, Ramunes (Japanese flavored sodas, three varieties), sakes, red and white wines, beers, and $11 cocktails.]  Several others had ordered apps and were gracious enough to share-- the Teeter Tots app was a HUGE hit!  So much so, that two Yelpers ordered two servings, and another had three or more!  (The third one was dessert, someone remarked.  LOL)  These fried tofu cubes w/ miso sauce surprised me w/ their delicate crunchy exteriors that then revealed juicy tofu inside, and the spicy miso sauce that they were tossed in was impeccable!  I'm not sure if the twelve Yellow-tail sashimi spoons were house freebies, or if three Yelpers ordered them (four spoons per order), but I really enjoyed the two I had tried.  (I'd initially turned down invitations to try them since they contained avocado, which I love, but the fruit unfortunately does not love me; However, they looked so beautiful and so enticing that I eventually broke down and tried one, minus the avocado.  The first spoonful was exquisite- tangy, garlicky, and clean-tasting, and I had to have another!)  My sandwich was, just as Lindsey wrote, perfectly crafted-- two magnificently-toasted focaccia "buns" housing golden-brown battered small soft-shell crabs, with greens, red onions, and a pepper aioli (I asked that the cucumber be omitted).  I'd definitely order this entree again! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w#gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w  Last, but certainly not least, the deep, silky Dark chocolate tofu mousse, w/ green tea ice cream and candied orange peel was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ  (Notice a pattern here?)  The Orange-almond fritters were fantastic, too, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the mousse!  I'll be back very soon, Nobuo!Nobu offers Japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional Japanese setting.  There were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard Japanese Isakaya (tapas).  My favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible.  The spicy miso sauce was very addictive, and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent.   The soft shell crab sandwich was good, but I think I like it more in a sushi roll.  As for dessert, after seeing everyone's order, I just couldn't resist not to order one for myself.  I have ordered the Orange-almond fritters, the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid, and tasted even better.  The exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing; just wish they have another scoop on it.   I took the pork belly buns home, and tried the next day. The braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a Chinese-style dish that my dad loves.  Actually, I preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun.  I just don't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat.    Overall, I had a superb UYE dinner at Nobu.  I am glad that they participated in Yelp Eats Week.   I hope they will be back for next Yelp Eats Week.  Thanks so much for organizing this, Lindsey!five stars alone based on the grilled tofu salad and the pork belly bunsthis is one of the spots you have to visit on any down town pilgrimage, it's simply one of the best restaurants phoenix has to offer.This is a great , intimate, and special gem of a place with fantastic creations from the James Beard award winning chef, Nobuo, in the Heritage Square's Teeter house, a historical old house with hardard floors and simple understated elegance, all in the heart of DT PHX. In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates, or what one might call "Japa Tapas",  made with attention to detail, flavor and texture, at reasonable prices, this place was part of Phoenix  Yelp's Eats Week recently, with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies.In a cozy, quiet room with only 4 tables, with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations, the two of us split the following:Small BitesKimchi ($6) - napa cabbage, dried shrimp, seasme oil, red chili. Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp, this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor, crisp and crunchy, as a salad rather than a pickled side dish. Excellent!Nasu ($8) - eggplant, bacon, red miso, Tokyo negi - this small bacon wrapped morsels stuffed with eggplanbt and akamiso, with shaveed green onions. (8 small pieces) Heavenly! Others not tried: Shishito Pepper, Watermelon Goat Cheese salad, Tempura Squash Blossom (All $10 or less)Cold DishesYellow Tail Ceviche ($14) - myouga, sesame seed, sherdded taro - a superb blend of textures from the Hamachi to the Taro shavings, caressing the palatte with sultry pleasure (4 pieces)Tako and Tomato ($16) - fresh grilled octupus, house made mozzarella - like a mini-Italian Caprese appetizer, with half a cherry tomato, a small ball of mozzarella, a touch of basil, and a scored, pounded, grilled tender piece of white octupus! Outrageous yet comforting in its combining recognition with a new ingredient! Others not tried: House cured Salmon, Ebi Salad, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Shiromi Carpaccio, Big Eye Tuna Tataki (all $12 - $16)Warm DishesPanko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich ($12) -  housemade focaccia, cucumber, kanzuri aioli - this is not your daddy's crab sandwich! Crispy soft shell, great aioli, a mouth watering delight!Seabass & Mushroom ($14) - seabass baked in parchment, garlic butter, sake, soy - delicate, flaky seabass soaking in a hearty sauce, on a bed of shitaki and enoki mushrooms, with a sweet sake, butter and onion base, tender, yet dripping with exciting goodness like a goddess in heat!Others not tried: Okonomiyaki ($8) - classic Kansai pancake favorite! Pork Belly Buns, Fried Sodt Shell Shrimp, Warm Duck Salad, Yuan Yaki, Foie Gras, Coconut Curry Lamb, (all $10 - $24)DessertChcolate Mouse with Green Tea Ice cream and chocolate syrupThis is a terrific date place, intimate and romantic, or a Foodies orgasm, and all at reasonable prices for the quality of creations and food. We had 2 small bottles of Junmai Sake ($12 eacch) but they have a huge selction of sakes going up to near $600 a bottle, as well as a good selction of beers. Relaxed atmoshere, not hoity toity at all, not attitudes, very down to earth. This is an excellent choice! And of my many reviews, only 10% or less get 5 stars from Wanugee, so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve!Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.The BF and I went to Nobuo last night for the first time with a local dines deal. The place is cute, it's an old house and you sit in one of many small rooms.  As we were seated, we overheard some other people complaining about their experience...uh oh. So, needless to say, I was a little worried. We ordered a whole bunch of things to share. We got the sugar snap peas, the fried and stuffed squash blossom, a special that was fried octopus balls (as in they were in a ball shape....stop being dirty :-P) , the sea bass and mushrooms wrapped in a pouch of sorts, and another special which was local chicken 3 ways. I also got a cocktail, the grog, and we shared the mousse for dessert (it was a pretty indulgent night). Here's the breakdown:Sugar snap peas: this was not my fave, but the BF liked it a lot. It was a little fishy and served cold, and I just didn't totally love it, but he ate it all. Fried squash blossom: I loved this dish! It was stuffed with goat cheese, was light and crunchy, and I thought it was soooo delicious. The BF didn't like it, but he's a goat cheese hater. Octopus balls: The garlicky sauce was good, the breading was good, octopus has a weird texture, but overall, I liked it, they did the best they could I think with this odd ingredient. Sea bass: This was the star of the show...the sea bass was not fishy. It fell apart. It was savory and delicious. The mushrooms were luscious, earthy, and added tons of flavor to the fish....I could eat this fish any day of the week...so yummy. Chicken 3 ways: Again, this was pretty delicious. The chicken was served: panko fried, wasabi grilled, and marinated in a soy onion mixture. The panko fried was good, but pretty expected. The wasabi grilled was awesome, I could feel the spice in my nose and the chicken was so moist, but the clear winner on the plate was the onion soy chicken....oh em gee.... this had such a wonderful savory and sweet flavor. The grog: This cocktail was strong! But it had a nice honey and orange flavor....definitely worth the 11$ because one was certainly enough. The Mousse: oh so chocolately and creamy...the green tea ice cream complemented it very well (and I do not care for green tea desserts). We were told that the secret behind this (and don't read this if it might ruin your experience) is that they use tofu in it to give it that silky texture...brilliant!Overall, I really enjoyed our meal there and would definitely go back again (although I would order a little less cuz we were stuuuuuffed).

Review Text :
I went here a couple of weeks ago for a Smunch get together.  We had a group of about 10 spread across two tables.  This was sort of a basic breakfast/lunch place but a bit on the larger side and with lots of diners it had a good feel to it.  Service was great and they did not bat an eyelash at the few special requests made.My first menu choice was eliminated because they did not have gravy that morning so I went with the potato pancakes.  Not impressed, they were very sweet owing to the onions chosen and were thin and burnt a bit around the edges.  The side of corned beef hash however was excellent, shaved corned beef mixed with their rosemary potatoes.Being a half hour drive in the wrong direction I wouldn't go back on my own but I would certainly recommend it for a meeting place with somebody in the area.After hearing that the owners of Perk Eatery were from Michigan, I think I got my hopes up that they'd be able to make fluffy omelettes like I get back home... unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  However, I did enjoy my meal at this little locally owned restaurant.  I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).Would I return? Sure.  Am I rushing back? No, but I don't want to deter you from checking it out.  And please let me know if you are more "perked up" after dining at Perk than I am!5/10/12Finally made my first visit today.  Funny- I told the greeter that I'd been waiting to try Perk for years, yet I added the bookmark just last year.  May 8, 2011, to be exact.  Anyhoo, the restaurant looked better than a roadstop diner- a lot better.  After reading a few reviews, I was expecting worse.  There were actually some nice pieces of wall art.  Overall, I liked the energy inside, even though there were only two or three other diners present at the time.  Since I'd already checked out the menu online, I had two choices in mind to try (French toast or pancakes), which would depend on what the daily/weekly special was, and what the "nut" was in their caramelized banana nut topping for the pancakes, French toast, and waffles.  Since the special "for a few days" was Pumpkin pecan pancakes and pecans were the only nuts on hand, and I've a pecan allergy, I was reduced down to the fresh berries topping, and so I ordered the French toast combo, with soft-scrambled eggs, spicy chorizo ($7.99 menu price) and a cappuccino ($2.99).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw?select=U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ#U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQWas excited to try another organic eatery since there are only a few in town, but I'm a bit disappointed on this first visit to Perk Eatery.  The eggs were fine, and the spicy chorizo complemented them well.  (The salt in the chorizo created a nice balance with the unseasoned eggs!)  The French toast had a nice crisp to them and were not at all greasy, but I guess I was just expecting more.  It didn't have enough custard for me, and I suppose I'm used to a little bit more decadence... mascarpone cream, caramel, creme fraiche, or just plain butter, even.  At least the pancake syrup was 100% maple.  (Can't recall if it's organic, though.)  The eggs served here are local Hickman Farms cage-free, so that's a plus.  Would love to see this updated to organic in the future.  The cappuccino was made with organic Passport coffee, and it was good, but I'm not used to seeing such a stark white froth, and so thick!  No matter- I got over it  quickly.  :)Restaurant and women's restroom were clean and organized.  Service was friendly, and I liked the frequency in which Daniel and other employees (owner/managers?) came by to check up on things.  I thought it cool that someone (he struck me as a manager, or co-manager) handed me another napkin just a couple of seconds after maple syrup dripped from my plate onto the napkin on my lap.  Good eye!  While the French toast was, to me, underwhelming, it hasn't stopped me from following Perk Eatery on Twitter to try the Lemon-ricotta pancakes when they're on special.Note to Perk: Please update your breakfast menus to reflect the price change of the French toast combo.  A $2 upcharge for a one-person ticket is no big deal, especially if everything on the menu is organic, but I don't know if I'd be as nonchalant about it if I brought in a larger party and the ticket reflected a higher discrepancy...My recent breakfast at Perk was OK.  The food was good, but the lackluster service will make me think twice about coming back.My mom and I both enjoyed our breakfast burritos (mine with bacon and hers with ham).  They were smaller than I anticipated, but tasted good, especially when topped with the side of cilantro jalapeno sauce.  However, our waitress was pretty brusque - no interaction at all after taking our orders.  It would have been nice if she could have managed to come by to check on us, refill our water/my mom's coffee or even make eye contact at all.  The restaurant was NOT busy - less than half of the tables were occupied.  I had to ask the hostess for both a water refill and our bill.  When our waitress finally showed up with the check, she slapped it on the table without even breaking her stride, all while looking out the window.  Hello!?  No 'thank you', or 'have a nice day'.Eh...  I can make my own breakfast burrito, thanks.Haven't seen some girlfriends in a while and they suggested meeting up for breakfast, the place picked was Perk Eatery so off we went!We were a party of 6 and I met up with everyone around 9:45ish on a Sunday, and what a cute place this is, like the vibe of it! This place was also featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives (I personally have never seen any of those shows, but do happen to wind up at places that Guy has been too) I ordered the Outlaw Scramble, came with 3 eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, saut√©ed onions, green peppers covered in cheddar cheese and topped with this amazing cilantro jalapeno green sauce also severed with a side of county style rosemary potatoes. I also got a side of Corned Beef country style hash.  The corned beef hash was DELISH, I loved the flavor of the corned beef, this Irish girl was happy for sure!  The Outlaw Scramble, man that's a great dish, my eyes were bigger then my tummy so I didn't finish everything, but what I had was so good! The green sauce OMG amazing!!  I have to say I did have plate envy for a minute or 2 , my friend next to me ordered something that is not on the menu, but was featured on the show, the Breakfast Enchiladas, 2 enchiladas with slow roasted pork, green chilies, black beans rolled up in corn tortillas covered in red sauces and topped with 2 eggs,  I did something I never ever do and asked for a bite of her food. OMG that stuff was amazing! I want to go back now and order it for myself! The red sauce has a kick to it, its soo soo good! Damn good breakfast enchiladas! Look forward to going back!Perk Eatery was the place picked for May's Breakfast Club UYE, and I for one was pretty excited for this! I adore Perk Eatery, haven't found a dish I didn't like. The food is greatWe were a group of 14 and service was good, everyone was taken care of and coffee cups were kept filled.Since finding this place back in Dec I have become a very big fan, and since my 1st visit they have expanded the place and took over the shop next door, and have a bar inside too, loving the new look Perk!This time around I went with the corned beef country style hash,  its rosemary potatoes, nice thick slices of corn beef topped with melted swiss cheese and served with 2 eggs, I had scrambled and also had English muffin (you can get any kind of toast you want, but I love me some English muffins) . Other than the Breakfast Enchiladas, the corned beef hash is a favorite dish of mine! It's just sooo dang good. I love the thick slices of corned beef and country styled potatoes omg YES! I don't think I can ever have corned beef hash any other way. I've been ruined haha. If you haven't tried the corned beef hash, you should but also everything else is delsih too! I crave the corn beef hash and the breakfast enchiladas, oh and that cilantro jalapeno sauce is amazing too, oh yes I know I will continue to keep coming back.I must admit I don't quite get Perk. I've eaten here several, actually many, times. I started as a curious DDD watcher, sharing the obligatory Wine Country French Toast. Pretty good. The favorite of our group on that first visit, however, was the rosemary breakfast potato. I was mystified, however, as to why DDD was drawn to this Scottsdale locale. Perhaps the crew wanted to stay at the Westin resort across the street. I've returned over time with several different diners in tow, sampling pancakes... The potatoes were never again quite as good as I remembered, varying quite a bit visit to visit. Other items seemed Denny's-like. Never felt a welcoming vibe. I've lived in the Scottsdale/PV area for many years, so I'm used to "Snotsdale" attitude common in the area. Maybe they're just catering to DDD tourists. Hard to say.On this day I dropped in by myself. Wanted to try their Belgian waffle, an item I'd never tried at Perk. Wanted a cup of coffee. Was seated and then waited. And waited. No coffee. No water. No welcome. That's the review I've been procrastinating about, I thought. I've been here often and still do not feel particularly welcome. At prime time. The hierarchy was all there. Not busy. I finally got up and left. No one said anything to me. Hmm. I drove down Greenway to the very non-Snotsdale Country Boys at 32nd Street. Only my second time there. They recognized me from a prior conversation, one unlike any I've ever had at Perk. They poured me coffee before I had time to open the menu. What a contrast. The 40th Street Caf√© is another Greenway Road breakfast spot I'd recommend ahead of Perk. Perk's food is at times interesting, perhaps more interesting than the other restaurants mentioned above, but the restaurant is missing the warmth and consistency you hope for in a neighborhood breakfast joint.As someone who is a confirmed corned beef hash lover I was really looking forward to coming here. It may not be the best hash I have had but it is in the top three. It also came recommended from a Yelp friend.  My wife went with the Wine Country French Toast which she loved. It has Brie cheese sandwiched between two large slices of French Toast topped with roasted grapes and a Rosemary wine syrup.  Needless to say I went with the Corned Beef Country Style Hash.  Our server explained how it is prepared every morning and made to order.  It was accompanied by two sunny side up eggs and two thick slices of whole wheat toast. Apparently within the last couple of years business has grown exponentially as they have expanded to the space next door and have added a bar. I would have loved to try the Bloody Mary but was driving.Maybe next time I'll give try.Oh Breakfast Club, just what would we do without you? I for one would probably eat a lot less breakfast, that's for sure.The long trek ensued from my humble abode in Cenpho, Monica, I hope you know I don't travel this far for just anyone. Finally landing on the huevos rancheros, my taste buds were excited to dig in. The cilantro jalepeno sauce was delicious with a good mixture of spice and flavor, it was tasty.With a decent sized group of 12 or so, the staff were able to accommodate us without many hiccups at all. We all chatted, got to know each other more, hung out, and had a great time. Be sure to try this place out soon!Happy Yelping Phoenix!

This place is located in the heart of Chinatown, the reason we decided to try it out was because we were asking around for a good chinese place and we happened to stubble upon the owner's daughter along with her friends. She told us the restaurant is good, and we believed her, simple as that!The decor was bad and next to our table were the electrical wires that lit up the street sign, it was a little scary, because one move and you turn into the fried duck they were serving the table next to us.Anyway, we were blown away by the food. seriously!! I got the beef and chinese broccoli and my friend got the spicy shrimp and scallops, and we got the fried rice. It was one the best chinese meals I had in a while now.I will definitely come back when/if i am back in the beautiful city of Montr√©al.

After a day of shopping for fortune plants, I had a golden opportunity to take my lovely mom to Sabai. We were exhausted and we were famished, so I suggested to have lunch here since we were in the area. The restaurant itself is rather roomy and clean. Pink flowers adorn every table which I thought was special. Buddha sculptures and fortune plants are also on display. They were running a lunch special entree for $8  which includes a soup or salad.I ordered the veggie delight and a Thai lemonade and mom dearest got the Pad Thai and Thai tea. The service here was super quick and the dishes were delicious.The chef definitely made the dishes pretty and our waitress was super nice. The only thing that bothered me was the music. It was a tad loud and distracting, so it was hard to enjoy a good meal.That said, I'm giving them 4 stars.SaBai Thai has become my new go-to place. I absolutely love the dishes, the service, the ambiance, and the overall experience!This Wendy's converted building is quite deceiving. The inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. At night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, SaBai Thai is a perfect spot to take a date. They have an EXCELLENT happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of Sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on HH). I generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant. As far as food is concerned, I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well. The staff is incredibly friendly, especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. His wife, Holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect Modern Thai environment.In additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have GREAT hours, especially for an Asian restaurant. Most Thai places close from 3-5 and don't do Sunday lunch service. SaBai Thai's modern take grants us Thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!I think even Mr. Sheen would agree, SaBai Thai is a WINNER!!!On my last visit to Phoenix we hungry ( yet lazy) so we decided to order delivery from SaBai Modern Thai.  We found the website very easy to use.  The menu items are sorted by type of food: appetizers, soups and salads, house specialties, stir fried entrees, etc.  When you select any item, a window appears asking you to designate a spice level for that particular dish on a scale of no spice, medium, Thai hot, mild, or hot.  You can also designate special instructions such as no onions.  I ordered my dish Thai hot, but my fellow diners stuck to the mild level.  I chose the Mussaman which consists of braised boneless beef short ribs in classic mussaman curry with potatoes, carrots, onions, whole peanut and cinnamon essence.Our food was delivered quickly; everything was still hot, and the food was packaged securely enough that none of it spilled.  Things started out very well.  They ended well, too.  The dishes were generously portioned and quite delicious.  I couldn't finish all of my rice and curry, so I had enough left over for breakfast the next morning.  I didn't try any of my brother's dishes, so I can't comment on those, but mine was delicious.The convenience of having food delivered right to the apartment was quite a treat.  I'd definitely order from here again.It started great.  The coco soup and lettuce wrap started were impeccable.  We ordered an entree to share trying to save room for dessert. The Pad Thai arrived and looked beautiful.  I have had this dish before here and really enjoyed it.  My son put a spoonful on my plate and one on his.  He tasted a shrimp and immediately said something was off. He decided to just avoid the shrimp and continue with the meal.  I took a bite of chicken and that had a sour taste.  We took a couple of bites of noodles.  No problem there.  The waitress came and I told her that the shrimp and chicken tasted odd.  She mentioned the chef put fish seasoning on them and that could be it.  She also wanted to know if I had tasted their Pad Thai before. Yes, and it was quite tasty a month ago.  The waitress took the platter and two plates away.  She came back and said because we ate half of the dish, the restaurant would only charge 50% of the $12 price.  Hummmmm, half of the platter was gone because it was on our two plates uneaten!The waitress also said I should have told her immediately.   The first time you checked, wasn't soon enough?Sad and disappointing.  Ultimately I did not have to pay for the dish but the restaurant acted like they were doing me a favor and I was a cheat.I called in an order of their Coco soup to eat for a cozy Sunday dinner. It was good, but not the best that i've ever had. It did cure my craving, and was jam packed with chicken which was a major plus. I completely recommend ordering a side of rice to put in the soup, it makes it a meal! It took a while for a call in order (About 25 mins) and the restaurant wasn't very busy but I do have to give props to the lady that took my order, she was VERY friendly! Since my favorite Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays, I would come back here as a replacement since it is in the hood! :)

Small place, big flavor! This Thai restaurant is worthy of its name. The exterior of the building may be very generic, but inside it is very clean and cozy, with a friendly staff adding to the overall warmth of the place. The food is very well seasoned, the heat tempered to your taste, with individual flavor elements like toasted garlic and spices distinct without being overly assertive. The food is well priced, too. This is certainly a place for numerous repeat visits.

Healthy eats for $5.75 (including drink).. *Swoon*! Although I was basically trying to eat "healthy", I tried the grilled, fried, and baked strips (I did it for Yelp - how can I rate a place without trying it all?)! I'm with Ann Marie - the grilled were actually my favorite. They put just enough glaze on them to give them flavor without being overpowering. They were grilled to order (guy threw them on the grill right when I placed my order!) and were so delicious. Baked wasn't all that special, but fried were awesome ! No idea how they aren't greasy ? Panko ..mmmm.. so light, so fresh, and so "not fried" tasting. Love it ! I was thrilled to death to get 2 skewers of fresh delicious veggies with my chicken (green peppers, onions, tomatoes - yum!). I also tried a plethora of sauces. For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce. My coworker was very pleased to find liquid cheese (like that kind that put on nachos at ballparks!), but I couldn't stop eating the BFG house sauce. It kinda reminds me of In-n-out special sauce, but yummier. It's a simple concept, but executed well. A good value, healthy, and delicious !This place was on my 'To Do List" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!I like Raising Cane's, its close to school and home, drive thru available, always hot, and the toast.. sometimes I go there just for the toast, but thats the problem. I can't be going to my chicken finger spot and only looking forward to the toast. Nooooow... lets pretend I am married to Raising Canes then.. BFG would be my mistress, cheap, hidden, ultra friendly, gives more than receives, and satisfies. Since I've cheated it would only be fair that I compare my lover and my new mistress. Raising Cane's Box Combo (6.89) versus BFG anything (5.75). The drink- Both locations offer similar drinks, coke, diet coke, orange fanta, sprite, and etc.. so thats a tie . The dip- Canes has ketchup and that brown gravy cane's sauce. BFG has 8 dipping sauces (guessing here), from a range of sweet honey mustard to the wassabi cream that brings a little spice to your life. My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.  The side- At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG. EL POLLO (CHICKEN)- Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG. Oh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.It is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop.The food is good here, but the customer service is phenomenal! Yes, I said phenomenal. The guy who took our order and served us our food was super attentive, funny, and an overall awesome person! My friend's car died because she left her headlights on and he jumped her car for her! :) That's customer service baby! :POn to the food... I ordered the baked chicken strips and tasted the fried chicken strips. The winner is FRIED CHICKEN! Doesn't it always win? The mac & cheese is creamy just the way I like. They had many sauces to choose from, but I'm not a sauce person so I just chose whatever.Note: This place isn't big at all and the seating is limited to about 20 people total. I will be back... I wish they had a drive-thru!I've been meaning to come for a long time. I pass by it all the time to/from work and it's either too early or too late.Jin greets us and like what most Yelpers said asked for our names and asked if it's our first time.BF and I both got the "Create Your Own" combo with fried strips, mac and cheese and each a wasabi sauce, BFG for me, and sweet chili for him. While we were waiting he asks, "are either of you Yelpers?" I thought it was rather curious question but I said "yes". He then explained that it's because he noticed a pattern of ordering that first timers who get what I got tend to be Yelpers because they read what is considered the "best".  On the way there I was reading the reviews and he's right.....and about 10 of the reviews are people I know. Haha. So there- they know youre a Yelper if you're getting the "best of" box. Then he asked about us and told us a bit about himself and Tin. The strips were juicy, crispy and not oily at all. I love they have a variety to sauces to suit your mood to dress it up but even alone it was nicely seasoned. I loved the wasabi sauce..a little bit of zing and a bit of sweet. The chili sauce is not that thai chili sauce from the bottle and was tasty with a hit of cilantro in it. BFG has a good tang. Garlic bread has slices of garlic on it. Yay! I kinda eat a lot of garlic so it makes me happy (sorry if I sit next to you while I sweat, haha). Mac and cheese is very cheesy and gooey. I hate when baked gets dry but this had a lot of cheesy goodness. If this was open late then I'd probably never go to Cane's. We only go there because it's fresh and open late. I'll steal my Yelp bestie Angela H.'s word- it's "normalicious". Delicious, doing simple comfort food right. As we were sitting there enjoying our food, Jin came to check on us and refill drinks so even though its counter service, they sit wait on peoples tables. We also listened to convos and he greeted a few people coming in by their name. If he remembers everyone that's pretty impressive. We'll find out the next time we come in.No, for reals! BFG, man! B... F'ing... G!I've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!I ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!When we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!The best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son! And wha!?PUT SOME WASABI CREAM IN YO MOUTH!!Came here with my yelp-izzles a couple weeks ago. LiLy D and I popped our BFG cherries. Elnino F was back for round 2. Owner Jin Choe asked us for our names and he remembered that we had actually met a week earlier when he was picking up food from Soyo where me and a group of the yelp-izzles were getting our drink on. I noticed that he was on a first name basis with all his customers. That's what's up!What I ordered:#1-4 Baked Strips-Baked Mac & Cheese-Garlic Bread-2 Sauces (I picked Wasabi Cream and Buffalo)-Reg. Drink (Arnold Palmer)Everything was yummy yummy in my tummy. The Wasabi Cream sauce was the bomb-diggity!! The service was excellent. Jin came around numerous times to make sure everything was alright and that our sodas were topped off. I will mos def come back to try other items from the menu and the whatever the weekly special is.Thanks for dinner LiLy!I know- how many flippin' review updates am I gonna do?!But it's a BFG first (I think) to have a fan family.It's already known the BF and I already love this place but we brought mom and grandma so their opinion matters.....the place is mom and grandma approved! My mom in law likes their mac n cheese a lot and for a person who doesn't like chicken, admits this is pretty good chicken. Grandma has been wanting chicken strips and she loved it. She's already talking about coming back. We also shared the chicken nachos so I'm 2 of 4 on the specials. Pretty good and a decent portion for $3.25. We all had a plate so we were sttuuuuffffeeeddd, but Jin totally pulled my leg to get it (thanks- I will get it again). The chicken strip phenomenon still perplexes me- so simple but it's crazy how much people it attracts. I love it so I am not complaining. Now I'm keeping an eye on Tin because there has to be some magical voodoo dust in the panko. I have not met a person with bad things to say about BFG yet I've met people who will talk shit even about Joel Robuchons food. One of my friends from Los Angeles knows about BFG and I wasn't the one who told them...seems like the chicken did more than cross the road. Vegas now and onto west coast domination?Have to agree with the positive reviews posted about BFG Chicken Strips.  They serve a simple menu, but the execution of their chicken strips is spot on. Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.It is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right. I tried Combo #1 (maybe not the "healthy" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.About the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.Tinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!Food: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips.Service: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here.Location:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95.Parking: 5/5  The parking lot is large, it should not be a problem.The Skinny: great fried and grilled chicken with awesome unique dipping sauces with some so-so sides(4) Service: even though it's counter service, you get the warm and fuzzies when the owner makes it a point to get to know you (5) Value: a great plate of food (plus fountain drink) for only $5.75 plus get your 10th combo plate for free? - bring it on!(5)Planted in a rather large strip mall, this place is rather inconspicious. Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!Combo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).The grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.The other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.The reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.These are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.Finally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it). This place has the makings of a great neighbourhood joint and I can't wait to come back here again!Okay, enough already!  The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!BFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  The menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.With five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. Their fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.Of course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.And there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!Another perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  And finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.I also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  Their only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to try this place out today!I came with my mom for a late lunch after a full day of shopping. We shared the grilled chicken strips with veggie skewers and the fried chicken strips with the baked mac n cheese. Everything was out of this world delicious and the service was so incredibly friendly and welcoming. I'm a big fan of the fried strips, but I think I almost liked the grilled ones a little better. The mac n cheese was phenomenal and super duper cheesy. Just how I like it. They have an incredible sauces too! My favorite was the wasabi cream. So perfect!The food was incredible, so was the service and on top of all that the prices were beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity that you get. Winner winner, chicken dinner! I'll be back... and soon!Awesome Mac & Cheese!SITREPI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.THE MAC MENUMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate "Classic American Eats", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!SPECIAL PREPARATION!BFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of "cheesification".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)THE LOWDOWNIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.So BFG was created and owned by Jin and Tin who has now sold it to someone. Now, whenever ownership changes there is always a worry if it is for better or worse of the food and service. When a place that had a frontman bursting with personality that built a rapport with people, it's admittedly hard to not miss that. I am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi. I like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that. Service is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial... Still, if you want some good basic comfort food chicken strips, this is where I go and you should too.I think I am in love!!!After hearing about BFG Chicken Strips for months through the grapevine, I was finally able to get over there today and check this joint out.  And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!As the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.  The mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.A great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?So yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out.They put in a fancy soda dispenser and, in order to compensate for the new expense (along with "rising food costs"), have dropped the drinks from being included in their meals. I only got the Gold Peak tea to begin with, so the machine doesn't do anything for me. They also raised the prices of the meals to add insult to injury. I removed one star for removing drinks from the meals and one star for raising the prices while simultaneously giving less. Probably won't be a regular here any longer. The days of BFG are over. Just doesn't seem worth it to support this place anymore. The kid at the counter is still really great with customer service though. He's always friendly and attentive. Just don't like the direction this company is headed in. There are plenty of other places to get my chicken fix.Chicken strips & Thai ice tea ~ why not?Lots of mixed feelings on this place. I came here for two reasons: Yelpers seem to love this place & they have funnel cakes! It's hard to ignore funnel cakes! This place is located in a very large strip mall & walking in I have to say I was not impressed. It was run down. The decor itself is nothing special but I let that slide when things are tidy. They weren't. It was also dirty. Trash on the floors, everything seemed out of place & the kitchen area which is open shouldn't be because there was shit everywhere. For a moment I thought to myself, this can't be it. We ordered the fried strips that come in panko which were great. Fries were ok. Garlic toast was really good & my man loved the hot chick. We also had the baked strips with mac & cheese, both good. Overall the food was good. They gave a wide variety of side sauces & I loved trying most of them. My favorites were the honey mustard & sweet chili. The Thai tea was my least favorite item of the evening as it was bitter & needed more sugar (super disappointing). Now to the funnel cake. AMAZING! It was perfect & couldn't get any better. By far the highlight! I appreciated the pop art (always a good thing to see) but the place really needs a facelift. It also really needs to be cleaned. I didn't take pics of all the issues but someone needs to rescue this place. The food is good & it would taste even better if the atmosphere was improved. Food gets 4 stars but atmosphere & cleanliness get 2 so I settled on an overall rating of 3.It's a good sign when a place is packed with people because that usually means the food is bomb! It wasn't even an hour into Strip-N-Dip being open, and it was packed in there... I decided to order the food to-go because there wasn't enough seating, even after waiting and receiving the food. That wasn't a problem, though, because waiting for these chicken strips was so worth it. The place may be hidden by the building next to it, so if you're getting directions through your phone or GPS, then just keep driving and you'll see it. The interior was black and red with checkered flooring. Everything looked clean and well-maintained. It's a bit small with limited seating, so if you come in on a busy day, chances are there will literally be no seats available. I got the 6 fried chicken strips, which comes with a small slice of garlic bread, 3 sauces, and your choice of side. I also got one baked and one grilled strip a la carte, so I can taste the differences... I am not disappointed in what I got!The baked strip was juicy and tender. I feel like sometimes when chicken strips are being cooked, no matter the method, they run the risk of becoming dry on the inside. I think Strip-N-Dip nailed their cooking techniques because none of their strips came out dry. The grilled strip had the distinct "grill" taste. It was juicy as well, and would be the best thing in between bread for a chicken strip sandwich. The majority of the other strips I had were fried. The fried strips were perfect! The panko breading was a golden brown with a good crunch, and the chicken inside was tender... They hit the bullseye on all of their chicken strips, so I don't think anyone would be disappointed in ordering a certain type. As for the sauces, I got: the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and their strip sauce. The wasabi cream had the subtle taste of wasabi, but with no spiciness. It's a more of a creamy sauce (like their strip sauce), so it's better paired off with the fried strips. The honey mustard, which is a classic, was sweet and paired well with every type of strip. Oh! And they offer Thai iced tea/coffee and funnel cake -- perfect menu items to satisfy your "just desserts" appetite. Strip-N-Dip did not fail to deliver. If you're ever looking for a spot that serves chicken strips that are NOT from Cane's, then this is the spot for you!

Review Text :
Stopped by this evening to attend a Tweetup at this joint.  My friend was hosting the Tweetup and I love Pizza, so why not?  I'm glad I made it!There was a special buffet of food setup just for the event.  Salad, Chicken Wings, Baked Ziti, and of course Pizza!  The Pizzas that were available were Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Chicken & Artichoke, and Cheese.  I ate a slice of every Pizza, a little Salad, about a dozen Wings, and a small portion of Baked Ziti.  I wasn't planning on eating that much...I swear....but the food was sooo good and the owner, Biaggio, came out and insisted that we try everything!  How could I say no?The Pizza is NY style thin crust.....and damn it's awesome.  It folds just right and the proportion of Cheese and Sauce is perfect.  The Meat on the Meat Lover's Pizza is something else too....I don't know if I could ever be a Vegetarian.  I suggest eating the Pizza fresh as the slices can get greasy fast...especially with the Meat Lovers.The Wings were served plain with the Hot Sauce and Dipping Sauces on the side.  Biaggio told us that the Salad Dressing/Dipping Sauces are all made from scratch in the kitchen.  The Bleu Cheese dressing was awesome....didn't have any of the others.  The Wings are battered and were cooked just right....not too greasy, which is how I like them.The Salad was ok....I didn't have much of it though because I ate so much of everything else.  The Baked Ziti was great too.....the Cheese was gooey and full of flavor.After I was done eating, Biaggo brought out Fried Dough sprinkled with Sugar & Chocolate....I had to have a bite....yum!  Then he brought out a cake for his Son's Birthday....what, more food?!  I took a couple of slices home....I couldn't eat any more.Overall, the event was fun and the food was plentiful and awesome.I spied the menu and saw that they serve Breakfast too.....I don't know how I'm going to lose any weight with this place in existence!Will I return?  Are you kidding me?!  I want to try Breakfast and their Subs, and a bunch of other things on their menu....of course I'll be back!Saturday night and the family wanted pizza. We headed over to Biaggio's to see what all the hype was about and it didn't disappoint. We walked in, were greeted by Biaggio (the owner) and his staff and grabbed a seat. We ordered a medium supreme pizza and a slice of cheese pizza for my two year old. While waiting they brought out a complimentary meatball and some bread. The meatball was amazing -- made in-house with a mixture of pork, veal, and some other stuff I don't remember.The wait for the pizza took a little while and when Biaggio checked on our order he found out that they made a meat lovers pizza by mistake. He came out and apologized and said that he would bring it out so we could munch on it while our correct order was being made. The meat lovers pizza was delicious, filled with house made sausage and bacon. Our supreme came out a short time after and that pizza was equally amazing. One of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. Despite all the cheese and sauce the crust remained crispy. That's something other pizzerias fail at.They boxed up the pizza we couldn't finish and on our way out they thanked us for coming and said if it wasn't a five-star experience he'd make it one next time. While I don't normally like it when businesses solicit stellar reviews from customers, the food and service was so good that I can't give them anything less than top marks. Now that Ciao Ciao is closed this will no doubt be our go-to pizza joint.Biaggio joins Bo from Yi Mei Champion Deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet. People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).5 starsI hate to go against the grain, but as a true pizza connoisseur, it would be wrong to hold back on this one. For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. I do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having "burnt" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. I thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. In fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!). This pizza may be appealing to some, but this isn't anything like the pizza served in NY.I have never been treated so badly by a restaurant. I take back my previous statement that the owner is friendly. Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that "wasn't the service" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, "We're out." He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again. You don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to "The customer is always right?" When did it become "The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?"  All he had to do when I came in was say, "I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better," and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back. Not with an owner that treats customers that way.It hurts to write this update.  Biaggio and his staff are super friendly and will bend over backwards to get things right.  Maybe this just wasn't their night last week.  But it still shows how far they'll go for customer satisfaction.   7:45pm: We feel like a pizza.  Just moved closer to Biaggio and the last 2 experiences we had there were good so what the heck.  I order a large supreme with extra cheese.  The lady over the phone tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.  8:10pm: I arrive and the cook informs the cashier he hasn't even started my order yet.  She seems shocked.  There was some grumbling back there with Biaggio and the staff.  Biaggio come up to me and apologizes profusely for the mishap, gives me my $23 back and said he would take care of me the next time as well.  I didn't think it was that big a deal and did not make a stink over it at all.  I said it would not be necessary to take care of me on the next trip and tipped $3 to the staff.  The pizza comes out unusually fast and I go home.8:27 and 24 seconds:  Arrive home and bring the pizza to the dining table and my wife takes the first bite.  The green peppers are COLD.  The pizza is not even warm and the consistency of the cheese is weird.  It was as if the cook took a cheese pizza that had been sitting out for a while and attempted to reheat it with the toppings he just added.  I thought I could just ignore all this and eat it but after half a slice, I called the restaurant and explained the situation.  The cashier offers to deliver a hot one to my house at no additional cost.  Fine!  Why would the cook think he could get away with giving me that first pizza?  Did he just think we wouldn't notice?  It was kind of offensive.  I've never returned a pizza ever before!  I couldn't believe it. 9:03: New hot pizza arrives and it's definitely oozing with cheese.  It doesn't have as much pepperoni or sausage but still way better than the first one.  The thing was that this new pizza was NOT five stars.  Not even close.  I could rattle off 5 other places off the top of my head that were better than this.         But the service, effort and attempt to do right is what saves it from giving them 2 stars.  I honestly believe this could've been just a bad night but I hadn't eaten there in over a year and won't give it five stars if it doesn't deserve it and tonight it certainly did not.  I am coming back for wings and pastrami but on the border for pizza.given latest move, I spend more time at the LVAC gym at Flamingo/215 than the Eastern location.  I have a new rule - when megabucks or Powerball lotto jackpots exceed $100 million, I drive to the NV/Cali border to buy tickets.  well, they are both currently over $100 million so on Wednesday, post work out, I start the drive, but, it is lunch time and since Biaggio's is nearby, how about a few slices to go ?I opt for the two slice soda special costing $6.  While waiting, talked to owner about how long it's been since my last visit.  The owner is a hoot - an old school guy !the slices took a little longer than it should given they were not busy - who knows, maybe it was a fresh pie being cooked.Anyways, the pizza was above average.  First of all, I was appreciated of having bite sized pieces of sausage on top - seems simple enough but last several pizza experiences involved "sausage strips"  not to my liking.  I really liked the crust - thin but not paper thin, had a crunch to it yet also some softness, too. could have used a tad bit more sauce but not a major issue.Overall, worth a return if i'm hankering for pizza post-work out or in the area for other escapades.pic includedI really wish I loved this place as much as everyone else does because it is ridiculously close to where I live. Unfortunately, it fell short of the hype.I ordered delivery from Biaggio's and everything went fine, nice person over the phone, delivery was on time (you'd hope so since I could literally walk there). My gripe was with the pizza itself, along with the side orders I had.I've had pizza in NYC, this is not NYC style. The crust is much thicker, the sauce was thick and the cheese made a hard layer over the top. You know that kind of cheese, that would all just come off in one piece? It was like that. The crust itself had small bumps on the bottom which means it was probably baked in a pizza tray, and not just tossed and slid into the oven. All of this is perfectly acceptable if this is your taste, but it's not for me.I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, and the salad came topped with olives, cheese, tomatoes and cucumber. The tomatoes were mealy and tasteless because they had been in the fridge for too long. The dressing wasn't as sharp as I'd like and I ended up adding some red wine vinegar at home.I ordered the zucchini sticks specifically because it said "sticks." I hate zucchini rounds, because when they're cut like that, they get overcooked and loose their texture. It also means a lot more breading, and rounds are always breadcrumbs. I like zucchini sticks that are beer battered, and was hoping these would be like that, but knew not to expect the beer batter. I was disappointed, since I was expecting sticks at least.All of these things I think mostly come down to a preference, but I didn't see the same quality everyone else did. I might end up giving this place another try, but with Those Guys also in the vicinity, it'll be tough for me to break away after my first experience.Service is excellent & very friendly. Establishment was clean.Value is good... $5.99 for 2 large slices and a drink.Pizza is average. We ordered the pineapple & ham slices, which were ok. I ordered the "Art of Chicken" which consisted of diced white meat chicken, artichokes, peppers, garlic and black olives. The picture shown in the restaurant was nothing close to what I got. The toppings were piled on after, on a sauceless cheese slice. I guess this is how they customize each plain slice. What bothered me the most was the smell of dirty dish rag that kept wafting from the pizza or was it the parmesan cheese shaker? It was hard to say. I didn't enjoy it at all, but luckily I did get a backup slice of cheese as my 2nd pick. The cheese slice was good, but swimming in a pool of grease. Be careful not to splash it on your clothing like I happened to do.I wish I enjoyed it more as the people in there were very nice and kept asking, "was it delicious?". I didn't have the heart to say "no...", so I just nodded.There is a certain smell of garlicky sauce, a hot pizza oven, etc. when you first walk into a really good pizza place that unfortunately Biaggio's lacked.3.5stars...I was craving chicken wings tonight during a Netflix marathon but was too lazy to get out of the house so I turned to yelp for some help. Chicken wings: Ordered 30 wings. These wings are so good! Fried and juicy without being too oily. They arrived hot and crispy with sauces on the side. Garlic knots: I'd pass on these. We ordered an order of 6 and only finished 1. Fries: Nothing special...White pizza slice w/ mushrooms: Underwhelming to say the least. It tasted as if it was left out all day. The slice was cardboard-like. The cheese reminded me of rubber. I tried reheating it in the oven but it didn't help much. The chicken wings were absolutely delicious but everything else was disappointing. I have a feeling that the wings may have held up the order which would explain why everything else arrived cold. The order came out to $50 before tip. Overall, I'm happy with the order.  My cravings for good wings was satisfied and I got to finish an entire season of House of Cards without leaving the house.

WHERE: Located in the plaza on Charleston & Sloan.WHEN: 10am-930pm, I believe.WHY: If you happened to just recently move around this side of town, and are desperately in need of some quick and great tasting Hawaiian food, look no further!WHAT: I had got off from work and straight home to some hungry brothers of mine! We debated on what type of food to eat, and came to conclude we were all craving some good old Hawaiian food! I would usually drive that 5 minutes to Island Flavor, but the 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes from our new place! Boohooo!!! =(I then decided to search on Yelp, and I was lucky enough to spot this SPOT. Muahaha!!First thing's first. We step in to order. My brother and I both get the chicken combo, while my other brother gets the local plate. (Most plates are 8 bucks and well-worth the 8 bucks!!) While we are waiting for our food, the server brings us a bowl of MISO SOUP!!! C'mon, who has ever had a side of miso at a hawaiian joint!! I say BOMB.COM!!! That right there = SOLD! Haha.After a minute or so, we got our actual combo plates. Fast service, I may add! I loved the chicken katsu, but my bbq chicken was on the bland side.  I could suggest adding a little bit more seasoning or even bbq sauce would have done the trick! Besides my bbq chicken, everything was splendid! I will definitely come back on those chicken katsu crave days!

A small, elegant and pricey Italian place in a surprising strip mall location. My work associates and I came here on a quiet weeknight with good appetites, and we were not disappointed.The menu was simple but had lots of good choices, plus there were four or five specials that night. I chose the red snapper special, and it was excellent, large, and perfectly cooked.  A delicious bottle of light chianti for the table, and we were set.Ambiance was very pleasant: Red curtains on one wall, birch branches in vases, elegant photos and prints surrounded us. The service was also excellent and attentive. I'll make an effort to return if I'm in the area again.

I tried Sushi Imagine for lunch, I have yet to go there for dinner. After yesterday's lunch, I'm really looking forward to it.After drooling over some of their food pictures, I decided to head there to try their famous Sunshine Roll. However, after looking at the menu, it would've been foolish to not take advantage of their lunch specials. Tuesday's $5.00 lunch was grilled mackerel & kara-age(bite-size fried chicken) including salad, rice, & miso soup. I settled for their 3-piece nigiri, tuna, salmon, & shrimp with California Roll. Accompanied with miso soup, also. $5.95. Great deal, I thought. Fish tasted fresh and yummy. I'm not sure if I looked at the kids menu, because they had a regular chicken teriyaki bowl special for $2.99. I ordered that for my son and we shared everything. Our bill = $9.56. Nice! Moms of toddlers: it was ultra cute when the server brought my son an adorable kid's plate, that came with matching fork & spoon!It's a small place with only about 5-7 tables and seats at the sushi bar. The staff  greeted us warmly and our food was served fast. Our server was very nice, I did notice she forgot my water. No big deal since I had brought a water bottle for my son. That is overlooked if my server is smiling.. and remembered my extra wasabi! Other thing that was noteworthy was she seemed hesitant when I asked them to substitute my shrimp nigiri for something else equivalent. They did...just was hesitant, it'd make me wonder if they are very open to substitutions. I'll see when I go back!I glanced at their rolls and dinner combos. Rolls were priced about the same as other sushi joints, and dinner combos had a big variety to choose from. I'll write an update after trying their Sunshine Roll my next visit. I just had to say I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch there!

Has this cafe always been here?  I have no idea.  I discovered this cafe was here when we were setting up an event for work, and my boss said we were getting lunch here.  Who am I to complain about free lunch?You walk up to the counter, order, and find a seat.  There is real silverware and plates, but we ended up taking food to go.  They provided us with plasticware and napkins.The menu is small.  There were four sandwich options, two soups, a salad, and a few other things.  What I really liked is that each sandwich came with a side.  I got the buffalo chicken breast sandwich ($8.75), which had buffalo chicken breast, America cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  The sandwich was large and tasted good.  I had two little cheese and sun-dried tomato risotto bites.  They were delicious, and I wish there had been more.  Apparently the chips for a side are good as well, and there were quite a few of those in a portion.The service was friendly, and everyone was happy with lunch!

Review Text :
Took Mom here for lunch on May 1st.  She was looking forward to it, as she had seen Sofrita's segment on Check Please! Arizona on DVR the night a few days before, while I had just seen it the previous night, although I've bookmarked to try this place for many months now, ever since I saw it advertised in the defunct Redendo's Pizzeria on FLW.Mom ordered the Shrimp Street Tacos, which she very much enjoyed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA#XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA  I asked what in particular was the best part of this dish for her, and she said that the shrimp were of very good quality- big and great texture. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ#mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ  I had the bruschetta board, choice of four, which Mom was also looking forward to trying, since it was featured on the show.  I ordered it, because it was one of the few items I could try (other than the salads) since the tacos were all encased in corn tortillas (corn allergy).  Their website mentions sandwiches, but I don't recall seeing any listed in their one-page menu...  I chose (from left to right) Cilantro hummus- awesome flavors, and one of my favorites of the four; Red pepper hummus- didn't impress me, but I've had a sensitivity to red bell peppers over the past few years, but Mom loved this one (!); Smoked salmon (with egg salad El Diablo and capers, and diced cucumbers as well, for those who are allergic to cukes)... this was another one I liked; and Chicken salad (with raspberry mayo and dried cranberries)- took me a couple of bites transitioning from the smoked salmon for me to enjoy this one.  I liked the textural differences from the soft mouth-feel of smoked salmon and egg salad to the chunky grilled chicken cubes and chewy dried cranberries.  Mom didn't care for it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q#8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q  And last, but certainly not the least, was the star of the show... Postre de caramelo, or simply "Santa Marta," a yellow cake, which reminded me of pineapple upside-down's yellow cake, with a layer of flan on top, toffee crumbles, and caramel and cream sauces drizzled on top.  I had the berries on the side due to an allergy (yes, it sucks to be me).  The two-sauce combo also gave the yellow cake a slight "tres leches cake" flavor, which I love.  This was a big hit with Mom!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ#wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ3.25 stars for now, but we definitely want to go back.  Mom wasn't happy about the prices, but our server, who I later found out was the manager (chatted her up after Mom left and I paid the bill), and the kitchen were willing to work with my allergies and tried to accommodate.  I love that the area is across the water fountain!  I somehow missed the fountain on my way to the restaurant (we came in separate cars), and I was on my way home when I spotted it across the street, so I parked at the shopping complex and went for a stroll.  I want to take Mom back to Sofrita, so that she and I can have a stroll after.  That is, if I can talk her into it...  Btw, the fountain comes alive on the hour, every hour, and I was lucky to catch the show before it turned off around the 15-minute mark.p.s.  The unisex restroom was quaintly-decorated (unlit ritual candles, wood sculptures, etc).  It's dark in there, which may have contributed to the slight urine odor I detected, possibly from little boys (and/or perhaps drunk men) missing their marks?  I didn't want to stay long enough to find out.  I meant to say something to our server on my way out, but got sidetracked talking about Redendo's former pizzeria location on FLW that was sold a couple of years ago.

Review Text :
Going out for a nice steak dinner on xmas eve has turned into a tradition for us but we opted for something different since we're planning on doing Carnevino for new year's eve.  Glad we did!!The food was tremendous.  The prices aren't that bad either.  Not the most romantic restaurant..much better for a group.Before I get into the food..I have to mention how good their Comme Ci cocktail is.  They got a whole prohibition cocktail thing going on which is all the rage but the Comme Ci was the real deal...totally refreshing.  It was some kind of cucumber, lemon and pepper thing with white rum.  I can't wait to drink these on their balcony during 100 degree weather.  They are $15 though so I gotta try to figure out how to make these at home.  Appetizers:Salade Frisee aux Lardons: Warm bacon vinaigrette, poached eggOur awesome waiter, Keith, mentioned the French eat this salad at home.  If this is true...I'm inviting myself to every random family dinner the next time I'm in France!!  I couldn't get enough of the cured bacon with egg yolky goodness covered over everything.  Steak Tartare: Coleman Ranch beef, capers, cornichonsI had never had Steak Tartare prepared the way they did it.  They mixed the beef in some kind of mayo/horseradishy sauce and it was so fn good.  I could've eaten this as my main course.Entrees:Crispy Skate Grenobloise: Haricots verts, lemon, capers, brown butterBEST SKATE EVER!!  Nothing else to say.  Duck Confit: Pommes Lyonnaise, braised red cabbageNot like I eat duck confit very often but a lot of restaurants seem to use duck breast for it now but duck thigh is really where its at!  Super juicy and flavorful.Dessert:Chocolate Pot du Cr√®me: cardamom cr√®me chantillyLike the best Nutella ever.  There are so many other things I have to try on the menu.  They also have daily specials along w/ raw bar.I want to preface this review by saying something very important...there are only a few things that Rex Marvin hates...that isn't true...but let's pretend it is...Rex hates everything...Rex hates you...but for this exersize in fiction let's say Rex is a good man with a few unnatural hateful feelings.  First would be hard boiled eggs.  Second, the Yankees and all Yankee fans...front running bastards. Last is a common one...the French.  Chicks don't shave. They all surrender at the drop of a hat. The country could be conquered by two determined 14 year olds...quite easily.  Rex is a man. The French have one man...and he is really a she who hasn't shaved or bathed for a long time. Only good thing is those French Broads are easier to bed than it was for the Germans to run past the Maginot Line. I say this for a reason...I am on vicodin and dust cleaner...AND...because I was sent an invitation to "Rex Martin" for a new French restaurant called Comme Ca.  Insert your own "Comme" joke here...Rex doesn't do low brow. (Believe me damn you!) I stared down at my the my mustard sandwich (mustard slathered on my palms) and decided...okay Frenchie...you want it...come get it.I promise two things dear reader...one...I am not wearing pants...two...my hatred of the French is outweighed by my love of food. When I got to the new Cosmopolitan Casino I wasn't impressed.  The parking garage is like a slalom course designed by a drunken idiot.  I get out of the car I "borrowed" and walked quickly for the elevator. I went up to the third floor and found my party. A nice group of people. Very uptight. Three times people asked me if I planned on taking the shoes tied strategically around my neck off and wearing them on my feet. Maybe they just have a foot fetish.  It was weird. Anyway, we sat down and as I looked around I was genuinely confused...and the menu didn't help. Does this want to be a French Bistro or a Gourmet restaurant?  Truthfully...it was never really answered.  The waiters wear this hideous plaid shirt and it is so tacky for an upscale place.On the good side the view is amazing. It is a perfect location on the strip and their balcony is really nice.  Again...not quite right. They had a sitting room and on the tv was a tabloid show.  Honestly? That is what you turn on? Why have it on if something that stupid would be playing?  I sat down next to a darling woman. Sweet. Accommodating. 500lbs. Sweaty. I was in love.  We shared our appetizers.  I had the bone marrow and she had the soup of the day, which was pumpkin or butternut squash...so mediocre I forgot and it has been a very short time.  I sucked it off of her chubby fingers. People vomited in their mouths. I smiled. My shoes dangled brilliantly. The bone marrow was a revelation...it was something really special. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was good. The soup...here we go again...something that should have been good but wasn't. The flavors were muddled and it was desperately under seasoned. The consistency was perfect. Velvety and creamy...too much cream actually...but here is an idea...SALT. I think salt is like soap to the French...something used all too sparingly. It was a common theme. My main course was the Duck Confit.  It was okay. Far too small, especially when I saw my soon to be huge mistress's giant steak and bucket of fries. It was staggering in comparison...it was like a midget standing next to a really small midget baby. Almost too hard to imagine.  The portions were so far out of whack it was ridiculous. The steak and fries was pub food, the duck confit was fine dining...if it was actually done right. Again hopelessly under seasoned and served with a sad little helping of "herb salad". Only if you consider lettuce an herb was that an herb salad.  Again, good and bad, pub and fine dining. To illustrate my point...there is a damn cheeseburger on this menu. Such a muddle concept it is hard to fathom there was any real planning.  Desert...the French have to get this right. Not doing this right would be like not watching Jerry Lewis movies or anally raping Pepe Le Pew...just not right.  Well, bend over Pepe it is time for your degradation and humiliation let's hope you are into that. The "Pot de Cr√®me" tasted like whipped off brand hazelnut spread. Decent but not good.  The Profiteroles of my sweet chunky lover were harder than they should have been...and didn't taste as if they were made fresh. The Apple Tarte was eaten by others and enjoyed.Afterwards Rex went to the bathroom to enjoy a little alone time and when I walked into the main men's room...between the bar and the dinning room...there was ONE toilet. It was a bathroom for one. If that place is packed how the hell is one toilet going to work exactly? Nothing says fine dinning like waiting in line for the John. While I was in there someone knocked to get in...totally ruined the mood for me. I left aggravated. I left chaffed. It was not good. Rex hates any bad food.After perusing every single restaurant in Cosmopolitan, which took some time, my husband and I settled on Comme Ca (pronounced kom-sa, for those who care).  I guess I was expecting this to be a fancy French restaurant but it is casual bistro food.  The servers all look like lumberjacks (red flannel shirts, black pants) which I found amusing.  Although a few patrons showed up dressed to the hilt, this isn't a super fancy kind of place. After being seated, the hostess told us about the balcony and said we could go out there anytime to just look at the Strip.  They have seating and heat lamps out there.  However, we had a good enough view of the Strip from our seats so we didn't make it over there.  It looks cool, though.  It seems like every restaurant in Cosmopolitan is required to make craft, old school cocktails.  Being a big cocktail fan, I ordered a ramble ($15) and my husband got a New York sour ($15).  My ramble was ok.  It was hard to get any of the raspberry flavor since all the raspberries were trapped below under a crapload of ice.  Let's just say I've had better.  My husband's New York sour was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I think I'll stick to American Fish for my cocktail fix in Vegas. The wine by the glass selection is pretty good.  I got a glass of the Orin Swift cabernet ($19), which was tasty.  They also appear to have beer on tap, as I saw some patrons with beer in pints.  Something to try next time.  For whatever reason, I didn't see beer taps at a lot of the restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.  The food here is the main star.  The beet salad ($11) and French onion soup ($11) are absolutely to die for.  Also the steak frites - so yummy.  I opted for the flat iron steak ($29) and it was pretty darn good.  It comes with herb butter on top just in case your fat intake is not all it could be that day.  You can upgrade to a filet for $36 and there was a $56 option of some sort that I don't recall, but why bother when the flat iron steak is so good!  The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  There were a ton of them and we ate them all, even though we shouldn't have.  My husband got the crispy turbot (usually crispy skate, but they were out) for $27.  I was so enamored with my steak I frankly don't remember the fish.  We had a caramel tart for dessert ($9) which was great as well.  It comes with hazelnuts and ice cream which goes so well with the tart.  Great caramel flavor!Service was pretty good but there is a lot of time between courses for some reason.  Our drinks and starter courses came out fast but it took a while to get main entrees and desserts for some reason.  However, our server was really nice and knowledgeable and two managers came by to check on us.The restaurant only has one-stall restrooms, which annoys me.  But the restrooms for the Cosmpolitan are just outside so it's not a big deal. A little disappointed in the cocktails but I'm a tough person to please in that category.  Definitely a fan and I will be back!The decor for this place was definitely the best part. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEAIt was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHAThere are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-wShrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2QCroque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpywMac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMgThe chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeAThe caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3wThe waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.(3.5 stars)This Comme Ca is David Myers' newest restaurant (located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan).  The original Comme Ca in LA can be good or quite average (depending on what you order).  The Vegas location features a pretty similar menu (the same good/average may apply).This Comme Ca has a much better decor/atmosphere.  I've always felt the Comme Ca in LA has really just inhabited its location rather than transformed it.  The layout and design is so much more well thought out here as it combines both French brasserie characteristics and modern touches (which is kind of like the menu--classic French bistro re-imagined for a contemporary audience). The room at lunchtime also takes advantage of its Vegas location.  They use floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a lot of warm natural light (as well as provide a good view of nearby casinos).  I think there is also an outdoor dining area, which probably incorporates The Strip even more.For food, the meal began with a complimentary French baguette--similar to the one they serve in LA but not as good.  It was freshly baked and warm; however, the crust was a little too hard and the bread was too chewy.I went with the 3-course lunch pre fixe ($32).  They give you a good variety of choices in entrees as well as a decent variety in starters and desserts.I started with the endive and watercress salad that was garnished with blue cheese, julienne apple, roasted walnuts, and a sprightly vinaigrette.  The endives were fresh and crisp (great snap to them).  The watercress was also fresh and good.  The combination made for a good salad base.The garnishes were good.  The walnuts provided a good crunch while the green apple gave the salad a good tart flavor.  I also liked the blue cheese, which had a good creaminess to it and was not too pungent, but there was not much of it.  The salad was nicely dressed with the vinaigrette.  It was a light tossing, which kept all the ingredients crisp and not soggy.  Still, the vinaigrette was a little acidic.For my entree, I went with the Scottish Salmon that came with artisanal polenta and oyster mushrooms.  It was a decent portion for a lunch entree.  The salmon was moist and had a good outside sear.  The outside sear had a good flavor, which made it feel like they left the skin-on (even though they didn't).  Salmon can have a strong fish flavor and this one certainly did.The polenta was creamy and pretty good though polenta is not my favorite side.  There was also a mild cream sauce that did not really do much.  There were also some oyster mushrooms on the plate, which were nicely cooked and not rubbery.  Unfortunately, they were incredibly salty.For dessert, I went with the profiteroles.  Like the LA Comme Ca, the profiteroles at lunch were not the standard profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, they filled the profiteroles with Chantilly cream and then topped them with vanilla ice cream and a crystallized sugar garnish.  They then poured a dark chocolate sauce over top of it.The presentation was nicer than the LA Comme Ca's lunch dessert.  Also, the dark chocolate sauce was thinner and had a much better and smoother flavor (but still rich).  The vanilla ice cream was good and creamy.  I liked the crystallized sugar garnish, which provided a good sweetness and crispy contrast.The profiteroles though were not the type of profiteroles I am used to; the profiteroles here were quite small.  They were very crisp on the outside and were not light, airy and soft on the inside.  They tasted more like a cross between a profiterole and a brioche cookie/biscuit.  I saw a photo on Yelp where the profiteroles looked to have the appropriate size and texture so it might just have been the day I went.  The Chantilly cream filling was good.The waitress (Andrea) seemed new (it is a new restaurant after all) and very trained.  She did a good job.  She was pleasant, personable, polite, and very attentive throughout the course of the meal.  She also (though this didn't really impact the overall dining experience) looked very similar to an actress, but I couldn't pinpoint who.Comme Ca's $32 3-course lunch prix fixe is a good deal especially when you consider all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas.  In terms of their regular prices, the prices here are about what you would expect to pay at Bouchon (The Venetian); since they are both French bistros, they have many similar items.  The food at Comme Ca might be slightly less.If you haven't been to the Comme Ca in LA, this one is a decent lunch option for Vegas.  The food was not spectacular, but there was consistent quality with each dish (the mushrooms being the exception).  If you've been to the Comma Ca in LA, You may want to branch out and try something new since the menu is similar.Complimentary parking via valet; parking structure may also be available.Since my first pseudo-disastrous visit to Comme Ca I've been back. And back. And back. I believed the place deserved a second chance-I mean with such a beautiful space and wonderful view it was hard for me to discount it on one grossly inattentive and downright terrible waiter.I'm glad I gave Comme Ca a second (and third and fourth and so on) chance! I've become a fan of their early evening happy hour in which they offer up their 18A menu for 1/2 off. This specialty drink menu is made up of handcrafted drinks with a prohibition style theme. They spare no expense when it comes to the ingredients and the variety, creativity and presentation of this menu just can't be found anywhere else. While I appreciate the unique menu I cannot justify paying $15 for one drink and choose to frequent the bar during happy hour only. Call me a spoiled local, but I've been groomed to appreciate and take advantage of happy hour.Most of my return experiences are based on the bar/lounge area-I was introduced to the bar after winning one of the restaurant's Twitter contests which got me two free drinks off the 18A menu. Since then I've been back several times and have pegged my two favorite bartenders- Len and Tony- however not a favorite drink, only because there's too much good to choose from! Recently I had the Queen's Park Swizzle which was pretty to look at and just as pretty to drink. The drinks are strong, so for those with, say, clean and undamaged livers, proceed to the 18A menu with caution.I ate here during Restaurant Week and had a truly delicious meal with excellent service. Our waiter, Ed, was above and beyond knowledgeable about the menu and walked us through anything we had questions on. When the food was brought out, either he or his assistant explained the dish very well, not only telling us ingredients but any special techniques used in the dish (obvi not getting to technichal). For example, my friend ordered the steak tartare which was served with an egg yolk confit-the egg was cooked sous vide which I thought was interesting. Just little stuff like that showed he took his service standards seriously and that was refreshing.Also had that evening was the tomato terrine (with heirloom tomatoes I believe-YUM), oxtail jam with roasted bone marrow which is just as mind blowing as everyone says, crispy skate and beef cheek bourguignon. All were very well prepared and beautifully presented. The beef cheek was SO tender and served with these tasty sort of potato cakes.  I'm 90 percent sure Comme Ca has ruined all other boeuf bourguignon for me which I think I'm ok with.Looking forward to coming back and giving some other items I've been eyeing a try. Very pleased with the improved service and the outstanding quality of the food!(4 stars for ONLY the Friday/Saturday Lunch/Brunch thing)People find it hard to believe that Rex Marvin can change his way of thinking.  The Rex Marvin who wore a Mao jacket for 11 years after he died. The Rex Marvin who up until 1997 steadfastly believed that Nancy Sinatra would one day be considered the finest entertainer of our lives.  The Rex Marvin who dug up the grave, at great personal peril, of Yuri Andropoz in 1991 because he was convinced that the old commie was still alive.  Yes, that Rex Marvin CAN change his way of thinking.What is this about you ask? SHUT UP I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU!!  A few weeks ago a faithful follower, who has yet to pledge his worldly possessions to me (he says because of the mortality rate of people who do), went to Comme Ca for their new bunch/lunch menu which is available on Friday and Saturday. He raved in his own pedestrian way.  He is a small man with small thoughts. The kind of man who still listens to Sal Mineo records and Men Without Hats 8-track tapes.  Stupid. Mediocre. Tiny penis and even smaller balls.He did say one interesting thing...3 courses...20 bucks!  So I stole 20 bucks from my meth dealer who looks like Ethel Merman and started walking.Desperate to see how the mediocre exists I decided to see what this idiot thinks is so wonderful.  The primary focus of his rant was the duck meat filled cinnamon roll with crispy pork belly and a duck fat frosting. I went back to Comme Ca thinking it would be a disaster...poorly executed as was my previous experience.  When the very lovely waitress (who I have undressed many, many times after my brunch) put the cinnamon roll down on my table I knew that there was a chance that even the stupidest person might be right once. Two bites in I was sobbing uncontrollably and screaming out loud "Why Lord? Why let me taste this amazing delight now and not 58 years ago as a small child!!???" The Lord answered..."because I hate you."  It wasn't actually the Lord it was a Cuban bus boy named Thaigo. That was a bummer. The cinnamon roll was not. It was perfection. It is absolutely one of the best things any human being can ingest. EVER!  Sweet. Salty. Smokey. Crunchy. Soft. All textures. All tastes. Rex Marvin was in love. In love with the waitress and in love with the Cinnamon Roll. If I had to chose which to save in my life raft that raven haired beauty would be on the bottom of the ocean.The second course was a fancy ham and cheese sandwich (there are other options like pancakes but after the sweet roll, I wanted pure savory) and it was terrific. It was a  very fancy gruyere cheese and ham sandwich with a great white sauce and a soft egg on top.  The soft egg made it happen. That was a brilliant touch. The richness of the sauce and the egg elevated a simple sandwich.  If Rex has an issue my bread wasn't great. It was regular white bread, or at least it tasted that way. It wasn't toasted enough but it was too hard, if that makes sense.  The last dish was, and there are choices of  profiteroles or cr√®me brulee, for Rex was the cr√®me brulee and it was the best Rex has ever had. Rex practically stuck his tongue in the ramekin and licked it clean.Rex has one major issue. The coffee. It was horrible. It was bitter, slightly burned and very reminiscent of Starbucks.  Starbucks sucks! At this kind of place you need to do things well and this was a big issue for a brunch.  The waitress, while stunning, was adequate. She was friendly and that made up for it, but when she had more than a few tables Rex was often forgotten...and no one...and Rex repeats NO ONE forgets Rex.Here is another problem...don't say brunch and open at noon!  OPEN EARLIER ON SATURDAY! Try 10am!A better experience than last time. The cinnamon roll will be a great memory of mine until syphilis eventually eats away my memories.  Still, Comme Ca...get it together. If you never want to reach greatness you are doing everything right. If you want to be great, like Rex, you need to start doing it all right. Like the great Myrna Loy told a young Rex "Rexie...you...you...do it all right. Now be a dear and get my teeth from the night stand." She was all class. Comme Ca...you aren't just yet.Damn. Not sure why the hate, the food was delish. Serious Delish.The service was also spot on, even though we were Grouponers, we were treated like high rollers, our server not only was professional, she was cute as a button with sexy southern style and a flirty fun attitude: perfect accent to the upscale decor and high falootin food.I got the Beef Tartare, not something I do most places but it was well recommended and boy, were they right. For an entree, I had the brick roasted chicken with duck fat fried potatoes and yes, that was as drool worthy as it sounds, the chicken was perfect, the potatoes managed a level of decadence not normally obtainable by lowly tubers. My guy ordered the  Bouillabaisse and it was as impressive as you'd expect as a star of the menu.I'll be honest, I don't remember the dessert, but not because it wasn't memorable, I'm sure it was delicious.  But, after all the good wine, amazing food and stellar service, I think I was just blissed out and anything else was just more of the same.During a recent trip to Vegas for a meeting, we dropped into this restaurant for a business lunch.  Having walked by this joint at dinner time and seen the large crowds, I was pleased to see very few people durung the lunch hour.We were seated near the windows so we had nice sunlight coming into the room...which is rare for Vegas casino restaurants....nice touch.I ordered the Comme Ca Burger, $19.The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I immediately noticed that the Ketchup was homemade and not bottled....another plus.  The Burger was also a hand made patty, not frozen.  It was very juicy and delish...yum!The server was pleasant and realized that we were at a business lunch, so she gave us our space to talk and work.  However, she remained attentive to our needs and ensured that our drinks/food were taken care of.Overall, it was a great experience for a business lunch.....good food and service.Return Factor - 90%Stopped off for a drink at Comme Ca before a dinner reservation at Milos... just down the hall at The Cosmopolitan. It's beautiful, classy and the perfect place to take your parents, a date, even a group of girlfriends. I can't see how anyone would be offended to drink or dine here. Pretty impressive bar! The wall of booze and 11 page wine/spirits menu could be slightly overwhelming to even the most experienced drink... But it's a French restaurant in Vegas and they have to be prepared for the most obscure requests.Everyone besides me had a cocktail... Mom really enjoyed her Ginger Joy with pear vodka, sugar, lemon and ginger. A big wino, I went for a glass of sparkling rose. It was the holidays, I was with my family and it seemed like the appropriate celebratory drink. Perhaps I've become accustomed to drinking California sparkling wine vs French champagne, 'cause I did not enjoy my wine very much. It was *very* sweet, almost syrupy. Luckily it had bubbles which made it drinkable. And I was with good company so it wasn't that big of a deal. Perhaps the regular clientele prefers sweet wine to dry? Pure class, all the way at Comme Ca. Grab a cocktail and see where the night takes you!Comme Ca, a French brasserie with a stunning terrace view of the half scale Eiffel Tower, offers a $17.50, three course lunch special featuring delights such as steamed mussels and pot de creme. The best part - lunch runs late.Grab a table at 4:15 p.m. - (lunch close at 5 p.m.)  and linger through the evening.I finally made it to Comme Ca for lunch!  Now what's so special about their lunch you ask?  For me, one specific dish has intrigued me for a long time just because of how bizarre it sounds....their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.I've waited a looooooong time to try their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.  Mainly because I guess it's a seasonal dish and it's been on and off the menu.  Last time I was Vegas, it was off the menu and I was devastated.  Like Harold and Kumar devastated when they discovered that their closest White Castle turned into a hot dog joint.When I arrived at Comme Ca it was for a late lunch and the place was pretty much empty by then.  That's a good thing for me since it would mean that I'd get extra attention from my server.  Her name was Britney and she was awesome!  I loved how she read my mind and knew that I was there for the Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun when I said I wanted something unusually different and waited a long time to try it.So here it is!  Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun with smoked bacon frosting, huckleberry, and Pork Bellyhttp://bit.ly/Vn2SCtWas it worth the hype?  You betcha!!!  It's funny how this is listed on the menu as an appetizer.  The taste is really unique when you have the sweetness from the bun and huckleberry and then combined with the smoked and savory flavor of the duck confit, bacon frosting, and pork belly slices, you have a kaleidoscope of flavors all over your taste buds.  Despite being an appetizer, it was really rich in that whole thing can fill you up.  It's like breakfast, lunch, and dessert all in one!  This definitely ranks as one of the best things I've ever eaten on the Vegas strip.Yeah it may be a little too premature to give Comme Ca 5 stars based off of one lunch dish, let alone an appetizer, but the whole experience with the nice view of the strip, awesome service, and enjoying one of the one of the of creative dishes I've ever eaten, it totally says 5 stars all over!  I can't wait to go back next time!Comme Ca has made its way into my favorites for strip-dining. Prices aren't crazy, food is great, and the way they took the fine dining concept and made it more comfortable is fabulous. The view helps too. Be sure to request a "window seat" when you make your res. Good way to impress your date ;)Servers are dressed in plaid & jeans. They're genuinely upbeat and friendly and I haven't met a server that isn't a good "sales-person" too (if you catch my drift). They also respect your privacy, don't comment on your conversation and know just when to come around. They are very good at what they do. Which is another reason why I like to take people here. It's upscale without being intimidating while offering mid-to-high price items. Nothing says cozy like eating a $75 steak on a paper placemat. You don't have to worry if you're using the right fork or if the stuffy suits next to you think you have bad posture. *kidding* *not really*On the Menu: Not to miss is the Bone Marrow with Oxtail Jam. The bone marrow is average but that Oxtail Jam takes center stage! Lots of tender meat, rich flavor, and little bits of ligament in it. It's just perfection and needs to be eaten on a regular basis. The beef tartare is by-the-book but noteworthy. It's served with some house-pickled stuff which is delicious. If you're considering the Duck Confit, I would skip it. I ordered it once and it was pretty miserable. Maybe miserable is a harsh word but I definitely didn't enjoy it. It was a less than hot and the flavor was lacking depth. Entree-wise, I suggest passing on the steak-frites. I see people order it all the time. It isn't the best in Vegas and not worth the price tag. I made the mistake of ordering it once and was less than impressed. There are so many more tasty options on the menu--like the scallops, short rib or lamb--so why would you settle for something so average? The short rib on the current menu is served with farro (which is my new latest healthy grain obsession--step aside quinoa!) and probably one of my favorite short ribs in Vegas. Seems like there's one on every menu but this one actually stands out. Lamb is also excellent. I like how they incorporate grapes in the recipes--adds a nice touch of sweetness to the dish. Oh, and if your there on a Friday, be sure to order the scallop special at least once. You won't regret it. The food here doesn't scream overly fancy creative stuff but it doesn't have to. Chef Brian does an excellent job of serving up enjoyable versions of these French classics. Just more reason why I think this place is great for dates or group dinners. There's something everyone will love but its still special.Comme Ca translates as not poorly or not bad ... and that's exactly what Comme Ca restaurant at The Cosmopolitan is ... not too bad.The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds. I forget the names, but one Pacific Ocean and the other was Atlantic. The Pacific were smaller, but better.When it comes to Comme Ca for Happy Hour, it is kind of comme si comme ca.This is my third Vegas trip in a row visiting Comme Ca.  It's pretty much become one of my default stops in Vegas that I simply just can't avoid and it's really hard for me to resist coming here for lunch.My last two visits simply just had me order their famous Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and call it a day.  Well, that didn't stop here with this visit.  But unlike those two visits before, I came with a bigger appetite and I ordered the their Oxtail Eggs Benedict as my main entree.Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll with Pork Belly --  http://bit.ly/1c1GQSFw/ smoked bacon frosting, raspberry compoteThis is one of those dishes that seem to get better every time I have it, even for the third time.  Like before, it's really hard to explain in words how amazing this thing is.  Sweetness from the cinnamon roll and raspberries, savory duck confit inside, and smokey flavor of the pork belly.  Oh, and there's Bacon Frosting too!  It's really not fair that I have to fly to another state to have this.  A must order every time!!  Oxtail Eggs Benedict  --  http://bit.ly/190ewQcw/ warm goug√®res, spinach, two poached eggs, truffle hollandaiseAre you kidding me?  This is definitely a great savory contrast to the sweetness of Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll.  There's a lot going on with this Eggs Benedict because of the braised oxtail and the truffle hollandaise.  It's oozing with flavor and has a lot of substance.  This is food porn at its finest.  One of the best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had!!I can't help but give high praise for their lunch which is only available Friday through Sunday.  There are plenty of other things to try like their Comme Ca Burger, Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Red Velvet Bacon Waffles. Someday, I'll be back to try their dinner.  I probably don't need to, because I would most likely end up going back for lunch anyways and I'm perfectly fine with that.Came here specifically to try the Oxtail Eggs Benedict! Glad it did not disappoint :DOxtail Benedict ($22): Warm Gougeres, Spinach, Poached Eggs & Truffle Hollandaise. WOW...THIS WAS OUTSTANDING! Loved every bite of this...wish it never ended lol.  Seriously, it was probably one of the BEST things I've ever ate this early in the day!  If you are coming here for breakfast food...do yourself a favor and order this!Croque Madame ($17): Smoked Ham, Gruyere Cheese, Farm Egg & Mornay Sauce. This was outstanding! So much flavor here, every bite puts a smile on your face!  It was very good....not as impressive as the Oxtail Benedict but was wonderful :)Quiche Du Jour ($16): Gruyere Cheese and Mushrooms. I'm not a big quiche fan, but this was pretty good. If you are considering ordering this, I am sure you will enjoy it.Factoring in the excellent atmosphere, great service and AMAZING food, I am confident in giving Comme Ca the 5 star review!  I will be back to give the Burger a run for its money!A beautiful French spot with some amazing strip views!The restaurant is very comfortable and cozy with a sexy Parisian feel. The modern and classic touches are everywhere and the service is always great. On this particular visit we ordered a cheese plate with honey comb which never disappoints and a few french onion soups, then steak & frites for the man & I decided on the special which was trout almondine. All items were great and definitely one of the best french onion soups in town with the perfect crispy, cheesy crust.Let's get to the views. I love sitting in a dark room and just watching my surroundings. The bright colors from the outside keep flashing into the dark room and I love the energy of Las Vegas Blvd. Its all around you but yet you're in a very comfortable spot at a beautiful table just enjoying everything. I also want to point out that they have an amazing social hour menu for cocktails & food at the bar & lounge. We absolutely love this spot.

Oh Mill. You are so fun but overcome with college students so it's sometimes hard to enjoy your splendor -- until now that it is. Welcome Canteen Modern Tequila Bar. You are welcomed with open arms to Mill! You are trendy, classy, decently priced and tasty! When I hear the words tequila and bar, I immediately feel a phantom hangover coming on and assume that if I visit, I should be prepared for a long headache filled morning after. But, don't let that fool you about the Canteen. Although the tequilas are top notch and flowing straight from the border, there's much more than lime and salt to this place. Let me first start with the decor. It doesn't quite fit in with the divey feel of Mill but that's a good thing. Similar to the class La Bocca brought to the street, the Canteen has a classy edge to the decor. It's very open. You could easily have a large party here and still have room for more. There are two patios; one off the front and one off the back. The bar is spacious and there's also a patio off the bar -- so actually there are three patios! I thoroughly enjoyed the back patio. The tables are high tops with cushioned seats and umbrellas. The tables are far enough apart from each other that you aren't sitting with a neighbor and sharing your salsa with them. I could easily see this being a fun restaurant at any time of day or night and it's going to be a perfect leisurely spot to stay for awhile. Now on to the food. Delish! First of all, go during happy hour. Between two of us, we had two margaritas, two taco plates, salsa and guacamole and it was only $10 a person. The items on happy hour have "hh" next to them -- and there's a lot to choose from. I think I pay more at a local Mexican fast food restaurant! And though the food is competitively priced, you wouldn't know by the taste. The margaritas are freshly made with lime juice and not pre-made margarita mix. I could absolutely tell the difference and while I'm not normally a huge Margarita fan, I could see these being dangerous and turning the night into a 5 margarita time. The guacamole was freshly made and had a good kick to it. We had the Cascabel salsa which is what I suggest. It was a tasty salsa to accompany the guacamole. When I saw that an entree comes with three tacos, I was worried it would be too much, but they are actually street style tacos so three is just the right amount. I left satisfied but not too full. I got the chicken tacos and my friend got the shrimp and we split. I like the chicken tacos better than the shrimp but they were both excellent. Add some of your guacamole and salsa to them and they are supreme! I think that Julian Wright did an excellent job adding a little bit more flare to Mill and I see this restaurant being a huge success. I would absolutely make the drive to visit again and make a night of it here.This place is the shit - so much so that I'm willing to take the light rail all the way from midtown to partake of its delicious drinks and food. Happy hour runs every night of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays, from 4-6:30 and it's one of the best HHs in Phoenix, in my opinion (and I thought that before Phoenix Magazine rated it as such). You can get 50% of house margaritas (quite large and decently strong), bottled/draft beer, premium well drinks and all tequilas. Plus, select food items, including some of the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had, are also 50% off. Those mushroom tacos with roasted blue cheese make any reasonable person not miss meat and have a very complex and sophisticated flavor profile. The cool indoor/outdoor vibe is the icing on the cake and makes this a perfect place for Phoenix day drinking. Take the light rail there, get drunk and soak up the rays. You won't regret it.

Ok, I heard about this place from a friend on Twitter.  Their Twitter account is:http://twitter.com/FusionTacosIf you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.From what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.The place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)The Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.Overall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!Will I return?  Absolutely!Whoa! This is my new favorite hole in the wall. It's currently in the middle of a tiny carneceria but they are moving by the end of the year. It sounded like they might be planning on becoming an actual restaurant, rather than a grocery counter with food.Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food. Huh!The owners are Korean, but they speak Spanish. Linda, the owner, said her husband was cooking her some food and everyone was interested. And their fusion food was born.I started with a bulgogi taco. I think I prefer Hanshik BUT...the taco was $1 and muy delicious.I then got a bulgogi teriyaki bowl and a pork tamale to go. The teriyaki bowl was $5 and the tamale was another $1. That food will probably last me for 4 meals.The teriyaki bowl is delicious. I mean, best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. Yum. Yum. Yum!And the tamale was even better than the teriyaki bowl! I freakin' love this place. Cheap, delicious, creative, good eats. I couldn't ask for anything better.I will be back..again and again.Edit:This place has moved and is now a full-time restaurant, rather than carniceria with a food counter.If you're looking for atmosphere, forget it.If you're looking for delicious comfort food, go check it out!I haven't eaten everything on the menu (yet), but most everything I've had seems to have Korean influences, which makes sense given that the owners are Korean.I got some wonton soup today. It's really not much like traditional wonton and Korean flavor peeks through....but it's delicious, comforting, and a bargain.The tacos are now $1.25 and still muy delicious! I came in for takeout, but Lynda still brought me out a side of chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were kind of soggy in the middle like homemade...and that's the way I like my chips, but others might disagree.Still, a ton of food, and a ton of flavor, for very little money. And I still love this place!My wife heard about this place on Yelp and really wanted to try it. So we ventured over last weekend. I am glad we did!This is one of the best Korean/Mexican fusion places I have been to. WAAAY better than Hanshik taco and maybe even better than the famous Kogi trucks in L.A.We got the chicken, beef, and pork fusion tacos. We got the chicken in a lettuce wrap and the other two in a corn tortilla. We also ordered the bulgogi burrito. Everything was great. I preferred the tacos, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I'm not a big fan of rice in my burritos.I plan to be a regular customer.OHHHH YEAH!Love this place and will be going there a lot.  Let's start with their story.  They are a nice Korean couple who ran a Mexican market for 10 years.  Their food isn't a copy of the Kogi truck phenomenon in Southern California but rather a result of their experience at the market. They sold tacos, burritos, etc at their market.However, they cooked food for themselves.  So they would blend mexican food with korean bbq, chinese food, etc.  Pretty soon customers would ask them what they were cooking/eating and ask if they could try it.  Long story made short - eventually their fusion food was doing much better business than the market itself.  So they made the leap to open up their own restaurant.Now - on to the restaurant.  It doesn't have a ton of decor but that's to be expected from folks opening up their own business on a shoestring budget.  The food, however, is outstanding.I had the following:Burrito with Korean bbq pork.  This was definitely the highlight of my meal.  Served with a side of kimchee (though I'd recommend you ask for it inside the burrito if you want the best experience), the bbq pork is absolutely delicious.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, and savory.  Served with rice and veggies inside.  They serve the kimchee on the side cause they are worried about how Americans will react to it.  But I think you need the tangy kimchee to balance out the richness of the meat.  That's standard cooking.  The owners also bring you 3 hot sauces.  A korean chili, mexican hot sauce, and the owners' own house made hot sauce.  I'm not a big hot sauce person, but the owners' sauce was really excellent and flavorful.Taco with bulgogi (beef).  A big, meaty taco that has too much to eat without spilling out the fillings.  I don't think that's necessarily great to have so much on top but I know others will love the value.  Served with a lime wedge as is traditional.  Nice tender, flavorful meat with nice crispy veggies.  They serve you tortilla chips and salsa while you wait.  They seen to be from flour rather than corn tortillas which is unorthodox but fine.  The value is definitely there.  It's cheap.  I actually think they should raise the price a buck on all the food and move to a richer neighborhood but that's just me.  I will back here many times.  This is really a hidden gem.After many sleepless nights I've decided a name more appropriate for KoMex. ChiKoMeRican Fusion Express. What the heck is right. I don't think I've have ever ate anywhere that serves Korean-Mexican fusion, Mexican, Chinese, and American. It is like the food court at a mall fell into a pot and KoMex was the product. What I like:- Uber cheap food. For $1.25 you can get a taco, but not just any taco, Korean marinaded beef, chicken, or pork sheltered by two corn tortillas OR protein style (lettuce) at no charge! Good bye Taco Bell Grade D "meat". - It tastes good. YEAAAAAAAA!- The portions are very generous. You can't even hold a taco without the lettuce, purple cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro falling out.  - Everything is cooked to order, just in case you were wondering why your taco is taking 10 minutes. - FREE chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. They make their chips from flour tortillas though, but, it is free. - FREE fruits for dessert. Sometimes I've gotten oranges and other times watermelon.- Drink selection is pretty interesting. Jarritos, Voss water, typical sodas, lemonade, Starbucks frappuccinos, and I believe I saw a coconut juice drink. What it is not:- This is not a Kogi's. KoMex serves food more family like and Kogi's is more street and greasier.- No Korean only items. I'll live. - Fancy. It is not in the best of spots, or has nice decor, but it gets the job done. - Going to make your wallet or bank account cry.- Going to give you a reason to regret. yeaaaabuddy!I'm a good honest man. I don't cheat. I don't lie. And I certainly don't steal. But KoMex makes me upset for making me feel like a thief! I'm actually upset that this place charges so little for the amount of quality food they serve. At the end of every meal, I get this guilty feeling like is this check a mistake? I can't buy this much happiness for so little. This place puts cheap fast food to shame. Try to spend $10 here for lunch and finish all the food they serve and you will understand. That's just speaking volume. Now as for the quality, my god! I can't even get my grass fed organic meat to taste this great. The other reason for the 5 stars, the Wontons! Fried or boiled. Unbelievable! 4 for a dollar is absurd. Now this is the definition of bang for your buck. Nothing in the universe can taste this good, per bite per $0.25 period.Say MexKoWhen I was a kid I saw this commercial where someone carrying a piece of chocolate fell into someone holding peanut butter, and peanut butter cups were discovered! Now, that's fusion! I don't know who fell into who here but mixing  Korean and Mexican did not have the same effect as the peanut butter cups for me. And don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad but I would rather have either Korean or Mexican, but not mixed, which they also serve. I did like the chips the salsa and the guacamole they were very tasty, and I would stop here just for that.Service was very good, very friendly and attentive. The place is small but kept clean. Oh! And the Korean lady taking my order and asking me how I wanted the food made, in Spanish! Now that's a bonus star! (Review went from three to four.) I will probably stop again  and try other items, Mexican or Korean but not mixed. For now, I'll just stick to my own Korean, Mexican fusion..... me and my Hyundai.Korea and Mexico are almost 7,000 miles apart.  The only herb in common, cilantro.  Why the fusion works?  Who cares.  Its just really good grindz.All three fusion tacos (bul-gogi, dak-gogi, and daeji-gogi) are great.  The proteins are all deeply marinated, slightly charred and overcooked (it works) and served hot with cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions, all overstuffed in a corn tortilla.  Perfect contrast of both temperatures and textures.  Add some kimchee and hot sauce (several choices but the Asian works best) and you got it all (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy).  Fusion street food heaven!The burrito is equally good.  Same great beef, chicken, or pork with the same taco toppings and the addition of seasoned rice all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  Once again, squeeze some lime, add some hot sauce and its all good!  (It even taste good cold especially at 2am at the tables). Prices are...heck, dirt cheap ($1.29 a taco, $4.99 for a burrito).  Dine in and you get free chips, salsa, and guacamole.Recommended.Almost six months had passed since I last reviewed this fine little restaurant, and it was time for a return.  I found it to be just as accommodating as before, offering free bottled water and complimentary homemade tortilla chips with a spicy guacamole dip.  I was even supplied with extra guacamole at no charge when the first quantity ran out.This time I wanted to try new items.  So, I had a half-order of Wonton Soup and a full order of Mark's Favorite Chow Fettuccine.  The Wonton Soup was a simple but delicious bowl of Cantonese goodness.  It contained 4 doughy wontons filled with ground beef and pork, 1 button mushroom, some onions, and a touch of whisked egg floating in a very hot, very tasty broth.  A full order costs only $1.00 more, and contains 8 wontons!  My main dish could easily have filled two diners, and it was probably folly for me to eat the whole thing in one sitting.  About two-thirds of the way through, I was asked if I wanted a to-go box--as if that was the normal regimen for a single diner--but foolishly declined and forged ahead until I was thoroughly stuffed.  And, my bathroom scale made me pay for that extravagance the next day.The food itself consisted of a generous amount of hunks of tender chicken, pieces of lean beef, and medium-sized nicely stir-fried shrimps mixed with green and purple cabbage, red and white onion strands, green and red bell pepper slices, some carrot splinters, and oodles of fettucinne nicely mixed together with a very light brown sauce.  The dish just needed a little salt, which slight application of soy sauce quickly provided.  It was a fine platter of multi-flavored and textured treats.  Complimentary orange slices and a fortune cookie were brought to the table at meal's end for a refreshing finish to a very substantial lunch. I did notice one thing different from my two previous visits.  Instead of several casually clad 20-something males predominantly in attendance, this time the nearly completely full small dining room featured a wide mix of diners, including snowy-haired senior couples, young men in suits, a technician in surgical scrubs, the middle aged, and a young couple.  The demographics have shifted to a wider audience as the kudos keep coming in for this no longer obscure, cook-to-order gem.I am so late on this bandwagon.  Writing a review for this now is like just getting into the "Lost" TV series yesterday.   Loved it all.  Kimchi was a must have for my tacos.  I enjoyed the pork, bulgogi and chicken in that order.  I wondered what their regular Chinese or non-fusion dishes are like but I will never know.  If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.  Free fried wontons with a check-in.  Afternoon lunch coma sets in upon completion.  Corona or Hite beer would compliment their stuff perfectly.  Maybe they let people byob?W - O - W !What can I say...Eric R. and I came for Jen S.'s UYE, and it was a grand time!The contest: $10 for all you can eat tacos (your choice of meat and sides) and free soda, iced tea or water for 15 minutes.The challengers: Eric R., Tiffanie R., Gabe, Jen S., and Danny.  The first four did the challenge at the same time, and Danny upon entering battled in round 2.It was a meaty, fast-paced chewdown with flavors flying and lots of excitement.  Jen and Eric were neck-and-neck when it got to tacos 9-11, but Eric's one extra bite claimed initial victory.  Enter Danny, who inhaled 8 tacos in 7 minutes, with all looking good, but he hit a wall, and after 9, Eric R. was declared the winner. The prize: a KoMex t-shirt and a picture with a sign that read, "I ate 11 tacos and one bite!"Tiffanie got recognized for being the only woman brave enough to try the challenge.Otherwise, for us sane people: Lily, Jieun L., Anthony M., Tony T., and Paolo D. - oh, and me! - we ordered from the menu.  I missed out on the free check-in wontons because they have pork, but we were given 4 plates of them generously!  We also got chips, salsa, guac and 4 hot sauces.  There was one I really liked with onions and Korean spices and other herbs.Everyone seemed to go for the lettuce wrap tacos except Paolo who ate his Torta Ahogada in record time and licked that plate clean!I got one beef fusion taco with avocado and jalepeno, and one fusion tostada, the star of the show...a rice patty (perfection!) topped with chicken, lettuce, pico, Korean hot sauce, avocado and jalepeno.  It was so amazing I wanted another one but refrained from overstuffing myself!  I think I am now hooked and next time I am over here, it is 2 rice patty tostadas for me!I also enjoyed the delicious mango-passionfruit iced tea.  I also noticed in the cold case KoMex carries Sweet Leaf mint and honey iced tea, the only sweet-ish tea I will drink (and it is made in AUSTIN!)Soooo much fun and I really liked everything I tasted.  Thank goodness Jen S.  hosted this fabulous event so we could finally eat here.  We also ran into Clint B. here who was here with his family for dinner!In this battle of man versus tacos, Eric R. won!NEWS FLASH! THE HYPE IS REAL! I REPEAT, THE HYPE IS REAL!%$#@!@#$% Sorry, that was me banging my head repeatedly on my laptop keyboard because I am so mad at myself for not going to this place a lot sooner! I couldnt wait to get home to do this review and I hope my keyboard is gonna work long enough for me to finish this!I ordered the Bulgogi Beef Burrito and my son ordered the Beef Bulgogi/Spicy Pork combo so we can share. OMG I couldnt make up my mind what to eat so me and my son split both meals.The Burrito has the best of both Korean and Mexican worlds! Now I know why they named themselves that. This tasty choice has Meat with Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian (Soy/Sesame base Sauce).Service is, let me put it this way, a little slow BUT before you jump to conclusions, you have to understand that they make everything from scratch and if a big party before you put their order in, then that is what is gonna go through first. That's understandable because if you ordered before somebody else, whether big or small, you should get it first right? With that said, I was a little irritated at first, but when my food came out and went straight to my mouth I was mad at myself for being irritated because the food is well worth the wait! I recommend that you don't be in a rush to go anywhere else if you plan on eating here and if you can order to go, that's even better because by the time you get there, it should be done.With the popularity of this place blowing up, I see one of two things that might happen: Either they open up another place or move to a much BIGGER location or both. The demand is definitely gonna out do the supply sooner or later because on really busy nights you are definitely gonna have to wait a while to get a table.Some random info: They are closed Mondays so make sure your cravings don't fall on that day! They have free wifi but I couldnt get my phone to work with it so maybe next time I will ask them. Parking can be a nightmare because they share the same small lot with other tenants. They take all major credit cards but be advised that anything under 10 bucks, you will be charged a service fee so as much as you can, pay with cash for all orders under 10 bucks. Its not Komex's fault. Its just that anytime you have a terminal for accepting cards, the company that processes it charges the business owner for every transaction. So you see its not a ploy for Komex to make more money. It's more like a convenience fee for not carrying cash. They don't have a take home menu for the info you need but you can look it up through their website:  www.komexexpress.com So with 350+ reviews averaging 4 1/2 stars, what more reasons do you need NOT to go here?I would like to thank all my Yelpmates for their wonderful reviews. If it wasn't for them I would have  no clue about this place. You know who you guys are your all on my Yelp friends list who have reviewed KoMex. You guys ROCK!So I woke up today around 4:00pm, still a bit jet lagged from my Asia trip, and i was craving Asian food, but something different than my usual eats.So I decided to finally check out KoMex. I was a bit reluctant to go because it is so freaking far from where I live. I checked out google maps and it told me it was going to take me 30 minutes to get there.I decided to go anyways and give it a whirl. I texted my roommates and they too wanted to go with me.About 25 minutes later we finally reached KoMex located on Decatur in small plaza. ( I must say DAMN! they need to open one in Henderson)The location is a bit far but i must say i do not regret going. The HYPE about this place is true! This place is awesome!I ordered the Bulgogi Taco and the Pork Taco which were cheap only $1.29 each.  Both tacos were to die for! They were a perfect size too!We also decided to try the Bulgogi Nachos for $7.99. This nachos is not your typical nachos. The chips itself even taste way better than your average mexican restaurant chips and their salsa and cheese are way awesome too. The nachos was so good i highly recommend this dish while over there.So since this place was far i decided to order more food. I figured hey might as well, I don't finish it at least I have leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast tomorrow. So i deicded to order the Kimchi fried rice with beef. I must say it was orgasmic! I'm normally not a fan of Kimchi, because it's too spicy for me. But who cares after eating KoMex's  nachos.Overall i give this place a  5 star. Good food! Very cheap! and friendly staff. I am looking forward to try the Bulgogi Fries on my next visit. Try now! Komex will give you the ultimate FUSION experience between Korean and Mexican!WHO: To all of you Korean food wrapped in tortilla goodness lovers!WHEN: I'm not too sure when they open, but I do know they close at 9pm.WHERE: North Decatur, sooooo far but soooo good! =/WHAT: It all began one night at about 8pm. My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lolWhen we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!I FINALLY made my way to KoMex after long anticipation and boy, did it live up to its hype! I stopped in after finding myself on "that" side of town and had luckily arrived ten minutes shy of their opening time. My guy and I sat in the car to wait until the clock struck 11. As we did, I noticed car, after car, after car pull into the parking lot. I kept eying the rearview mirror saying aloud, "I wonder if they're going to KoMex..." As I watched the first car full of people make their way towards the KoMex door, I jumped out of the car and dashed for the door (I entered first by the way). We took our seats and browsed through the menu. While there were many items on the menu I wanted to try, we agreed that we HAD to try something off the fusion side. We decided on sharing an order of the Bulgogi fries and musubis on the side (the latter selection mainly due to the fact that I have a man from the islands). So, the place filled up within minutes of being there and while we waited, we were served homemade chips that were warm, crisp, not too salty, not too greasy. Just my style. The fries arrived first and man, were they delicious! The mixture of flavors of everything atop the mound of goodness was perfect-- It somehow tasted as though you topped off an order of Gordon Biersch's garlic fries with perfectly cooked bulgogi. Let me tell you, it tasted better than an order of Roberto's carne asada fries after a night of intoxication. The musubis arrived shortly after and didn't disappoint. I've actually never seen them molded the way they did-- they were wider and flatter than other places usually make them. Two things I did observe during my visit which is the only reasons why I didn't tack on that extra star:1) As a holder of a food handler's card with lots of knowledge of food handling, I did observe one of the workers wearing the same pair of food handler's gloves the ENTIRE time I was there. The same pair was used to scoop ice, serve drinks, serve food, get items from the back, move the kitchen curtain, etc. I received a plate with a little bit of food on it as well as the drink I ordered having remnants of food that wasn't mine. 2) I should've chosen my seat differently. I sat in a position directly across from the opened gate that separates the little prep counter with the customer seating. This gave me full view of the large garbage can that I wish I hadn't had view of during my entire meal. Next time, I'll sit elsewhere. Can't wait to return!It takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightHit it!I wanna eat right nowI'm Greg N, and I came to chow downThis place is not internationally knownBut on the Yelp App on your new iPhoneIt's near the top and so highly ratedIn Las Vegas: and that's going to be debatedAfter you order, they give you fresh cooked chipsWith pico de gallo and guacamole dipsSome of the best chips that I've ever hadThis free offering made me feel real gladOrder three tacos with beef bulgogiRight on par with that truck called KogiKeep the flo' cuzIt takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightIt takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightHit it!

I don't see what the big deal is...I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.  To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entr√©e failed to pass my taste test.My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK....As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae...I knew that I was going to like this place before even stepping in. Komex is a fusion of Mexican and Asian...my two favorite foods. Their dishes are creative and very different. The fusion fries came in a huge order...very generous portions. I should've probably ordered the half order for my friend and I. The Bulgogi Tostada was my favorite dish...sweet and spicy. We also got the Bulgogi Nachos which were good but only the first layer...the toppings did not infect the whole order of nachos:( There was just not enough. The rest were just well chips...which are free when you dine in.Although everything was delicious, it's also very heavy...Mexican food usually is. I wouldn't eat here everyday but I can see myself craving Komex and making the drive to indulge in these unique dishes.If there was a fashion statement for food, it would definitely be fusion food! A lot of restaurants are trying different combinations and mixes and I think the best would be Korean and Mexican fusion food. When I found out about KoMex, I knew I had to give it a try. After reading the Yelp reviews and looking through pictures, I was impressed and my stomach was speaking to me... like it needed some KoMex! I'm just kidding, but really though, I was impressed now the only thing was to try it! There are two locations in Las Vegas now. When I first found out about this place, the only location was the one on Decatur/Washington. (I have yet to try the new one located on Buffalo/Flamingo). The location is somewhere more north of Las Vegas so a lot of the buildings are older and smaller. The plaza where it is located is in a plaza where there is a limited parking spot. Every time I go, I find a parking spot so i'm sure its not that bad! The moment you walk in, the restaurant is small, but it smells so good! Service is great! You are greeted immediately and sat down to a table.Every table gets a complimentary chips and salsa with guacamole. The guacamole is so good and taste very fresh! Everything on the menu is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant except it says "Fusion" before it. I thought it was funny! Anyway, some of the food that I have tried:Fusion tacos- I usually get the pork belly tacos and the bulgogi tacos with flour tortillas. Oh man, oh man... what can I say about the pork belly tacos... IT'S AMAZING! The pork is so fatty and cooked perfectly! Its not tough and its so juicy! They put the pico on top with shredded lettuce and the sauces that the server gives you once your food is ready! Bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine! The beef is cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness to it! All the tacos are delicious and you have a choice of flour tortillas or have them with a lettuce wrap!Pork-belly fries- Okay, by now I think you should get the hint that I love pork belly. One of my guilty pleasures! Think of carne asada fries, but with pork belly and the special sauces that they add and jalapenos! It is that good! Must try for yourself!Pork-belly musubi- It was a special at that time, but i'm sure you can order it. Just like spam musubi, they replace it with pork-belly. It was a bit too oily for me so I wouldn't really order it as much. Only when I crave for it!Fusion chimicanga- I had this with bulgogi and man.. its HUGE! I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good nonetheless!My favorite here would definitely be the tacos. Man, i'm getting hungry just writing this review.We found this place on Yelp! Thanks for all the previous reviews! We were greeted by friendly staff and we're seated. We had just enough time to study the menu. Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now! I'll definitely be back!Dammit, I really really wanted to like this place, and I still do want to, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. The restaurant is clean and neat, and the service was good. We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it. The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch. Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :(

I need to go back and I'm liable to up my review to 4 stars. I mean really: chilaquiles so close to home?!? They were delicious the first time but it's been a couple months - I need to get back there. Here's the deal: this restaurant used to be on Central Ave. just north of Hatcher (http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/0911mexdiningcheap.html) and they've moved to the Let It Roll bowling alley. As a consequence (I'm guessing) they were asked to have bowler-friendly foods like pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers. So, you'll find those on the menu.You'll also find the traditional Oaxacan food (and a mini version of the mini-mart) from the previous location.One drawback of being located in a bowling alley and being constrained to add bowling-alley food to your menu is that you're bound to have a customer that orders bowling-alley fare (which is never anything to rave about) and writes a review bashing the restaurant based on that - which is what one reviewer did. If you are going to try a Oaxacan restaurant, try the Oaxacan food, for cryin' out loud!You won't go to this restaurant for ambiance, although it does have a charm of its own, in a kitschy sort of way. But the food - wow, this definitely ain't one of the 'berto restaurants that litter the Valley landscape! Come here for the amazing tlayuda with cecina and tasajo (beware - it's a big portion, you might have to share) or the savory chilaquiles or memelitas. Perhaps pumpkin-blossom empanadas or verdolagas (purselane greens cooked with pork)? Decisions, mouth-watering decisions. On a cold day, have a cup of piping-hot atole. Or if it's a cold beverage you want. try the chlacayota; it's a refreshing drink made from a sweetened infusion of the chilacayota squash. It's not fast food and you may have to wait a bit as they cook your order but it's definitely worth the wait. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the prices are friendly to those who are on a limited budget.

Chaka Chaka I love you!!!  I love hearing about fellow comics having some ambition and following a dream other than...comedy.  Charles started this place not too long ago and except for the porn place next door, it's great!  I think the neighborhood made for some good people-watching, too.Had the jerk chicken sandwich and the garlic fries.  I devoured both.  Well, I went with 3 other women in comedy and we all devoured our lunches.The server was super-friendly and prompt.  Even told him our orders and none of them got mixed up.There are only a few options on the menu, but I think it really works for Chaka Chaka.I mean, with a name like that, how can you go wrong???Oh, and get the brownie.  GET THE BROWNIE.

It pains me to give my all time favorite sushi joint a 4 star review.  Why, you ask, would I give it my fav restaurant a 4 star?  Because service is just so horrible compared to the incredibly friendly and attentive staff at the actual Penn Ave location.  Is the sushi still the best in the city, heck yeah!  Do I salivate at the thought of their Pretty Girl Roll (salmon, avocado, spicy sauce and wasabi caviar in a soy wrap) and Spicy Yellowtail?  Heck yeah!  But then every time I head into this location the service is always the same.  Hurried and unfriendly.  Tonight was no different.  Our server was definitely not into us, or stopping at our table much and got our bill wrong 3 times.  I have never actually been to this location for dinner.  I know I should have tried an actual dinner item, but I REALLY just wanted some sushi!  I did, however, order the Butternut Squash Soup.  It was INCREDIBLE...creamy and rich!  This sorta made up for the crappy service (but not really).  Oh, and it's BYOB, awesome!I'm not swayed, I will be back....I just wish they'd be more friendly to make the experience better, since the food is phenomenal.  Here's hoping....

Review Text :
Finally an official "go to" diner for breakfast in Phoenix, without all of the added hype wait times and over~inflated~self~indulging hoopla that some of the "more famous" breakfast places have had from being featured on TV's food network!  Joe's Diner is the real deal, cooking tasty homemade breakfast the way it should be.First thing I noticed is this place is ten times the size of the other two "more famous" breakfast diners with plenty of room to move around with little wait times even when they are busy. It's easy in and easy out! Second thing I noticed was the service. It was fantastic and memorable! In fact it was THE BEST service we've experienced in any diner throughout all of Phoenix.  Even Joe gets involved cleaning tables, meeting his customers, shaking hands and asking for feedback on what he can do better to make your dining experience even better.  Dolores G mention he brought out some black eyed peas during her visit for good luck in the New Year. During our visit Joe brought out some samples of his candied toffee that was not on the menu for us to sample. It was toffee deliciousness that I've never experienced before. This owner is FANTASTIC with his customers!The third and final thing I noticed was their food tasted exceptional. Everything was cooked and seasoned very well. We ordered almost a sample of everything from pancakes with eggs, bacon and has browns to corn beef hash with eggs on top with a side of biscuits and gravy. We also had their Sunday special of eggs Benedict with a side of sausage.  Everything was awesome. Their homemade pancakes were light and had just enough flavor without being too doughy. Their scratch biscuits and gravy were "the bomb"! You can eat just the biscuit by it's self, it has that much flavor. Their sausage was exceptional with the right amount of spices and fat ratio. Their coffee was very smooth and tasty. They use Arbuckles, made in Tucson. We bought a bag to bring home!My only criticism was even though their corn beef hash and bacon tasted very good they weren't homemade at their diner, for everything else was.  Joe thanked me for my feedback and stated he has been working on making these in house with some trial and error. This is why this place deserves a 5 star rating, hand down. Joe and his staff will make your visit enjoyable, appetite fulfilling and well worth your time and money. I've been to the other two so called "more famous" breakfast diners many times and I have never met theirs owners nor have received service even close to this. Look out Phoenix and those two so called "more famous" diners!!  Joe's Diner will win you over as they have with me.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to try something Joe has either on or off his menu!01/20/11It doesn't take much to talk me into trying a new breakfast joint... I've a list of restaurants that were bookmarked YEARS ago, and I've yet to step into those places to order my first meals there, and yet, I read a couple of enthusiastic yelp reviews about Joe's Diner, and I'm there w/in a week or less, savoring for myself forkfuls of those delicious pancakes I read about, but there I go, getting ahead of myself...Delighted in finding ample parking (I think I arrived around 1030a or so), I walked into Joe's Diner pleasantly surprised to find a cozy 50s-, 60s-style diner.  Yes, yes, I read all about the atmosphere here, and I was still a little disconcerted, coming in from the open-air parking lot, but pleasantly so.  I liked some of the memorabilia, but I don't know what to make of the outdoor decor-- roofed and cemented empty garage w/ the parked truck?  Seems like wasted space to me- perhaps this is where the weekend overflow goes...  I initially was directed to the more-crowded room at the back of the diner, but it was much darker in there, and I wanted light (!), so I asked if I could have a booth in the more-spacious front.  "Sure," the hostess said, w/out blinking an eye, and I was already off to a great start.Couldn't decide what to have, so I decided to order the items that appealed most-- biscuits and gravy, pancakes w/ a side of fresh strawberry compote, and Thursday's lunch special of lasagna.  Ordered a cup of deliciously strong Arbuckles coffee, too.  The sausage and biscuits came out relatively fast-- good to note if you're really hungry and you want something quick! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA#LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA  I didn't care much for the biscuits, though.  Found them to be too tender.  (I like my biscuits to buckle, not crumble, a bit when I dig in w/ my fork.)  I'd requested the regular sausage to be substituted w/ chorizo, and the gravy was nicely done.  Too bad about the biscuits...  I next tried the lasagna... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw#CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw  Wow!  I really enjoyed the bites I had sampled.  The pasta was al dente- tender, yet had a nice bite to it; the filling was well-seasoned, yet not too salty-- meat was chunky, and the ricotta portion was generous; and the garlic bread that accompanied the entree was warm, perfectly crusty, and deliciously buttered.  I wouldn't mind returning back on a Thursday to have this dish again.  Last, but certainly not least, the pancakes!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw#cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw  Portion seemed small- there wasn't much of a rise, so I mistakenly thought the platter was of a short stack, but the server asked me to lift all cakes to see for myself.  Yep!  I counted three.  These cakes tasted amazing, and all they needed were a tiny bit of butter and simple toppings of macerated strawberries (I had to ask for a second serving of fruit).  Now, I wouldn't mind returning any day of the week to have a stack of these carb-delights!Cool retro decor; warm and friendly service, a bit relaxed in pace; and two out of three knock-out entrees on the first try put Joe's Diner on my list to visit again soon!  I'd take out-of-town guests here in a heartbeat!Weekend mornings I'm all about being a complete lazy bear, sleeping in then get up just long enough to lie back down on the couch. Only a few have the power to lure me out of bed and one of those is the promise of a big satisfying breakfast. Of course not by my own hand but by someone elses because lets face it, I'm that lazy on the weekends.So when I decided to cover the much buzzed about Joe's Diner it was sheer excitement that got me out of bed. You know a plate full of perfectly cooked eggs and bacon paired lovingly with cups of hot coffee and glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice are true motivators.As we saunter in we're welcomed by an upbeat good morning and sat pretty much immediately. Located in what used to be a classic car shop, husband and wife team Joan and Joe Seriale transport you back in time with 1950's nostalgia complete with glitter flecked seating and old tin billboards and neon signs. There's a flurry of waitresses and I kept waiting for Flo to appear with her huge red nest of hair but she never showed up.Concerning breakfast there's always that one nagging question, should I go savory or sweet? I say do both starting out with one of Joe's homemade Cinnamon Rolls ($2.59). The large yeasty bun arrived laying in its own caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon pool, complete with an oozing topping of cream cheese frosting. I nearly stabbed my partner with my fork after he took the best part, the tender loved filled center. When I eat a cinnamon roll I like take my sweet time, licking and nibbling on the outside, making sure I don't miss an inch of that roll. Then once I get to the center I'm gratefully rewarded with a mouthful of gooey pleasure.The Number Two ($6.49) is the more versatile choice when it comes to the sweet and savory dilemma. You get two eggs, your way, two sausage patties, two bacon strips and a short stack of fluffy pancakes. This plate has your bases covered with the addition of thick ropes of maple syrup which the pancakes gladly guzzle down. For an alternative try the strawberry jam in lieu of the syrup, some rules were meant to be broken.Joe's Homemade Biscuits & Gravy ($2.99) gets you a plate full of light-as-air biscuits grounded by a layer of sausage gravy. The gravy had a faint sweetness that was a surprise hit at our table.If you're having a rough morning from one-to-many last night, try this remedy, Joe's Breakfast Burrito ($6.59). Stuffed tight into a soft flour tortilla are three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and cheddar cheese served with a sides of sour cream and salsa. Or try the Breakfast Bowl ($7.59) which gets you scrambled eggs with ham, bacon and cheddar cheese served over home style potatoes. Both were filling and satisfying, the only thing was a couch afterwards to nap on.I foresee Joe's Diner getting me out of bed many more times in the near future, especially after dreaming about cinnamon rolls.OMG get the chorizo omelet!!! The place is cutely decorated and the service is super friendly, though a little slow. I am a booth girl, so I was happy to see that most of the seating up front was booths. I don't like tables and hate chairs.When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there.The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!Went here for a Saturday Smunch.  They were packed but the service was still great.  As things slowed down about noon the owner came out and made the rounds of his guests.  I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, potatoes, skipped the toast and added a short stack of pancakes.  Way too much food for me but it was all good, very seldom do I get pancakes that are not doughy and overly filling (including my own kitchen), I really liked these.

Great Diner Food...24/7.....Slack Service!Been going here for a few years now.  Up until this  year... I would have given it 5 stars.  I love the food but have to say that they really need to tighten up the slack in the service.They used to have a solid wait staff that had great energy and worked really well together.   They were entertaining and on the ball!   Now it seems like they have twice as many employees and the service is much less efficient.  Everyone moves at a glacial pace.When you pull in, you can almost count on the majority of the wait staff being in the back parking lot on smoke break.  The visit before last, we got there at shift change.  NEVER GO AT SHIFT CHANGE!!!!  They happened to get slammed and everyone got confused and in the weeds.  After 15 minutes, I had to flag someone down just to see if we were going to have a server.   After our order was put in and the food was delivered.... Our server never came back to fill a drink....and we had to flag her down to pay the tab.  I've watched food being auctioned off to the wrong tables, drinks spilled, dinner plates dropped etc.  It gets quite comical actually. No one seems to know what's going on there anymore.This past visit, there was a table that sat right beside us and it took 10 minutes for them to even be acknowledged.  One waitress asked the other waitress "Do you want them?" (Right in front of the customer)... They both rolled their eyes and walked off.  Eventually another server stopped to help them.  I think management needs to take a serious look at how things are being run and even possibly reclaim some of qualities that their former wait staff used to have.All in all, I'll keep going because I like the food.... But I may really have to think hard about going because of what I know is in store for the service. Perhaps they should can the smoke breaks.

Review Text :
Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.After a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. There was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.The music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. The menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.Once we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado "cream" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. The area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a "mutha fuga'!"to get back in the truck. This is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. EDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.I think my luck with Fukuburger is all negative or neutral at best.  Way back on July 1 (pre-grand opening) when I was following them on their blog and went to a Chinatown location at 8pm, where they said they will show up, but ended up being a no show after 60-90 minutes.  Then I waited in a line at one of the food truck rallies, thinking it was for Fukuburger, but the long line snaked its way to Slidin' Thru, and I ended up missing that opportunity.Anyway, finally thought my luck has turned when I was the second order placed at the Ellis Island sponsored Food Truck Smash-Up event.  When I received my burgers (#3 Buta-Burger & #5 Karai) I was pretty excited.  Finally a short line and short wait for this elusive and much loved burger, I thought.  Quickly navigating my way to a table in the shades, I took two pictures and attacked the burgers.  When I picked it up, I noticed that it was pretty greasy, to the point that almost 1/3 of the bun was soggy from the puddle of Fuku Patty grease.  As burgers goes, I was thinking this was no better than the cheap and greasy burgers served at hole-in-the-wall bowling alleys, and all the people that love and rave about Fukuburger must be on crack.At this point it would be a 1 star review.  But then I see the burgers that others ordered and I did not see the grease soaked buns or the puddle of melted fat in the paper trays, and realized that the food truck gods have dissed me again!Knowing that they can make and serve better burgers, I will give them one more try, but if the consistency is again on the negative side then that will be that + a down grade to 1 star for serving subpar food and lack of proper QA.1 star for the food + 1 more star because I know they can serve better ones than the ones I received for popping my Fukuburger cherry.Beep! Beep! Make way for the food truck...This mobile burger stand has quite the loyal fan base! Not only do they eat the food, but they hang out wherever the truck is parked and make an occasion of it. Seriously, I was here on a Thursday evening and there were at least 30 locals parked in the Fukuburger Truck lot, just hanging out. They must put something in the sauce.We took ours to go, as this wasn't the time to show off my +1's Honda Fit. I had the traditional Fukuburger and we shared an order of fries. HUGE burger, dripping with sauce. Delicious. Fries helped to soak up the juicyness, btw. Even though I was starving, there's no way I could polish off that much food by myself. If I lived here, I'd definitely be eating at Fukuburger more often. Sadly, I'll have to settle for the occasional stop on holidays or weekend vacations. Next time, I'll come ready to race!Just because it's a little cold outside doesn't mean you can't brave Father Winter and grab some grub from a food truck. Fuku is all that and a bag of chips. Er....Fries.I've been twice now, and both times, I've noshed at lunchtime into a heavenly afternoon. The first time, I had the basic Fukuburger. Amazing. They don't skimp on the burger patty!The second time, I had the SurrenderVegas special...named after one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas (per Yelpers and TMZ).  Yeah...they made a special burger named after a nightclub. Pretty damn awesome!They take credit cards. If you want all the morbid details, read the 200+ other reviews, but take it from me...this is a fantastic spot to get your food on.A few words of warning: Go Hungry! You will be STUFFED afterwards. Also, make sure you have a gym membership before you go. You'll need it afterwards. Also, try the Strawberry Lemonade. Lastly...be patient. As with all good food, it's made fresh...and it takes time. Don't be one of those overly anxious people. Peace.If you haven't tried these guys yet then go Fuku yourself! Literally! Come find out what everybody has been raving about! Their food is so good that their reputation has reached all the way to LA with an actual sit down restaurant! So if you are in the Hollywood area, make Fuku a part of your lunch/dinner plans. Your hungry stomach will thank you!As for the actual Fukuburger Truck, I originally gave these guys 4 stars because I'm very picky with who I give 5 stars to and it is very rare. The fact that it's a roadside truck and not a sit down restaurant, was major to me. BUT since I have been eating at their different locations regularly, I have grown to know the owners, Colin and Mags. You will not meet any nicer owners anywhere. Since these guys are customer friendly and they try to cater to everybody's requests, they have earned that 5th star! I appreciate the fact that they actually get back to you when you contact them. Now for the food. Doesn't matter if you're a first timer or not, everything on their menu is fantastic. Their beef Fuku patty is so juicy and perfectly seasoned that you will probably use it as the measuring stick to any burger you eat from that point on. What makes them unique is the different ingredients they put in their menu that you just can't find in other burger joints. Oh, and I can't forget to mention their different specials every night. Always something new and tasty. Special props goes out to Colin and Mags for actually naming their special the other night with my name! Awesome! Tell me how many other places would do that for you? Thanks again guys! Whatever you decide, you gotta get jazz fries with it. Trust me on this.Prices are reasonable compared to those other gourmet places. They take cash and cards. Remember, it's not easy to operate a food truck and they work hard so you can have a freshly cooked burger, so don't hesitate to show them your appreciation. Whether it's by tipping or giving them a great review, it's up to you.In conclusion, you will not find a better burger truck anywhere. Go to their website www.fukuburger.com for more info in regards to their shedule and contact info. Make these guys your regular stop and they will have you saying "TIP JELLY!"Last time I patronised this foodtruck, which was this afternoon, was my first time. And it was the best 5$ I have spent in a while. Instant customer as long as they stay open and keep the same owner/management. It was the burythehatchet event where the Fukuburger truck parked alongside bar + bistro on First street. I was attending the Mineola Twins stageplay across the street and was more than ready to try a quick burger. There was no line because they must have just set up and I had a #2 ("Tamago"). You may have heard that this burger is amazing. Well, it is. It is a shame I had not had it before and truly a threat to self-discipline for these things to be only 5$. I must say that it is unfortunate that there is no vegetarian option, but it is a minor point since I am not a vegetarian (the girlfriend is). In hindsight, after finishing my delicious #2, we should have gone into bar + bistro and thereby patronised both chefs involved with this friendly showdown. Alas, if only they can do this more often. - EI heart food trux big time and this is my number one grrrl!I frequent Vegas a few times a year and decided to look up some food trucks to check out during my stay. This has definitely become one of my staples when I'm in town!  Asian fusion burgers, fries with crazy sauce and fun staff are what make me a diehard fan. My favorite burger is hands-down the Buta-burger: applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled onions and red ginger topped with Japanese BBQ and wasabi mayo...yum town!!!  And I don't even like wasabi or ginger but the combination is outrageous. Look em up.  Check out the schedule.  Eat a burger.I'm pretty sure that Fukuburger has replaced dirty street tacos as my favorite post-libation-snack-while-you-sober-up option.Friday and Saturday nights they can often be found in a parking lot off of 6th and Fremont these days...and I completely support this decision. My standard these days is the #2 Tamago and their Jazz fries!  They do a great job with their burgers here...always cooked to a wonderful med-rare every time.  They have a couple house-made sauces that are spot on for burgers.  I would be confident ordering any of their items though.

Restaurant name  Jimmy's Hot Dogs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My new go-to lunch or snack place when I'm at work in the Cotton Center area. Good honest Chicago-style hotdogs (using Vienna Beef) with the traditional toppings: mustard, onion, relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers, and celery salt -although you can tailor the toppings to your liking. Basic hotdog sandwich for $2.95, double dog for $3.95, pepper 'n egg sandwich $3.95, Italian beef $5.95; and all sandwiches include fries. A tasty meal, a great deal!Today was my first time eating at Jimmy's hot dogs, for hearing such good things & reading the reviews I was slightly disappointed. I wanted something quick & easy for lunch. It wasn't busy & service was fairly fast, I guess that's the benefit of having a later lunch hour. Customer service was ok, I mentioned it was my first time in and that I'd heard good things about their dogs. I ordered the fire dog(not spicy) which was told it's generally served Chicago style, I was asked what toppings I wanted, to my misunderstanding thought she meant additional to the Chicago style toppings. My dog which I'd ordered to go,  to my surprise only had what I thought were my additional toppings of spicy mustard & good bundle of jalapenos on it. It was a tasty dog & came with fabulous fresh hot fries for a reasonable price, I'll definitely try it again, it's close and good cheap eats.Wow, that was unexpectedly good!  I had the Chicago Dog (I don't remember, they may just call it an original hot dog) with everything and the free fries that come with it.  Ok, fine... you caught me, I'm lying... I had TWO Chicago Dogs.  Sometimes at places trying to replicate a good Chicago-style hot dog, I have experienced less than stellar results... things like soggy buns that fall apart or relish that is too sweet.  But here at Jimmy's, the bun was PERFECT and the the toppings were just as they should be!Oh, and the fries?  Ummm, UH-MAZ-BALLS!  Normally I'm not much of a fry guy, but here I let out my gluttonous fry side and gobbled up all dem fries!!I will DEFINITELY be back -- hurrah hurrah to Jimmy's for getting this Chicago classic just right!!It's been almost 2 years since I 1st stumbled upon Jimmy's and the 1st time I was just going along for the ride, and now Jimmy's is what I think of when I want a hot dog!  I am thrilled to see that Jimmy's is still doing great! They still have the freshest fries for a fast food joint, you literally watch the whole peeled potato get cut into perfectly proportion fries and placed in the fryer basket and watch them bad boys get fried! And you know what else makes these fries pretty sweet, they still are free, you are only pay for the price of the dog, and yes I bet are saying now oh but a 6 buck dog is paying for your fries, but here at Jimmy's you can get a dog for like 3.50, killer deal right there!Ever since I tried the Chicago dog at Jimmy's almost 2 years ago, that's all I crave, a Chicago styled dog, the tomatoes, the diced green peppers & onions, the peppers & the hot dog on this great bun!  So damn good!   If you haven't been to Jimmy's you should stop by, this place is more than just hype, its great hot dogs excellent fries at an awesome price!While visiting Arizona I called upon the local Yelper population to assist me in finding hot dog joints to visit and eventually review. One of the places suggested was "Jimmy's Hot Dogs" which serves Chicago style hot dogs and within a few days I had made my way there. I pulled up to a non-descript looking building and sure enough Jimmy's was there with Vienna Beef umbrella's out and visible. I walked in and decided to go for a hot dog and fries. I took a few pictures of the place on the inside and headed back to the table to actually sample the hot dog here. I ordered a hot dog with everything, fries and a cup of water. A few minutes later my order was up and it was time to try it.The bun here was a classic poppy seed bun as often found on Chicago style hot dogs. The bun was mostly soft with a few of the edges being a bit dry. The relish was of the neon green variety and was applied a little too heavily. The onion was chopped and applied nicely to the dog. The mustard was well applied as well, two thin slices of tomato were at the bottom. A thin pickle slice at the top and a pair of sport peppers were on the dog as well. The sausage used here was the classic Vienna beef natural casing and was properly heated up. The overall taste of the dog was excellent. The bun on the edges was a little more dry than I would prefer and the relish was applied a bit too excessively, but overall this tasted excellent and is a great representation of a Chicago style hot dog for people in Phoenix to try.The fries wrapped with the hot dog were "fresh cut fries". Over the past decade or so these have become extremely popular with hot dog vendors in Chicago. The good news is these taste like authentic Chicago style fresh cut fries, the bad news is as in Chicagoland, these are usually hit or miss and these were about average for ones found around Chicago. They weren't too greasy but they were a bit on the bland side. I didn't finish off the fries, but I will say these were a lot like what many places in Chicago serve.Overall for a Chicago-Style restaurant 1500 miles away, Jimmy's Hot Dogs easily exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend this place if you want a good example of what a Chicago style hot dog should taste like in Arizona. I tried several other places (with more reviews coming) that were serving alleged Chicago style dogs while in Arizona, and none compared to Jimmy's. I am going to give this place a full five star review.

Review Text :
Their product gets 5 stars and you definitely pay top dollar for it but it's great. Overall normal day service gets 2 stars as they are generally slow as hell. Today however gets 1 star.  0 or perhaps -1 if it were possible.I drive here all the way from Huntersville and don't mind the drive or their prices because the seafood is fresh. But I always call ahead to make sure what I want is in cause its quite a haul. No different today. Been wanting to make some chowder so called ahead and reserved 2 dozen cherrystone clams. "Do you have them? Yes, absolutely. Ok I'll see you in about 45 minutes." I get there, get ignored at the register for a few minutes and when finally helped. The woman looks at my order ticket, goes back to the back for 3 or 4 minutes and then comes back with an "it will be a minute". Ok. So my call ahead order isn't already ready. That sucks but I'll wait. Literally 10 minutes later, after they see me still standing by the register, one of the guys tells her to go back and "do a count of the clams". 3 minutes later she comes back and says something to the guy. Another 3 minutes go by and he goes to the back. Thank goodness he only took another 45 seconds to come back and tell me   "we oversold and have zero clams". No "I'm sorry." just a "well someone gave you bad information when you called".  You have to be kidding me. As Seinfeld told the rental car company. "You know how to TAKE the reservation you just don't know how to KEEP the reservation... What would have been great service recovery?  "I'm so sorry, how about a half dozen dry pack scallops on the house." Or, "Here's 5 bucks for gas or something, anything...!  Even half an effort like that would have kept me loyal. Instead... It's been nice knowing you Clean Catch.After more than 3 years I continue to be a weekly, if not more, customer to Clean Catch.  The fish is consistently amazing and over the years they have expanded things, offering a lot more of pre-prepared fish selections that can be heated at home and are outstanding.  Bill and Cain and the rest of the staff are attentive to your preferences, honest about how things taste and recommend amazing ways to cook their daily fish.  I am a fish lover and look forward to their creations and daily deliveries.  Recently I have tried their Tuna Tartare, Tuna Meatballs, Shrimp Enchilades, and so much more, all of which I love. And, I cannot forget to mention their homemade dumplings, from the Dumpling Gang.  A few different varieties but are all amazing.  There is nothing like Clean Catch in Charlotte and I will be a customer for life.  Check them out when you get a chance.

Review Text :
It was a raining Saturday night and I was cold to the bone and wanted a warm bowl of curry to fill my tummy, I have driven by Thai Chili a few times and that night it was beckoning me to come on in, so I went!What a cute little place, love the feel of it. It's very clear that they do a lot of to go business, the call in orders & people coming and going were nonstop. Right off the bat I ordered some Thai tea, I love that stuff and it was perfectly sweet just the way I like it! Also ordered Sa-Te Chicken, it's really the peanut sauce I am after, that stuff is amazing, the chicken has always been a afterthought to me when I ordered that in the past at other places, but this time, the chicken was the main star, it was perfectly cooked and the seasoning, omg the flavor was amazing, almost shameful to put the peanut sauce on it. I was torn, I would bath in the peanut sauce if I could, but I didn't want anything to deter the flavor of the chicken, but in the end the peanut sauce happened.For the main dish I went with the Mussamun curry, I have to say out of all the curries, Mussamun is my favorite and it was what I craving on this cold night. It had great flavors, the chicken potatoes, carrots all perfectly cooked it was creamy orange and just heaven in the belly!! I also ordered it Thai Hot, whenever I got to a new place I just jump right to Thai Hot, the hotter the better for me, the waitress told me that's like habanero hot, and I told her to bring it!! When my dish arrived, you could visually see it was spicy, and after a few bites in my eyes were watering, SO SO GOOD!!! Then the waitress comes back to our table and tells me that their heat table goes to ten and that Thai Hot is around a 6,,,ooohhhhh oooommmmgggggg I need to try and 8 next time! Great little find, everyone was so very friendly, I enjoyed this place and look forward to coming backThis place would be your good, dependable neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I feel like it's not quite as authentic as Siam Orchid or Tum Nak Thai (both family run by husband/wife cook/wait teams) but they serve up some solid tasty food.They have a good range of vegetarian options -- I seem to always gravitate towards the Mushroom Soup, which is as close to my beloved tom kha gai as I've been able to get since I stopped eating meat.  The Golden Tofu is also pretty good but I sub peanut sauce for the sweet sauce it comes with.  I like their Silver Noodles -- mmm broccoli!  And they actually make a Larb Tofu, which is just alright in my opinion; even though it's been years since I've eaten beef, I think the dish tastes better with it than tofu.  My husband really likes their Beef Panang Curry and Pad Thai with pork.They have good lunch specials, a great rewards program, and very nice staff -- they always remember my name when I come in!  I don't think you'd be disappointed here.

Review Text :
I came to Pyaar in a roundabout way. You see, I asked the hotel desk clerk if he had a menu for the Thai restaurant around the corner, Archi's.  He said he did but they had changed the name to something else. He fussed around in a drawer (not in his drawers, that would be weird), said "Here it is" and handed me a menu for Pyaar.I knew right away that Indian cuisine is not Thai cuisine.  I'm funny that way.  While I have enjoyed being curried away at both, the food is distinctly different.  Anyone that is even a slight foodie is not going to confuse Thai food with Indian food.So I decided to check them both out. And I decided on Indian instead of Thai.I was the only one in the restaurant. I tried ordering several things and struck out with an assortment of "We're out of that" and "He only makes that during the day" (Hint-don't put it on the dinner menu).I opted to order several small things. I started with a veggie samosa, followed with some gobi paratha and to go...rasmalai.I really liked the samosa.  The gobi paratha was pretty good, with a nice robust and grainy bread.The rasmalai for dessert was...interesting.  Very sweet.Overall, pretty solid Indian, nice people and reasonable prices.And Sanford and Son on the tube when I left.Too old school for me.

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."¬°Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.Adam...lead on!

Review Text :
Trust me, I worked at a Chinese take out place before and this rice here is stale and day old, because fresh rice does not look off white and is not so hard.  Spring rolls when fried once are light brown in appearance, but refried ones that were not sold the day before, and thrown back into the deep fryer turns the edges dark brown and greasy.  Some folks might try to say the oil is just darker, but darker oil in the fryer means its not been cleaned and changed regularly enough that its gotten to a gunky black color.  It's a troublesome process and, it is true that most places do not do it often enough, but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your food.The chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all.  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce.  Overly starched and overly salted.  Does not have any flavor at all.  If this is NY style Chinese food, then its not the NYC I have been to.  My friend had their teriyaki chicken and its bad too : (  Same stale rice with pieces of oversauced chicken.  He said after it tasted kind of weird, not the teriyaki taste he was expecting.  Again too much starch and salt.  And this is the dude that eats everything. Dear fellow yelpers, stop short changing yourself.  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food.  Neither does big shrimp, crisp cabbage in egg rolls, big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food.  Guys, U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste.  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price, that's perfectly fine too, send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet, seafood or no seafood.  But please do not rate this place as 5 stars because a 2 star is generous.  I gave them 2 cause the service is good and they keep the place pretty clean and neat.  I think I am too generous already.Fast service and amazing food! had an order delivered to my home and I think its the best Chinese food I've had!

Review Text :
I love a sketchy 24-hour taco shop, which is why Tacos Mexico has my heart. After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, "put burritos in me", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, "hood" had to offer.Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.

Watch through a window in the back of this tiny place as your dumplings get gently folded up and cooked fresh by women with serious, food loving faces. Enjoy the pop of juices, the perfect cooking, the lovely balance of flavours. Based on Yelp reviews last night we tried the beef curried dumplings fried, the pork, shrimp and coriander fried, and the pork and oyster steamed. 15 dumplings are served per order. Dinner was $35, served with speed and a smile by the one tasmanian devil of a waiter holding the whole place down and banging out some serious rapid fire turnover without making you feel rushed. We boxed up massive leftovers and left glowing.New Years Eve and my man romances me at a whole in the wall spot in Montreal's Chinatown. I will give it up he tried calling 100 places last minute but NYE, similar to places in NYC fill up fast and have $100 tasting menus and the food is never as good if you go on any other night so, why not go cheap, quick and delicious and get to the bar more quickly to celebrate with some bubbles?!First of all Montreal's Chinatown is great, same vibe as Chicago's. A few main streets chalk full of dumplings, bahn mi's, and other delicacies. The Yelp reviews were positive and Risa D stamped this one as the best so, done.The dumplings were amazing. But, just a heads up, this place ONLY serves dumplings. There are a few salad apps but, you are here for the dumplings and dumplings only. We went with all steamed varieties ranging from pork and leek to lamb and coriander (!!!) and finished it off with beef and onion. With 15 dumplings per order and at about $7 per order you get a lot of bang for your buck. Sweet. All were fabulous, I do want to highlight the lamb dumplings which I don't think I've ever had before and happened to be the winner winner chicken dinner of the meal. The other dumplings were just as great but the lamb had this extra kick to the meat. I also want to highlight that these dumplings were plump dumplings. Plump with juicy meat and with the skins being thin, the filling flavor really came through. Praise the dumpling lord, that's what I'm talking about. This place is super authentic with lovely lil' ladies in the back rollin' those dumplings as you eat. So fresh.My one gripe was they wouldn't give us water. We asked twice. Water never came. Dumplings and sauce are pretty salty and the free hot tea is really nice but, I really wanted ice cold water man. Whyyyyyyy?Regardless, this place was legit.The best dumpling place in town, good price and ultimately they serve dumplings that make us 'wow'. We try different dumplings each time we visit but always include pork, shrimp and coriander dumplings. Many people mention about spicy cucumber salad but try also lettuce and egg salad with wasabi dressing, it's amazing.so they moved, next door to a bigger, brighter and most importantly, cleaner place.in a way, this is an update from my previous review. instead of the 3 stars, i'm bumping it to a 4 stars as the food quality that you are accustomed to is still present therefore the fried dumplings that i'm not a fan of is still the same one.instead of fried, i got the steamed/boiled  lamb and coriander ones and they are still as good. my companion loved her dumplings too.bathrooms are cleaner, way cleaner! which is very unlike in chinatown. all in all, expect the same quality that made you love this place, just in a brighter and better place.probably the biggest disappointment, they are still out of many salad items..

Located inside the Green Valley Ranch. It's in the food court area just upstairs over the movie theatre.This is a small attached location with yogurt shop. The community seating for food court can be good or bad depending on how busy it is. When I was there it kinda sucked cuz there were a bunch of kids at the food court I think flowing over fro the movies.The staff is friendly. Got my smoothie out reasonably fast and was in the mood for fresh orangy mango taste. Bammm Sunrise Sunset it was. Strawberries, Pineapple, Mango and Orange with extra orange. Had it my way and like it!!Good spot for quick fresh while in thete and not wanting the whole restaurant thing.All good - do it!

Review Text :
After watching a movie downtown, we decided to get a light lunch and I chimed in about how much I've been wanting to try Centurion since we nosed around on a bike ride last weekend. Little did I know we were in for a decidedly bold lunch. First, I must mention this place is in no way associated with its former tenant (214 Bistro and a later "rebirth" by the same guy). So there's no need to be apprehensive about the food or the service. And while the space hasn't been expanded, you won't be assaulted by airborne capcaisin upon entering. Rather, you'll begin your adventure into a quaint world with exceptional food. Our starter course was the fromage plate ($9) and we selected fromage a trois, manchego and goat cheeses. This was served with homemade bread, dijon mustard and jam on the side and strawberries. [The menu mentions a seasonal fruit is served with the cheese plate.] All were fantastic. Since none of us were terribly hungry, we decided to share our lunches. Robert ordered the gnocchi in shitake dijon cream sauce with panchetta ($13), his mom ordered the shitake spinach risotto ($8) and I their white truffle pizza ($12). Rob's gnocchi was triumphant and boldly flavorful, but not overpowering with the dijon mustard. MIL's risotto was delicate on the palette and remarkably refreshing on its bed of fresh spinach. My pizza was remarkably executed. It's made in a brick oven with pecan wood, which lends a fantastic smokiness throughout the entire pizza. Incidentally, the oven is also used to roast the rack of lamb and poached tilapia, which are on the dinner menu. So our "light" lunch turned into quite the experience, and with to-go boxes as we were all pleasantly sated on our rich meals by the time we were about half way through the portions. I'm on the fence about whether this would be a good place for a group. On the one hand, you could totally take over the restaurant with about a dozen people and feel like you have the place rented out to yourself. On he other hand, once this place gets in the foodie rotation it will be harder to accommodate. At least that's what I'm hoping.  Something that may want to be addressed is the bench seating. I was higher up at the table than Rob and Belinda and my legs were close to touching the bottom of the table. Maybe with someone heavier they would sink into the cushions more? Centurion was a hit with us, and this will be a place I'll return to again and again (I'm so excited to try the lamb!), and be in the top five places I'll be taking out-of-town guests. While they presently don't serve alcohol, they are applying for a license and intend to have premium beverage options (think a notch or more above top shelf).I'm starting to form an association with this place and watching movies at AMC AZ Ctr. Friday night I stopped by to have a dinner before seeing a film. Shortly after arriving, they addressed me by name and inquired about my bacon tattoo (thanks, Amy D!! They thought it was a hoot.) And they remembered I wrote about wanting the try the lamb ($27). In a word: Phenomenal Rubbed with Dijon mustard and topped with fresh herbs, the lamb was baked rare (I don't see any reason to cook lamb past rare; doing so destroys the terrific texture and flavor that make lamb such a treat for me). The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. Now I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal. And as my leftovers sat next to me in the theater, I felt wonderfully fulfilled not only because I converted to Team Jacob but because of the knowledge I would have the best lunch in the office come Monday. Centurion is a damn fine restaurant.I talked my gracious date in to taking me somewhere new for dinner on Friday night. He wanted Dicks, but I can be pretty convincing when food is involved. I head read a lot about Centurion on Yelp, so I persuaded him this was the spot to try. I was pleased to see we were the only people when we arrived. I always like the special attention and choice of seating. We chose a spot outside on the patio to take advantage of the beautiful evening and got busy with our orders.We started with the baked clams in a berry balsamic reduction and pancetta cream sauce, it was light and scrumptious. We also shared the three entr√©e dinner for two  1/2 rack lamb,  1/2 filet mignon and  1/2 poached tilapia. They were all excellent, the filet had a smoky wood fired sear and the lamb was incredibly moist. The entr√©e came with three risottos: a white truffle, a chorizo and manchego and a spicy coconut shrimp. The flavors were great, however the risottos were extremely overdone (had I cooked those at home I would have pitched them out before serving them to my guests). To the chef Eric's credit, he did offer to have us back and to try the risotto on him as he claimed that is not the norm. I will be back, the place is charming and the overall vibe very inviting, no one is perfect (risotto) but the heart and effort put in to the dish is worth a second chance.This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food. We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.  Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entr√©e was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.  At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.  The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, cr√®me fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some cr√®me fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.  The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.Good, but I don't think I'll "cross the Rubicon" for this place.  Don't get me wrong, the food and location are good...it's the execution.  The things that soured the experience for us.First, the whole restaurant.com mess.  We went with our gift card.  We were greeted with a sign explaining that if we had a card we should see the manager to get a refund.  We did as the sign requested, but were rebuffed.  She said that they were now overwhelmed and that we should take it up with the folks of restaurant.com. She explained that it was beyond their control.  Bad form, take down the sign then. Caesar wouldn't have put up with that kind of response in his legions.  Second, the set up of the place is cluttered and confusing and small.  There is no hostess to direct traffic- unless the you count the Centurion- so you are left guessing as to what to do.  Third, we came right before six and were told we had to wait five minutes to order from the dinner menu.  That was odd and not very accommodating. Once they work out the kinks- namely the restaurant.com fiasco- the place has potential.  The food was good.PS- The website states, "Serving food from the regions where the ancient Roman centurion marched with his men, i.e. France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, etc.." I had the coconut shrimp risotto.  It was great but I was unaware that the Roman Empire extended to Southeast Asia or the Pacific Islands.  I don't think any Roman, centurion or otherwise, ever tasted the sweet meat of the coconut.  Any historians are free to correct me.Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE:Dinner for four at 6:30pm on a First Friday could have been trouble, but there was no waiting, no rushed service, and no diminished quality from the kitchen.We were seated in the corner bench area in what I'd call a "studio restaurant" -- 12 or so seats, 5 bar stools, and in-your-face adjacent, bustling kitchen made for a lively and somehow uncramped 2-hour meal.Chef Osburn's menu had us perplexed by the varied and extensive offerings coming out of that tiny kitchen.  We spent 15 minutes discussing the menu and sipping APP: The white bean trio finds a way to present cannellini in three distinguished ways, but the puree with truffle oil lingers after the plate is taken away and breaks the three-way tie. The bread is deceivingly ordinarily looking, has a dusting of seasoning and absorbs olive oil very well.  [memorable ingredient: TRUFFLE OIL]SALAD: With Mom I shared the grape, apple, arugula salad that's served with blood oranges, smoked paprika cashews, and the most appropriately light application of blue cheese dressing I've ever had.  The oranges gushed, the apples snapped and crunched, the cashews were not overly smoked, and the arugula was crisp, not limp.  [memorable ingredient: perfectly purple BLOOD ORANGE fillets]MAIN: The gnocchi with season vegetables (artichokes, butternut squash, shitake mushrooms, leeks) reminded me that the fare at Centurion is decidedly French-Italian.  The sherry reduction with a touch of cream draws a sweetness across the top of rich squash, nutty mushrooms, and lemony artichokes...very lemony.  The gnocchi themselves were plump with a satisfying tooth-feel without being mushy or gummy or too potato-forward.  The dish -- like the others -- came out piping out, and with any pasta+cream dish, was best in the first 5-10 minutes.  [memorable ingredient: SHERRY]DESSERT: The table shared two: the espresso cup and the flourless chocolate cake.  The centerpiece item of the first was a dark chocolate demitasse cup -- yes, an espresso cup made from chocolate -- filled with an espresso mousse and toped with molten caramel.  The dense chocolate cup was a fun transport for the airy mousse.  (Idea: A graham cracker baked lid might have made this an interesting s'mores update.)  The flourless cake was also dense but not brick-dense, and the accompanying berry and apple-lemon purees made each bite a bit different. [memorable ingredient: APPLE-LEMON puree]SERVICE: During dinner the delightful server showed acumen in food knowledge and was attentive to everything from water to wine to cutlery to change for the parking meter.  When we arrived, the restaurant was serving about five guests.  When we left Centurion's small dining area and front patio were full.A strong meal for sure. I'll be back to try Sunday brunch soon.I'm in LOVE! I came here after purchasing a Groupon... We sat on the patio enjoying the great weather. Our server was great and we quickly found out he was the Owner/Chef. They were offering two liquors that evening and one was a Vodka filtered 5 times through white rose petals. There are no mixers so it was served over ice. It was THE best vodka I have ever had! We ordered the Artichoke and Salami pizza and the Portuguese style mussels to share. The owner recommended the pizza since it was our first visit. It was WONDERFUL! I couldn't get enough. I normally do not like tomatoes with my shellfish but I was easily convinced that the Portuguese style were the best, so I gave in and boy am I glad i did!!! I was actually eating the tomatoes out of the broth (if you know me that is amazing!). We had parked our car right in front of the patio we were sitting on... While the car parked in front of us was leaving they crashed into our car and began causing a scene...(long story short) The owner stayed with us until the police arrived and made sure everything was taken care of properly. He was so amazing and sincerely concerned about our safety. We owe him big time! Thanks again and I will be back very soon!Where to begin? I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man, but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skills.I'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it in.Attempt one: "We don't accept reservations this late." (The coupon required a reservation) Attempt two: "We're not open this late on Sundays" (It was 7pm) Attempt three: "We're not open, doing construction on the patio."In each attempt mentioned above, a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his reply.The final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered, she was much more professional and customer-service oriented. (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone. Hint. Hint.)After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired; $25 wasted.The owner said he felt bad about it, and gave us a few free drinks. I was livid. However, I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting). The salad was disappointing, the cheese overpowered it. I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plate.The friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoning.I think I should be forgiven for the one-star review, the rating is well deserved.So we decided to try something different last night.  Against a couple people's advice we ate at Centurion, we had heard it changed hands since our friends ate there, so what the heck.1) The waitress was extremely friendly and eager.  She needed a little polishing on the waiting skills,but nothing major.  We were very happy with her bubbliness.2) They do not have an extensive hard liquor selection, as they are more a wine bar.  No problem, except that the $10 - 2oz pour vodka "martinis" came out in those mini vintage coca-cola glasses, with an unripened green olive containing the pit (we were warned about the pit ahead of time).3) They have an extensive mussel selection, about 5 different ways to prepare.  The waitress was very knowledgeable on the different preparations and explained them all in detail to me.  I chose the Loise (some type of lemon, butter, caper broth).  She also explained that the mussels used were New Zealand Green mussels, and were bigger than ordinary ones.  Hmmm.  So my entree comes out in a large bowl filled with broth and no capers, and about 8 mussels, which were about 3x the size of normal mussels.. Sweet!  I thought...  Until I ate one.  It was the most disgusting tasting mussel I have ever put in my mouth.  It tasted like i just scooped up a bunch of fish crap and shoved it in my mouth along with some dead creatures.  Disgusting.  I only ate 3 of them and could eat no more.  I believe they had been frozen too, as they were terribly rubbery.4) My partner had the Portuguese style fish stew, which was much better than mine, but had a few flaws of it's own.  He watched as the chef thawed the frozen filet that went in it.  It also had a couple of those horrid mussels in it which he didn't eat on my advice.  He thought there was too much tomato sauce, although it was quite good.  I tried a couple of bites of the fish and sauce, and agreed it was much better than what I had ordered.  But not mind-blowing.  The other shellfish in his stew (mostly small clams) were fine, no taste really, but went well with the stew base.5) A couple other observations.  This space was definitely not intended to be a full service restaurant, nor should it continue being one.  It is about 400 sq ft inside, there is a bar (not the kind you drink from) dividing the kitchen from the dining room, so guests can see everything going on in the kitchen which faces the dining room.  W were able to see that not much, if anything was prepared fresh.  Things from cans, Uncle Bens rice packets, Franzio wine in a box (maybe this is the chef's private stash?).  The stove, oven, and brick oven make it extremely hot inside for the 4 tables.  Sitting outside was much better, but after May is not possible in Phoenix.  They apparently don't have a cleaning crew either, because all the extensive tchotchkes, pictures, and decor has a thick layer of dust on it.We arrived around 9pm, and there were 2 tables outside and 2 inside.  It looked as if none of those tables had actually eaten, but were just drinking wine and talking.  Maybe there's a reason for that?So much potential, but ultimately a let down.  We arrived at 730pm without a reservation. To be fair we had a Groupon and the fine print did require a reservation. But the place was empty except for two diners inside and a party of three on the patio. Eric hesitated but did accommodate us on the patio. We ordered two beers and the cheese plate to start. As we munched on the nicely presented cheese plate and sipped our beers the waiter came out to take our orders. He recommended the duck pizza. We planned to order two pizzas and a dessert. He loudly added up our tab and announced that we were his cheapest Groupon customers ever. A few minutes after ordering he reappeared and very unconvincingly told us that they were out of all Pizzas and we would need to order entrees. This was a desperate attempt an an up sell as Chef Eric was obviously annoyed that he accommodated us.  We were tempted to finish our beers and cheese plates, pay the check and leave but we did order two pasta dishes. They were mediocre at best. This is probably one of our least favorite dining venues downtown. The personality of the owner/chef is largely responsible for our disappointment.I first reviewed this restaurant 2.5 years ago and boy, time flies! Centurion continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. Easily in the top 5. It has changed a lot since my first review and now added Bar Maximus. You can still order food from the Centurion menu at Bar Maximus. I have several favorites on the menu which overall ranges from inexpensive to pricey. Lately, their Hamburg mussels is what I crave. It comes in a crockpot with a creamy sauce that you dip your endless, buttery bread into. Uh, so freaking to die for. My 6 year old and I fight over that dish. As a matter of fact, we are each going to get our own next time. Ha! I also love their Israeli couscous salad made with feta, salami, chicken, cucumber and a light dressing. They also make great pizzas, risotto and dishes from their brick oven. Try their handcrafted cocktails, too. While a little pricy, they are well-made. Eric also has a really nice wine list for different palates. Case in point, my husband and I have vastly different tastes in wine and can still enjoy a glass there.

What a shame...Like so many of my failed relationships I fell for something that looked attractive, only to find out that beauty is sadly often only skin deep.  Such was my relationship with Venues today.It looked great.  The location is cool, right near the sundial and the stone work and rustic/contemporary feel really pulled me in.  We grabbed a table outside and the waitress handed us some menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  She brought an iced tea and then we watched.We watched the staff walk around seemingly in a New Years Day daze.  After about 15 minutes I told my friend to put down her menu, thinking that her still holding the menu was preventing the waitress from thinking we were ready.  Five minutes later I finally succeeded at getting that precious eye contact and she took our order.  Then...once again...we waited.Now another fifteen or even twenty minutes passed and this time when I gained that eye contact I must have triggered her memory that we still hadnt been served so she went and checked.  Nothing.  Another five and she says "I'm going to see whats going on!"  She came back and acknowledged that she forgot to put our order in and offered to buy me a beer.  It was too early so I declined, but no other compensation whatsoever was made for this screw up.She then came back again and told us that it shouldnt be much longer...there was only one order ahead of us.  How could anybody be ahead of us?  Wouldnt the kitchen drop everything to take care of the salad (thats right...thats all we ordered).  Nope.Another five.  "Its almost done...there are just finishing the chicken."  We stopped her and said "Thats OK now...just bring the lettuce...we dont need the chicken".  "OK...are you sure?"  "Yes!!!" we told her"  We expected her right back now...no such luck.  Another five and she finally came back with the salad with the chicken.  Now she didnt try to bluff us and took fault for the error.  I'll give her that but the check came without any favors.  Didnt offer dessert.  I wasnt drinking and hadnt even hinted that I do so it was surprising that the only offer she made was for a beer?  She joked and even tongue in cheek made fun of the situation and it did add some levity.  She acknowledged "The shitty service" (her words) which I did laugh at.  But who would go back when they didnt even say "Hey....its on us...just please give us a second chance".  I dont think I will ever go back.  Maybe for a drink but I really felt bad for everybody waiting on their meal.  I think that one table left without waiting for their food while we were there.Great atmosphere and unlimited potential I might guess but as for right now the "New Ownership" sign isnt winning over any patrons.  It couldnt have been any worse before.Good luck.  Its a tough business!

Solid 3.5 stars.  We hadn't dined at a Firefly in at least a couple of years so what the heck.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of this one over Paradise.  High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  The menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster "escargot style" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  Aside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!  Who knew warm wilted spinach with pine nuts, roasted peppers and artichoke would be so good??  I think whatever dressing they had going on knocked it out of the park.  The sangria packed a nice punch as well.  I would be fine coming back to this location.

A young Rex...a young taught schoolboy Rex...was once a star athlete. I was good at all of the sports the other boys wished they were. I was great at shooting dice, 3 Card Monty, pick pocketing and loan sharking. I was the envy of my entire 3rd grade class. Very few kids that age can play the shell game on a street corner for 8 hours and then kneecap some deadbeat over a 20 dollar debt at night.  I was a machine...a well oiled, tight bodied machine. The girls...oh the girls...nap time was a special time. A young Rex surrounded by his prepubescent harem.  It was magical. I was on top of the world.  My aunt Eunice would see me come back with some old man's pension check, because he owed 3 weeks of the vig after betting on the Giants, she would beam with pride.  We would go to our special place...and then he would take me for food. I deserved it...believe me. She would buy me fried chicken. I loved it. It washed out the taste of low tide. Bribe sweet bribe. Bribed my silence.  As an older man I look back on those days and still cringe. Sure the money was good. Sure the chicken was good. The rest...not so much.I tell this tale of woe and want for one reason...all of that great chicken was almost blotted out of existence from a combination of court ordered therapy, LSD, electroshock, and Kenny G Therapy...my own creation...not for the week of heart.  I discuss it in detail in "Kenny G: How the Devil Gave Us Therapy."  Those great chicken dinners would be lost to the recesses of my mind...just flickering images...like the ones I see of me standing on top of a building, naked, wearing a beer hat and smoking a cigar...images of meaningful nonsense. That was until I went to the Chicken Shack. Oh, sweet Chicken Shack. Let me hold you. Let me kiss you. Let me call you aunt...wait...never mind. Chicken Shack does what it does...and it does it amazingly! Chicken Shack chicken is never frozen. The breasts and the wings are huge...like Busty Dusty big. Ah, memories...I almost suffocated at a club in Pittsburgh once. The 5 strip lunch/dinner is more than enough for the biggest eater.  It comes with fries and a drink for under 8 bucks.  Fountain drink for unlimited soda. I saw these two huge fat guys mowing down a 5 piece. They looked full. They looked content. They looked like they had hypertension. God Bless America. The wings are excellent but I recommend the strips. More meat. Tender. Juicy. Delicious. Same price. The sauces. The sauces are key to a place like this. Like having weed on you when trying to sleep with Jennifer Aniston. Mandatory.  Well, Chicken Shack doesn't disappoint. Recently I had the special Habenero Honey. It was sweet. It was hot. It hurt a little bit after 4 pieces. It hurt the good way...like being dumped by Amanda Peet...that body can only keep you happy for a long time...then you are just praying for a stroke.  The BBQ sauce is excellent. The Garlic Parmesan sauce is absolutely amazing. The chili lime isn't very good, sorry. Too limey...like Hugh Grant. If chicken isn't your thing...then you think that Rex will tear into you for going to THE CHICKEN SHACK...but no...not at all...they have a burger there that is amazing. A single. A double. A triple. You can add cheese and bacon. Yes...triple cheese and bacon.  Oh is it good...it's really good. I ate it. I cried. I ate it again. I cried harder. I threw a chair out the window. I ran. They have an all you can eat chicken wing and 1 dollar beers. If that doesn't sound good to you then you are a loser. I say that with no hesitation. No remorse. No second guessing. You are the type of person who would hold up a bank but leave the stuff in the safe.The atmosphere is great. They have funny slogans on the wall. Cute. Sickeningly cute. Rex is sarcastic. Rex hates it. Others will love it. The bottom line is that this is obviously a family place run by people who actually care. Rex is very happy to find a local business that prides itself on quality and building an ongoing local relationship with customers. Nice owners. Great food. Local. Cheap. Quality. When Rex dies please batter and deep fry him. He deserves the honor. Take a bite. Take a big bite. You love the way hate tastes.I went here ever so eager. My eyes went wide at the menu - so many possibilities and so many sauces to try.I opted for the standard wings. And went with trying 4 of the sauces - hot, damn hot, chili lime, and habanero honey. Blue cheese and ranch for dipping. Also ordered fries with fry sauce and potato salad.The wings themselves are nice and plump. Very good quality. And the wings are actually breaded, which can be hard to do well. But the breading was nice and crisp and had a good flavor. So all is good with the actual wings.The sauces, though, are lacking. The hot was actually more like a mild. Zero heat and little flavor. The chili lime was similar. I could barely tell it was chili lime there was so little flavor. The habanero honey also had zero heat and was too sweet. The damn hot, however, was fabulous. It had heat and flavor, but wasn't hot just for the sake of being hot. So, with the exception of the damn hot (which is the hottest on their menu), if you don't like heat or lots of flavor in your wing sauce, this might be the place for you. This is where they lose major points. The sauce is the most crucial part of the wings.The blue cheese and ranch were ok, but not great. They didn't add anything to the wings. They're just sorta there.The fries are really good. They are shoestring fries that are crispy and non-greasy. The fry sauce was just average. They do also offer chili cheese fries.The potato salad was edible. And that's pretty much the best I can say about it.Good service. Props for the $1 drafts and all you can eat wings.Overall, if they could just get some better wing sauces (or my taste buds suddenly deteriorate), I might be back.Chicken Shack.I'll keep you my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aqwn3jdQLCWnb59gHK4nAw?select=RdNqQUC1ycmedKx6NWD0Rg#YUmHZ0Wy3sIY5w6H0OZDKwWho has to know?Best fingers. Best fries. That's all you need to know.Nice little joint you guys got here tucked away in a plaza off of East Sunset Road.I ordered the number 1 combination which consists of 6 Wings, Fries, and a Drink for 8.29 plus tax. I chose chipotle honey barbeque sauce for the wings which has a nice combination of sweet and spicy. The wings themselves has a slight breading on it which gives it more of a crunch to its crispiness.As for the fries, SHOESTRING! I dont think I have had shoestring fries that good in a long time. If anything, I would go out on a limb and say it was even better than the wings! I can only fantasize how good their chili cheese fries might be. They also have chicken strips, burgers, and a salad with your choice of grilled or fried chicken. Now for the downers. Their prices are bit high for your basic chicken wings. The biggest thing I think that doesnt make sense is that they dont serve you any sauces with your wings like ranch, blue cheese, etc. Of course you can have your choice of dipping sauce but only if you wanna pay extra. Also if you want veggies like celery or carrots, that is also a separate charge. WHAT? When you think of wings, you see a plate or basket full of wings, fries, veggies and dipping sauce. That right there is perfection. I can think of many other places that give you dipping sauces and veggies included with your meal or at least free when you ask for it. With everything mentioned, mostly good and a little bit of bad, this warrants 4 stars. To the owners, if you are reading this, a little bit of sauce and veggies goes a long way.Wow! It should be called CheapSkate Shack! We are obviously regulars here (ashamed to say Dukedom) and they wouldn't let us have a water cup...basically accusing us of trying to steal soda. My daughter drinks water or soda. If she wanted soda today, we would have bought a soda like all the other times before. But to hassle regular customers about a stupid water cup is RIDICULOUS!! Being the greasy dive you are CS, you will attract the less than savory crowd who take advantage of water cup privileges. Solve the problem without insulting your regular paying clientele!Also from the lack of cleanliness in your dining area...you could do for a health inspection.Thanks to Bethany E. for turning me on to Chicken Shack. To my surprise after I checked in and was seated Bethany came over and introduced herself. It was a pleasure to meet you finally Bethany!It was the lunch hour and Chicken Shack was rockin although I had no problem finding convenient parking. I opted for the six wing combo which included shoe string fries and a beverage. Service is prompt - within minutes my entree was brought to my table and I was taken back of the size of  the chicken pieces served. I chose chipotle sauce on the side which was tasty and the fries were also yummy. The portions are generous here and I couldn't finish all  the fries.I would definitely return to the Chicken Shack.After living in Vegas for a year, I'm used to going to places with high ratings/reviews and being underwhelmed. This place lived up to the hype! Large, meaty wings in great sauces, with surprisingly tasty shoestring fries- and I don't even like the shoestring cut! Service was also surprisingly friendly and prompt, so don't let the location and exterior fool you.The #4 combo is the way to go for a little of everything: 3 wings, 3 strips, fries, a drink (fountain), and toss in bleu cheese or ranch for just under fifty cents extra. Your total is under $10 and it's enough to stuff you to the gills or share (though for dinner I'd add on an extra 6-piece).Habanero honey and jamaican jerk are really tasty sauces- as my BF said, I'd buy these bottled if they were available! The bleu cheese dressing tastes homemade, which makes paying extra for it a little less annoying.Wish they had more than one location- I think they'd do well on the West side (hint, hint).Read the reviews from this place a couple weeks ago and got excited, and as usual...I was let down!!! I never like to review a place after one visit anymore, so I gave it a couple chances. Fail fail fail. To succeed in business, you need great customer service. This place does not have it. After reading on their website that they close at 9pm, I get in my car around 7:45pm to travel 11 miles to this place. I arrive around 8:15pm. It's a family of four head of me in line. The guy behind the register is preparing some take out orders and never acknowledged them. They had enough with the waiting, and the lady says she's ready to order. His response? "Oh we're closed". What the hell are you talking about you're closed? He says "we close at 8:30 and its 8:31". I couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing! If the customer is inside before those doors are locked? You're still open for them!!! The lady and her family angrily walk out, and I do the same. What made me even more mad??? I get to my car and see that it's only 8:24pm!!! The boy was straight up lying to our faces!!!I told myself that I was done with that place, but because of such high remarks on yelp, I wanted to try the food. Decided to go back the weekend after, early in the day, so I can see if the hype was real. Ordered 3 wings, 3 tenders and fries. Back in college, I worked for KFC... So I know exactly what old fryer oil looks like when used on chicken, and what it smells like. Old oil (reused or not changed) will make your chicken darker, and make it taste funny. This was the case with Chicken Shack. Absolutely nasty. Fries were soggy and lacking taste. It was so bad that it prompted me to go online to find out who owns this place. Whoever you are...we need to speak. You served me a trash worthy product. Get it together. Will not return.Worst treatment ever & it was from the OWNERS. As someone who has worked in in the restaurant business for over 15 years now starting as a dishwasher and working my way up into management doing everything in-between I have NEVER seen anyone else, let alone myself, treated so unfairly in my life. I've been eating at Chicken Shack for over 6 years now. I live right across the street and have filled up MANY loyalty cards with them. Along with bringing my friends and family into their restaurant. Their cashiers and guys who normally work their are great. I call my orders in, they know me, and they take care of me. The other day when I stepped in the owners were working. I had called my $16 order in ahead of time, and the female owner came over and rang me up. I told her it was nice seeing them in the store and handed her my loyalty card. This is when the fun began. She begins to tell me they only stamp the cards for combos. Well...a combo is $6, I just spent $16, and normally the guys would stamp it for me anyways. I never even knew it was a combo card because they always stamp it because I'm a loyal, regular customer. Much like we do where I work. We actually take care of our regulars. I mentioned the $16 dollars to her...and I am not joking...this is where she proceeded to tell me that people like me were, in her words, "combo jerks". "People like you come in all the time trying to be "Combo Jerks"." I laughed it off because honestly I was surprised an employee would speak to a customer like that. Let alone the owner. As I got my order to leave I told her I was disappointed, and her response once again was "just don't be a combo jerk." I took the food and drove home. Still thinking of how I was treated I didn't think to check the food. It's usually just fine. Well, I got home to be surprised that half my chicken was burnt. I had had it. I called the store back. Got the run around for 5 minutes until I got the owner on the phone. I told her half the chicken was burnt and her response was "You were complaining from the second you got up to the counter. If you don't like it bring it back." WOW...just WOW and when I proceeded to tell her I'd never be coming back she hung up on me. Tell me that isn't great ownership. I don't know peoples excuses sometimes for being so mad at the world but this ruined my day. I was only looking for a meal before a night at work where I deal with customers with the utmost respect every night, and I lost my local eatery along with a dose of hope for humanity. I'm already spreading the word to those I've brought in. My family will not be back and there's a lot of us. I can't speak for my friends but they haven't been happy with their service in a while either so we'll see once they hear this story for the ages.Shack attack! From the first time we set foot in Chicken Shack to the present, it's been our favorite place for wings.  I have a catch phrase of 'Shack Sunday' because we always come here to get our wings during football season.  They open at 10 so it's perfect for game time. They are located off of Sunset in the Smiths shopping plaza so it's easy to find with ample parking.  Now let's get down to business- the wings here have stayed consistently huge, succulent and flavorful.  They offer a huge variety of sauces for the wings.  All are great.  The hot sauce and the honey habanero are our favorites.  You can choose to have them tossed in the sauce or on the side.  Tip- if you're carrying out, get the sauce on the side and toss them yourself when you get home. I hate to leave out mentioning the over addicting shoestring fries.  They do not skimp on these tasty sides.  The BBQ baked beans are also a favorite of mine. It's always a tough choice of mine which side to get.  Customer service is reliably top notch. They treat us like one of their friends every time.  They are always friendly and make a point to say hi even during a busy time.  I always appreciate their kindness as well as the amazing food.  Any day is always a great day for wings!I had to visit the Chicken Shack because I was craving their chicken fingers. I've been here a few times before, but I finally took the time to visit again and write a review.Inside, the walls are decorated with license plates from different states. It has a pretty cool feel to the place, but it can get crowded given the fact that it is small.Since I was buying food to feed 4 people, I ordered the shack pack (your choice of 25 wings OR 20 fingers, two large sides, and 4 drinks for $34.99). I opted for the chicken fingers and chose the macaroni salad, potato salad, and the coleslaw for my sides (I decided to get an extra side item instead of the 4 drinks). The chicken is supposed to be their showcase item, but it ended up being more of a letdown. The fingers are a good size for what you pay for and they're juicy when you bite into them, but the fingers I got tasted like they had been cooking in old oil (it wasn't that pretty golden-brown color, but more on the darker brown side). The sides were alright. The macaroni salad and potato salad were the better of the sides. Unfortunately, the coleslaw looked like it was put in a blender before serving. It was more on the sweet side and really watery.They didn't deliver on the wow factor, but I'm willing to give Chicken Shack another chance.Went to Chicken Shack last night after reading all the reviews here on Yelp, and having on my "Bookmarks-to try" for the past 2 months. Take Out or Dine In w/ Catering Available.Upon walking in at 8pm, I noticed approximately 75% of the the tables had chairs up, which was a sign of closing. My thought was they are closing early, as the hours posted show 9pm. Fortunately, we were able to dine in as I had zero interest in a takeout order.We were greeted promptly by a friendly cashier named John, who I learned his parents own this franchise.1 of 2 TVs were on, with enjoyable background music. After listening a while, I didn't notice a radio station; yet I heard a variety of artists. I asked if it was Pandora, and was told they use Direct TV and play 80s, 90s, Top Hits, Adult Alternative. All my kinda music, so I was pleased listening while awaiting our order.The wall decor of cartoon like bubbles displaying humorous chicken related quotes were amusing. The license plate theme was unique. The use of a mirror on one entire wall gave the illusion the place was larger than it was. 25 wings (1/2 Habanero Honey & 1/2 Damn Hot), 10 chicken fingers, 2 sodas, large order of shoestring fries, and a few dipping sauces were brought to our table from John within 15 minutes or less, served in to go boxes. Expensive at around $1 wing and $1.23 per chicken finger. Did not appreciate nickel & diming the extra .39 cents for fry sauce, .49 cents for bleu cheese, .49 cents for honey mustard, etc. Usually at these high wing/finger prices, small 1 ounce sauces/containers are complimentary.My son enjoyed his chicken fingers, fry sauce and honey mustard sauce. I enjoyed my breaded chicken wings tossed in the Habanero Honey, but the Damn hot wings were not to my liking as it reminded me too much of Frank's hot sauce. The good news is they offer 20 sauces to choose from. More good news is these breaded wings were cooked to perfection and very large in size.Our shoestring fries were really good!"No Coke! Pepsi!"...SNL circa 1978. My son had Pepsi, despite him preferring Coke. I had a Mountain Dew which I love, and when I returned for Round 2/refill, the machine was out of syrup as it came out mostly watery. Same thing happened w/ the Brisk Iced Tea; so 3rd choice was Orange Crush and was good. Another patron was experiencing the same difficulty, as we stood at the machine together attempting to get our drinks. Perhaps this was part of the closing process is to shut something off in the fountain machine, not sure; but it clearly didn't produce sodas properly. Storing the mop bucket w/ string mop next to the fountain drink machine is unsightly to patrons and really should be placed discreetly in the back.Around 840pm, the background music turned off and the cleaning process began. This was the second clue the employees are ready to go. Reminder, 1st clue was upon entering seeing all the chairs up on tables. Nothing makes me more sick to my stomach than watching a dirty string mop the floors within 15 feet of me, while I am eating. My appetite was lost and my son was filled after 6 wings, so we placed the to go boxes in plastic bags that John kindly offered and left. Personally, I believe cleaning and turning off music, chairs up on tables, etc should all be done AFTER the last patron has left the restaurant. I understand turning off the "Open" window light at the front, possibly locking the door, but not indirectly hinting to the patrons that it's time to leave when it's not even 9pm. It's not like the patron area is the enormous size of a banquet hall requiring hours of cleaning effort. My guess is Chicken Shack front area is around the size of a 2 car garage, requiring no more than 15 minutes if one were to really provide serious effort.Lastly, some of the conversation was regarding Yelp as John saw me taking photos and I told him I was going to do a review on Yelp. I told him it was the wonderful reviews on Yelp that inspired me to take my son here tonight for dinner. He mentioned the owners (his parents) focus mostly on the bad reviews and not so much the good reviews. I tried to inspire him by advising him to look at the bright side, as the bad reviews will help improve the learning process to what patrons experiences are, and the good reviews are certainly noteworthy and overall, outweigh the bad ones. Hopefully the owners also focus praise to their employees regarding the good reviews too. Employee morale is vital to success!So although my son and I shared a 2.5 star experience last night (rounded up to 3 stars), we will most likely return, just much earlier in the evening.

The food is great but service is terrible at this location. I accidentally asked for the house dressing instead of the vinaigrette and you would have thought I asked them for the world on a platter. The restaurant was an absolute mess, napkins and food all over the floor, sticky tables and even though I informed someone that the soda fountain was out of syrup, it wasn't attended to the entire time we were there. It's a shame to have such a poor representation of this great chain.

Review Text :
A trip with family to Vegas means no clubbing or drunken shenanigans. First thing on our to-do list? Look for a Vietnamese restaurant.The Vietnamese-Chinese cuisine sign initially deterred us from Pho Kinh Do but to our pleasant surprise, it turned out to be more authentic and tasty than many Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area. We ordered the family menu which included dishes like Ca Kho To (catfish in claypot), Canh Chua (tamarind soup), Ga Xao Xa Ot (lemongrass chicken) and Thit Kho (saut√©ed pork). My family, including those visiting from Vietnam, agreed the food was flavorful and comparable to a home-cooked meal.www phokindont dot com Pros- #1.Cheap and tasty Chicken Banh Mi. It's all about the delicious bread. I have to give them credit for that.  Cons- #1. Really bad service. The waitress could not understand slow and perfectly spoken English to the point she was rude and short with us. Not cool considering we eat Pho regularly and know how to order right from the menu. Maybe it was my blonde hair and blue eyes or my friend's biceps that caught her off guard. Either way I felt discriminated against. Not a good feeling. #2. The Pho broth- Well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to Pros. The broth tasted dirty and just off which are usually a sign of a dirty kitchen.....#3. The meat in the Pho- Where's the beef? There were 3 pieces of beef. Nuff said. #4. Our order came out REALLY wrong. We both ordered Pho Tai and one of us was the lucky recipient of tripe. Big surprise at this point. Summary- As the great C. Barkley would say," That's turrible" . Since there are so many other Vietnamese restaurants on point in the same vicinity I will not be returning unless I suddenly get a craving for mop water. PHOKING EPIC FAILFriends from out of town were hankering for Vietnamese and we chose this place based on the mostly 4 star reviews and the free egg rolls with the Yelp check in.  It has probably been a good two years since I had pho.  That's weird for me to say or even fathom but hitting up all the places I have bookmarked ain't easy.My wife got the rare beef pho which she said was the best pho she's had in LV.  I didn't even have a shot at trying it since she scarfed it down so quick.  I went out of the box and got the curry pho which was filled with veggies and dark meat chicken on the bone.  I really liked the flavor and you could tell this broth had been simmering for quite some time.    Misti Y's review of Kinh Do was the one that stood out while deciding which pho spot to choose.  Lo and behold..who do we run into there but Misti and Bobby Y!!  I didn't notice her review was 2 years old but we still liked it a lot and definitely plan on getting our next phix of pho here!I was pho-kinh recommended to try this pho-kinh place.I pho-kinh-do love this pho-kinh place.I pho-kinh-do love the pho-kinh sweet spectacular service and attention by the lady boss.I pho-kinh-do love how deserted it was at an early lunch. For once I'm not pho-kinh staring at hordes of zombified-over-pho-kinh-partied-out-Vegas-tourists.I pho-kinh-do love my bowl of pho with its (not so oily) tasty broth, fresh beef, and pho-kinh perfectly done noodles.I pho-kinh-do love how cheap it is (after dropping pho-kinh pretty shillings down in most other Vegas spots or the Cathay dimsum craphole nearby).I will be pho-kinh back and totally pho-kinh recommend this place for those who need to fix a pho-kinh hangover (or a sick tummy like mine).Btw, might as well say that I pho-kinh love that BMW outside tinted so dark (including the windshield) that makes me think two pho-kinh words: "PIMP"+ "PUSHER". X)[PS. Pho is pronounced "Fa/Fuh" not "Fo/Foe"]Pho Bosa was closed (Wednesday) so I ended up here. This is another one of those moments....Thank. You. Yelp. App.The place was easy to find, about a mile up the road from Bosa on Spring Mountain. I walked in and was seated quickly with a fine view of the large TV playing Fox News (?). Tick...tick..tick. No one came to take my order for what felt like 30 minutes, although I'd guess it was more like 10. I finally scooped up an order of rare steak and well done brisket pho along with an iced tea and an order of spring rolls ($12 total). About 5 min later, everything came out. Iced tea was standard. Spring roll was good and the pho....the ____ing pho....was phenomenal. The brisket wasn't fatty, the rare beef didn't taste like concrete and the broth was the best pho broth I've ever had. I was full early on and just kept having one more spoonful...then another...then another...then I was sweating...then I ate more...then there was none left...then I was sad. Compounding the sadness was the fact that no waiter had stopped by for another 10 minutes, so I had to stare into my empty bowl (the alternative of Fox News wasn't any better). I eventually just got up and went to the register. I'm 4-starring this for now, but I have a feeling it will be bumped up to a 5 soon enough. Why? Only the finest in pho will get a 5-star rating from me and I have a lot more searching to do! Also, bleh to the service. Blehh.Note: the check-in offer of two egg rolls is not offered anymore :(EASY 5 star review in my book based on these two things : The Pho Tai & Banh Mi!Pho Tai ($6.95): Rare Sliced Beef Noodle Soup. Awesome! Broth is a little darker and more "meaty" with just the right amount of salt. So much flavor in here...from the first sip, I knew this was my new FAVORITE in Vegas!  Portions are large, lots of meat and goodies hiding inside, and all at a great price!  Can't ask for more!Banh Mi Thit Nuong ($4): Grilled BBQ Pork, Carrots, Mint, etc. Sooo good! Packed with so many goodies in a soft sweet bread, with a little crisp on the outsides. BEST Banh Mi I've had so far!  The difference is in the flavor of the grilled pork, and the amount they give you in the sandwich...Yum :PBanh Mi Bo Kho ($7.95): Beef Stew with French Bread. VERY flavorful broth, fairly spicy, with super tender beef...fall apart actually. Again, the best I've ran into so far, although I don't typically order this dish often, so take that for what it's worth. Can't go wrong here!We got Complimentary Egg Rolls with Yelp check-in! These were pretty tasty, with all the veggies / goodies to wrap them up and eat.  Good, especially considering they were free LOL.I found me a new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas!  Thanks Yelp :PPics :I never wanted to find the best pho in Las Vegas. Well, I would in an ideal world, but after being burned so many times, I just wanted one place that measures up to my Californian standards. I think my quest is finally over after lunch yesterday.All you really need is a hot flavorful broth, lots of delicious meat, reasonable noodles, and some thai basil and lime on the side. The pho dac biet (#5 [EDIT: appetizers are #1-#4] on the menu) came out very quickly after I placed the order (not a busy lunch hour). It satisfied my palate entirely, and it was very filling, about the same as a typical large pho somewhere else (there's only one size here) and very much worth the $7.49.I also ended up with two cha gio (egg rolls) from the free Yelp check-in offer. They were very crunchy and filled with pork, carrots, and mushrooms the way I'm used to having them, which is not the same as your typical Chinese egg roll with lettuce and whatever mush is in the filling. A quick wrap in lettuce and a dunk in nuoc mam was all I needed for a nice appetizer.Pho Kim Long, Lemongrass Cafe, and Da Lat all failed the test, but Kinh Do has passed with flying colors. Other than the Mexican server, they'd fit perfectly in San Jose. Actually, given the demographic trends, I guess they'd still fit.This is our usual Sunday morning stop before leaving Vegas. It is the perfect meal to end an exhausting and fun weekend. The employees will get you seated right away and are very accommodating. The pho bowls are only offered in one size, but it is a generous portion of broth and noodles. In my opinion, the Pho Tai could use a little more meat. All of the flavors are on point. I enjoy that the broth is a little darker and beefier tasting than other places. Note, they no longer offer the free egg rolls with check-in. But they are delicious so I recommend ordering them to share amongst the table. They come in a set of 4 with dipping sauce and lettuce and cucumber to wrap. If you're looking for pho in Vegas, this is where you need to go!Since Ramen Misoya was closed for interior remodeling I stopped in for lunch here. It was before the noon hour on a Thursday so parking was no issue.The older male who I suspect is the owner filled my request to be seated by a power outlet even though it was a table for 8. I started off with some pork springs rolls that were tasty and fresh. I also ordered the regular chicken Pho which was tempurature hot, contained generous amounts of chicken and the broth was delish.Overall a solid luncheon - good food and service, so I'll be back.

Restaurant name  Hot Dog Haus

Review Text :
The Skinny: great juicy dogs for $2.99 - the Chicago dog comes complete with the neon green relish, make sure to try the schnitzel minus the bun, skip on the fries (3.5) Service: it's counter service and let's face it, the decor is a little tired (3) Value: the food is pretty good while the prices are reasonable, it's not a bad place to try out(4).Hankering for a good hot dog, we stumbled upon the reviews for Hot Dog Haus. A branch off of Cafe Heidelberg, it's hidden behind a Marie Callender's and can be a little hard to find.We ordered the Chicago dog, the Polish dog and a Euro-schnitzel (veal schnitzel in a kaiser bun) with a side of fries.Hot dog wise, they use the real deal here - Vienna Sausage. The casing's got a nice snap and keeps all the lovely juices inside as you bite in.The Chicago Dog is legit - sporting a poppy seed bun, neon green relish, mustard, fresh tomatoes, onion, pickle and peppers.  Absolutely no ketchup as it ought to be. It was pretty delish.The Polish Dog was loaded with saukeraut and mustard, had a nice flavour to the sausage that was distinctly different from the Vienna Sausage. Saukeraut was the word of the day because it was a little sweeter than your usual variety.French fries were okay while they were hot but got soggy quickly as they cooled down. I probably wouldn't order this again.Curious, we also ordered the standard Euro-schnitzel - a kaiser bun with schnitzel inside ($5.99; $1 extra for the upgrade with mayo, tomato, and lettuce).The schnitzel was absolutely lovely. Crisp, light on the outside, the schnitzel was tender and moist on the inside. The lemon it was served with added just the right amount of acidity. Unfortunately, the Kaiser bun was a different story. Overly dry, its size seemed to overwhelm that wonderful tasty morsel inside. The lack of condiments accentuated the subpar bread. It may be better almost to serve the schnitzel on its own.Given the food, the ambience and the service, I'd probably give this place a good 3.5 stars overall for their great hot dogs and schnitzel. It loses 1.5 stars for the french fries and the bun that schnitzel was served with.

Review Text :
Opening night! Loved it. I tried the brussels sprouts and the grits 'n' sausage appetizers, and both were excellent.  I ate the chicken 'n' dumplings main dish, and it was perfect. the vegetables really made the dish - perfectly crisp and fresh. i finished my meal with the pecan and fig pie with "cream cheese and citrus zest" ice cream, and was blown away. the ice cream was fantastic - highlight of the meal for me.i drank a nice glass of arizona wine and a nice ($8) AZ farmhand cocktail, which was a tad bit sweet for my taste, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.service was flawless, prices fair, and environment lovely. can't wait to return to give it a 5th star.Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start??Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what "ricard" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked "the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said "get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in "Six Billion Dollar Man" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially ("no ordinary pasta," said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.I'll be back- thanks BT!The tagline (and shiny new door handles) that say "Come Together" couldn't be more appropriate for Beckett's Table... Last night was only their fourth night open, and I'm giving them a solid four stars.  The Becketts and partners Scott and Katie Stephens did a remarkable job with the renovations of what used to be "That's Italiano."  The environment is extremely comfortable and warm.  The staff was spot-on, starting with the hostesses.  And throughout our meal, Court, our server, made plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions about the menu.  We happened to see a handful of friendly faces and friends dining while we were there as well.   We started off with the mac n cheese with pancetta and the oven roasted organic root vegetables (both a bargain at 5 dollars each).  Next up was the romaine salad and brussel sprouts, which are not to be missed.  The pickled golden beets in the romaine salad were unique and delicious, as were the hot appetizers and sides.  When I couldn't place one of the vegetables, Court was right there with the answer for me: parsnips!We paired our first course with the Pilsbury "One Night Stand" ros√© and liked it so much, we had another round.For our entrees, I had the blood orange glazed salmon and J went with the fork tender short ribs.  Both were large servings, especially the short ribs, and the description for these is perfect; no knife needed.  I actually liked the short ribs so much, that i ate more of that than I did the salmon, which had a bit too much orange glaze for me.  As if that weren't enough food, we finished up with an order of the fig & pecan pie...it is served with a cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream, the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  The only suggestion that Jared had for this course, was to also offer a Root Beer Float.  Perhaps we'll see that on the menu in the future?!One funny thing about the evening was that they were out of the "pat√© all the time," which was ok, as we can try it next time!  We will definitely be back to Beckett's Table soon - I see it being a regular in our rotation of neighborhood spots for sure!I loved the simplicity of my first dining experience at Beckett's Table. What looked like copper pipe cut for the napkin rings, small vases with a sprig of mint on each table... definitely no unnecessary frills here! Luckily the surroundings are simplistic because when the dishes are served - look out! Magic, spice and everything nice begins.We ordered almost everything on the menu (or so it seemed).So when it comes to starting off the meal, I highly recommend sharing the grilled cheese with pancetta & roasted red pepper tomato soup AND the vegetable chop salad with pumpkin seed brittle and a champagne vinaigrette. Although I won't lie - the creamy grits & spicy andouille sausage and mustard came in as a close second. The server mentioned there were three (count them....3!) different types of sausages in the dish. Fantastic and very unique.Onto the entrees! We tried four but of the ones we picked it was a close tie between the short ribs and the pork osso buco confit. The pork was interesting because it was served with a butternut squash spaetzle, roasted veggies and a black pepper reduction. Quite the combo!Looking for some serious winter-ish food?? Don't pass up the chicken n dumplings...just like mom used to make (shhh....only waaaaay better!)I almost forgot about the cocktails! They run a little on the sweet side so I'd recommend a cocktail to start but then stick with wine. We tried almost all of the cocktails but my fave was Miss Katie's Pimms Cup!Lastly, let's talk about dessert.While the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter and graham cracker was a novel idea - DO NOT PASS UP THE FIG & PECAN PIE. The fig is mashed into the most amazing crust (and I hate pie crust normally) and served with this cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream that was TO DIE FOR.The service was fantastic. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were larger than I'd expect for the price. Truly a wonderful addition to Arcadia.Lets start with the drinks, shall we. After all, it was "miss katie's pimms cup" that lured me here, being vegan, food choice has become an after thought. My drink, miss katie's pimms cup (pimm's #1, ketel one vodka, muddled cucumber, ginger and sprite) was amazing. So refreshing, not too sweet, subtlety of cucumber and ginger, I could have drank these all night and it would have been worthy of 5 stars, but a girls gotta eat!After I read the menu, and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen, I actually felt guilty for being Vegan. I too wanted to enjoy one of those mouthwatering meals. However, Chef Justin had no qualms about catering to my needs. I was informed he was preparing something special for me. I do Love surprises. It was quite a treat to have something so artfully presented to me. (see pics) Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious! It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of. It really says a lot about Chef Justins level of customer care that he went out of his way to prepare me something that was not just a bunch of sides thrown together on a plate. It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors. It was my pleasure to meet Chef Justin last night  and I can't thank him enough. My husband had the Short Ribs (see pics), which he'll attest, were amazing, as well as the Fig and Pecan Pie (darn, no pic) that blew him away. All put together with stellar service form Cort our server, it was a Wonderful evening that we will look forward to enjoying again and again.P.S.I hear they will be adding  daily Vegan/Vegetarian/GF options to their menu by the new year. I cannot wait!Probably the best salmon I've had in long time. It was cooked perfectly and the blood orange glaze, while a little bit of a sweet shock to my palate initially, really balanced with the accompaniments. It was good that our server advised me that the couscous would be cold -- I would have expected hot, especially on a winter menu but: (a) this IS Arizona, not the northeast and (b) with its refreshing mint accent, it was the perfect accessory to the salmon. The last thing I ate on my plate was the shaved veggie salad. It was such a great end to the meal. Really pleasant and crisp with the occasional treat of a yellow beet. I even shared a slice of beet with my friend, explaining: it IS possible to like beets if they are handled well. In this case, they were definitely handled well! A huge fan of Sam Pilsbury to begin with, I think this meal was made for his One Night Stand Rose. A match made in heaven!! On another visit I tried the pecan fig pie and really enjoyed it. The cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream was novel for me and really complimented the pie. The crust was also excellent. Last night, we had the creme brulee with shortbread cookies and it was a bit of a disappointment for me. While my dinning companion LOVED it, I found it a tad on the runny side and the shortbread crumbly. Flavors were fine but would probably try a different dessert on another visit. Beckett's Table is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene!Great meal there Saturday nite!  Our Waitress Allison was friendly, knowledgable and excellent at her job!The environment was fun, nicely designed and comfortable.  The wine list was complete with many offerings and I liked how Allison had both myself and my hubby taste it before pouring it!There were so many delicious sounding choice that it was difficult to choose...but we ordered the Shep's Pie and the Pork Confiet....both were fabulous, filling and unique!We saved room for dessert and we loved the bread pudding and pecan fig pie...the coffee rocked as well!Make sure you have a reservation the place was packed...and deserves to be!Absolutely Amazing!From start to finish, I was completely blown away by Beckett's Table.Beckett's Table is a type of restaurant I would expect to find in Beverly Hills or Hollywood, not in the desert city of Phoenix. BT has only been open a month but the owners have done an amazing job making sure this establishment runs like a well oiled machine that has no chinks in its chains. In fact, there is no way I would have known that BT has only been open a month if I was not told by our waiter. The inside of BT is dimly lit and has modern and rustic d√©cor. Even though the place was extremely busy, my fianc√© and I were able to grab two seats at one of their communal tables near the bar area. Right when we were seated we received complimentary warm wheat and white rolls with super creamy butter. These rolls were fantastic, especially the wheat ones which were really soft and sweet.BT's menu is made up of classic comfort foods with a twist. My fianc√© and I started the evening by ordering three appetizers. These are the apps we ordered:Creamy Grits with Spicy Andouille Sausage in a Mustard Au JusBeckett's Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Four Cheeses, Pancetta and Roasted Red Pepper Tomato SoupBacon Cheddar Biscuits with Apple Honey ButterAll three of these apps were delicious. The creamy grits were indeed creamy and contained lots of juicy, semi spicy sausage, tomatoes and grilled onions. The mustard au jus that was on the grits was also extremely flavorful. The little grilled cheese Sammie's were super cheesy and also somewhat salty because of the pancetta. The roasted red pepper soup was also really tasty. The bacon cheddar biscuits were warm, fluffy and had a nice bacon-y flavor. For dinner I ordered their chicken and dumplings entr√©e while my fianc√© ordered the fork tender short rib. The chicken and dumplings was served in a big bowl and contained juicy pieces of chicken, soft and squishy dumplings, peas, carrots, celery and an extremely flavorful herb saffron cream sauce. This dish brought back so many memories because as a child my dad used to make chicken and dumplings at least once a month. After him and my mom divorced when I was about 12 or 13, for some reason he never made them again. BT's chicken and dumplings was just as wonderful as the ones I ate as a child. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The name of my fianc√©s dish perfectly described it. The fork tender short rib really was fork tender. It was also huge and incredibly tasty. The big short rib was placed on a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes, green beans and a wonderful red wine herb reduction sauce. For dessert I got a slice of their fig and pecan pie with a scoop of citrus zest ice cream and my fianc√© got their bacon s'mores plate. My fig pecan pie, which won a Phoenix pie contest not long ago, was amazing. It tasted so much different than a normal pecan pie. The figs gave it such a different flavor and texture. The citrus zest ice cream was also unique and tasted wonderful. My fianc√©s bacon s'mores dessert was phenomenal. Forget the s'mores you make while camping, BT's s'mores blow those boring things out of the water. BT's s'mores plate comes with graham crackers, toasted homemade marshmallows, chocolate covered bacon and homemade creamy peanut butter that has caramel sauce drizzled on top of it.  All of these components come on a plate and it is up to you to put it all together in s'more form. It's funny because Scott Stephens (one of the owners) personally came over to us and said that my fianc√© was the first person he had seen actually take the time and build a s'mores sandwich instead of just eating all the elements with a fork. BT's s'mores are by far the best s'mores I have ever had. They were sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time. The service at BT was fantastic. Our server Josh was incredible. He was super friendly, funny and attentive. He talked to us about their menu, gave us suggestions on what to try and what his favorite dishes were and even joked around with us every time he checked up on us. Actually, everyone at BT was extremely friendly and they all seemed to enjoy working at BT. The prices here were great too. Our entire bill was less than $80 dollars, which I thought was great considering all the food we ordered. If you're ever in Phoenix then I highly recommend you pay a visit to Beckett's Table. This place is absolutely amazing and I look forward to the day I return to Phoenix so I can eat at BT again.Word on the street from the locals is that this new spot is the talk of the town, so I felt very lucky that I got to go here for a work dinner last night. We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about. The cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice). We got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either. For my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies. The desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite. I'm no expert in Scottsdale culture, but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh, classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers!Now that I've recovered from my food coma, I can happily report on my pleasant experience at Beckett's Table. As our large group walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back. I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening, the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture. Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia, you would never know once you get situated inside. We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire. Tasty!! It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it. So now moving on to the food. Order everything on the menu, or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious. The enchiladas have a zing to them, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness, the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more. Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone, I moved to the entree. Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option, I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go. Yes, it was worth every bite and more. The shorts ribs were so tender, the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment. To end the meal marathon, the group tasted all the desserts on the menu. Yes all of them. Each one was good in its own way, but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake. What can I say, I'm a chocoholic. In summary, this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group. You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere.Let me also might add...they are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.I went to Beckett's Table on a Wednesday night with the fabulous Aileen B. I was dying to try this place because she made my mouth water after reading her review. The pictures that on on yelp do not do this place justice. It is alot bigger than it appears and it is wide open. They are also already expanding the patio after only being open for a few months. We started off with some drinks, I had the classic painkiller which reminds me of a pina colada and you do feel like you are on a beach somewhere sipping on a cool refreshing drink. Aileen had a glass of white wine which for the life of me, I cannot remember but she did enjoy it and that is all that counts. We ordered some mac and cheese and roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer. OMG! People always seem to not enjoy the yummy goodness of brussel sprouts and believe me, this brussel sprouts were extra yummy. They were roasted to perfection and had shaved manchego cheese, pancetta, and had the sweet taste from the yummy lemon thyme vinaigrette. I am still drooling over those brussel sprouts as they really were that good. The mac and cheese was also divine. It was the creamy white mac and cheese with little bits of pancetta sprinkled very lightly over it. Between the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and the warm house bread with the honey butter, who needs a main course? ME! duh. So for the main course, I decided to order pork osso bucco. I was so excited about it because I had read how great it was in Aileen's review and I just had to try it. Well, unfortunately it was not all that great. The osso bucco was a little dry to me and I found that I am not a fan of spatezle as it had no flavor to me at all. I literally was moving my food around my plate like kid to make it seem like I was eating it. Aileen ordered wood fire mussels and she said they were good but needed a little bit more salt. I am not one to return my dish if I am not happy, but when our lovely waitress Rebecca came over to ask how the meal was, Aileen (bless her heart) let her know that I was not enjoying it. Rebecca asked if she could get me something else, but since I had my heart set on this dish, I politely declined. Well, to our surprise, Rebecca came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were not only comping the dish, but they were giving us the death by chocolate dessert as a treat. WOW! I was floored. That was very generous of them. The dessert was fabulous. Warm chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and a oreo cookie that was dipped in white chocolate. Yum. The drinks were delightful, the brussel sprouts were heavenly, the mac and cheese was creamy, the dessert was sinful, and my company was fabulous! Even though I did not like my main course, I will definitely be back to try something else as the service was great and they went above and beyond. Extra, extra special thanks to Aileen for inviting me and to my surprise treating me to dinner for my birthday.Comfort. Let me spell it out for ya Mary. Cool!Oh sooo goodModern. Urban. CozyFabulous. Fabulous staff. Fabulous clientele. Fabulous room.Oh sooo good.Relaxed. Yet energetic. Vibrant. T. Hmmm. T...Totally will visit again!The seared tuna app was outstanding with a crusty, herbed seared edge. My chicken and dumplings was okay...we were seated around nine and kitchen closes at ten. Dumplings were a little, well, stiff. Much like my rigid right wing cousin. I was missing Bisquick lol. Beef bourgoninase was outstanding. And the "smore" dessert was more miss than hit for me. VERY difficult to eat. Perhaps it was the bottle of wine that made it difficult to navigate the deconstructed dessert...or the intense light from the fullest moon EVAH!Great time. Good food. Great service. Good God. I will. Be. Back.Well once again I'm the last one to the party. Beckett's Table has been buzzing away since opening in the old That's Italiano space late last year. I've tried so many times to get in but for whatever reason or another didn't make it. Well finally made it in and I have to say, I wish I hadn't been so damn fashionably late. A couple of notable thing, the space is killer, rustic-industrial and second, the waiters are hot, especially our beefy ginger waiter Scott, Sam, hmm, maybe Bill? Anyway I can't remember his name but what I do remember was his attention to detail and service. Looking around you can see that all the servers were attentive and helpful to all their guests. I'm just a sucker for a beard, I mean great service. In case you're wondering who Beckett is, the name refers to local Chef Justin Beckett. The man has got some chops and has nothing to hide in his open kitchen. I love open kitchens, I think its an honest way of sharing how clean and organized a well lubed kitchen works, in other words the orders slid in and out with total ease. The menu is made up mainly of meat + starch with a few flare items that while are mostly comforting, shows the levels of sophistication, especially for a neighborhood kind of restaurant. At first glance the Country Pat√© ($12) seemed to be overwhelmed with way to many accompaniments. I'm a mustard and bread only kind of guy, but after trying each delicate bite with a different topping it all made sense. Each component is representative of a different tasting experience. Vinegary whole grain mustard is completely different than sun dried tomato making for an interesting and interactive experience. Another surprise appetizer was the Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage Trio ($9). I generally avoid grits simply because I've never really had them made well, though Beckett's version is as advertised, creamy and delicious. You can never go wrong with Schreiner's sausages, simply the best as far as I'm concerned. The only real let down was the Grilled Cheese ($9) served with bacon, four cheeses and roasted red pepper tomato soup. Every component was good except that main one, the bread, which was dry and not very tasty which made the entire dish unravel. Entrees were meat-centric starting with the oh-so-tender Osso Buco ($18). A pork shank braised in its own fat was melting tender, served atop butternut spaetzle and pepper reduction. The braising continues with fork tender Short Ribs ($19) that were big and beefier in flavor thanks to a red wine and herb reduction.What's a great way to round of such a rich meal? How about a slab of Fig and Pecan Pie ($6)? The sweetness really cuts through the richness from so many savory items. If you're still in the mood for unique, try the hands on Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores ($6). Yes, you read it right, slices of thick cut bacon that have been enrobed in chocolate. Once over the novelty, you realize that it's far too messy to finish.I think the party at Beckett's is only getting started.It's restaurant week, and I finally had the opportunity to try Beckett's Table. Having read so many good reviews, I decided to book a reservation here to take my mom out.I carefully inspected their prefixed menu, and was elated to see that they offered a vegetarian option.For our main course, my mom tried the chicken meatballs which, unfortunately, was not a fan because of the onions and peppery taste. (I guess she didn't look at the menu)I ordered the vegetable salad with champagne  vinaigrette, which was fine.For the main course, mom got the meat loaf, and I ordered the vegetarian mushroom lasagna (their vegetarian option).My mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted.My lasagna was decent, but I wish the vegetarian option wasn't a pasta dish.   I've been eating pasta this whole week, so I was sort of  sick of it.  A Total overload!Now as far as the service goes, it was great. Our server Michael did a great job explaining the menu, and the waiter's assistant kept our beverage full.My only fret is where they sat us. They gave us a table smack in the center of the restaurant, so regrettably, I could not provide pictures. Next time I'm going to ask for  patio seating now that the weather is getting cooler.I'm a fan - though avoid the deep fried deviled eggs that they offer every table. They were not at all what I expected (and I happen to love deviled eggs). The rest of our experience from the butter salad to her chicken with stuffing and my pork chop and baked beans were decadent. The coconut cake desert was one of the best moments of my life. Beckett's is an upscale experience at mid-range prices.Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype. That's when a restaurant throws in a communal table, brings back old school classics like deviled eggs as an appetizer, and/or covers bacon in chocolate on their dessert menu. Beckett's Table does all three, so people are obviously going to lose their shit over it. Let me break it down for you. Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:The wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)The Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment. The Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a brussels sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.That's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. Even my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service. The waiter was fantastic. Spot on.You know, it may be complicated to give me a real life orgasm, but it ain't that hard to give me a food-gasm. Now that's just a fact.

Review Text :
Holy cow... we had the worst experience here! The one up in Surprise was a million times better!First of all, we walked in with a party of four on a Friday night and they looked at us like we were crazy. The lovely gal up front asked if we had a reservation, and of course we did not. They weren't very busy at all for a Friday night, but she acted as if they were completely swamped. She informed us that it would be a 20 minute wait like it was the end of the world, but of course to us that seemed very reasonable. I guess we're just used to going to busier restaurants on the weekends?Anyway, the wait actually took over 45 minutes--definitely more than double her initial guess. Whatever, we were able to grab a few drinks before happy hour was over so we were happy. The bar was actually the busiest part of the restaurant, and their service was fast and friendly. However, the rest of the place definitely took away from our positive initial experience there.We were finally seated in the normal dining area and had the slowest, most forgetful waiter ever. I also noticed that the Hibachi area of the restaurant had barely anyone in it, so maybe that's why it took so long to get in. Everyone was trying to get into the smaller, normal restaurant section! :P We just wanted a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night, but unfortunately our experience wasn't so great.We all asked for waters, and the waiter brought one. Gee, thanks. Communal water? LOL. He also kept forgetting things we'd ask for, so we actually had to ask other waiters/waitresses on THREE separate occasions for things that our waiter didn't bring. We would've reminded him, but he seemed to disappear for long periods of time after forgetting things. He also seemed to know whenever we were complaining about him, because he would show up immediately after. 6th sense for unhappy customers? :)Now, for the food... I had seafood kabobs, and they were okay. However, two of us had scallops in our meals and they were not cooked correctly. I know it's hard to cook them correctly, but these were just bad. The rest wasn't bad, but nothing great either... especially for the price.Oh, I think the biggest part that bothered me was the location of the restrooms. It was right next to the kitchen, so it was constantly busy with waiter traffic. This is fine, but the attitude of said traffic was what bothered me. The first time, three waiters almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom. They just looked at me as if I was in the wrong place, and of course I said "excuse me." They didn't say anything... just looked at me and went around. On my second trip to the restroom, three waiters/waitresses were standing in the hallway just talking to one another, blocking the entire walkway. I walked up and stood there, finally saying "Excuse me, I have to get to the restroom." One girl moved to the side a little bit, but the guy standing in the middle had his arms crossed with his elbows sticking way out and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to maneuver around his impertinent elbows in order to fit through the tiny gap the one kind waitress had made for me. Basically, I was thinking "WTF?!"When we were done eating, after we had paid the bill, we then realized that we had been there for over 3.5 hours. Ridiculous! The service was extremely slow and mostly unfriendly, the food wasn't good for the price we paid, and we just ended up being pissed off in general after leaving. This was our first trip to this Hayashi, but we wanted to try it out after having so many fantastic experience up at the Surprise location. I guess the name is the only thing these 2 locations have in common.

Great bagels, I can see Poppy's being my go to for bagels. Comfy little spot to hang out, outdoor seating & friendly staff. Everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and a cup of joe.  Just talking about it makes me want another one, good thing Julia S. gave me some of her bagels to go.  'I'll be back' in my best Arnold impression.Wandering around Harris Teeter Morrocroft (Taj)  this morning, decided to pick up some smoked salmon with all the fixins'.  Did not want to drive to Poppy's for a bagel, so I decided to just break down and buy a couple from Harris Teeter. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Bright light shining, angels singing.  POPPY'S bagels are in the bin at Harris Teeter!!

Review Text :
Thank you, Seasons 52, for having me in for a special preview lunch last weekend... it was such a treat!I'd been to the Seasons 52 in Atlanta and had a great experience, so when I heard the news that they were opening a Biltmore location, I was really excited!  During my recent visit, I took a tour of the gorgeous new restaurant, which reminds me a lot of their Atlanta location.  It offers private dining rooms and even a room with A/V for business meetings... I also met some of the key partners of this Darden concept.  I actually sat next to Stephen Judge, their President, and learned a ton about the (100 wine selections / 65 available by the glass) on the menu from George Miliotes, Master Sommelier.  My favorite wine, from the eight I sampled, was the Aveleda Vinho Verde, Portugal 2009.  And as for the food, I didn't have anything I didn't like... it was all pretty spectacular.  Standouts were the Organic Green Salad with Oak-Grilled Mushrooms, Toasted Pistachios and Truffle Dressing (which I must mention arrives with a very unique presentation), and the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but theirs was perfectly paired with mashed sweet potatoes... mmmm!As for dessert, Seasons 52 supposedly originated the "mini indulgence," which is a small portion (shot glass size) of "the real thing," dessert... in all of its decadence!  I sampled the Old Fashioned Carrot Cake and the fresh fruit, which were both delicious!  The other ones looked amazing too, but I couldn't justify eating anymore in one sitting.  I did see the custom "Mini Indulgence Cake," which features 18 of these mini desserts; perfect for a celebration!As Sarah S mentioned in her review, everything on the menu at Seasons 52 is under 475 calories, so you can dine guilt free...**Fun fact: You can find out which "Mini Indulgence" matches your personality on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/seasons52?v=app_125847674120672(I was fresh fruit the first time and key lime pie the second time!)****Seasons 52 will be open to the public on 10/25, and I look forward to returning again real soon!I need to preface this by saying that this review was taken from 3 to 4 stars by way of dessert, but I'll get into that later.  I was invited to check out Seasons 52 last Thursday evening with a friend that I haven't seen in way too long and after checking out the menu online, it was a date! Seriously, google it, if your mouth doesn't water your a corpse.Everyone's really excited about the 'everything under 475 calories' thing and I get it...I suppose that is a pretty statement move on Seasons part. I will say that everything we had also tasted like it had less than 475 calories, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, I wouldn't come to Seasons for a steak if you know what I'm saying.....(i.e. filet mignon deserves a butter bath in my humble opinion) That said, I decided on the Caramelized  Sea Scallops with asparagus and sundried tomato pearl pasta (errrrr, Israeli Couscous) and my dining companion decided on.......wait for it........The Mesquite-Grilled Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables and roasted mushrooms! Yep! I did actually get to try it and like I said, I wouldn't come here for a steak. I, however, am the snobbiest of steak snobs so take that for what it's worth. It also didn't look like a Filet to me, more of a well pounded out top sirloin. I'm not claiming any deception, it just looked odd. My scallops were quite tasty and even though I missed the flavor that butter searing produces I would definitely order them again. The asparagus and pasta were good though surely difficult to really 'mess up'. The wine list was decent and I'm impressed that Seasons offers alternative menus for those that are vegetarian/vegan or have certain allergies or intolerance. This is when secksi time comes into play and the reason for the fourth star. DESSERT!Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse and Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust. Holy mother these little guys were divine. Served in what appear to be shot glasses, this was the perfect amount of sweet and delicious for two people that just consumed probably the healthiest thing they've eaten all week. Very rich and heavy, clearly hitting the 'under 475 calorie' mark by size alone. The restaurant itself has a pretty standard chain look/feel to it, reminiscent of a slightly upscale Cheesecake Factory. The service was great. Our server, Samantha was adorable and bubbly and was armed with enough familiarity of the menu to answer our questions knowledgeably. All in all a good experience. I'd go back for a dessert and wine happy hour (or four) in a second.i don't get it.our service was no bueno. our waiter rarely came around and kept forgetting things. also, they tried dusting our booth in the middle of our meal. i thought that was extremely tacky, it wasn't even close to closing or anything. they just felt like dusting over our dinner? they claim to be super healthy and fresh, but start to ask questions about the ingredients and freshness and you'll find out everything is rubbed in sugar and everything is frozen or pre-made. i went with the pork with haricot verts. i ordered it medium but it was well done and very dry. he sat my plate down and immediately said 'they over cooked it, would you like me to take it back?' 1. why would he bring it out if it was wrong?2. obviously, he didn't want to fix it or he wouldn't have even brought it to me....so i didn't send it back and i just added some salt to help it out. and i didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.so the price, combined with the food, and the bad service- i won't be going back.Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...Wow, came here again with a friend for lunch on Friday.Excellent service as always!! Lou was our waiter, he was very helpful in all depts.My friend Kris is very particular about what she eats, so this is a great place for her. They explain everything and can answer every question.Everything on the menu is low calorie. I got the mushrooms stuffed with shrimp and she got the Ahi tuna salad. Both were awesome.We also got the artichoke Pizza that was fantastic. They refill your drinks continuously and even their water is filtered. You can drink glasses of it without feeling you just poisoned yourself.The decor is dark wood and I think it is beautiful. They have an awesome little fire place in the front that I just love looking at.Restrooms are nice and clean, but the water never really got too warm to wash your hands.Lots of Parking, located in the Biltmore shopping Center/Also my friend got one of the desserts and she did not like it at all, she thought it was far too sweet, she said she could taste artificial sweetener in it.Lou was kind enough to take it off the bill.Awesome place and very healthy!This place is pretty damned good and I'm disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. I didn't understand the concept of fresh, healthy upscale eating so I was surprised that everything was so delicious while minimally impacting my ever-expanding waistline. It just goes to show you that in this world of poisonous, processed foods it is still possible to enjoy your food and be healthy so well done to these guys.I started off with a beer in the bar and started with the Blackened Steak and Bleu Cheese flatbread. The bread was thin and crispy and topped with two of my favorite things. Really delicious.For my main I had the grilled scallops with asparagus and tomato mushroom pearl pasta. The scallops were AMAZING and so tasty without being bathed in butter. My plate was served up so beautifully arrange with the asparagus spears arranged in a grid over the pasta, it was almost a shame to eat it...almost.Healthy then went out the window when we went through more than one of their Mini-Indulgence desserts. I had the key lime but my favorite was the raspberry with chocolate chip cannoli. Still fewer calories than a slice of cheesecake.The atmosphere is very nice, the service is great and like I said, you really can enjoy some delicious food with out so much butter, fat and additives.A good solid choice for a nice dinner or lunch.A friend of mine was in town and asked me to find a central meeting place for dinner. I got online to see what was good around the Biltmore area and found Seasons 52. Seasons 52 has a pretty user friendly website and it was easier to just type in reservations than to call directly. As it got closer to the reservation time, I called just to make sure they received the reservation and that everything was set. The phone was answered on the first ring and the woman quickly and very politely confirmed everything was in order.I arrived early and the hostess said it was fine to wait at the bar. After I sat down, I realized how gorgeous the bar was and in fact, the restaurant was huge and very well appointed. (see pics)The bartender introduced himself (Aaron) and was extremely friendly and efficient. When my friend arrived, we decided to just stay at the bar for dinner. The menu promised rustic cooking techniques like brick oven roasting & open-fire grilling that brings out natural flavors. The menu includes:FlatbreadsSalads/SoupsAppetizers:Shrimp Scampi (which I had)Asian glazed grilled chicken skewersLobster RavioliHummus Duo with Crisp Hawaiian Sea Salt LavoshBlistered shishito peppersLump Crab/Roasted Shrimp Stuffed MushroomsDuck Wing Lollipops (which I had)Ahi Tuna Tartare Caramelized Grilled Sea Scallops (which I had) Entr√©es:Entr√©e SaladsFish & SeafoodPoultry & MeatChef's SelectionsDesserts:Ganache BrownieCarrot Cake with Cinnamon HoneyChocolate Peanut Butter TortePies:PumpkinKey LimePecanBelgian Chocolate S'moresRaspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli (which I had - see pics)The wine list is bananas awesome!Whites:Chardonnay Pinot GrigioPinot Gris Pinot BlancSauvignon BlancRiesling Viognier Unoaked WhitesWhite Zinfandel Sparking DessertsReds:MerlotPinot NoirPetite SirahShivazGrenacheMonastrellZinfandel Tempranillo Sangiovese Cabernets & BordeauxPortFull bar for cocktails.

Review Text :
As a smart man once said: "Once it hits your lips it tastes so good!"That sums up everything about La Gourmandine Bakery!  The delicacies in the case looked scrumptious, it's hard to choose one... so I choose two!  I bought the D√©lice de Pistache and Paris-Brest.  The D√©lice de Pistache is Choux dough covered with pistachio mousseline and topped with dark chocolate.  I had planned on only taking a bite.  That did not happen.  In fact, as soon as I took the first bite I was floating away towards the pearly gates of heaven!  It was just divine!  The Choux dough was light and almond tasting, the pistachio mousseline was fluffy and distinctly tasted of pistachio (I hate when fillings don't taste like what they should) and the chocolate just topped off my dessert decent!  The Paris-Brest is Choux dough filled with hazelnut cream.  It actually looks almost like a doughnut.  It was the same heavenly taste!  They're actually very similar but different shapes.  The hazlenut again was distinct and the Choux dough was light with a slight crisp to it.  I would say my fave had to be the D√©lice de Pistache though.  But both were fantasmic!I also grabbd a sandwich, which was very good as well... But I didn't want to mention that first because I was too excited about th desserts!  I had the Le Campagnard, which is a French baguette with mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese.  The baguette was incredible, and I don't normally even like them.  Too hard to chew.  Even though it was a baguette, you could tell it was freshly baked that day, so it didn't have that stale taste a baguette from say, Panera, would have.  I'm glad they offer lunch, because it's a chance to grab a quick sammich and bring home dessert for later... or stuff your face with it then!Oh my! This place is great!My girls and I went on a sunny Saturday morning this past Summer. Surprisingly the line wasn't out the door. We were all overwhelmed by the variety of choices from such a small space. The pastries are out of this world! The Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine (Flaky pastry with chocolate barres.) is without a doubt my favorite pastry that they offer. They also offer danishes, croissants, individual little pastries, cakes, tarts and so much more. Everything I tried was delicious. They also offer coffee that goes perfect with the pastries they offer. The space is small with only a few tables to sit at so I would suggest getting your stuff to go. Their sandwiches are also delicious. The fresh French baguette really makes the sandwich. The Le Parisien (French baguette with butter, ham, and Swiss cheese) was my favorite.The people seem happy working there, are patient while waiting for you to make your choices and greet you with a smile. If you are ever in the area, THIS PLACE IS A MUST STOP!Love love love this small place. My boyfriend's parents live down the street and whenever we're over this area to visit, I always asked to make a stop here FIRST :) everything here is so pretty to look at it and most importantly, so so yummy! I can never remember the names of what I got because I always choose what I want on how it looks.. so the name is just a blur to me, especially with sweet pastries (ugh, so bad I know) Parking on butler can be a pain sometimes because of how busy this road can get but I never seem to have a problem with it. So it might just depends on the time you come in. Other than that I'm definitely coming back to try some of their sandwiches because I've heard great things on it tooListen: I'm just going to cut to the chase. If heaven had a bakery, I'm pretty confident it would be La Gourmandine.I've been dying to come here for ages now, and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. When I walked in, I was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly. It felt just the way a bakery should feel: quaint, homey, and it smelled wonderful.I was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, "Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!" I pretty much so wanted to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot, but instead replied, "Yeah, I'll take one of those, too."I left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because I obviously couldn't decide on just two. I apologize to my already non-existent waistline. I was trying to get things for my better half and I to enjoy together this weekend, but he's still at work and I can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.As I was checking out, my new BFF said, "Oh, you should come back here earlier in the day, we have twice the selection!" I'm literally glad I didn't come earlier in the day, or I probably would have left with 10 pastries. But tomorrow morning? Well, maybe I'll go back tomorrow morning.La Gourmandine has been on my Pittsburgh bucket list for a long time.  I came in with the fabulous Sophia H., and we got to ordering.  I picked up a Chocolat Fondat and the Opera Cake (Hellooooo.  Opera singer, Opera cake.  Duh.).  The pastries totaled $7.05, which was steep for the size.The Chocolat Fondat was described as a lava cake.  The chocolate flavor was very rich.  It was a fairly dark chocolate, which appealed to me.  The opera cake was this tiny slice of joy.  Dark chocolate and espresso and cake layers.  A flawless combination.  However, it was truly tiny, and was about 4 small bites total.The only side note is that my pastries became dry very quickly.  24 hours later they were already starting to go stale, which was a bit quick for freshly baked.  Baked goods from Prantl's last me for days with no issues.  This actually might stop me from returning because I do not eats sweets crazy quickly.  These baked goods will not stay good for more than 24 hours.If you have extra cash to drop, La Gourmandine has very high quality baked goods.  The credit card machine was down when I visited, but they normally take cards.While checking out the area for an upcoming event I stumbled upon the first location of La Gourmandine. I had no trouble parking and was pleasantly surprised to find it open on a Sunday morning.I went in and like its sister shop over in Mt Lebanon, the layout is virtually the same. They are noted for their flaky almond pastries which I have had before. That alone is my number one recommendation! However, since I have had it twice I decided to try something different. So I asked the lady about some of the new items they had. One was called Clafoutis which is made out of bread pudding and stuffed with cherries. The other was lime Bavarian cream with raspberry. I ordered both since they told me I could store the Clafoutis in my refrigerator for one day.They served my lime Bavarian cream on an actual plate with a fork. They also have a few tables where you can sit and eat. Again, they offer sandwiches as well as coffee or tea. You can also order cakes or pastries in advance. The staff was very helpful and explained everything to me.That new lime Bavarian cream was delicious and not overly filling which was perfect for me!  I plan on eating the Clafoutis later but I'm sure since they recommended it to me, I know I won't be disappointed. When I had finished eating my dessert I placed it to the left of the cash register which I was told was fine so they could take it away.This place is easy to miss while you are driving down Butler St but again the place fills up very quickly since it is a popular place for sandwiches and French pastries.I did ask if they were planning to add any other locations at the moment and was told they aren't. Either way if you visit this location or the one in Mt. Lebanon you will get exceptional service and some of the best Parisian desserts you can imagine.

Review Text :
12/22/10Nice space, but a bit too "cool."  That is, I don't find the atmosphere here beckoning me to stay awhile.  More of the "order something, or get out."  I don't mean to say this attitude is coming from the people there.  No- it's the vibe that I get from the furniture, from the brightness of the room, and from the music played at too loud a volume level.  I really like coffee shops that play music at a softer volume so that I may hear conversations I'm having w/ friends, or be able to read w/out having to work to tune out the noise.  (I tried using my iPod here once, but I couldn't stand the high volume level necessary to block out the shop's own music!)Read much about how great the food here, but since everything seems pre-packaged and processed (meats, cheese, sauces), and I couldn't get the rep to tell me which local bakery supplied the breads, I can only order the black tea (the green tea is tropical-flavored, meaning it's off-limits to me).  I did try the iced mocha latte, minus the "white chocolate powder mix" it is normally made w/, but the beverage tasted like it was missing something to round out the flavor and texture.  Yes, I know that's where the white chocolate mix comes in, but I can't have it, so I wonder what ingredient Brosenbrus could add next time to give the drink more creaminess, more oomph?  The shop also offers soy milk, but I'm trying to stay away from the preservatives that are also present in the liquid...Free wi-fi-- I like to come here when I have extra time before my massage at nearby SWIHA.If you're a college student and looking for a good spot to study, this is it. First of all, it's located on the bottom floor of college housing. Secondly, it's located right by camps. Thirdly, they have great Cartel coffee and what appeared to be tasty food (even though I didn't get a chance to try any of it). This isn't a spot I would probably seek out as a working professional to come and work out of but that's mostly because working here reminds me that my fun days of college living are long over and it's obvious that the students around me don't realize that one day it will also be over for them! The staff here is chill and friendly. The seating isn't super comfortable, but the tables have room to layout your work and the chairs are deep enough that you can slouch a little bit (shh, don't tell my Mom that sometimes I slouch!)It's not too crazy here and I was able to get my work done and have a comfortable conversation with my meetings. So college students or Tempe residents, this is a spot to think about!

Review Text :
To mix cultures, a Mexican Haiku:Carnitas tacos.Tableside guacamole.¬°Vida Cantina!We stopped into Vida during their grand opening weekend, deciding that 5pm would be a reasonable time to try and catch a table without a reservation.  We were almost turned away.  The patio was packed.  The inside was empty, but about to fill up.  Consider yourself warned.If you go, you absolutely must try the tableside guacamole.  It is made to order  from three avocados (six halves), cilantro, onions, tomatoes (and who knows what else) in a giant stone mortar and pestle, which stays on the table.  You unfortunately do not get to keep it.  That would be amazing.This thing is as large as my head and I have a big head.  If you're there with one other person, you should try this before ordering dinner.  It might fill you up all by itself (and it doesn't really keep for the next day).  If you have a large group, it will probably do as your only appetizer.  Even after eating two bowls of chips with this guacamole  - and salsa, which they mix with what seems to be adobo at the table to suit your heat preference - we still had a massive amount left to take home.For our meal, we had tortilla soup, corn with queso fresco (corn and cheese?  Awesome.) and carnitas tacos.  These might be the best tacos I've had in Charlotte.  The pork was so tender that after my first bite, I wasn't sure if I had any meat in my mouth.  It was that good.  The second bite gave me a bit of the skin, which was crispy and juicy at the same time.  But to eat meat that just melted in the mouth?  Nice.  I actually couldn't finish them because of the guacamole (unlike the guac, the tacos were good the next day).The only bad side?  I wasn't terribly impressed with the sides.  The rice was average, the corn was decent, but how bad can it be - put cheese on something after you grill it and it's going to be good.  But still it seems like Vida is off to an excellent start.  Service moved along nicely - I heard they had some bumps earlier in the week, but it seems they have them ironed out now.  Why are you still reading?  Go get some of that guacamole.Darn it, not for me. Since the weather is starting to get warmer, an afternoon on a patio was what I needed. Remembering that Vida has a lovely patio, especially for people watching, my husband and I went there for lunch. Knowing we wanted to spend a leisurely time, I thought we'd snack on their delicious guacamole to start. I remembered from my first visit that if you sign up online for their membership program, you get the guac for free. Signed up then and there, showed my server, server asked the manager, manager said, "No." I guess when their sign says that you can experience the benefits "immediately" that means something different. Something about a number...I got a confirmation email, but no number. After my initial visit, one of their PR staff called me to figure out what went wrong, we played phone tag, but they never followed through. As you can see, this restaurant is not a good stop for me...bummer.I will say, the server we had this time around was very attentive and friendly and the hostesses were very nice too. However, the food was still mediocre. I don't know if even the patio or getting a number for the free guac can bring me back...

I braved the reviews and decided to try this place out anyway. Sorry to anyone that has Ill feelings but unfortunately we do not know the truth and can only comment on the current, as we see it. It took me two u-turns to actually find the place but that is because I did not look at the address before I left. It is located on the North East side behind the Oil changing place. The building was bigger then I had expected and I liked the colors of the exterior. I walked in stuck me head in the bar and the waiting room and no one was there to greet me. It took about 2 full min which feels like forever for some reason. The owner (I assume) seated me in the bar while I waited for Ryan C. The interior was clean and inviting. I liked the bar setup. The bar tender/waitress helped me with a cold drink while I waited. I usually wait for Ryan for just about everything. LOL I looked over the menu and the the lunch specials are killer. $4 for a 1/4lb pork sandwich with a side. WOW We both had pork sandwiches one with fries and one with salad. The meat was good, we each had one hunk o fat but the texture and flavor (before sauce) was good. The meat was a little too greasy and soaked the bottom bun while dripping out as well. The spicy sauce was good but not too spicy. The blue cheese was lacking. All in all I had a great lunch. I would go back and use my REST.com coupon for dinner.There are times when people have referred to another person's review and said, "So-and-So said it all, I really have nothing to add." Well, in this case, it is literally literal. Daren C said pretty much what I would have said, as far as an objective description of the place and what went down. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hammered-hog-bbq-hall-and-saloon-phoenix#hrid:tVZ6FRcn8Osi0QsJT4beNQ However, I have to part from my wise brother in my rating. Although I believe we felt the same about the fact that the meat had a really good, smokey flavor, it was too greasy for me to enjoy that flavor. The bottom of the bun sponged up so much that it was soaked, and a light squeeze produced a stream and puddle. Eww. The meat and sauce had good flavor, so there's potential, but the grease just overpowered it so much, and I fear the repercussions that may be to come.Perhaps if I were "hammered" I would have enjoyed this meal better... I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot. I ordered take-out on a Sunday, and when I arrived I felt something was off right away. The place was dead... Not one person in the gigantic dining room, only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored. The bar however was pretty lively, maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food. Ribs - all char and fat, barely any meat and extremely overcookedPulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of greaseThe sides, corn (half a cob is considered a side for two??) Cheese grits, worst I have ever tried, dry and flavorlessCornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry spongeBBQ Sauce - disappointing at best, watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides).Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on topI really don't like writing scathing reviews, but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal. There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix, this is not one.

A rotisserie chicken place with a nice dose of homey ethnic flair - what's not to love?I kept it simple and split a whole chicken ($9.99) with a coworker. Drinks were $2. Food came out quickly and I dig the decor - eclectic and fun. Very Peruvian seeming, but what do I know ?Chicken was fabulous! Moist and very flavorful. I'm am a hearty eater and 1/2 a chicken with no sides was perfect for me. I can imagine if you're adding sides, desserts (the caramel crepes looked ridiculously good!), etc, you're probably fine with a 1/4 chicken. When they brought out chimichurri sauce and salsa for the chicken my heart sang for joy- delicious! Yup, I'll be back!

Review Text :
Was on the way home and remembered to finally stop by this joint and take it off my "To Do List".....thank God I did!  It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!I was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.I browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!I couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.I saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.After a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!The Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.The Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.The owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said "See you soon Peter!"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.Will I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories.I've eaten at the other location in Henderson and really liked it. They also have good deep dish pizza at the other location however the the only pizza you will find at this one is a puff since the menu mostly consists of dogs, sausages, Italian beef and wings. I had a #12 which is a 2 grilled sausages with onions and peppers on bread. The onions and peppers were perfect but the sausage was too dry. Remember I had not just 1 but 2 of these dry sausage to work through. Even with adding mustard it just didn't help. Then my wife and I shared a basket of chili cheese fries however we didn't eat but a small dent in them. After tasting the chili I remembered that I didn't like it at the other location either. Honestly I don't care that it doesn't have beans but what I care more about is that it tastes like a stinky armpit smells. I love chili just not here. My wife ordered a pizza puff that I ended up eating a few bites of and it surprised me how much I liked it. I have had more authentic ones at other places and this one is more like a over-sized totinos pizza roll yet it was damn good. I can't say enough about how nice the staff was. They took the time to show us menus we could read at a table since the menu board here is curved and at a weird angle so you need a neck massage after looking at it too long. Staff checked on us a couple times to make sure we were good and to see if we needed anything so that was a plus. The inside is small with some tables and a bar with stools and they have a couple tables outside.I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.I love me a good Chicago Dog and this place is pretty solid.  Vienna Beef everything, dogs, neon green relish, steamed poppy seed buns.  They have all the right ingredients that's for sure.  I prefer the jumbo vienna beef hot dogs.  They are skinless and a little fatter.  I've always thought the regular Vienna Beef dog, gets a little lost in all the toppings, and that was the case here.  However I swear as I was walking out, I heard them telling a customer about the Jumbo dog.  But I never saw it on the menu - darn it!.The skin on the regular dog gives it a little snap when you eat it, which doesn't really do much for me either way, but most Chicago Dog aficionados swear by the snap.  While this was a good Chicago dog, it could have used a little more celery salt and the tomatoes could have been a little better.  I did like how their pickle spear was sliced thin enough to actually be eaten along with the dog.  Most places you have to take the pickle off and eat it separately.  3.5 stars for the Chicago dog. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#Z6UGYg-LExpNUYs7Qt2jRAThe star of the show was the Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich.  They serve it dry, wet, or dipped.  We decided to go wet and it had just the right amount of sogginess to it.  I had them add mozzarella cheese and got the giardinera pepper mix on the side.  They have two levels of spice on the giardinera mix - medium and hot.  We went medium and it had just the right amount of vinegary spice to it.  The Beef itself had a nice peppery flavor to it, and it just melted in your mouth as it's been simmering in it's own au jus.  4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#dMWDeRLDPiRWLo09g5oQAgI don't really get the pizza puff.  After reading the yelp reviews, I thought some yelpers were on to something here, so I had to give it a try.  I found it very uninspired.  Like a hot pocket.  It had small pieces of ground sausage, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese, in a pastry.  Nothing that you can't get a frozen version of at a grocery store.  2 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#BmSWVAd7apKHf44lPrHtLwThe fries were just ok for me.  Fried to order and served in it's own little brown bag, they were plenty hot and you could add some salt and shake the bag.  They were pretty thin cut and on the crispy side.  I'm more of a thick steak fry or crinkly fry kind of guy.  I like to taste the potato on the inside of the fry.  So I knew right away that I wasn't really going to be into Windy City's fries.  3 stars.Service was very friendly and they made us feel at home.  You can tell they really know their local customers and they have a well deserved loyal following.  They also take pride in their restaurant and it was very clean and nicely decorated.  I also like how they randomly write a man and woman's name on a board every day.  If it happens to be your name, then you get a free hot dog.  How fun!  On this day Chester and Diane were the lucky names.  5 stars.

One of my favorite bars in Vegas. Such an awesome concept with the old school classic board games such as rockem sockem robots, and jenga! Oh yea and the Wii upstairs, so fun!. Love the black and white decor and the upstairs overlooks the bar. Very cool. The prices aren't bad and they serve Illy coffee, my favorite!Its usually pretty busy on weekends so i would suggest showing up early to grab a table or the upstairs part for the fun games.Def a fun bar to check out when your in the Green Valley area. Ive never tried the food but it always looks delish.

The food here is great and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the 1/2 white meat chicken dinner. The chicken consisted of two sizeable breast cuts of chicken, well-seasoned and bathed in just the right amount of sauce, and two wings, which were smaller but nonetheless delicious. I dock it stars for what I consider horrible service. After ordering I sat around the restaurant, waiting for my chicken to be prepared. While I waited, a large gentleman with a case of bootleg DVDs waited in the front of the store for the entire time while I was there. I never saw him order and he never received any food. I have no idea what he was doing there.After about five minutes of waiting I asked for a glass of water, The attendant behind the counter got me a class, but acted as if I had offended him by asking. Later when he removed an order from the back I asked him if it was my order and he said "No fool. This is mine." I am not making this up.A few moments later he walked out from the back with his order and tells me that I am spilling my water. I looked below me and did not see any spilled water. I checked by the fountain to see if I had spilled there. I hadn't. I checked the shelf behind me and found that indeed there was no spilled water. I don't know what the attendant was talking about, though I did get the strong impression that he was trying to intimidate me.Finally, the wait for the chicken should have been 10 minutes. Mine was 20, and it wasn't really that busy. I was in a hurry and this made me late.So yeah, there's some real solid food here, but I hope you don't have to wait around for it while the staff tries to intimidate you.i had a high expectation for this place, but yet i was let down. i placed an order over the phone, ordered the 6 piece chicken. ended up being around $10. and once you'll sit down and open up that box, you'll be in a world of shock! they got wings so small that you're mother wouldn't believe her eyes! the cashier (she's the owner, i'm predicting.) i couldn't believe she hid her baby under the register! my lady and I was trying to enjoy our chicken, then all the sudden. we heard a baby crying! upon observation, it was coming from under the register...yes, believe it. a chicken shack turned into daycare service. and the funny part, as we're eating. the chef walks out and calls me a fool( i'm sure he calls everyone a fool, whoever he sees) like get with the program, if you're representing an establishment you gotta be professional! and not insult a customer. the verdict, sad to say. i've experience better chicken, popeyes is still the best.Harold's is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get...A week earlier, Harold's flakey operating hours foiled a lunch date between Miss Joyce and I.  The sign on the door indicates Harold's opens at 11 AM, but at 11:40AM, the door was locked and the lights were off.  Just Harold's being Harold's, according to Miss Joyce.Fast forward five days:  I'm making a Woodman's grocery run and see the lights on and customers filing through Harold's door.  Throwing caution to the wind, I dashed through the front door and thus began my maiden Harold's experience.The employee working the front counter greeted me and handed me a menu.  It didn't take much time for me to decide on the  1/2 chicken dinner special (2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 slices of white bread, cole slaw and fries for $6.99) with the hot sauce on the side.  Because everything is made to order, I was told my food would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes.  No problem, I sauntered over to Woodman's and grabbed the handful of items on my shopping list. I returned 20 minutes later, grabbed a seat and after my lunch was delivered to my booth.SWEETBABYJESUS!When I looked down upon my newfound bounty, I realized I just entered fried chicken heaven.The sides of the flimsy cardboard serving tray were bulging from the sheer mass of my order. No anorexic birds served at this chicken shack.   My first attempt to tackle one of the drumsticks results in burned digits - confirming that this chicken was fresh from the fryer.  No heat lamps...check.  Pro tip: the white bread served with the dinner order has amazing insulating properties - use it to protect yourself when making a move on the first piece of chicken.The exterior boasted a crispy exterior shell that gave way with a loud crunch on every bite.  I learned that Harold's still uses  1/2 beef tallow /  1/2 vegetable oil in its fryers.  The seasoning was spot on as well.The interior was the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  My server left a dozen napkins on the table for good reason - I had juice running down my hands and dripping down my chin.  Pro tip 2: Do not go to Harold's on a first date or before a job interview.I absolutely loved the tangy cole slaw.  It had the right balance of sweet and sour elements and had a wonderful crunch.  The only negative is the thimble-esque serving size.  More cole slaw please!The fries were the weakest link of the meal - a little soggy but well seasoned.Unlike the colorful encounters experienced by my fellow Yelpers, my visit was uneventful.  Nobody called me fool and the bootleg DVD guy was nowhere to be found.  The server came by and cleared my table.  On the way out, she politely reminded me that I could order ahead next time if I didn't want to wait the 20 minutes.  However, I was only paying partial attention.  In my mind, I was already planning my return trip next Monday when the  1/2 chicken (dark meat) dinner is only $4.99.I had heard good things about Harold's Chicken, and I was itching for some righteous fried chicken on this particular day. I stopped in around 2:00pm, lunch time for many people. There were three guys sitting in back, perhaps eating lunch themselves. One man approached me and asked if he could help me, and I attempted to order some food.He said to me, "I can't do it, I have a meeting. I'm trying to open another restaurant." Wow, what a joke. Why oh why would you open another restaurant if you can't serve food at lunch time, with three guys sitting around? Isn't selling food the general idea of a restaurant? Furthermore, why is your open sign lit and your door open if you're about to leave and not serve anyone?I would review the food as well, but seeing as how I didn't receive any, this review will do until I'm proven otherwise. Maybe I'll try Harold's again, if I'm in the mood for wasting some more time out of my day.

I went there last night about 7:30 with a friend and the restaurant was almost empty. It was like that sometimes when it was Pie Town too. The pool table right when you walk in the door seems out if place. I would rather see more cool lounge type chairs to socialize with friends. The bar area has a nice feel to it. Our server was above average and very attentive - probably because we were his only table :)The new menu has many great choices for food and still some of their unique pizzas from Pie Town. We ordered the calamari and it was cooked to perfection - not overdone and chewy like most places around Charlotte. We split the chicken marsala and the bacon & egg pizza. Both were outstanding. Note:  I am giving 4 stars for the food and atmosphere, but I would like to give it 3 stars because the red wine selection was very very small, there were only a couple choices of red available. They said they were getting ready for restaurant week. So I am hoping if the owners read this, they will add more red wines like a cabernet and chianti.  We ended up drinking beer. I will go back and if the wine list is better, I will keep the review at 4 stars, otherwise, I will drop it to 3 for good.

I take my sweet mom to lunch at least twice a month, so she can get out of the house once in a while. She likes Vietnamese cuisine, so I searched on Yelp to find something close to downtown.  I stumbled upon Dolores G's review and she seemed to like it, so I brought my mom here.My Mom ordered the house stir fry which is a noodle with beef, pork, shrimp, chicken and veggies stir fry. ($8.75) and I ordered the Sauteed Tofu with Tomatoes and Onions and Thai Tea. ($7.50). Given our hunger levels, we also ordered a couple of fresh Spring Rolls and shared a pot of hot tea.Mom really enjoyed her savory dish, Mine on the other hand was just fine. I guess I was expecting it to be more flavorful, but it's just Tofu with sauteed tomatoes and onions which I can easily make at home. I thought it was a little  under flavored in my opinion-- nothing that a shot of Sriracha and a few dabs of chili pepper sauce couldn't cure though. Portions are not too big just a scoop of rice and the entree', so if you have a big appetite better go to a buffet instead.But to be fair, I am giving them 4 stars for providing a clean establishment, good service and reasonably priced dishes.

Another stop on my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition Tour, I decided to check out Broadway Pizza.  Since I was dining by myself, I opted to order 2 Slices.  Cheese Slices are $1.95 each with $.40 ea for additional toppings.  I ordered 2 Sausage & Pepperoni slices.After a short wait, the Pizza came out.  The slices were huge....a little bigger than what I normally see around town.  The Pizza is NY Style thin crust.  After a few bites I was underwhelmed.  The Pizza was just OK.  I didn't really care for the Sausage and the Pepperoni didn't have much flavor.Overall, the Pizza didn't leave me wanting more.  They serve other items like Wings and Calzones....maybe I'll come back to try one of those.Return Factor - 40%

Review Text :
I am hesitant to even review JoBot Coffee.It's one of those situations where I'm caught in a catch 22: i want their business to flourish, but i want it to remain sparse and not overpopulated with d-bags.however they need the publicity and support so i will go ahead and sing my praises. JoBot for me, reprsents Israel. Now hear me out on this one Goyim:  If Phoenix is a metaphor for the world, and people like me, i.e. stylish intelligent cultured 20 something yr olds supposed hipsters persecuted as such a metaphor for the diaspora of jewish peoples than JoBot coffee would be our zion. You look about and as far as the gates of their partially sheltered courtyard extend you will see nothing but my peoples, heads bowed in solemn respect that denote caffeine addiction and apple computer usage, the cool kids vonnegut readers, cigarette tokers, friends of vegan and pescatarian alike. This place is my canaan in a fiesty world of jack boot goose stepping fascists in lifted trucks and tribal tattoo arm bands who'd just as soon shout a slur at me on my bike or rocket off a monster energy drink at the back of my head. JoBot is my shelter from the storm. and i sincerely hope it remains that way.JoBot is the real deal. Outstanding coffee, crepes and the service is first rate. I went to JoBot on a Thursday night, meeting someone special there. Walking in, there is a long corridor, with a coffee bar and stools lining the length of the bar.I ordered an iced vanilla latte, and my partner in crime had water and a banana nutella crepe. Our drinks and crepe arrived, and the reviews saying how great everything is, are really accurate. As it slowed down a bit, the amazing employee, Shane, asked us how we were doing, and we told him how great everything was. This spawned a great conversation where we learned a ton about JoBot, and coffee in general. Shane was so cool, and he taught us about the most popular items at JoBot, specifically a toddy. We had never had one, and Shane was nice enough to make a small sample drink for us, and it was unreal. SOOOOOOOO tasty and nice, but not as great as the service and conversation with Shane.Another super cool thing about JoBot, is that they have late hours EVERY day, so when you need a drink, snack, or tasty crepe, you have a spot to get your fix. Being at JoBot, you can easily have the feeling that you are on vacation somewhere really cool, and this is one of those places that you only wish you had back in your hometown. It sounds weird, but being at JoBot feels like a vacation, it's just relaxing, you're not rushed, and it's very laid back. The great news is, we have JoBot in our backyard, and I can take a mini-vacation anytime, and go there and relax. I am really grateful that we have locally owned gems like this in the 602. I really cannot imagine a situation where I would pick a chain over JoBot, Lola, or Giant Coffee. It's really nice to have a great drink, while supporting local Mom & Pops. That is what I call a win-win. Check out JoBot, you will not be disappointed.Wow, worse service ever!  My girlfriend and I went there on Sunday morning. We traditionally frequent different coffee shops during the weekend and looked forward to their good coffee and crepes. I love the screen door and intimate feel of the place, so relaxing.So we arrived and sat down, only to wait for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) before we decided to leave. The barista didn't even acknowledge us until half way through that time. It would be different if it was screaming busy  but there was only two other couples sitting down ahead of us. I spend alot of time in coffee shops, this place may have good coffee but compared to service at Lux and Lola's; I'll take my business elsewhere in the future.I came here this morning with the BF to use a living social deal I had bought recently. I was really excited to try this place, as it was crazy busy the last time I was there (on first friday), so I passed on it. This place is really cool, it has a nice atmosphere and feels homey and friendly. The whole street is like a little community, so it has a good feel, and I like to support that kind of business. I ordered an iced latte and the 'cannoli' crepe (ricotta, choco chips, almonds) and the BF got a hot latte and the PB, raspberry jam, and banana crepe. They were a bit chewy, but good flavor. The coffee was very good, it is made by cartel coffee, which I always like. I would definitely come back here to try different flavors and to drink yummy coffee.Holy Crepes! Iced Mocha - More like iced "crack" mocha...I'm bouncing off the walls. Si Si me gusta~Banana-Nutella Crepe - Sweet Virgin Mary silhouette on my morning toast, It was heavenly!...AND a punch card?! I'll be a doughy mess in no time. Thanks yo!Man, I REALLY love the food and the coffee here, but I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a business in my life, ... seriously. So... Let me tell you how my JoBot experience went down today. This is how it went down. I ordered a couple of crepes and a coffee from the incredibly friendly gentleman with the long hair. Then I went over to the register where the bald dude (the owner) was standing. I stood there for several minutes, holding my bank card in the air, while he ignored me and continued talking to some guy next to me about cameras. After a good, long while the owner finally looked at me and said, "Why do you keep looking at me?!", in just about the shittiest tone possible without necessitating a fist fight. I was pretty taken aback. I just said, "Uh... I'd like to pay for the things I just bought." The guy next to me who witnessed this unprecedented level of snobbery said, "Wow, dude. You were so nice about it too. I'm impressed. It takes a real man to be polite after that one." Then the owner continued to process my order (17 dollars), without saying a word of any sort, let alone a thank you. I'm a very mellow guy, but after that I was so pissed I thought about walking out. I'm still angry.I make it a point to be as reasonable and polite as humanly possible with anyone in the service industry. It's part of my moral code to use only my most impeccable manners when dealing with service people as I know they put up with a lot of shit in their line of work. I just can't fathom asking any customer "Why do you keep looking at me?!", under any reasonable circumstances. I mean, WTF? I was just standing there, card in hand, waiting to give him my money. I'm going to have to do one of three things. Option A - I never go to JoBot again. Option B - I convince myself that the owner has "some sort of mental problem" and that he doesn't understand that he's being an asshole to the customers. Option C - Keep going to JoBot like nothing happened and just expect to be loudly and openly disrespected by a cackling dimwit when I go to pay for my food.If you find yourself wandering the streets of down town phoenix late one evening, no, you're probably not homeless you were likely just hopping from bar to bar and can't remember. Don't fret because JoBot's lights are still on late into the night. While I can't say exactly just how late "late" is because I haven't payed too close attention to that minor detail and no one has posted it here on yelp yet. I can say they've been open every time I have visited after 11pm.Mental note to self, next time at JoBot find out about hours and update yelp. Is it considered a mental note if I just wrote it down? I'm also not so sure it was to self either as I plan to post this review sometime soon. Anyway.Give any of their crepes a try, they're all fairly good; although, I do prefer the savory crepes over the sweet crepes here. I truly can't believe I just said that actually, since most of my other reviews are for frozen yogurt and cupcakes, at least that's what I tried to order and was told "We don't actually serve frozen yogurt here sir. Would you like to try our crepes?"Loved the chorizo and egg crepe - twas the perfect combination of everything they combined together to make the crepe. I'm pretty sure it was part chorizo, part egg, part cheese and part crepe. But then again it was a late night and I did just swing by after visiting Lost Leaf next door.I hear they serve excellent coffee too, but I tend to stick to tea and pastries. Happy wandering my yelping friends! Hope to stumble into you sometime while chowing down on one of their tasty crepes.Positives: open late, free wi-fi, free entomology lessons (if that's your thing...read on)Negatives: everything elseOK WOW!  I have been meaning to write my first review for a while now, but I was basically forced to do it right now by my experience at Jobot.  Too bad my first review has to be a negative one, but I feel I owe it to all of you who so faithfully warn me to stay away from places like this, although you may have let me down on this one!So I read through most of the reviews and felt that I had a fairy good idea of what to expect.  Since many reviews seemed positive enough, I thought I'd give it a try since I am getting bored with the same old coffee joint.  So I found my way from the dark street in front of Jobot, through the dimly lit patio area, up onto the old wooden porch, to the front door, and into Jobot ready to fall in love with the place.  As I entered I was initially overwhelmed by three things.  One: the blaring punk music, two: the swamp cooler blasting air and noise directly at my head, and three: the total apathy of the staff who were conversing among themselves (ironically, about how "dead" it's been) while ignoring me.  I was eventually approached by a worker and I placed my order ($2.75 for an 8oz skim latte...more about the latte later).  While waiting for my latte, I decided to have a look at the pastry selection at the end of the coffee bar; only problem was, there were 3 employees standing there talking and blocking access to the pastry case.  I politely said "excuse me" as I tried to squeeze by them.  I kid you not...they glanced at me and then continued talking.  I squeezed thru the gaggle of employees determined to get a look at the pastries.  Once through the gauntlet of employees, I had a look at the pastries, which looked a little "run thru the mill" if you know what I mean.OK so determined to make the best of this experience, I pressed on.  While continuing to wait for my latte I poked my head into the two adjacent rooms.  The rooms are dingy and uninviting with hard, uncomfortable wooden benches and cheap metal frame stacking style chairs scattered about.  The crowd inside (two customers) was interesting.  One guy covered head to toe in tattoos hunched over an old laptop, and an older man snoozing in the corner near his empty coffee cup and book.  ...so back to waiting for my latte.  I intended to pay for it when I was intercepted by a 2 inch long cockroach crossing the floor between me and my latte.  I politely waited for it to pass.  While waiting for the roach to pass, I glanced at the guy who seemed to be in charge of the place to see how he would handle this most interesting situation.  He looked at me, shrugged his shoulders as if to say "whatcha gonna do"?  I almost laughed at the absurdity of it all, but quickly remembered I was on the hook to pony up the currency for my latte, which I did, albeit reluctantly at this point. I have taken my seat, opened my laptop, and am writing this review as we speak.  A few more shady characters have popped in and out, although they don't seem to be customers since they didn't buy any food or drink.  I assume they are friends with the owner(s).  My stomach has turned sour from the experience with the roach and having to recount the ordeal in detail as I write this review... so my latte will sit untouched as I leave in about 1 minute from now.  I hope you have enjoyed my contribution.  Thanks for sharing all of yours!Leaving Matt's low on caffeine and realizing Jiffy-Lube and Chase were not yet open to accomplish my afternoon errands I decided to next pay a visit to Jobot Coffee - a place I'd heard both good (music, coffee) and less-than-stellar (patrons, service) things about and pointing my GPS to the address I at first wondered if I'd mistyped; to say the least the area is residential and unassuming, but upon seeing the "Coffee" sign I assumed I was in the right place, parked, and walked in as Sigur Ros Takk played on the outdoor speakers.Half knowing what to expect from a house-come-coffee shop named the "best place to take a scenester" by the local media I entered the doors of JoBot to the aromatics of coffee and a bar populated by the partially hung-over and half-shaven but surprisingly also to smiling faces and families sitting with their Ipads as the kitchen turned out respectable looking sweet and savory crepes.  Not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee I was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if I wanted a menu or if I knew what I'd like I deferred for a moment while I perused the options - eventually settling on an iced Toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.With the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms I found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the Toddy - a rich blend from Cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 Strawberry "DohNut" and a $4.00 slice of Dr. Pepper Cake.  Beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze I have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  Moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since I ordered something as simple as "chocolate cake" and while there is no doubt I could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting.JoBot is the spot to go for a nice cold Chai or Iced Chamomile Tea at any time, literally their open twenty-four-seven. This place is soo uniquely cool. I like it!!Oh and they even have a cool little piano inside!! Mad nice!! It's weird how I get a look like, " What's this girl doing here?!" almost every time I come here. It's more FUNNY, than upsetting!! :) No worries, I guess I'm not their usual clientele. Oh well, they'll get use to it eventually! It might be the bright colors I sometimes frequently wear, who knows?!.Late Night Problems... there are those nights at 2 am when every thing with edible food is closed.  You pull out your mobile Yelp app.  You search for restaurants that are open now.... and just some times, you find a rare 5-Star gem and wonder,  "How could I have not found this place before today."  JoBot Coffee is one of those places.Everything about JoBot screams hipster.  It is in an ecclectic part of down town Phoenix, they serve as much local food as possible,  it sits next door to a house-pub, it is in a house itself and  the inside is retro-shic.  AND It is open 24 hours on the weekends.  I fell so deep in love with this place that I wanted to bring my cot and blanket and move in.  The selection of crepes and specials is phenomenal.   You walk up to the counter and order something good.  This IS a coffee shop, so expect brekfast-like options with tasty salads and other things.  Sit at the counter or a table inside or stroll to a table outside on the front lawn.... enjoy food.  Repeat.  Repeat.I can't wait for my return to this restaurant.  I am sure there are more exciting things about this place that I have yet to discover.We went for crepes and we had crepes and we were pleased.That would be an understatement, we were in heaven. The crepes were to die for! They had flavor that oozed more flavor. Each and every bite was a gastronomic masterpiece of flavor. Did I already mention the flavor?The coffee that accompanied the crepes was also wonderful. Not quite exquisite, just wonderful.When we arrived the music being played was David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust album and the DJ outside was blasting out some awesome Santana tunes.And the sun was shining and life was good.This place is an all around A #1, five star coffee shop with a cool vibe. This is definitely on my return as soon as possible list. Bring your bike, your electronic communication device (or a good book) and enjoy this wonderful oasis of cool eats in Phoenix.

Certainly the best Greek food I've had outside Greece. Fresh ingredients, freshly prepared and about as unpretentious as it gets. Had good chats with the owner though he was a little grumpy at first!

$5 beer and a burger. Annnnd scene. Seriously, that's a hell of a deal. Sure, you're going into a crappy, smokey, hole in the wall cafe where people are coming to die, but still...$5 beer and a burger. The burger wasn't bad either! Wasn't great, but was totally edible. The beer? Tanaya Creek. Again, not too shabby for my $5. Would I come here for a casual meal? Nope. Would I enjoy this special again while having a few drinks on Fremont East? You bet your arse I will.What does five bucks get you these days? The answer is: not very much. Perhaps a box of Girl Scout cookies or maybe a crappy watered-down well drink at your grandpa's favorite dive...Well, I have some great news, my friends. Rather than throwing your last Lincoln on black and hoping for the best, save that last fiver and have that dead president treat you to a burger and a beer at Cafe Cortez. I cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle, in my eye. This is no lie, folks.Is it a great burger? We don't ask that question here. Instead we ask something like, is it a bad burger, or is it edible? Yes! Cooked well, served will all the standard fixin's and delivered with a side of sass and guilt from an "overworked" waitress. So the beer must be awful right? Nuh-uh! You'll be sippin' in style when you wash that beef bomb down with an ice cold Tanaya Creek - one of Vegas' finest craft brews.Good on ya, Cafe Cortez.We came here on a Friday night and ordered their specials1. Burger and Beer, 5- Extra cheese, 50c2. Prime rib, 9.95$19. - A bit of a wait time to be seated. Expected for a Friday night. - shallow whisper...strawsssss? huh? haha..uh, yes please. - Reminds me of Grand Cafe but worse. - Burger was good. Made medium not extra for grilled onions. Definitely get the cheese. Made it juicy.- Choice of Tenaya Creek or Bud Light. - Prime rib was chewy. Very similar to the taste of a Station Casino buffet. Decent enough to clean the plate after a few too many- Fries were thin. - Drunk? Come here for a cheap eat! Sober? Get inebriated then come back here to eat.

My first one-star review. I feel really bad, but this is necessary. Before I start off about everything negative with this place, maybe a couple redeeming factor should be said. The restaurant is new, so the decor is pretty nice. The lounge area at the front seems inviting. Hmm... That's it!We had a party of eight with us that night. We all did all-you-can-eat except for one pair of couple. Given we are regular at AYCE, we know our orders can be pretty hectic, so we wrote down our orders on a piece of paper with how many number of order each. This should have made the server's life easier and the orders to arrive quicker. Well, we were wrong. One thing I can say is that I am glad there is no time limit at this AYCE because our dinner was 2 and a half hour long. This was not intentional on our part. First, they give you all the rolls you ordered, which I am sure it is a strategy on their part to fill you up with rice. Then they bring out four orders of the nigiri and the server asks you if you have gotten everything you ordered. WAIT A MINUTE! You had a list, didn't you??? Anyway, we waited for our food longer than it took us to eat our food. It was terrible! Second, the rice was cold and hard. I felt like I was swallowing pebbles no matter how much I chew. The fish itself was very decent and fresh, but the rice was terrible. However, as fresh as the fish was, the rice is about 75% of the nigiri, so there wasn't much room to turn this into a more positive situation. Anyways, this place is one dollar cheaper than your usual AYCE. I'd avoid it if I can. Good luck!Groupon Alert. I was skeptical of this place after hearing the downgrade in reviews as of late. Finally, I dragged my butt over there and I am happy to report that it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Not a rave review, but pretty good. I was able to enjoy the AYCE sushi option with my Groupon, while my fella ordered the steak. The steak left quite a bit to be desired. Bad cut, dry potatoes, not super flavorful. I wouldn't recommend it! The sushi wasn't bad. Some of the rolls were a little over seasoned and drenched in sauces. I found this to be the case with their salads as well. Too many sauces, too many flavors. I would recommend sticking with the nigiri or appetizers if you're getting the AYCE. The specialty rolls left quite a bit to be desired in the flavor department and were too overstuffed with rice. I have to give special recognition to the miso soup. I'm not typically a big fan of it, but I found this one to be well-seasoned and yummy. I had read quite a bit about bad and slow service, but I didn't find that to be the case. Our server was quite attentive. She checked on us every few minutes for additional sushi orders and the food came out quickly as well. Which helped them earn an extra star in my book.The atmosphere is nice as well. There is plenty of seating for large parties, so I think it's great for large groups to get together and chat. We were in a secluded room, which I didn't mind at all, but when the servers had to walk in and out of the room constantly they would yell out "corner" to notify people they were coming so as not to collide. Practical, but annoying after a while. There are quite a few sushi places I prefer over Xtreme Sushi, but it's not bad for the price.i wish there was an option for less than zero stars.  THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  here is my experience:enter the restaurant and we were told that there was a wait, we said that was fine and we would just wait at the bar.  the three of us sit at the bar and watch the guy behind the bar talking and drinking with a customer, he NOT ONCE even acknowledged our existence.  This went on for about 10 minutes, even when another party of four more people sat at the bar.  finally a girl came behind the bar and i asked her if we could order from her, and we finally got our ridiculously overpriced sake (more than double what you would pay at most sushi places).  we then were seated and given soup while browsing the cheap paper menu's tri-folded on cheap paper (very classy considering the price for everything).   while looking at the menu the busboy came and took all three of our soups before any of us were near done.  the waitress was nice, but you could tell she was new and a little overwhelmed.  we ordered several rolls and an appetizer and after waiting for more than 30 minutes we asked to talk to a manager.  a woman came over and i told her about the experience from the time we walked into the door and she just stared at me like a deer caught in the headlights.  i told her to cancel our food order and she said she needed to ask the owner.  to my horror she indicated the owner was the douche bag behind the bar that didn't acknowledge any of the patrons that are paying his overhead cause he was too busy drinking and trying to pick up a girl.  UNBELIEVABLE!  i asked the manager to just send the owner over, but he refused to come to my table.  i refused at that time to pay.  on my way out i confronted the owner, he was demeaning and rude beyond words.  i told him that i couldn't believe he didn't help or even say a word to us when we sat at the bar and his response was "i'm not a bartender, i'm the owner".  the whole time i was talking he kept trying to talk past me to the man in our group, you could tell that this foreign excuse of a man considers himself not only above serving a drink or saying hello to a customer, but also being talked to by a woman.   i cannot wait for the day his business shuts down, and we have all bet money on the month that it does, it's just a matter of time.  until then, sorry i could give you no review of the food as it never came out.  i can tell you though the prices do not justify the service, and the owner is a complete disgusting greasy ass.   head up the street and go to i love sushi, it never disappoints.Beware...this has been downgraded to a "do not enter" rating. Irate wouldn't be the word I would use when describing the service here. My friends and I were treated as if we stole something...read on for details. Certified regulars of this Palace of Pain, we endured mild mistreatment simply because we became hooked on the food and it's close to the house. We came here on 11-26, my birthday!, for a nice meal before heading to the bar. We should have known from the clueless hostess who we asked twice for outdoor seating, then led us to an indoor booth. Finally when we said, "can we not sit outside for some reason?" a different hostess replied, "Oh, sure we can set that up." Hmm...Since we weren't starving and had some drinkin' to do at the next location we didn't all do the AYCE, just ordered random rolls. An hour later (60 full minutes) members of our party hadn't received the first rolls they ordered. Second and third orders arrived and we reminded the server we were still waiting on some of the first items ordered, which she said she'd check on. Twice. How does that work? If I took a number at a deli, say 23, and 42 got his food next....there's a problem. Simple math. The place was busy but nothing warrants that kind of service. After a third time of asking where the missing rolls were, while exhibiting some visible displeasure, the waitress did bring some "free" sake but no rolls (the price being our sanity). When they finally did arrive, basically when we had our coats on to leave, we sent them back, completely tired of waiting and being treated like sake drinking children.The final chapter? When a member of our party calmly spoke with the owner, who self importantly posts himself up at the sushi bar, apparently watching orders not be made, this man had the nerve to argue that we had only been waiting 30 minutes. 1. What owner argues with a customer? 2. Even THAT amount of time is ridiculous for one roll!!! It was completely baffling, especially since we go there so often and were pretty positive the owner recognized us. There will be an empty space in this shopping plaza if this pattern of service continues and my friends and I will be watching from afar. Very far.So... I haven't been tempted to come back to this place since my first visit, until this week. My coworkers were in the mood for sushi and I said yes to their invite before I knew where they were headed. We arrived at the restaurant around 12:15 and the place was pretty busy. We walked in the door and I was already turned off by the fish and vinegar smell that welcomed us. That definitely set a bad tone for our meal. We ordered our food and each of our dishes seemed to come out pretty slowly. Not great, when we have a time limit.One at a time, our food trickled out of the kitchen and I can't think of one thing that I ate that was even slightly good. The tofu was flavorless and soggy, the edamame was bland, all the sushi and rolls were poor quality and texture. All the fish had an extremely fishy smell.  The sauces were too thick and sweet and I think everyone at our table had to force themselves to eat most of the food we ordered. I'm not someone who dishes out 1 star reviews very often, but I'm absolutely shocked that this place not only stays in business, but that they were actually pretty busy when we came. The prices are cheap for AYCE, but I'd rather pay a few more dollars for something edible. If I wasn't dining with coworkers, I would definitely have said something about both the service and the food.Xtremely poor.Xtremely slow.Xtremely rude.This place isn't called "Xtreme" for nothing! A few girlfriends and I settled for this 2nd string quarterback because the Heisman winner, Goyemon, was running a 2-hour long wait that night. None of us were that hungry so we didn't want to do AYCE, choosing instead to opt for a la carte choices. Everyone else ordered rolls which came out first while I waited for my hot item to come out from the kitchen. And waited. And waited. By the time everyone else around me finished, my order still hadn't arrived so I told the server to cancel my order, and she seemed completely unaware that I had even had anything to begin with. The whole time I was debating whether or not to say anything to management, and when I finally mustered up the courage to do so, it seemed only logical that the Jersey Shore character expediting at the sushi bar would be the one I'd need to talk to, since his face was the one plastered in celebrity photos throughout the restaurant. As I started to talk about my frustrations about the service, he waved me off and said I'd need to speak to the manager who was that other guy tinkering around some bar in the back that wasn't even occupied. Okaaay. So we did, and as I was mid-sentence, the manager actually turned and walked away for me. What does this mean? Are we done here? Because I didn't think we were! He came back with his card, and wrote on the back that next time we came in, I'd have 50% off my tab, apologizing and adding that unfortunately they only had one cook scheduled in the back kitchen to accommodate hot orders. 1 cook on a Friday!? There are too many things I could say about this lack of common sense so I need to cut myself off now.Let me paint you this horrific picture. Came in here with a party of 20 for my girlfriends birthday and was sat in one of the back rooms. we pretty much took up the entire room. We were all told we all had to do either AYCE or order off the menu individually. a few of us didn't want to eat but since we were being forced we all chose AYCE. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 rolls and a large sake. after about 30 minutes of not receiving either (a few friends still hadn't received their orders either at this time) we went to the bar to grab our sake. there was no bartender so we stood there for about 5 minutes and finally someone came up. we told her about the sake and supposedly the waitress never put in the order so we bought a large sake at the bar. the sake bottle looked pretty small but we took it anyways. come to find out she gave us a small sake bottle instead of the large that we paid for. when we brought this to our waitresses attention she ROLLED HER EYES and walked away... dude wtf. she never retuned with our right sake and she never returned with our food. when we asked her where our sushi was, this is what she had to say. "Listen there are 20 of you, if you know anything about the service industry you would understand this is a challenge" I honestly was so shocked this left me speechless. Myself and 3 other friends never received a roll, and when we got the bill she had added auto gratuity. I have never in my life asked for a auto grat to be taken off but this was an exception. i asked her too and she said she couldnt, the computer didnt "work that way" when i advised her I am a bar manager and i know damn well its against the law to force someone to tip you she walked into the back and never returned. we paid our bill (the large hot sake we originlly ordered was on the bill also btw) and left. When i got home i called to speak to a manager becuase i was FUMING. we were told there was no manager present. I will never retun to this establishment. what a scam.Beware! The "X" in "Xtreme Sushi" means stay away! Do it with me- two fingers, now! X! X! X!Where to begin? Here it goes... We went as a party of 4 adults:Even though the restaurant was quite empty, there was a little bit of a wait.. & we were seated down the hallway, RIGHT NEXT to the only other table (with 3 crying children), in the room. I get it, children will cry. When we sat down, we could feel the kids pushing on the back of the booth seat, repeatedly; so we had to politely move one booth away..The music was not at a dining level, I could have sworn we were at a Jay-Z concert! We couldn't even hear each other speak across the table... lots of lip-reading.The service, overall, was mediocre... at best. The water served was like drinking pool water!! I had to order lemon to try to mask the nasty chlorine flavor.. One of us asked a man what beer was served.. he looked at her like a deer in headlights & said he send the server right over.. but no such thing happened.Three of us ordered "all-you-can-eat sushi"-- & one (not a sushi fan) ordered a few appetizers, as her meal. The waitress brought the appetizers, along with ONE small dish of some ginger & old dried up wasabi the size of the tip of my thumb. (For the three of us!?, you're too generous!) Absurd!After we put our first order in, we waited 15-20 minutes(!) for just 3 rolls to be made. By that time the "crying kids table" left & they had seated another couple with a crying kid RIGHT NEXT to us, AGAIN-- after explaining why we had moved over! We should have left when we had the chance.The sushi was dis-gust-ing. In other words--revolting, repulsive, off-putting, unpalatable, foul, nasty, vomitus.. Take your pick. NOT FRESH IN THE SLIGHTEST. The "tempura" shrimp was cold & soggy. The tuna, warm & mushy!! Gross! The presentation was even horrible. Had to "fish" other tables for napkins, ask for wasabi & ginger for EACH of us that ordered sushi, not to mention- when we told our server our second order, (5 rolls) she didn't write any of it down, & guess what?! Just 4 rolls came out to the table! We took that as a blessing... Couldn't believe they had "Best sushi in Las Vegas" printed on their menu! Someone needs to take a permanent marker & fix that, they spelled "WORST" wrong. $80 down the drain, should have gone to In-N-Out! ... & for those "compliments" by people who think we "should have complained" & think I "must be such an awful person" to write my opinion & experience ...  Mentioning this to a manager was not worth my breath, that's what YELP is for, duh. I've been in the hostess/ server/ restaurant/ customer service business.. The etiquette-it's pretty simple!!Simply put, NEVER AGAIN.. ever.

Small local business, let's support Sunflour by eating pies! They have the cutest, little baby pies, key lime, coconut creme and CHOCOLATE!  Enough for three normal slices or one just fat party pants pie. The nice girl behind the counter took two pies in the back for us and divided them so we could each take half with a smile! Now this is service!They also have sandwiches, cookies, savory muffins all wrapped up in a modern little dining room with friendly staff. I'm gonna rate them, three pinwheels.I would like Sunflour to make their coffee a little stronger. Please. PIE!!! 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288Ok...is it odd that I wanted to find something off about this place just to knock a star off it's pedestal? However, I must, enthusiastically, give it 5 stars as well! Andes mint brownies, morning glory muffins, ham & gruyere croissants, red pepper & cheddar scones...all do good! Yes, I decided to order a plethora of items for a recent house party. When in doubt, buy it all :)My favorite was the red pepper & cheddar scone. Can't beat a salt/sweet treat! They even have some unique low sugar carb beverages that are refreshing! Staff was very helpful and recommended the perfect items for my needs!

Saw @ashley B's review and was reminded that this joint just opened on Saturday.  Decided to stop by for dinner and grab a quick bite.The place is casual dining with 20 or so tables.  You order at the counter and they call your name when your Sub is ready.  After browsing the menu decided on an Italian Sub (Italian Sub - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone Cheese and Italian Dressing sprinkled with Italian Seasonings) $5.59.....with a bag of Chips and a bottle of Water.  Total damage $8.42.The girl who took my order was very new and took a while to take the order, but she had a huge smile on her face and was very friendly.....how could I not like this place so far?There were a lot of employees working/getting trained.  My food took around 15 minutes to be prepared.....an employee apologized to me and told me they made my Sandwich wrong the first time, so they had to make a second one.  A) I'm impressed that they cared enough to make it right...some places won't.  B) I'm impressed that an employee cared enough to come and tell me about it rather than have me wait around wondering what happened.After I finally got my Sandwich, I took a few pics and couldn't wait to dive in.....it looked soo good.  After I took my 1st bite, I fell in love with it.....the combination of Meat, melted Cheese, and Italian Dressing/Seasoning made this Sub taste so good with the toasted Italian Roll.  The Jalapeno Chips went well with the Sandwich too.Despite the hiccups because of the new employees, it was a great experience.  They've only been open 3 days and I really like the attitude of the employees.  I hope they make it.Will I return?  You can bet on it!Couldn't resist coming back here to try more of their Subs.  Last visit, I got an Italian Sub.  This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!As I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!Of course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.I devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.Will I return?  I'm already thinking about it!Firstly, customer service was most definitely a 5-star rating!WHERE: Tenaya & Lake Mead, right next to Rubio's!WHY: To get your sandwich fix on =DWHAT: As you park and walk to the entrance, it really looks like a firehouse!! (Or, I actually didn't know if half of the building was actually under construction, HAHA). There were also about 10 or more specialty sandwiches, with a million different types of hot sauces! I really thought that was creative!! You are allowed to get up and choose one, either out of curiosity or to ADD A LITTLE FLARE to your sandwich!I had the Firehouse meatball sub because I absolutely love different meats and meatballs in my subs!! I also asked to add lettuce and tomato on top, which made it a little more sub-like! I was surely pleased with my sandwich and ate it all there! =DThey also had a signature fountain drink!! It was the firehouse cherry limeade, and of course I had to try it out!! It was a little on the sweet side, but it was okay.SERVICE:  There was one worker named Melanie, who gave absolutely great service!! If you're ever there, give her a shout out for me! She was really helpful with helping me pick out the right sandwich for me, and brought our sandwiches over to our table. She also said, "when you come back and eat inside, they should always bring the sandwiches over to you, otherwise don't be scared to let them know!" YOU GO GIRL! Haha, so kudos x10 to her!!*NOTE: The combo, which included a large drink, sub, and chips of your choice was just under 10 bucks!!

The food is still decent but this place is going downhill fast. Today is my 5th visit in the 6 months since they opened and the place is in disrepair, literally! There is scaffolding in the middle of the dining area holding up a broken roof truss. They had most tables full but the rest had discarded foodservice items piled on them and there were fries and soda all over the floor by the tables.  The soda counter was filthy and a sticky mess and I truly felt bad for the elderly couple I saw clean their own table off when they realized none of the staff would. I really want this place and other small local restaurants to survive, but I don't think I'll risk being crushed by falling roof beams for the food again.**Update, got a message from Vanessa, who says she is one of the owners*** She expressed concern about the cleanliness, and commented that the scaffolding was temporary while the sort things out with a contractor. What upsets me, and made me add this update is the comment she made to me about not appreciating my review (which was written from my actual experience). Sorry business owners, if you can't take candor from your patrons on a public forum, you're in the wrong business. A negative review hurts your business less than allowing the negative experience that spurned the review in the first place!Also, the part about being crushed by a falling roof beams was intended as humor, not an actual expression of fear of injury. I know nobody would be dumb enough in our litigious society to allow people in an unsafe facility.Bueno Burger is doing some great advertising lately, taking full advantage of ValPack, etc to get the word out about their neat concept of mesquite grilled burgers and dogs,but if you live anywhere nearby, the scent of the burning wood alone has already piqued your attention.Sometimes it's possible to create expectations that are tough to live up to.  The air smelled great, but the burger itself just didn't seem to hang onto all of the flavor generated by the smoke while grilling.  It wasn't anything that was bad about it, but it just wasn't as exciting as i wanted it to be.I enjoyed it enough that i know i'll take advantage of a coupon and give it another go.

Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it.It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).Here are some highlights if you're not familiar:Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dipPasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better)Amarillos... sweet fried bananaArroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beansand last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in)Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally. "Bottom" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!Fantastic food, friendly owners, a new favorite.I'll admit up front that I'm a huge fan of Caribbean food--anything with plantains in it automatically gets points in my book. I had been wanting to check out this place for a while, and now that I finally have, I'll be sure to make it back here regularly.This is a little place in an otherwise unremarkable strip mall on Main St. I believe there are only 3 tables inside this place, so there were a number of people who took their orders to go while I was in the restaurant. I think I heard one person say that he had driven from the other side of the Valley for the food, so I was pretty sure that I was in for something good. There are a bunch of pictures inside of Puerto Rico, as well as a number of little souvenir-type trinkets for sale. It's all enough to make me want to visit the island, especially when combined with the delicious food.There were a number of daily specials, sandwiches, and other items to order. As I was trying to decide, I saw a newspaper article on the countertop about the Jibarito sandwich. As soon as I saw that it used tostones (fried plantains) as the "bread", I knew what I was getting. The people with me got the pernil with arroz con gandules and the chicken with arroz con gandules. We also ordered sides of tostones and amarillos (a more dessert-like version of plantains) to share before our entrees. My nephews also each got a mango juice.The person taking our order--who I assume to be the owner of the place--was very friendly and helpful throughout. They definitely know what they're doing here, food-wise.So back to the food: My Jibarito was amazing! The tostones as bread contained some delicious pork and nice complementary items. I tried it with some of the hot sauce made in store as well as the garlic dip served with the tostones, and it was even better that way. This really is a good sandwich! It's not huge, so if you have a big appetite (like I do), some other food may be necessary to satiate your hunger.I'm writing an entirely separate paragraph for the garlic dip that comes with the tostones. This stuff is amazing! It's really a simple dip, I'm sure, and you have to be comfortable with the people you're around for the rest of the day after eating it, but it is delicious! There is a nice little spiciness to it, and it goes great on the tostones and the Jibarito sandwich. I'm sure it goes great on a number of other things as well, but I only had so much to use. Great stuff!Both the pernil and the chicken were done really well--great flavor and tenderness. The arroz con gandules was really great, especially with some of that hot sauce poured onto it. Speaking of the hot sauce, it's a very liquidy mixture that is very different from any hot sauce I've previously had. I'm not sure exactly what was in it other than a bunch of little chilies which seemed to have been pickling in the liquids. Whatever it is, it's a great accompanying flavor. Both of these dishes come in pretty substantial serving sizes.The tostones and amarillos were both done perfectly. The tostones were hot and crispy, while the amarillos were hot and sweet. Seriously, I could survive solely on variations of plantains. Finally, the mango juice was excellent. It's made fresh in the store with pulp, according to the guy helping us, and it smells and tastes like it's fresh. It's really like liquid, ripe mango.I'm really satisfied with my visit. This place turns out delicious food, provides great service, and does it all at a really reasonable price. For 5 of us, it was around $45, juices and appetizers included. I'll be back!

Bleh. I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.Lovely bar in North Phoenix. I was going to say 'little' but it is actually deceptively enormous, going back a long way inside. Very friendly staff and good atmosphere, but not too many vegetarian options. My friend Sage dragged me over here for dinner, so I had to try it. I now live in the north side of town, so this place is convenient. I ordered the grilled Harvarti sandwich paired with Tomato basil soup. The sandwich was good, but I think the soup was warmed in the microwave because the bowl was too hot. The decor is kinda cool though, colorful lighted tires and bar paraphernalia that I am simply not expert enough to do justice to in my description. Parking is not easy, but if you drink you really shouldn't drive.I came here for dinner with a friend the other night, it was our first time here so of course we're excited. =)So we started with the garage fries. Let me just say these are probably some of the best fries that I've ever had. They came with this chipotle dipping sauce which was amazing. I almost felt like I enjoyed these fries more than my meal. For my entree I got the garage burger. I didn't feel like it was anything special. I've definitely had better burgers. I got sweet potato fries but the garage fries are wayyyyy better. They have a cute little outdoor patio that you can sit at and enjoy the amazing weather right now. As far as customer service, it was extremely slow and disappointing. We had no silverware when we sat down, when we asked for some, for some strange reason the waitress only brought one set for my friend. Not sure if we were supposed to share it or what. Everything was pretty pricey as well. I probably won't come back during dinner but will definitely be coming back for happy hour to enjoy their fries and wine.  =)

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.This place has okay food but needs a lot of work in the customer service and time management department. I experienced several issues during my visit. The server took forever to bring our order out from the appetizer to the main meal. They were not bust at all so I don't know what her issue was. I had mozzarella sticks that were delicious even though they were only brought out because I reminded our server about them. The pizza I had was good too and like the sticks took forever to be ready. I know deep dish pizzas can take 45 min to an hour but this went beyond that. Inside the seating was cramped. I'd order from here again but likely it would be a phone order for pick up since I did mostly enjoy the food. I sure didn't like the service I received on the other hand.

I like this location is much better than the Friendship one for many different reasons.  Same beers, but totally different vibe!  The Beer Emporium is more of a bar kinda bar.  Bar food, bar atmosphere.  This Bistro location has a better variety and I think better tasting food.  Plus the atmosphere is a lot more inviting.  Couches in the front to relax at, nice sized bar and clean restaurant area.  Hence the Bistro title!I love their Dried Cherry Almond Chicken Salad Platter and Grilled Portobello Panini.  Of course for the tasty and indulgy choice I go for the buffalo bites aka wings.  The menu here has much more to offer than the Emporium does!I always love a good deal for Happy Hour, so thank gawd they have half off Belgian Beers.  If you love to indulge in the beers but think, like me, that they're too gosh darn expensive regularly, you can take advantage of the half off!  It may mean that framboise you lust after could be yours for $5!Last time husband and I were in Pittsburgh, we made a point of visiting Sharp Edge Beer Emporium.  We're Belgian-brew-heads.  We love a run down neighborhood watering hole.  It just made sense.  This visit, while walking from our hotel to The Strip, we happened to stumble serendipitously on Sharp Edge Bistro on Penn.  SEBoP is SEBE's more sophisticated big sister.  Me like.Leather couches, marble bar, polished wood, blah blah blah.  What you really need to know is: 36 taps of Belgian beer, plus hundreds of others in bottles.  Corsendonk, Leffe, Kasteel, Gulden Draak.  Anything your Belgian-swilling heart desires.  And during Happy Hour, EVERY BELGIAN DRAUGHT IS HALF PRICE.  Snag a seat on the small patio on Penn for prime people watching along with your brew.  Some folks were eating food, so I suppose there's always that if that's your thing.  Me, I'll fill the belly with Belgians.I stopped by Sharp Edge with CM for a drink after seeing the PGH Ballet Theater's performance of Beauty and the Beast last Thurs. evening.  I'm not really a beer drinker, but I'd been to the Friendship location for happy hour with my former lab two years ago and tried the raspberry Framboise and enjoyed it, so I figured I'd see what this location has to offer.When I arrived (at around 10:00pm), it was pretty empty, with only one or two other tables occupied.  I ordered the peche (peach) framboise ($8.50) and the Mediterranean nachos ($11.50) to share with my dining partner.  CM didn't order anything to drink himself due to having to drive afterward, but I can't help but wonder if it may have also been due to the steep prices.  (In a similar vein, I wonder if this is why it was so empty at the time that we came.)Both the beer and the nachos were pretty good, if overpriced. If you're a non-beer drinker or don't like hoppy beers, I'd recommend trying a Framboise, since they're more similar to a cider than a beer, due to the fruitiness.  The nachos were an interesting take on the dish, consisting of fried pita bread topped with hummus, asiago cheese, and tomatoes and back olives. I wish they had been a bit more flavorful, given the ingredients, however.Although I enjoyed the drink and snacks, the sticker shock of the price will probably prevent me from returning again, except for during happy hour.  I suspect the reviewer who said that they depend on conference attendees from the convention center across the street for revenue was on the money (literally). 3.5 stars.

Two words: happy hour. It's every day from 3-6 PM and they have some amazing deals! You can get one of their delicious burger sliders for just $3 a slider. You can order their BBQ Chicken Nachos for about $6. Everything is very inexpensive during happy hour and everything is simply sublime! The menu here is pricey when it's not happy hour though, so be prepared to spend $16 on a burger if you miss happy hour! I like the atmosphere at Relish because it has a "man room" feel to it. The furniture is dark and comfortable, the windows overlook the beautiful Phoenician golf course and they have several flat screen TVs and a fire place. It's a great place to sit and relax. Now let's talk more depth about the food. I wish I could eat a million of their burgers! I don't know what they do to them but the burgers are extremely juicy, with this flavorful special sauce and placed on a soft bun. My second favorite dish would be the BBQ Chicken Nachos. The happy hour portion is smaller but still provides a decent amount of food! The BBQ sauce and chicken compliments the cheesy nachos and makes for a hearty dish!

If you asked me to name all of the things I missed about Illinois, I might need two hands, but I'd have a few fingers left over.  Jimmy John's, however, would be one of those things I missed.The employees are great- They're fast, they've got personality, and always have a smile on their face.They make the bread fresh in the store; sometimes when they hand you your sandwich, and the bread is still warm from the oven?  That's the greatest.Just hold the mayo (not a mayo fan)!Yes, I love Jimmy John's.  I've been to this location 3 times now.  Every time I go, I say to myself I will try something different....but, I always go with my favorite #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.50) w/Hot Peppers.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2UQESr5pUBW5hHf6Y0XCIQ?select=KshAeD8SKcWvNRdgFxMjiAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2UQESr5pUBW5hHf6Y0XCIQ?select=WFtxcGoKOzoCR4YFA5yNbAAs usual, they have the Sandwich ready before you can blink.  The Sandwiches at this location are just as good as the other.....it's a very consistent chain and the Sammies are great!Return Factor - 100%I found another Jimmy John's in the area.....I'm addicted to their Subs....sooo good.  Of course, I order my usual #9 Italian Club w/Hot Peppers, $5.50.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=ym9uaNFNqiVqdTUFGht8swhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=cnXDJkcZ2-4ikvr3W-lHOQThis place is as fast and consistent with the quality of their Sandwiches as any other location.  I like how it's right off the 101 and Raintree, very easy to get to.  I'll be back soon.Return Factor - 90%

I've been going to the Sugar Shack on 5th for about 3 months now to get my Steelers fix.  Yes, I said it, Loud & Clear - I am a Steelers Fan ! ! !   The Sugar Shack reminds of a few bars in the 'Burgh.  It is a Steelers bar and a Cardinals bar!  ?*$%@  how is that possible?  St. Louis Cardinals - think baseball...  Anyway, this place has the mandatory bar cuisine, burgers, French fries, etc.  The beers are reliable, not too diverse.  The Steelers Fans are here though!  If you are in the Scottsdale area and not up for drive to Harold's in Cave Creek, the Sugar Shack is a throw-back to real-deal, the Iron Curtain!

I must say that this is a 5 star combination of those things that make an establishment deserve the coveted 5th star~Excellent, Friendly Customer Service Fresh, High Quality Ingredientsand Superb Quality ControlThe Pastrami is DELICIOUS here!The fresh $2.99 loaves are huge!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  Mmm, Bread.  }^ )Ok I agree that the owner(s) may be quirky.  Adds to the charm of the place as far as I am concerned.  I went there on Wednesday only to discover they don't open until 10 am.  Thought that was kinda weird for a bakery. Went back the next day @ 4 and there wasn't alot left but what was there looked fab.Let me explain I am not a fan of most european bakeries sweets because they are well......... just too sweet.  I do love the breads and the pretzels.  I also love a good plain coffee roll, strudel, ect.  Not sweet but more on the flakey flavorful side of things.   So while I skipped the eclairs, kreme horns, ect I did try a coffee roll and a french baquette. Let me say that it is the BEST french baquette I have had since I was in Europe.  Hands down.  The coffee roll was my breakfast the next morning and frankly I almost went right than to buy more of them.Yummo! To top it off, the elderly lady in front of me ordered a loaf of sliced bread and then discovered she didn't have any cash or her check book and was embarrased to tears.  The owner GAVE her the bread.  Some might say 'big deal it was only 3 bucks" to which I say YES it is a big deal.   Kindness is always a big deal to me.  I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food.Seriously one of the best subs you will ever eat. 1. Fresh baked bread2. perfect selection of hand picked meats and cheeses3. Quality toppings, sauces etc. 4. Bang for your buck. HUGE subs.5. Try the sweets!

I was a little nervous to walk into this place because I know it is new and in an awkward area, but hopefully through the power of Yelp, it will pick-up and business will boom at this well deserving place. I was nervous because I expected to walk in to an eager set of a sandwich maker's eyes ready to over serve me and hear the obnoxious & awkward humming of the industrial refrigerator. Oh, how I was so wrong. They had a large staff already making sandwiches for a possible pick-up order and I was greeted with a welcoming crew. They left me alone to decide on my decisions;) and I chose a number 15 (turkey and lean pastrami)... regular size. My order was taken and I sat down in the neatly and cleanly decorated place.. very quick... and hand delivered... I got it to go so I could indulge and analyze this sandwich in my own private surroundings.. OH MANN. The bread on this thing (yeah, its called the SOURDOUGH eatery, but how often do titles back-up what they represent???) was incredible. It is a mild sourdough with the perfect amount of crustiness backed up by its light, airy, all the while perfectly dense breadiness! Then comes the mayo (which they make themselves with peppers in the mix), the Dijon, purple onion, sliced tomato, shredded lettuce.... then the meats. There is NO skimping out on the meat here. Perfectly layered with an incredibly generous portion. The turkey was delicious and the pastrami had just enough saltiness. Every flavor and texture stood out from its own while combing with each other in a beautiful harmony!!! Should food sound like a poem or a song?? Uhmm.... YES. and Sourdough eatery does this! The Regular size filled me to the brim at just $5.99 and next time I will be getting the Half sandwich.. I also can't wait to come back for a breakfast sandwich of theirs which they had for $1.99. I'm glad I went out of my "comfort level" to come to try this place out... a true Henderson treasure.Something is now SERIOUSLY amiss at SFSE. I was able to stop in on Wednesday, 5/2 and the first thing I noticed is the Illy coffee is gone. And I didn't see the super cool owners I saw last time. I ordered a Garlic Pesto sandwich and told them I wanted light mayo and mustard. What I got looked like a French's mustard bottle and a container of Kraft mayo had a love child together and it was not pretty. And it tasted like, well, we won't push Yelp's community standards for writing a review and you can just let your imagination fill in the blank. After skimming the reviews it appears ownership has changed and the focus may have shifted from quality of product to quantity of cash in the till. Which is a shame as what they had going on here was something pretty special. Now it's not even worth taking the time to exit I-215 to drive two blocks South to go to it. Tack on the stupid payment card policy (see my list description), pathetic fountain drinks that make me want to call Coke and complain directly, and a glare when I used the Yelp check in deal for free chips and a drink and I'm giving 1 star under protest.EDIT: There's been some new 5 star reviews posted for SFSE by people with no previous posts. That could be legit,  or it could be suspicious. I'm felt it was worth mentioning as this sort of thing can be people trying to counter bad reviews by gaming the system so to speak. Again that may not be happening here but it warrants keeping a close eye on it.

Review Text :
Ate there YesterdayFood  was  average Sushi was Ok.    Waited a long time for crab leg.  Over an hour They were tiny for a 16 dollars buffetGood variety but  all tasted mediocre Lots of dirty plates.  Told the girl at the fruit bar, and she came out with a towel to clean it  right at the buffet table.  Donno why she did not take it back to the washing machine .   I took a pic tooGreat wall taste better and shan hai tooI'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress (while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant) recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet.  She was the BEST waitress we've had in a super long time and extremely honest with us when we asked her where she eats seafood and she said, "Pacific ~ but please don't tell anyone"..  If you're looking for a great Asian style seafood buffet, this place is it! It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas, but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ!I actually like this buffet better than the Rio.  It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price.  Albeit the decor isn't as nice, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, and we don't have to go all the way to Las Vegas to eat at a great seafood buffet ~ it's in our own back yard!This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a generous and decent sashimi/sushi bar. For dinner and lunch you'll find a huge selection of freshly cooked food to choose from like snow crab, sea bass, mussels, oysters, many different kinds of shrimp, Peking duck, escargot and so much more.Since this place is still fairly new, you don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.This is a great place to go when we are thinking about eating seafood, sushi and/or Chinese. I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 stars, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star.Bordering on 3.5.  It's all you can eat sushi and seafood for $16.The sushi was bland and dry.  The crab legs and cocktail shrimp were the best things here. They also have fried crab, fried shrimp, scallop on the shell, cooked salmon/white fish, bbq pork, short ribs, roasted duck, sausage, Korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and grilled octopus.For dessert, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies -- all mediocre. This place is fine for the price and selection, but I doubt you're coming here for quality.  Next time, spandex pants.

Decent if you're jonesing for tapas. (This is not a paella review. Yet.) I apologize in  advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and PR firms cringe. I know you can't do authentic tapas in Southbridge/Waterfront and stay open. But I have to rate it honestly, or not at all.I remember the original TPF on Camelback, I think where Sportsmans or Tarbell's is now. I recall it being exotic and delicious, with the right intimate atmosphere. My memory could be clouded by lack of experience at the time. But overall, *this* place is a little too big, clean and corporatey to match an authentic tapas experience like you'd get in Barcelona, or Basque Spain, or some of the real deal places like in NYC. I don't think you can be located where they are and pull that off. So it's dumbed down a bit for the market. I think if you're not on the search for a super authentic, intimate experience (small bar, communal tables, etc) it will fit the bill.ATMOSPHEREBig, open, lively and trying a little too hard, IMHO. The uniforms look like Halloween costumes. It comes off a bit too kitschy. Staff all seemed pretty friendly, if a little harried. The live music is a nice touch, even though pretty low energy when we were there. I'm anxious to catch some Flamenco though.SERVICEOur server, Timo, was the epitome of charm and enthusiasm. Big thumbs up for him. But timing was all over the place. First round of drinks took  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. We saw other tables clearly looking around for their servers. Not sure if the bar is the hold-up or what. Food took much longer than expected as well, since we didn't order paella or anything that was likely made to order. Once the food started coming, we got it all pretty quickly.DRINKSMan. Do not order the mojitos. I admit I'm pretty picky about them. I love making them at home. I want them muddled fresh and I want to taste all the ingredients. They have a "pitcher approach". It's like they have mojitos on tap. I asked for a fresh mojito, not a whole pitcher. I just wanted to try their mojito, and then move on to an Albari√±o or some other wine. I got the pitcher anyway. And what came out was refreshing alright. Much like ice water is refreshing. Basically clear liquid with some rum aftertaste. No detectable lime. One sad little shred of mint in each pour. Very little sugar. The pitcher approach works well for sangria, obviously. But do not do this for mojitos. Doesn't do them justice. My wife's red wine choice (a pintoresco by the glass) was very good. A friend who tracked us down there after a Yelp check-in said the sangria was very good. So there you go.FOODI'll point out the stand-outs:BoqueronesFresh white anchovies in light oil. Delicious. Smaller than I've had elsewhere. A little more body to the fillet is nice. But a great light dish.Rabbit StewThis one gets you bang for the buck, if you're not averse to eating cute little bunny rabbits. Lots of tender delicious sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it. Bone-in meat ensured lots of flavor.Shrimp a la Plancha (or whatever they called it)Head-on, shell-on shrimp. Messy to eat unless you crunch the whole shell. Not quite crispy enough to allow for that though. So mostly we peeled them. Quality white shrimp with real shrimp flavor. Not the rubber you so often get with grilled shrimp.Oxtail StewThis should be so up my alley. Classic mirepoix dark stew flavor. Did I detect a little store-bought demi-glace starter? But it could have been braised a bit longer. Like a couple more hours. There was still too much un-rendered fat and connective stuff; not enough meat.Basque SausageNot memorable. If you've ever gotten the Spanish Chorizo from Schreiner's, or LaTienda.com, you'll know what I wish it was like. When we get the Schreiner's, it never makes it through the car ride home.Mix of Snails, Sausage and something elseDidn't do it for us. No individual character to each of the proteins. Just a mash-up of savory chewy bits. Be a pretty good starter bread dip if you were hungry, but not a great dish.Pan con Tomate (pan boli?)For me, this is a benchmark item. This would have been better if the bread had more chewiness and structure to it.And of course they have all the stand-bys like Potatas Bravas, Fried Squid, etc. And Paella. Next time, I'm trying the Valenciana for sure. That alone could add a star if the flavors are there. But there better be smokiness, bone-in dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispy on the bottom of the pan.So, just A-OK for now.I could see an updated 4 star review once... a) I've further explored the menu and know what all the gems are, and learn what to avoid, for my taste. b) they fine-tune the service and hopefully work on the authenticity. the crowd that was there and the location don't give me much hope for tuning toward the more authentic. if anything, i fear it being dumbed down even more.OK, realllllly did not want to write a poor review of this place.  I even thought about it for week before I did, but they have done themselves in here! My honey and I went last Saturday for "happy hour".  I love tapas and haven't been able to find a great spot since Sol y Sombra shut down, so we thought we would give them a try.  It was a beautiful evening, and they offer a 2-4-1 happy hour on the patio or in the bar.    So we spent two hours enjoying their delicious tapas, wine, sangria, and even dessert and coffee.  Food and drink were both amazing, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Sadly, thats as glowing as this review is gonna get because they have royally pissed me off.  Where they really went wrong was with what happened after.  So we got our "happy hour" tab, signed the receipt, and left.  I have to admit this was partially my fault because I tend to sign credit card slips with reckless abandon and utter disregard for the total(denial is not just a river in Egypt people), which was in this case, $93 plus a $20 tip.  So we get home, still talking about how delicious everything was, and I casually throw the receipt on the counter.  The sangria has now worn off.... $93? For happy hour? Yikes.  So apparently our server neglected to price our drinks out at happy hour pricing.  And the servings had been pretty small, even for tapas, certainly not the double portions that are supposed to arrive between 5 and 7.  So I called the restaurant immediately.  Having worked in restaurants before, I usually pick my battles, but since we had gone for happy hour intentionally based on what we read on Yelp, this called for attention.  SO I called the restaurant right away, and was apologized to profusely. Yes, I was correct, we had not received the happy hour portions that we should have ( which was probably why we ordered so many tapas) and we were charged double what we should have been for our drinks.  The sweet guy on the phone informed me that there was no manager available as it was a busy time on Saturday night, but that they would certainly make this right, and a manager would call me tomorrow.  Seemed reasonable so I gave them my number and waited.  Sunday, no call.  So Monday I called and left another messgae. Tuesday, still no call.  So I emailed them.   So a week later, no call, no email, nothing.  Like I said, I really don't want to give these guys a bad write up, but this is just about the worst customer service I have encoutered in a while. I personally will not return, despite a craving for their crab stuffed peppers.  If you want to chance it, go ahead, you will have a great time but will certainly pay for it!  It's really a shame because stuff like this is why otherwise great places seem to cycle in and out of this area way to fast.I arrived expecting a great night here but due to the horrible Sangria and Paella, mediocre tapas, and lousy service, I left extremely disappointed. I have walked by this place a few times before and seeing all the people on the patio enjoying the beautiful sunset and listing to the Flamenco music, it just seemed like a cool place. Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and so although the patio was complete empty when we arrived, we were told by the host (owner?) in a very condecending way that all the tables on the patio were reserved and so we would have to be seated inside. That dampened my spirits a little but I was still anticipating an enjoyable evening with my hubby and some good food. To start off, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share and some soup. Sangria arrived first in a surprisingly small pitcher. I could not believe that small pitcher was $22!  It turned out to be a good thing since it was so bad, neither one of us wanted to drink it. It was by far the worst Sangria I have ever had. It tasted like it was 1/2 cheap red wine and 1/2 club soda. Not sweet, not fruity. Instead of bright refreshing slices of citrus and other fruits there were a few bits of orange rind and a couple of pieces of some other fruit that had been diced so small it was unrecognizable. I ordered the gazpacho which was pretty good although I prefer it chunky rather than pureed and my husband got the seafood stew. That had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was very overcooked. We decided not to order any tapas with seafood in them after seeing the quality that was in the soup. We selected three Tapas to start with: the beef tenderloin, the leek tart, and the potato tortilla. The beef was pretty good, nothing special about it but it had a good flavor. The leek tart was not so great but the sauce it came with was delicious and we mopped it up with the bread in the bread basket. The tortilla was disappointing. To me this is the quintessential tapa dish so I was expecting it to be great but it was rubbery and tasteless as if it had been prepared hours earlier and then reheated. We had intended to start with only 3 tapas since we had already had the soup and told our waiter that we reserved the right to order more. He pressured us into ordering some paella as well so we did. Now I absolutely love paella, it is truly one of my favorite dishes on earth but since other Yelp reviewers had said to stay away from it I ordered it with some misgivings. The paella arrived about 20 minutes after we had finished the rest of our meal. Our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepare but I was not expecting it to take that long. As soon as we tried it, I realized that it was not worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned it was way too watery and very bland tasting. In addition, the vegetables tasted like they came from a bag in the freezer section. And the seafood was the same rubbery stuff that was in the soup. The rings of calamari were so tough, you could not cut them with a fork, I had to use a serrated knife. The shrimp had lost all of its sweet flavor and was just as tough. The entire dish was so awful that we didn't even finish it. So, they were already down two stars for the horrible Sangria and Paella... Also while waiting for the Paella, I visited the ladies room which although beautifully decorated was filthy. Dirty restaurant bathrooms are a personal pet-peeve of mine so that had knocked them down a star as well. Also, the cheesy outfits the servers wear and the overall poor service (we were brought the wrong dishes initially and had to ask repeatedly for plates since we were sharing) had knocked them down another star. The final straw was that as we were leaving I counted four empty tables on the patio that we could have been seated at.  Overall, just a horrible experience.  I strongly recommend staying away from this place.A few of us stopped by here after work for a little food and drink.  We went buck-crazy and ordered a ton of Tapas.  Here's what we ordered:Patatas Bravas ~ Spicy Potato wedges (Burgos) $4.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=DV0lG3c-DobjZ-UM8BEDcAChorizo ~ Red Pepper Sausage (Rioja) $5.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=-tlRkoU8fGBUo5bVD3Qj3wTigres ~ Steamed Mussels in a spicy Hot Sauce (Basque) $7.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=E8OEfJMGBtMyKtoSXpIJjwRabas ~ Tender Calamari Rings, club soda batter (Basque) $6.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=RiaeNcPUtildRkOQqeA59wAlmondigas con Tomate ~ Spanish Meatballs in a roasted Tomato Sauce (Murcia) $6.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=8qlVvEGJxw-6QemgDHVfmwCroquetas de Jamon y Queso ~ Ham and Cheese Croquettes (New Castille) $5.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=FeupOhh6i0_GnWGhIZHlowRabo de Buey ~ Oven roasted Ox Tail with Carrots, Roasted Peppers, and Tempranillo Wine Sauce (Basque) $19.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=PbyX24hx_F7Sb7Ad3WBMWAChuletilla de Cordero ~ Open flame-broiled Lamb Chops with Herbs (Old Castile) $10.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=oZmbtFxxvewV23e-9V2KoQGambas al Pil-Pil ~ Saut√©ed Gulf Shrimp, Garlic, Guindilla Pepper, White Wine (Andaluc√≠a) $8.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=RXyMMgvjf8e2wYkILDXmlgCordero Burgales ~ Lamb Ossobucco, castille style (Castilla la vieja) $24.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=gSq_8nXnfonJmDa5u5mj9wWe grubbed and drank Wine all night long.  What a great after-work dinner!  Good thing I didn't pick up the bill that night!Return Factor - 100%This place has the slowest service ever. I can't actually review on many plates because we saw our server maybe 2x. We couldn't even get the check from him and had to rely on the hostess and a bus girl to help get us the check, take our creditCard and return it to us so we could sign it.   We had the tuna, lamb, asparagus and we would rate them all as ok. They could've used a drink to wash them down with.One of the best meals I've had ... with the *worst* service. Quite possible in my life. (Attributed to the rudeness factor of Dino, our perpetually annoyed server.)This is a beautiful restaurant, with sky high ceilings, offering dignified dining in Old Town Scottsdale. The patio space reminded me of a street in Europe. The food is exquisite. In a heat beat I'd recommend every morsel that touched my lips.- Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine) - Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo (peppers stuffed with crab) - Patatas Aioli Verde (potatoes, cilantro, ham)- Pastel a la Porrusalda (leek tarte) - Boquerones (anchovies in garlic)I was "eh" on the flan. (Very eggy. Too much air involved.)I had been very curious to sample the fare as this place is across from The Herb Box. With International Supper Club UYE here I gleefully perfused the menu. (Thank you very much for organizing Ursula!)I'll probably never visit this restaurant again. EVEN THOUGH the food was spectacular. EVEN THOUGH the decor was wonderful. EVEN THOUGH they have live flamenco music and a happy hour.Note: They would prefer if the check wasn't split. (Even for parties of five.) Come prepared to share wine menus. There appears to be an inexplicable shortage of these.Pls forgive short-hand use; Review would be too long, otherwise.SERVICE: Reserved through OpenTable wks ago.  Checked in w/ host & she told me about a great spot for us where friend & I could hear each other talk & where one of us would have a view of the stage, & told her I appreciated the gesture, but could we both see the show?  She sat me @ a table across the stage & two-steps from the bar.  A great spot, 'til I noticed servers & busboys entering & exiting behind me (front patio dining area).  Soon got used to the clatter, but what eventually annoyed us was that people would block the stage view on their way & back from the kitchen!  (Restrooms were next to kitchen, too.)  It would behoove managers/owners to move the stage to somewhere with less foot traffic.Was here months ago w/ a group (Irene V. incl.) so knew service could be rude.  Hoped tonight would be better.  Denzel came to greet me & asked if I was going to wait for my friend, or would I like to order anything to drink?  Told him I was going to do the Restaurant Week menu ($44 pp excluding tax & gratuity) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapas-papa-frita-scottsdale#SPCe2DEC5YvywwjqA1h1jQ & asked to confirm that it came w/ a beverage (glass of Spanish Moscatel), & he immediately became excitable, w/ hand gestures, leaned in & said that it was an after-dinner drink that would arrive w/ dessert.  This was when I noticed he had bad breath.  (If you're in an industry where you have to interact w/ guests in person, you better have ways to keep your breath fresh, yes?)  Friend arrived & soon after, Denzel appeared again.  Already had an idea what to order, but she didn't, so we asked if he could come back in a few.  He came back after 15 minutes & friend proceeded to choose an app & a dessert to be brought together & was looking for one more item she'd spotted online, & while she was searching, he seemed like he was getting impatient, so I said "How about I place my order while she looks?" ("Good idea" said friend), & Denzel didn't seem to like this for he made a "whatever" gesture w/ his hands.  Had previously confirmed w/ him that I could sub out allergenic appetizers (1st course came w/ five items- shrimp, mushroom, beef tenderloin, rosemary goat cheese-stuffed date wrapped in bacon, & crab-stuffed piquillo pepper) for something else, so I told him I'd go for a 2nd stuffed date & the potato wedges he suggested.  I then asked for the pork tenderloin entree & chocolate churros for dessert.  My friend couldn't find what she wanted, so ordered a second dessert- banana-apple bread pudding.LIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Classical Spanish guitarist already playing onstage @ 6:50p.  Very petite female dancer was a joy to watch (dramatic arm posturings, spins, tap-dancing & rhythmic stomping), but when it came to her partner's time to dance, while entertaining & footwork impressive, he was @ least two & a half times heavier than her, which meant his footwork taps & stomps were many times louder than hers.  My ears hurt every time he did his solos.  Take note & bring your earplugs if you want to keep your hearing intact!FOOD: Didn't think I ate well for $44 plus tax.  Initially was going to order coffee w/ dessert after persuading Denzel to serve the Moscatel first & coffee w/ dessert, but he didn't come back to take my coffee order ($4-$9) & indeed forgot to place my churros order.  Friend's bread pudding arrived long before my dessert did, & my dessert was given to me by head chef who said that w/ the advent of the dropped plates of food in front of our table, our server didn't know I wanted churros (??).  Of all the 4 different apps, I liked the stuffed pepper & dates best.  The spicy potato wedges were good & the beef skewer was the worst- bland and unappetizing texture.  Puff pastry-wrapped pork entree was delicious, the meat tender, & the rice so fluffy & soft- almost like risotto w/ the saffron & cuttlefish sauces.  Churros weren't good.  Bit dry, heavy w/ sugar, came w/ a caramel filling, & minimal chocolate.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL, so even good food can't make things right for me.  My friend enjoyed her 2 stuffed piquillos & Catalan creme br√ªl√©e.  Tasty bread pudding arrived cold, w/ ice cream, so that was a disappointment, since we expected hot pudding.We asked for boxes to take our desserts home, & Denzel arrived w/ what appeared to be a bowl & a lid & placed them in front of her.  When I tried to stop him from leaving so as to avoid  flagging him over for another bowl & lid, he made exaggerated motions of separating the bowls & lids & placing them in front of friend & me.  Friend had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing!  Why didn't he do this in the first place?  Ugh.Stay away from here if you value service!Well nothing takes you back to Spain like getting on an aeroplane and flying there when the finances are right. But here in Phoenix, if you can settle for watered down sangria for $8 a glass, no bullfight, and no cigarette smoke then dining at Tapas Papa Frita is recommended. On weekends you can enjoy entertainment with dinner.The menu is large and heavy and of a reddish background color, so it was a bit annoying to read through. But of course being from the Yelp community I pre-read it online and already had an idea of what I would get. Go figure I was asking everybody else if they were ready to order yet.Other reviewers have complained about the lack of service. That wasn't my experience. In fact I feel like we were over served. I had to give our waitress the evil eye for popping over every two seconds while we perused the menu. And at meals end she insisted on taking our leftovers to wrap them herself instead of bringing containers to the table.There were several selections of vegetarian tapas. Few were vegan, some prepared with cheese or type of crema, one had ham (which I'm unsure why it would be listed in the vegetable section). Having tapas is kind of like building your own tasting menu, and we didn't hold back. Here are the uniquely tasty morsels we tried. 1. Pastel a la Porrusalda: Leek tart in a pastry - 6.50Liked it, but the dough was a bit chewy2. Champi√±ones al Jerez: Braised mushrooms with garlic and sherry - 6.50Liked it, but not too flavorful3. Pimientos a la Riojana: roasted peppers with olive oil - 7.50Liked.4. Patatas Bravas: Spicy red potato wedges - 4.95 Liked them, but they had crema on top and were not spicy at all.5. Tortilla de Patatas: Spanish potato pie - 4.50Liked, but it was dry.6. Escalivalda: Peppers, onions, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic over bread - 7.00 The veggies were good, but had a tangy taste.Did not like the bread, it was hard and not garlicky.7. Cabrales con Menbrillo: Cabrales cheese with quince - 9.00So-so8. Setas con Queso De Cabra: Stuffed portabello with goat cheese - 9.00Recommended by the waitress. Liked it, but it was too small. I expected a burger sized mushroom, but it was about a third of what I expected.9. Pollo al Ajillo: roasted chicken thigh in lemon garlic - 7.00Having gone through the basket of white bread rolls and aioli and all these tapas, we were getting full. But entrees were coming. 1. Pollo con Jamon: Ham and cheese wrapped chicken breast with capers, and guindilla sauce - 16.002. Paella de Vegetales: Seasonal garden vegetables with saffron rice - 16.95 Although the paella was tasty I would not order it again. As a rice dish with cooked veggies the whole thing just had a mushy consistency to me. One spoonful was more than enough.And now for the sweetest ending. No spanish dinner is complete without some churros. But share one dessert? Not at my table! So we also ordered the Pastel de Pan: banana and apple bread pudding with ice cream - 6.00 There's no point in saying another word about the bread pudding. If you like bread pudding then try it. Cut to the churros. Oh dessert heaven...the churros! Churrrrrrrrros. I felt like dancing around the restaurant stomping my heels like a flamenco dancer and instead of clacking castanets, I would have churros on my fingers. Churros con Chocolate - 7.00Served warm, stuffed with hazelnut/caramel filling (??) and with a side of chocolate. Unfortunately they were coated in a lot of unnecessary sugar, but delicious just the same.

Oh noes, Icehouse. I was really excited to bring some out of towners to this new restaurant/pub seated in the heart of South End. The building itself is really neat - super tall ceilings, a nice patio facing South Blvd. and tons of super sweet flat screens inside. This would be a great place to watch a game...but not to eat...and here's why. Four of us were seated and ordered all different things off the menu - chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp and spinach quesadillas and I ordered the Thai beef salad. Even as we ordered, we thought that some of the menu items looked a little pricey as depicted. But, as this is a new restaurant we didn't quite know what to expect. The food came out very quickly - quite literally within 5-10 minutes, which was good. But the outcome was not. My mother ordered the shrimp and spinach quesadillas and upon tasting them, she put them down and asked me to try them. The spinach had a metallic, almost chemical taste to it. Within five minutes the waitress came over and she offered to bring her something else, later stating that too much oregano was reason that the quesadillas tasted strange. No offense, but I cook with oregano often, and that wasn't the odd taste. My husband's shrimp tacos were fine, but we took issue with the fact that for $12 - all he received were two small tacos with no sides. And my father's chicken tacos - $9 for the same. Even if these tacos were stellar (which per my dining mates they were just ok), that is a paltry amount of food for the price. The only decent item at the table was my Thai Beef Salad - the seasoning was nice, the mint was a pleasant touch, I just wish it had a little more spice. Portion wise it was more than enough. As a replacement to the spinach quesadillas, my mother ordered the Thai beef spring rolls and they were positively swimming in oil. Now, I don't mind a fried item, but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isn't appetizing to anyone. Needless to say, she didn't eat very much at lunch. On a brighter note, Icehouse has an extensive and affordable beer selection that would please just about anyone. Overall, I like the concept and the feel of Icehouse - plenty of brews and plenty of tvs. The food, however, fell waaaay short. I really hope that this place reevaluates its menu as the location and the concept have a lot of potential.I went into Icehouse after waiting tables tonight, grabbed a beer, half night pint night on Wacky Wednesdays. Yay, can we start meeting here on Weds for a Yelp Office Hours meeting? I ordered pork tacos and a White Zombie wheat beer, my tab was $9.90. What a deal. Mon: $2 Bud, Bud Light & Bud SelectTues: 1/2 Price WineWed: 1/2 Price DraftsThur: $2 Carolina Blonde & StrawberryFri: $2.5 Corona & Corona LightSat: $2 Miller Lite & Coors Light - $5 Bloody MarySun: $2 Bud Family Products - $5 Bloody MaryP.S.

We have watched business' come and go at this location for a few years now.  When I saw that it is now a sushi restaurant, I had my reservations.  During the day you cannot see into the shop because of the tinted windows, but don't let that stop you from seeing and tasting what's inside.  We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted very warmly from the waitress and soon afterwords, the sushi chef.  It happened to be happy hour at the time with extremely reasonable prices.  Happy hour is everyday of the week from 4-6:30pm.  What great deals!  Sake bombers were only $6 and you can choose from a variety of appetizers; such as edamame, calamari, and gyoza, to name a few.  I had to have the edamame, and the calamari was scrumptious as well.  It was served with a yummy aioli sauce that paired with it perfectly.Not only were there appetizers on the happy hour menu, but there were some sushi rolls to choose from too.  We tried the shrimp tempura roll and wow, the shrimp had an amazing light batter that had a lovely crunch! Besides happy hour, we had to experiment more from the sushi menu.  The Surfer was amazing; that was one of my favorites.  The dynamite shrimp on top was delectable with it's spicy zing.  It was hard not to eat all the shrimp on its own without the roll!  If you like spicy, you would also like the yellow fin tuna with sauteed jalapenos.  It's served with a delightful soy garlic sauce.  It was a little misleading, because we thought it was going to be a roll.  However, it was extremely fresh and tasty, but a little overpriced for all that you got.On the adventurous side, the quail egg was phenomenal!  It was served in a shot glass and I have to admit, I wasn't sure how to proceed.  After taking the plunge into my mouth, I found that all the components went together extremely well and the creaminess from the quail egg only added to the delicacy of it.  I would definitely get that again and perhaps experiment a little more with what else they had to offer.  I am very happy to have found a sushi bar that keeps my taste buds wanting more.  Service was excellent.  My glass never reached empty, and it was never a nuisance to stop our waitress and ask for something.  The atmosphere was mediocre.  I felt that there could have been more charm, especially with the big screen televisions playing football.  Personally, I could have done without and maybe been more entertained with anime.  However, this sushi hot spot is off to a good start and I hope they will be around longer than their predecessors.

Review Text :
We frequented this restaurant a lot over the past five years. In fact, there was a time we were going every other weekend. Unfortunately that changed yesterday. Since the restaurant was renovated, my husband and I have been there three or four times. I understand that now that they can accommodate many more customers, the service is going to be slower and the stress levels will be higher. However, what happened yesterday was inappropriate, unprofessional and unacceptable. I ordered what I order every single time I go there. My husband did the same. In fact, I joked with the waitress that she should make copies of the ticket so she can just have them ready whenever we come in. After my husband and I placed our orders, the waitress walked away, checked the window for other tables' food. Talked to the other servers. Got my coffee and my husband's soda and snagged some creamer off of another table for me. At that point, I asked if she could change my toast from dry wheat to raisin bread. She informed me that was fine since she hadn't even put the ticket in yet. Um......okay??? This particular server is new and I get that. However, you write the ticket, hang it in the window, then go do other stuff. After waiting another thirty minutes (again, I get they were busy and I was willing to overlook this) she brought out my eggs, bacon and grits. She told me she was waiting on the bread. My eggs were the consistency of rubber. When she came back over with my husband's plate, I asked her if she could have them remake my eggs as they were overdone. She took the plate, walked over to the kitchen and put my eggs on a separate little dish. She brought the bacon and grits back, along with my husband's food. She went back to the window and retrieved a new plate of eggs for me and brought them back over to me; by which time my husband had pointed out his eggs were not over-medium either, but were still clear where the whites were undercooked. He had taken his eggs and put them on his toast plate for her so she could just take them to the kitchen to be replaced. When she handed the cook that second plate of eggs is when the problem started. The waitress and another woman I can only assume is the manager stood in front of the window while the cook screamed, yelled and threw things (yes, THREW things) like a two year old child who was told "No." He yelled and screamed about eggs and "stupid people" and cooking for a good thirty seconds before my husband went and informed the owner, Don. When my husband and Don walked back, the cook was still screaming and yelling. As Don was walking into the kitchen, we heard a dish crashing and Don yelling at the cook. While this was going on, the waitress brought me my raisin toast which looked like it had been chewed up and spit out on the plate. Seriously, the presentation was just very poor and by this time, I was just over the whole thing. A few minutes later, Don emerged from the kitchen with two eggs, cooked over medium. He put them in front of my husband who thanked him. Don told him to "check them." My husband told him they were fine. Don insisted he check them again. So, my husband stuck his fork in them and stated again that they were fine. Then, the waitress shows Don the plate of raisin bread. She mumbled something and he yelled, "She ordered raisin bread and....what???!!" The waitress looked like she was about to cry, so I said, "It looks like someone chewed it up and spit it out on the plate." He took it and went back into the kitchen. By this time, I had just completely lost my appetite. I got the car keys from my husband and went out to the car. My husband advised that after I left, Don came back out with two new pieces of bread. He advised Don that I had left and Don threw it in the trash and exclaimed, "I TRIED! I tried to make it right!" My husband finished his eggs and was told there was no bill (I should certainly think not!). As he was leaving, Don told him, "Have a nice life."So, here's the thing: If you own a business in the service industry especially, there occasionally will be a complaint. However, you should realize that your customers are your source of income and the reason you even have a business. In the five years I have been going there, I have never once complained about the food...EVER. Yesterday it was completely warranted and I left there feeling as if I were the "bad guy." Well after five years of supporting this local business, I can honestly say I will never be back there. I'm a bit disappointed because it was our favorite place to go for breakfast, but I'm not going to be a patron somewhere that treats their customers as an annoying inconvenience. And, honestly, I would have been okay but not for the fit the cook threw. That is where it all went downhill. They're just eggs. You're not doing brain surgery, dude. Take a valium and chill out. As for me, I'll be going to Black Bear diner from now on.I will never come back here. I just witnessed what may be the rudest manager dressing down an employee not only in front of other servers but about 10 patrons as well. The waitress may have been doing something wrong I have no idea but you do not dress down employees in front of customers or patrons for any reason. The manager then proceeded to ask the other servers after the lady left if he was wrong. Well who the hell would disagree with you for fear of being yelled at. Also the kitchen is in the weeds and this manager or owner was more worried about going outside to smoke. In the 40 minutes I sat watching he went outside twice. I was so angry by the time I left I wanted to punch the guy for 45 minutes I had to listen to him yell at people from the cooks to waitresses

Restaurant name  Mekong Palace
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Mekong Palace is located off Dobson Rd. and Main St. in Mesa.  This food court eatery is located inside the Mekong Plaza shopping center.  Mekong Palace is a trifecta of a restaurant.  During the day they offer up Dim Sum, the evenings it's either classic Chinese dining or Hot Pot!Dim Sum is what I like to call Asian Tapas.  Dim sum, literally translated, means "touch of the heart." Traditional legend says that women would make dim sum dishes for their husbands before they went off to work.  For this reason, dim sum is very labor intensive, made up of small Bo-Bite-sized pieces (usually served in dishes of 2-4 pieces) with attention to detail; even going so far as lines on dumpling wrappings.  Dim sum is traditionally served for breakfast and lunch and is considered an art form amongst Chinese chefs. Modern day Dim Sum is served by the waitstaff pushing carts around and in between tables, while patrons view and select the dishes in the carts.  My family and I usually go on Sunday mornings like most Asian families.  I jokingly call this Sunday gathering Chinese Church.  Dim Sum is also called "Yum Cha" or drinking tea since tea is the choice of beverage.Mekong has all your favorite Dim Sum plates from Siu Mai, Cha Siu Bow, Nah My Guy to Guy Lans and Nai Wong Bows.  Yes, I know, it sounds so foreign, but it's the only way to order it.  No worries, the servers translate all these dishes in English well.   Make sure you bring a Chinese speaking friend.  Not only is it almost a requirement, but makes it more fun, as well.  I love the Dim Sum here not just because the food is great, but because of the atmosphere.  Mekong rocks out on classic Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Vivian Chow music playing while you enjoy a great meal with family and friends.During the evening, Mekong Palace pumps out great Chinese cuisine.  They have everything from your favorite Kung Pao Chicken to your Sweet and Sour Pork.  However, they also have some great classic authentic Chinese dishes such as Stir-fried Lobster, Mapo Tofu, and my favorite, Stir-fried String beans and pork.  Think that's it?  Well think again!  Mekong Palace also offers up Hot Pot style dining.  Here at Mekong you get your own pot of hot boiling stew and choice of flavor, while cooking your own ingredients made to order; fresh chopped vegetables, round eye beef and diced calamari.  I love eating Hot Pot here since it's very tasty and also very affordable.  At $2-$3 per plate, this place can get you full real quick at a very fair valueThe last time I had Hot Pot it was in Taipei and it was 2009. Clearly I was due for a repeat. Since my China days are over, I had to rely on my friends to take me where they thought the most authentic stuff was in Phoenix, so all 10 of us gathered at Mekong for some Hot Pot goodness.Here is my easy guide to eating Hot Pot at Mekong.ORDERINGSharing is Caring!!  Since Hot Pot is all about sharing, the hard part about it is the strategy. The bigger your party, the harder it will be to coordinate. Groups of 4-6 are ideal. 10 is just a mess. Make sure you all figure out what you collectively want to eat (everyone likes meat? Ok, a couple portions of meat. Only 2 like mushrooms, Ok only 1 serving). Otherwise if everyone fills out an order card with their personal preference you will end up with 1) too many leftovers, 2) a giant billPICKING FLAVORSGo a little past your comfort zone on flavors. A big/spicy/tasty broth is good as you will not be drinking it, but just dipping your sides in it. The stronger the broth, the better the flavors of your sides will be. Also, go above and beyond when making your dipping sauce. Mix and match! Spicy soy sauce mixed with satay, sesame seeds, garlic and cilantro is a good base. Again, you're not drinking the sauce, just dipping your cooked goods in it. The stronger, the better!COOKING YOUR STUFFThink like a chef. Not everything will take the same amount of time to cook. The meat will take 10 seconds (in-out-done). The taro will take the longest. Dumplings will take a while to cook, while bok choy, greens and some veggies will be faster. Noodles will also be pretty fast so check often. Also, don't over boil your broth! you have the temp controls under the table, so pick a temperature where you get steady heat and bubbles without making a giant mess and overcooking everything. Experiment! EATING YOUR STUFFShare Share Share. Pass along the sides, try everything (coagulated blood, tripe, fish balls, you name it). If you really want to take some leftovers home, I suggest you cook them prior OR take some of the broth home to cook later. Most of the stuff really don't make good leftovers, so I wouldn't particularly bother unless you went overboard with the ordering.PAYING YOUR STUFFBased on the whole sharing technique, I would just split evenly (except for drinks). Since sides get passed around, splitting according to what you ate might be a giant pain in the ass- for both you and the server. Expect to pay around $20 including some drinks.Overall experience was fun and worth returning. The list of options is large and the quality is A-OK. Doesn't compare to my Taiwanese experience but hey, this is Phoenix after all.Mekong Palace is definitely my choice for dinner and dim sum, ALWAYS.  While there's no solid walls perse, the decor and ambiance is decent.  How can you not love the cleanliness?Dim sum:  The prices are a steal for the quality that you get.  Food is fresh, dumplings are big [that's what she said], and the food is just downright amazing.  It doesn't matter if you're the first for dims sum or the lat, the food is always fresh.  Service is always superior and your tea pot is never left empty for more than a couple minutes.  Those kids are on the ball about keeping the pot filled!  I love their seasonal items like the little fried sweet potato balls of heaven and their special items are always exciting to try.  Food is genuinely authentic and I love it here!Dinner:  Dinner is just as great.  Mekong Palace is the only place to go for Peking Duck.  While other places makes a delicious bird, they usually just give you the skin only with the buns.  At Mekong Palace, they hook it up.  You get the skin for the buns of course but they also prepare two more little dishes with the price of the one dish:  You get lettuce wraps and the duck meat itself.  It's DELICIOUS!  Food at dinner is just as amazing and the portions are gigantic.  This is definitely my favorite place to go when I want some Chinese food [well, here and my mama's house].Came to Mekong Palace for February's Breakfast Club UYE to try some Dim Sum, we were a party of 10 and were seated right away.  Even though the restaurant itself sits in the back of a shopping center, once you are seated you sort of forget that you are in a shopping plaza.We tried at least 15 different items, everything was delish, my son really enjoyed the shark fin rolls the roasted duck, we also tried noddle dishes, a chicken and rice dish, steamed bbq pork buns, oh gosh we tried everything,  every dish offered a new flavor and everything was very yummy!Like I said we were a party of 10, and tried over 15 different styled dishes and the total bill for each of us with tip included: $13 bucks! That's right! Great meal for an excellent price, but have to be honest, none of were thinking with our wallet when picking items, we just wanted to tried all the things we could and I was quite shocked to learn it was just 13 per person. It was a great time had by all, and I look forward to coming back!This is as good as dim sum can get in AZ.  you'll need to wait for a seat as this place is quite busy.  You can also order classic Chinese dishes off their menu.

Restaurant name  El Pollo Loco
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I gotta give them props and bump them up a star. El Pollo Loco is still my healthy lunch of choice in this armpit of the city. It's kinda like a shaved armpit now instead of a musky, hippy armpit. At least in regards to EPL that is. They have booted the homeless crew who use to reside here AND remodeled the interior of the restaurant which created a brighter and more spacious environment for grubbin'.*Salsa bar is clean and full (until I get a hold of it)*Staff is on point even if they still say," Hi-Me your order is ready". I'm cool with that. Makes me feel all Bon Qui Qui inside. *Food here is consistantly delicious and fresh. *They have a loyalty card that seems to equal a free $5 salad for me once a month. Boo ya!!!!Yeah, they are on their game right now and I'm likin' it. Only thing I don't get is this. They started selling smoothies and slushy coffee drinks. Why don't they have a Horchata flavor ice-blended drink? Wouldn't that make more sense? I know this Ranchero would be all up on it on Cheat Day.Love Love Love the new healthy menu! So much to choose from. I'm glad they are next door to my gym location.The drive thru is hardly ever busy and the staff is always so nice and answers any questions you have about the new menu.I ordered two shrimp tacos with avocado, two for 7$. So delicious and healthy with the wheat tortilla and cabbage. I was full after just eating one. And the shrimp are medium size(not bay shrimp!), and so flavorful.Definitely give it a try if you don't have time to sit down for lunch and want a fresh healthy option.

Restaurant name  KGB: Kerry's Gourmet Burgers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I went to KGB for a really late night snack at around 2:30am.  It was actually a tough decision for me to eat here considering that at this point of my trip, I already had eaten Burgers at other spots on the Strip and didn't really feel like having another one.  I looked at their menu and did see something that caught my attention..... their Bacon Waffle and Fried Chicken Burger.  What the heck??I've had my fair share of Chicken and Waffles from Roscoe's, to FarmerBrown, and Hash House A Go Go, and even Bouchon, but I've never had them in the form of a sandwich.  So when they brought it to my table, I couldn't help but crack up because it just looked ridiculous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw?select=uznWQt-KgYXi3OEBfGbXJw).  Basically, you get two Bacon Waffle "Sliders" with Fried Chicken that comes with a funnel of Tater Tots and your choice of either Maple or Jalapeno Syrup.  I opted for Maple because I thought that Jalapeno Syrup just sounded so weird.  Maybe I should've opted for it though since the dish was strange enough already.  I really didn't know how to eat this thing because once I put the syrup on the Waffles, I was no longer able to eat it with my hands.  I ended up taking it all apart and just knife and forking it.  I think the execution fell a little flat since the Bacon Waffles were a little overdone and the Chicken was dry.  The Syrup only helped just a little bit to counter the dryness.  I do applaud Kerry Simon for trying to be creative with this dish though.  At least the Tator Tots were good!! I guess it's not really fair to judge this spot based on their interesting take on Chicken and Waffles since it's a burger joint after all.  I do appreciate that they're open really late (till 6am).  I'll probably drop by again so I can try their burgers or Kerry Simon's famous Iron Chef Sliders and hopefully have a better experience.I like the concept of KGB and it's riff on the Soviet era.  Being at KGB, however, is not like being at the Lubyanka in Moscow.  There are Soviet era knock off posters of the proletariat.  Most of the female servers had short, leather shorts that evoked a police state couture.I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I messaged a good Yelp buddy and asked if he wanted to join me here before our Yelp event last night and use the Groupon.  He has been there before but this was my first visit.I ordered their southwest burger which the menu describes like this:   avocado, cilantro, lime-marinated peppers and onions, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, avocado cr√®me fra√Æche, jalape√±o-Cheddar bun.  I ordered it rare.  The burger comes with fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and it was very juicy but none of the avocado was there.  Pico, yes, and cheese, but there was no taste of avocado.  Service was good during our visit.  Since the place was almost empty, it should have been.  The price was in line with Strip prices.  At first I thought the burger was over-priced but when you factor in the fries served with each sandwich, it is comparable to other burger joints on the Strip.I went to see the round semi-private dining area on the side of the kitchen where they have the hammer and sickle light.  I got a photo of it and I could almost see Felix Dzerzhinsky having dinner there.  KGB is A-OK!Hubby was craving a burger and heard they had decent ones here, so we came here for dinner. There wasn't a wait and we were seated right away. The place was maybe half full and I liked the vibe. We were sat at a roomy and comfy booth. Our server was nice and checked on us right away at first taking our drink orders and then our food order, but didn't check on us for long periods of time after that. Priced at $10 I ordered a "House Salad" and asked that the balsamic vinegar be replaced with extra ranch dressing. It took a while for our food to come out. When my salad did arrive, it was a big portion. They forgot to give me extra ranch dressing instead of balsamic and when I mentioned it to our server he went and got the ranch. The salad had a mixture of greens that I personally didn't prefer, tomatoes that were sad, 3 dinky little cucumber scraps and shredded carrots. It just wasn't a salad I'd eat again. For dessert we ordered a "KGB S'Mores" and was presented nicely. The rice krispies treats were rock hard making them tough to eat. The marshmallows on the top and chocolate sauce that was underneath tasted good and the single strawberry garnish, but that's about it. After dropping off dessert, our server took a while before coming back to check on us or bring the bill. My hubby did enjoy his burger even though it wasn't cooked the way he requested at first and the burger had to be remade, but nothing stood out enough here to come back.

Review Text :
Jalapeno margarita + kick ass salsa = one happy Nikki.I have always loved the food here, but the service has pushed this from 4 stars to 5 stars.Let's begin with research I did a few weeks ago for the Weekly Yelp. For my Yelp Flips The Bird issue, I called on a super busy night. The nice young girl on the phone answered all my odd questions (I never told her who I was or why I was asking all these questions). So nice... so helpful. This past weekend, I took my buddy Steve to bust his Paco's Tacos cherry. The bartender was our server. She was fantastic. Super friendly, so good at her job. She knew the menu by heart. And when she got tied up with to-go orders at the bar, another nice girl jumped right in to bring us boxes and the check. During the meal, the manager walked over to ask how our lunch was. I wish all restaurants did this. It's such a simple gesture, but it really does go a long way.Okay now to the food!Chips and salsa: I love the salsa here. Perfect combination of spice and flavor... plus the chips are so light and fresh. I could easily crush multiple orders by myself.Firestarter margarita: Jalape√±o infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had. Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high. Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side. Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals. I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit. Cheers Paco's! :)

Restaurant name  Salt of the Earth
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've been to Salt of the Earth 3 times, most recently with my brother and his friend.  We sat in the common tables downstairs, but I've sat upstairs as well.  The large space and open-air environment are vibrant.  It's the kind of place that you'd be just as comfortable in a shirt & tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  People like to say that this the kind of place that you can find in "fancier" cities than Pittsburgh.  I've eaten in many fancy restaurants in much larger cities, and I can honest say that I have been never been any place as unique as Salt.Kevin Sousa has been serving outstanding food in Pittsburgh for years now.  His current restaurant is no different.  They unusual nature of the preparations and ingredients are highly unique, but are wonderfully harmonious in the execution of the dishes.  I recently started off with the Vodka cocktail made with local Boyd & Blair and Creme Yvette.  Yes it was girly, but it was delicious.  For appetizers, we had the cockscomb and escolar sashimi.  The cockscomb was combined with cheesy grits and collard greens that gave it a theme of Southern soul-food.  The pink escolar was beautiful in its presentation.  The slices were thick and the the flavors were outstanding.  It was a perfect appetizer to share (and not just because eating too much escolar isn't a good idea).  Sharing the appetizers is a great way to experience the vastly different variety and preparations that the kitchen produces.Our entrees were likewise outstanding.  I had the Bluenose bass, a fish and I can't say that I've ever had before.  The preparation with coconut and pomegranate was tart and flavorful.  It was unusual, but it really worked.  Chef Sousa is a master of unusual flavor combinations that challenge your imagination.  Likewise, I never would have thought bananas and duck go so well together, but they do beautifully in Salt's duck entree.  Compared to when the restaurant first opened, the dinner portions seemed noticeably larger.  The restaurant clearly acted on the early feedback from its diners.  I was perfectly sated at the conclusion of our dinner.  We didn't have dessert on this occasion, but it wouldn't have been necessary to leave full.Service was outstanding as always.  I keep hoping to see Kevin's old waiter Jim who literally is the best waiter ever (as anyone who went to any of the Alchemy dinners knows), but our sever was very friendly, knowledgeable, and all of our food arrived quickly.  The young woman sommelier who served our wine was also equally friendly and knowledgeable about the wine.I believe that any potential criticism of Salt of the Earth has to take into account the overall vision of the restaurant.  It does not offer a conventional sit-down restaurant experience (amuse-bouches, fresh baked bread, etc.).  What it does offer are incredibly unusual and high-quality ingredients at a VERY reasonable price.  Some say that the cocktails are too expensive at $10.  For the ingredients they put in them, I think they're a steal.  The "house" cocktail at Fleur de Lys is $24.  Salt of the Earth is a modern bistro for the 21st century.  It is especially appealing to the new generation of foodies & gourmands that are huge fans of shows like Top Chef (of which I count myself one).  I remember one of Kevin's blog entries, before the restaurant opened, said he didn't want to create a "destination" restaurant.  Personally, I would love to see Kevin's version of a "destination" restaurant like Moto or Alinea in Chicago.  Heck, I'd be want to be one of the first people to invest that that venture.  Amazingly, by not setting out to make Salt of the Earth a "destination" location, Kevin Sousa created a place with such outstanding food, service, and atmosphere that Salt has itself become one of the top dining destinations in our region.(To the "DuckTales" tune):Life's smooth as a Hurricane here in Pittsburgh.Spirits, bitters, sugar cane - it's a bar blur.You might solve a mystery or rewrite history.CockTails, woo-oooo!Every night they're out there making CockTails, woo-oooo!Tales of derring-do, these ain't no mocktails.D-d-d-danger, watch behind you - there's a work week out to find you.What to do? Just grab on to some CockTails, woo-oooo!Every night they're out there making CockTails, woo-oooo!Tales of derring-do, these ain't no mocktails.Not pony tails or cotton tails but CockTails, woo-oooo!I floated out of dinner at Salt of the Earth belting "CockTails, wooo-ooooo!"...which *could* have had something to do with the six premium mixed beverages husband and I shared over dinner.  We couldn't help ourselves: once we'd sampled one we needed to taste all six, not wanting to miss one taste of the most imaginative, high-quality, and subtly nuanced beverages we've imbibed in a long, long while (I refer you to my pictures for more detailed descriptions of these beauts).  In fact, I gushed about them so much and so frequently to our server that she eventually just went ahead brought one of the mixologist geniuses behind SotE's elixirs up to our table to introduce her -- Maggie -- to her newest biggest fan -- me.  I was giddy as a school girl.  Again, I'm sure this had nothing to do with the alcohol consumed. I would have been perfectly happy if our experience ended right there, but SotE also serves food, and that had been our main impetus behind coming.  So order we did, and the food that came out of the kitchen was as exceptional as the libations, rivaling some of the best, most inventive restaurant meals I've had.  An appetizer of scallops dazzled with perfectly caramelized shellfish and a velvety uni emulsion.  Husband was taken by the snails with orrichiette, rich sweetbreads, and chicken skins fried to potato-chip-like crispness.  I wasn't as impressed with my soft shell crab entr√©e; the crab was wonderful, but the seaweed and the potato salads felt uninspired.  Husband's wild Copper River salmon was stunningly prepared, however, leaving me jealous.  And I've never met a salmon I *liked*.  The care put into the food considered, prices are surprisingly reasonable (especially coming from inflated and overpriced DC).Service -- provided by the adept Alison -- was excellent and attentive, and the pared-down, minimalist d√©cor more appealing than one would think.  I love the concepts of family-dining on the main floor, more private tables upstairs, and menus penned on enormous chalkboards rather than brought to the table.  SotE is an all-around wonderful and well-thought-out experience, a real breath of fresh air.The trip here was LONG overdue!  I felt like it was one of the restaurants in the city that I was embarrassed I hadn't been to yet.  Well, embarrassment no more, I made it it!I actually almost passed it up, as it's at the very edge of Bloomfield and the very beginning of East Liberty.  It's incredibly unassuming with the name only shown on a tiny part of the window in the corner.  Almost like they were trying to say, "are you curious about what we're doing in here?  Why don't you stop in!"The atmosphere is incredibly unique.  The downstairs portion is all communal style dining with long dining tables and chairs set up like a kings feast.  The kitchen is out in the open, like it's your own kitchen, except you have expert cooks living in your house (wouldn't that be nice?!).  I love the loft type feel of the second floor dining area that looks out onto the first floor.  Again, I felt like this was designed after someones super hip loft apartment.  I'd live here and get fed all day...no complaints!  The hostess told me that the upstairs seating is for reservations and the downstairs is for walk ins.  I like that set up because more than likely you'll always be able to snag a seat.Every ounce of this place just screams unique.  The menu is on a chalkboard on the wall...so thank gawd we were close...because I'm totally blind!  The drinks are set up by what type of liquor you'd like.  Simple idea, but very cool presentation.  Since it was approximately 120 degrees outside I opted for the refreshing sounding Punch, which had DonQ, Anejo, Benedictine, falernum, pineapple,  and angostura in it.  First sip I was taken aback because it was definitely a kick in the booty.  The next couple sips settled in nicely for a pretty delectable drink.We decided to go adventurous and order the Cockscombs app.  It was  described as the fried part of the Roosters little red hat type thingamajigger (technical term, I know).  At first thought it sounds incredibly weird...but we eat the chickens wing and leg....so why not little red part.  Total southern comfort food, with grits and greens.  It was tasty but incredibly fatty too, so it wasn't a fan fav among my table mates.  The other app, the Sashimi, was incredibly fresh with prickly pear and wasabi coating the outside.  That was the winner hands down.For the main dish I choose the Tomato-braised Eggplant with soy protein and tahini.  The Eggplant were in little cubes of light and crispy joy!  I just wish there were more because I enjoyed it so much!  The soy protein and tahini mixed well together for a perfect side.  The biggest observation I can make about this place is that the chef and owner put a lot of thought into the concept of this place.  With careful consideration you can tell the specific ingredients are put together to make a spectacular dish.  And for that, I admire them.  It's refreshing to have a place that's so inventive that it will just keep you coming back for more unique tastings.  I for one, will get my eat on here again very soon!My brother, who lives around the corner from here, refuses to admit that this is his favorite restaurant in the city. I have no such qualms. Of course, you've got to take that with a grain of salt (get it?!!) since I've only been to a few places, but Salt is easily my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant to date.While the communal tables were packed and lively on a Friday evening, we were able to sit down at the bar immediately. I would've preferred a spot watching the open kitchen, but I'll never be sad about sitting at a bar, especially one manned by such talented ladies. Both of us jumped on the bourbon cocktail of the day; with Green Chartreuse and hickory, it was a bit on the sweet side for him, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.The menu on the wall (and only on the wall, no printed copies anywhere) was appealing from top to bottom, and we went meat-heavy with our orders. We started with the steak tartare; a bit of bone marrow, cornichons and a silky quail egg punched up the quality cut, and it was flawless. However, it still paled in comparison to the crispy gnocchi, served with chunks of astonishingly tender beef cheek, all atop an unctuous layer of beef tongue. The light touch of a papaya sauce, along with a bit of the braising liquid, culminated in nothing less than culinary genius. I loved every bite, and if he wasn't my brother, I probably would've broken his face for eating almost half. Since three types of beef weren't enough for him, he also opted for the hanger steak as his main. Served with broccoli kimchi and a wild rice porridge, the beef was once again a winner. The dish was a bit soupier than anticipated, but the dark porridge was a perfect vehicle for the medium rare meat, once again tender as can be. I chose the duck. The perfectly cooked slices of breast were laid over a parsnip puree and accompanied by halusky with onion and apple, a few roasted brussel sprouts and what appeared to be even more braised duck. While it might not be an affordable entree by Pittsburgh standards, you absolutely get your money's worth with each order here. It was a MEAL, and a damn fine one.Throughout dinner, the service was excellent. Our beautiful bartenders were kind enough to keep us in cocktails (a Manhattan for me, complete with a huge, round ice cube) after we finished our initial offerings, and didn't rat me out for stealing huge pieces of steak while my brother was in the bathroom.If I had a complaint, it would be that it's gonna be a bitch to hit up the 'Burgh every time I want to eat here, but I'll be back.***Some of the dishes I had at Salt of the Earth were a little underwhelming, but there were still good things on the plate and the ribeye and salmon (with the skin on) looked very good***Salt of the Earth is a popular and relatively new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Salt of the Earth is in a great space.  There are two floors of dining areas and this combined with the high ceiling really opens up the dining room.  The downstairs dining area is very simple and comfortable, but it is also sleek and modern with a good use of blonde colored wood.  There is a great chalkboard on one wall, which lists up the menu (the menu seems to be very spontaneous with frequent changes).I really like the upstairs dining area because you get a great view of the downstairs dining area as well as the kitchen as they both cook and plate.The menu features a lot of good ingredients with several interesting flavor combinations.  I started with the octopus, which was served with white bean puree, chorizo, crisp radishes, crunchy almonds, a cilantro pesto, and oranges.  The octopus was very nicely done.  It was incredibly soft and had a very interesting texture.  The octopus almost shredded like crab or braised meat.I did not like the chef's choice for the other ingredients on the plate though.  Everything was fine, but I was just not sure if all the flavors went together that well.  The white bean puree was also a little cold.Next came pork loin with a poached egg, farro and chorizo risotto, green tomato jam, pickled okra, and mustard seeds.  Like the octopus, the cooking of the pork was very good.  The pork was very tender and had a good amount of juiciness.  Once again, I was not a huge fan of all of the garnishes, which kept this dish from from being exceptional.  I also did not like the color of the dish.  Still, the plate definitely showed the talent in the kitchen.I did happen to see their ribeye special and salmon special and both dishes looked excellent.  The skin on the salmon looked crispy and flavorful while the ribeye had a great thickness and color.  The garnishes there also looked more traditional so those two dishes might have been better representations of what the Salt of the Earth kitchen can put out.For dessert, I had zucchini bread, which came with crunchy sunflower seed brittle, rhubarb sauce, brown butter powder, and fennel ice cream.  The zucchini bread was good--nothing exceptional but good.  The brown butter powder was interesting and I really liked the fennel ice cream--good, unique flavor and very creamy.  It was not my favorite dessert, but like a lot of the dishes at Salt of the Earth, it really shows the potential of this restaurant.Service was great--very personable and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.Prices were very reasonable given the high quality ingredients used and the generous portions.Salt of the Earth shows real potential.  There were definitely elements in each course that I really liked and I think if you order right here, you could probably have a very good meal.  There is definitely good sourcing of quality ingredients, a seasonal approach, talent in the kitchen, and a contemporary approach to the menu.  All of these pluses make Salt of the Earth one to consider for an upscale but still casual dinner in Pittsburgh (while I did not love Salt of the Earth, I would definitely give them another shot if I lived in Pittsburgh).You can find metered parking on the street.Never again! The name of this restaurant is so untrue: "NOT of the earth" is more like it! After last night's meal, I feel like I was mugged while being smiled at.In short, two glasses of wine, a main course, and a split dessert set me back $61 + $12 for the tip (can't punish the waiter for the cruddy food). The entire bill was $122.In general: when I called to make a reservation, I got a lot of push back for requesting the time that I did. However, upon arrival, the place was ~25% full. What gives?the waiter, when asked for recommendations, without fail suggested the most expensive thing on the menu. From the wine to the starters to the main course. That feels like check padding to me. Our table was in the darkest, further corner of the second floor, above the kitchen. Aside from it being near impossible to see either menu without standing up or requiring binoculars, the table pulsated the entire time; I assume that this is because we were located above the exhaust fan of the kitchen. I felt like we were an after thought.My girlfriend ordered the soup. It was lukewarm upon arrival, they only gave us one spoon in spite of the fact that she had announced that she would share it, and the chestnuts in the soup were a soggy, chewy mess.Main courses. I ordered the pork. Let's just say that what arrived at the table appeared to have been cooked at approximately 4 pm, then was allowed to sit under a heat lamp in the intervening three hours. The pork belly slices were like petrified logs, chewy, hard, crusty. Not melt-in-your-mouth at all. The broccoli bits were dark, shriveled, and pathetic looking. The fried rice cakes - the highlight - were so hard, i couldn't stab them with my fork, so I had to eat them with my fingers. Classy. Finally, the blood orange/soy reduction had no tartness or sweetness, and was so salty, it burned upon contact. TOO much reducing! It was a disaster from top to bottom. Oh, and this is just my personal preference, but the crumbled pork was probably from Parma Sausage in the strip. Glad Salt buys locally, but I personally do not like the spicing mixture Parma uses, so that was a fail for me, too.My girlfriends dish, the short ribs, was much more palatable to look at, brighter, fresher, and more moist. Dessert was the "chocolate". This was the highlight of the meal, but for $9, a half a scoop of ice cream and a silver dollar of chocolate mousse seems...again, like I was being mugged! Come on guys, splurge a little! More than four bites for dessert, OK?At least they were good about refilling the water glasses, which about 98% of Pittsburgh restaurants neglect to do. The one star is for the water. Honestly, I feel like this place markets itself as so upscale, and it sure is lovely to look at. But peek under the hood and it's just a fiasco. I would like to think that this was an off night, but I don't want to get ripped off again to be proven wrong. Shame on you, Salt.Every time you move to a new city and ask about the places to go for good food, there are a few names everyone rattles off.  Salt is one of those in Pittsburgh.If this were a quasi-French restaurant I might understand the price point, but no such pomp and circumstance.  The decor I think is great for a casual dinner, and a fancier date that you don't want to feel too stuffy.  I don't care that you have your own place setting and fancy silverware-- it's at a communal table (unless you reserve upstairs).  The service was no different than anything you'd expect at Elbow Room, it's fine.My barometer for any restaurant is a simple protein.  It says a lot about how they pick ingredients, their philosophy about bringing flavor out vs. marinating, timing in the kitchen.  So I got a hangar steak. Why? No idea. This is a cut closely resembling flank, the stuff people use in fajitas and beef stir fry (read: marinade the shit out of it to make it taste good).  The dish came out looking like an art piece, but the meat was so thin it didn't retain any heat and it felt like eating the steak off the top of a fancy salad... without the salad.  To their credit, it was cooked well and I could see the idea behind it, just didn't taste good because the cut itself was lacking.  Scallops were the same story.  Good ingredients, great plating, light fluffy flavors and not too buttery.  We had two drinks a piece. I don't tend to get fancy cocktails but two Hendricks tonics and two Rieslings brought the total to $130 with tip.  Humbly two stars from me because feeling "fine" after leaving a place like that is disappointing.  Went straight to Wendy's afterwards and got some chicken nuggets.

Stopped in here to grab a Beer while I waited for my flight out of Gate B-19.  It's a medium sized bar with around 14 seats and a dining area that seats around 50 people.  It's located near the B Gates where it splits into a fork.I ordered a giant (see pics) 32 oz Stella ($10.99)....not a bad price for an Airport Bar, right?  How could I resist?  It's going to be a nice plan ride to San Diego.....ha!Will I return?  Next time I depart out of the B Gates, you know where you'll find me!FOOD: BYOF! Yes... Bring your own food to this sports bar. They only sell bags of chips and pre packaged sandwiches. So don't be the 100th person to ask the poor bartender if they serve food because they don't. And he will tell you to get food else wear and bring it back. Too bad not many choices on this side of the airport. But do what you gotta do. Then you can order alky to your liking here. INSIDE: plenty of Tvs and tables and chairs.Sports jerseys in glass cases along the walls. Sports bar lounge feel to this place. DRINKS: they have some beer on tap.STAFF: bartender was friendly and joked around with customers especially nice to hear considering he had to repeat himself so many times about where people can buy food and bring it back.

Allow me to break it down.Arrive at a boofay and pay at 8:37pm (per receipt).  After taking a seat and gathering drinks, proceed to boofay tables to commence face stuffing selections.  Notice a lot of usual items absent or severely depleted.Ask Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy at cash register what time is closing time.When he replies 9pm, but you may continue to eat until 9:30, I confirm that they will continue to replenish food items up until 9pm, otherwise I want to get refund and forget it, there's not enough time.He assures that they'll continue cooking and asks me to simply inform him of any missing items.  I do -- two main entree items that they advertise as 'signature' items.I wait around for the items they're supposed to be cooking, all the while watching as other dishes become emptied and are not refilled.  I ask about the original two, and one of these other dishes, and Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager goes in the back and comes out to tell me they aren't cooking anymore. I relay to him my previous convo with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy and say what gives?  After checking with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy in a mysterious back office location, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager informs me that it has been decided that it's not appropriate for me to receive a refund in this situation and there's nothing he can do.I remind Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager that I paid by credit card, and if I truly have not received the goods that I paid for, I'll just file a dispute with them.  He goes in the back again. (am I buying a car, here, or what?)Upon return, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager presents me with a business card, on the back of which Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has hand written a note entitling me to one (1) free adult boofay at any time of day.There were three of us in the party, and apparently Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has decided that since I'm the only one complaining then I must be the only one who deserves a free meal credit.Poor customer service has made me second guess my love of cheap ass boofays.  I guess i'll just stick with my nasty indie china boofays and avoid this WalMart of Culinary Mass Volume all together.

I have noticed that there seems to be a huge problem in classifying, identifying and experiencing Middle Eastern food properly.First off, there are huge regional differences and varieties in the food from the Middle East or the Levant. It's not all just "Arab" or "Islamic". Turkish, Afghani, Persian, Lebanese, Syrian and Moroccan all are very distinct cuisines, where the ingredients and spices they use are often a reflection of their geographic, cultural and historical reality.Turkish food is not heavy on spices but places a huge emphasis on the freshness and quality of it's ingredients, where the natural flavours are allowed to shine through. Add a little bit of Greek, Roman, medieval Venetian, Persian and some Arab influences along with a verdant Mediterranean climate and you have one of the most overlooked cuisines in the world, which hopefully will change soon.If you're not sure what to order here on a visit, for mezes, (appetizers/tapas) , try the Kirmizi biberli ezme, an extremely flavourful dish with pureed red peppers, walnut and herbs. Other uniquely Turkish dishes are the Yaprak Sarmai (stuffed vine leaves with berries) , Sucuk (spicy sausage) and the Kasar Pane (Shepherd's cheese from eastern Turkey). For mains, try the Karniyarik (meat stuffed aubergine) or Manti (ravioli pasta in a yogurt and garlic sauce).I lived in Turkey for 3 years and miss some of the dishes there terribly, but at least coming here gives me a small taste of the true thing. While Su is great overall, they don't have much in the way of desserts and wish they offered some of their home grown classics like Tavuk G√∂s√º, a chicken pudding based on "blancmange", a Medieval European pudding typically made with chicken, almonds and sugar which was a very popular sweetmeat in the medieval royal courts of Europe which the Ottomans picked up. Sounds gross, I know, but once you have it, you'll never forget it. The only place you can get it now is back in Turkey.Another wonderful dessert which is absent here is Ekmek Kadayfi (almost drenched Bread pudding), smeared with kaymak, especially the fresh kind from Afyon. The cows are fed the remaining stalks of poppy plants, making them, um... very happy, which allows them to produce the thickest, freshest clotted cream you can imagine called kaymak.I think I have to buy a ticket back to Turkey soon...

I was on my way to try Thai food from Archi's after an earlier appointment, however as I drove past the intersection of Rainbow and Sahara and looking for the name of a Japanese restaurant that I have wanted to try but somehow never did, I noticed that it has been replaced with a new Japanese restaurant and a big Grand Opening banner.  This restaurant is Sato-Ya.It is literally a family run business that has the dad working at the sushi bar, the mom and other Japanese cooks working in the kitchen and I believe the son running the front as the waiter and cashier.I decided to try their lunch combo and picked Yakiniku and Pork Cutlet and also Salmon Roll out of the available options.  A House Salad dressed in Miso dressing was quickly served (it was nice but a little too much dressing, as there were still a lot left after I was done with the greens).  The Miso Soup followed shortly and it is comforting.  After a short wait the main entree was delivered to the table, which I took pictures of, but have to quickly devour so I can be on time for my next appointment.  The Yakiniku was okay. It tastes fine, but the thin slices of beef was overcooked for my taste, but the tonkatsu was good.While I waited for my meal to be prepared I also checked out their dinner menu, which has a larger selection and also a Dinner Special section.  They also have Happy Hour from 8pm until they close at 10:30pm, which serves 1/2 items from the HH menu.The thing I was most impressed with is the fact that it is actually run by Japanese, and not Koreans, Chinese or other ethnicity, and in a subtle way you can taste the difference if you know what to look for.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with those other Japanese restaurants, but when you are looking for pure Japanese, especially with an Okinawan flavor, Sato-Ya is the place to be.Plus the service was impeccable.  The waiter checked on all the tables to make sure we were okay, and bring out whatever we ask (more water, tea, etc.) in a timely manner.  And when you pay your bill and is on your way out, he walks quickly ahead and opens the dorr for you.  Now you don't see that everyday, and certainly not at a non-Michelin Star restaurant.I will definitely be back soon to try more of their menu.  So stay tuned for the updates and the photos of the menu and the food to be uploaded after my class.4 Stars for the overall dining experience, especially on the account of the superb service.-- Review of Dinner on 9-22-10 --Leos called me about doing dinner at a new Japanese restaurant, and it turned out to be Sato-ya, where I ate lunch earlier in the day.  So we agreed to go after our class, and I can check out their other items.  We ordered off their HH & Daily Specials menu and also an Okinawa Soba Noodle (looks like udon, but tastes different, and the meat is really tender) and I thought it was good.Albacore - good and expert attention was applied.Goyo Chanpuru - Okinawan Bitter Melon sauteed with Spam and egg. Homey and I enjoyed it.Futomaki - A little different from what I have had (no spinach), but still good.Chicken Tatsuta-age - Fried marinated chicken breasts. Alright.Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna - Sushi rice that is fried so it is crispy topped with spicy tuna.  Different from your typical sushi places. Reminds us of MOS Burger items.We spoke to the owner and sushi chef "Habu" (a poisonous snake in Okinawa) and you can tell he is very passionate and an artisen in his craft.  Totally cool in my book! And he made a decorative Japanese Stork (C. Boyciana) out of 1/2 an orange! Plus showed us his avocado seed carvings!!! - again didn't know you can do that.  I eat at a lot of AYCE sushi places, but you almost never get that kind of connection with those sushi chef like we did with Chef "Habu".We will be back for more.After reading Tony T's review, I had to venture this strange westward direction, manifest destiny for good Japanese food.  I entered Sato-ya and sat at the sushi bar.  Chef Sato greeted me and explained that "ya" means house so essentially I was eating in his "home."  That sounded nice already!  The window of the restaurant has a flat screen showcasing their food (pretty cool).Inside there were specials listed.  I immediately noticed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel) and ordered it first.  Chef Sato did something Teri C. would appreciate - he carefully placed ginger and scallion on the fish with a long chopstick.  The Aji was awesome, so I next ordered shimesaba (Japanese mackerel).  The chef was surprised - an American likes mackerel this much??? ahh yes I am weird.  The saba was delicately cured, moist, and perfect, topped with a piece of kelp.  I also enjoyed agedashi tofu (good broth, crisp on outside, soft on inside, daikon and scallion) and endless hot tea as my comfort on the cool night.  Green hot tea is FREE and unlimited!  (free edamame too) Next I ordered yellowtail, and immediately noticed Chef Sato gave me belly cuts.  I thanked him and he smiled, noting that I liked fatty and oily fish so he gave me the best cut.  A regular joined me at the bar and talked about the great food.Then I had a salmon skin handroll (on special as well) complete with gobo root, bonito flake, and kaiware sprouts.  It was a bit small but less than $3.  Chef Sato blowtorched whole scallop sushi for me.  He left the abductor muscle on, so I removed it (that only seems to happen at Japanese establishments and not Korean-owned).  He topped it with yuzu pepper - a zingy heat for sure!  I finished the meal with uni, and it was succulent and fresh.  They had the Wednesday night college football game on, Chef Sato taught me some Japanese, and a couple at a nearby table just moved back to LV from Okinawa and were telling me about Japan.  Before I left, four Japanese friends sat at the bar.  The lady gave me suggestions for my honeymoon in Japan and told me Sato-ya is her favorite authentic place in town.  I can't wait to return! *Happy hour starts at 8PM****Happy Hours from 8pm-10:30pm*** **closed on Sundays** After reading Lisa L & Tony T's reviews, I decided to try this place right away... I absolutely trust their taste of food :)  I am very pleased to find this cozy place run by a nice Japanese family that I can enjoy the tasty Japanese dishes all the time.First of all, the service is fantastic!!! The servers are very attentive, always smile, and knowledgeable about the menu. Whenever, I am at this place, most of the customers are the local Japanese. They casually dine at the sushi bar and seems like they all enjoy having a conversation with a sushi chef, Sato :) They always talk quietly... I have tried.. asari miso soup(not salty at all, tasty clams were served in the soup), assorted sashimi dinner entree, all kinds of nigiris(very fresh), Japanese ceviche(if you like the taste of citrus ponzu, you will like it), crispy rice with spicy tuna(well blended taste of mayo spicy tuna & sliced jalapenos on top of crunch rice,, It's so delicious that  I always end up ordering more), spicy muscle roll(one of my favorite rolls), saba nitsuke(makerel seasoning with sake & dark soy sauce,,able to taste of sweetness & ginger,,love it!), seared tuna sashimi with salsa(the salsa was the bomb-avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber & the chef's secret sauce), nabeyaki udon(the broth was really good), the lunch box, and more. I definitely can say it is a great local Japanese restaurant that you can quietly enjoy your meal with your company or by yourself at any time of the day.I hate to be one of the only bad reviews but.... I was completely and utterly dissatisfied with my experience here tonight. First and foremost the service was great. Our server and the sushi chef were both attentive and informative. But that doesn't come close to making up for the food...We ordered two of the 14.95$ deals. They came with a Nevada Roll, Alaskan roll, white tiger roll, calamari steak, crunchy rice with spicy tuna, and baked mussels. The only thing I found edible was the white tiger roll. Everything else I couldn't even attempt to eat. The Nevada Roll was soggy and the Alaskan roll was drenched in mayonnaise. The calamari steak was so rubbery and the baked mussels weren't even warm... They too were rubbery.Like I said I hate being one of the bad reviews on here but I will never return. Not to mention I'm totally horrified I may have gotten food posioning..  I've been sick for the past hour.

Sometimes, it's hard to write a review because you have to talk about food. Right now, I am so fucking full, that I have no choice but to write this review with a full stomach, and a happy heart.My coworker suggested this place for our Work Family Dinner, and we all obliged.From the outside, it looks like your typical hole in the wall Mexican/Taco joint, but when you walk in, you are surrounded by a clean habitat for the most bomb-ass Mexican food ever.I ordered one taco (cabeza...brain for you weaklings), and one quesadilla (chicken). Both were perfect.The taco, perfectly cooked on fresh tortillas, surrounded by onions, and guac. The quesadilla was PERFECT!! Chicken that melted off the fork, and so much flavor, it was as if the chicken was born in the sauce and spices it was cooked in.Will I come back? Hell yes. Will I feel bad about it later? Probably, but who cares. YOLO. hahaha Hint...be adventurous, and not a food wuss. Don't ask for things "healthy" or say eww just because the menu items have cabeza, buche or lengua. Man up, and be the adventurous person you claim you are. Otherwise....you are a poser. And no one wants to be a poser.This was a stop on a taco trek UYE and I was glad because I always see it, but never go because Tacos El Gordo is next door. This place is pricey! I was shocked at the prices for being a fast food place with a drive-thru. The tacos are $3 each and that is before toppings. If you want cheese, avocado and sour cream it will cost you $5 per taco. The tacos tasted somewhat OK but some of my asada meat was cooked crispy and it seemed the tacos were filled with more salsa and junk then meat. It was a hot damn mess to eat. I just don't like getting ripped off when the taco doesn't even taste authentic and the tacos are overpriced. If you see the picture of my 2 tacos you will think it looks good but are you willing to pay $10 plus tax for them? After buying a drink my total was almost $14. Like I said it didn't taste bad but it wasn't anything close to Tacos El Gordo which is in the same parking lot and right next door! Just go to El Gordo trust me!This is one of my absolute favorite taco shops. I wish there was one closer to my house, although it would really effect my waistline. The tacos are huge. I highly recommend getting them fully loaded... Price usually works out to be about $5 with everything, but it's worth it. AI love the green sauce... I love to smother my taco with it. I've also tried the ceviche, and it was pretty good. I also love the corn quesadilla with carne asada. I love the ease of the drive thru.

I wish I could give them 0 stars.We made a point of visiting PBR while NASCAR was in town (March 9-11, 2012) only because of their PBR promotional flyers & website ads which read: Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.I was in charge of picking the bar to enjoy the Saturday (Nationwide) race. Out of all the sports bars (or bars for that matter) in Las Vegas, I brought our group of five to PBR because of the promotion. We planned on eating and drinking for two hours and then enjoy the free drinks an hour after the race and then take 10% off the dining portion of our bill. Unfortunately things did not go that way.I made a reservation via OpenTable for five, and when we arrived I asked for the hostess to seat us so we had a tv with a view of the race. She replied, "we have tvs everywhere, I'm sure you'll see the race." She proceeded to sit us at a booth that fit five people comfortably, yet NOT ONE TV HAD THE RACE ON - all were on college basketball. Before the hostess left I said to her, "can we change a tv to the race?" She replied, "only the manager can change the channels - I'll have him come over."The manager does not arrive, but our waitress does. She gives us menus and takes our drink order. I tell her our predicament and she replied she'd send the manager over. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we still hadn't seen the manager and were missing our sporting event. Our waitress apologized profusely and said she didn't know what more to do - she had asked the manager to come over multiple times and change the channel for us. Just to be clear, no one was watching the tv we wanted changed. Upset I was being ignored and missing the race, I got up, took my bucket of beers and walked over to a table near the bar which had a view of three tvs showing the race. Next a bus boy walks up to our table and says, "you can't sit here - that table has been assigned to someone else already. You need to visit the hostess to get a table." I replied to him, "No, I am sitting here because I asked to be seated in an area with the race and was not, and your manager is too busy to come and change a damn channel for us - so I am sitting here." Of course he didn't like my answer and went to the hostess. Now the hostess comes to our table and says, "you can't sit here I have this table booked for another party." Not only did I repeat my comment, but my husband was even louder. She turned and walked away.Our first waitress came over to our table and introduced us to our new waiter. In front of us she explained our predicament and told us the bucket of beer would be moved over to a new ticket and apologized she couldn't get the manager to change a channel for us. We told her it wasn't her fault and we would be happy now that we could see the race. She was not upset and our new waiter was happy to serve us. We thought all was on the right track.Well, we won our bet on the race (YEAH!) but as soon as they waved the checkered flag we asked for our free drinks per the promotion. Our waiter told us the only beer selections were Bud or Bud Light. We don't drink Bud or Bud Light - so we had a well drink. It was healthy and we were happy. As soon as we finished the first drink was asked for a second. Again, we figured since the promotion was an open bar for one hour - the service would be slow and we would get at most three free drinks. Well get this: upon ordering our second well drink our waiter tells us, "oh, it's just ONE free drink." And I said, "WHAT?!"Again, promotion read:  Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, ***as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.*** Where does that say ONE DRINK? BULLSH*T!At that point I ask for the check because I was through with crappy establishment. And when I asked for the bill I reminded them of the 10% dining discount. This time our waiter said, "Oh, that discount is if you don't get a free drink - it's either one or the other." My husband came unglued! I think I cursed. Our waiter said, "Let me check though, you are my first customers asking for the discount."'Fuming, I sat at the table thinking about all the other bars we could've enjoyed the race as well as spent our out of town dollar...the food was barely average (I had a salad and my husband had a burger) and the service was horrible from the hostess & manager (waitstaff worked very hard). Our waiter returned and said, "Sorry, I was wrong, you do get 10% off your dining portion" as we all made some sort of comment about actually doing what your promotion says.I am also going to review this horrible establishment on OpenTable too. Seriously people - this place sucked. STAY AWAY!I have never had the urge to eat here but my friends didn't want to wait in line for food, so we ended up here because they had no wait. It is good as a bar environment, if you want a bustling atmosphere where you can cheer for your favorite sports team, watch some people attempt to ride the mechanical bull, get drunk and eat a bit of appetizers. Don't come here if you are looking forward to a super appetizing meal. It is essentially just bar food that is served. I ate the Chili Cheese Taters and the PBR Burger. The food is heavy and there is nothing special about it. Most of our stomachs felt unsettled after eating here. Additionally, our waitress was grumpy and didn't do much to ensure we were having a good experience. I would rather eat elsewhere but if I were into sports I would probably go back for drinks during a game.There is no guarantee of tomorrow. It is so important to make the most of each day and night. My dear friend Christie and I made the most of last Friday night when we met her lifelong friends at PBR Rock Bar.   From a local's perspective, driving to PBR Rock Bar is a nightmare. It is not like the Voodoo Lounge or Level 107 Lounge where you pull in from a 4-lane arterial into a well designed parking garage. The local has to maneuver through the mayham of the Strip area traffic. The worst part is maneuvering through the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile parking garage. It is a poorly designed parking lot without notice that the motorist is driving the wrong way. Once the local finds the parking spot, it is a walk through the corridors of Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood to reach PBR Rock Bar where the mall touches the Las Vegas Strip. Now, If your vacationing on the Strip, PBR Bar is a short walk off the sidewalk.  PBR Rock Bar is really two different bars under one business. You have the indoor bar and nightclub overlooking the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlooking the mid Strip. This is where the high energy is. When you look up you could see the Cosmopolitan tower, when you look straight you see a Las Vegas Strip bordered by Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan. In the near distance the intermittent Bellagio Fountains dance and the Eiffel Tower stands tall. In the near distance, the sidewalks are prime people watching. Looking into the bar, there stands the mechanical bull. The mechanical bull is really a symbol of their business practice. They really take the customer for a ride by charging different prices for the exact beverage. That is bull!  In hindsight I regret not riding the mechanical bull. I think it would of been a lot of fun. In reality, my eyes and attention were on my company. The volume of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one another. Christie and I started out in the indoor bar. When you arrive from the Planet Hollywood parking garage, you enter through the indoor bar. From this angle, the outdoor patio is camouflaged by a wall and dim interior. After Christie's friends called her we'd find our way to the outdoor patio. This is where we'd spend around 3 hours of our lives.    There is an admission price for guys. Even guys who drink girl drinks :-). The admission is $10. But it includes a drink. For the Las Vegas Strip this is a decent deal. The average drink on the Las Vegas Strip is $12. And if I'm not mistaken, a 22 ounce beer upstairs in Twin Peaks is $10. Once your in the bar, a click on the Yelp application illuminates the buy one get one free drink check-in. The average drink is around $12. By the conclusion of the 3 drinks, people ought to be up in Space Mountain-a state of a nice relaxing buzz.    By the time I drank the three drinks, I was up in Space Mountain enjoying a nice relaxing buzz. I enjoyed two Blue Hawaiins and a Bahamas Mama. Supposedly they are girl drinks. But I got to be a man and tell the truth. They were delicious but nothing spectacular. The bartenders didn't even bother to add a maraschino cherry. They came in a plastic cup. They were a delicious route to get to Space Mountain. They taste like fruit punch with alcohol. Now high up in Space Mountain,  I thought I was being funny and managed to drink Christie's Whiskey Neat. I am no connoisseur on whiskey, but it was decent and put me to the summit of Space Mountain. When I brought Christie, a replacement Whiskey Neat I was incognizent to the idea that the bartender charged different prices for the exact drink. I'd end the night with the least expensive beer. It was PBR. Although I was in no state to keep track of the price, I think it was $5.  Now back to Earth and off Space Mountain,  when I reflect on PBR Rock Bar, I see 3 stars. I dislike the inconsistency in price. However, there is a high energy level to the place. Its setting on the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of the Cosmopolitan Tower and in the sightlines of The Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower is high energy. $25 for a nice buzz is a good deal. Most of all I enjoy the memories of spending three hours here with my friend and her friends.After coming in last year and having a good time to stopping in again and having the worst service ever I've gotta change my rating. Seriously. Service was really bad. The server repeatedly forgot drinks we had ordered and then would disappear for what seemed like forever. The worst thing was, my food sucked. I ended up scarfing down some of my friends BBQ chicken pizza because my buffalo chicken pizza, that sounded so good, in reality was not. It just tasted hot. Like burn my mouth hot. But no buffalo flavor. Does that make sense? It just wasn't good. I'd probably still buy the cheap drinks at their bar or counter in PH, but i wouldn't come and eat again. Stick to the drinks! Don't tell me I didn't warn you!Fun & loud place filled with lots of interesting people...This place has a great design to it and a fun menu with really delicious creamy deviled eggs, mac & cheese coated with Doritos (wrong in all the right ways), fried pickles, decadent nachos, great spinach & artichoke dip and so many more fun plates! We came here as a large group and it was perfect for sharing a bunch of appetizers and delicious cocktails! They have cocktail bowls here that are massive and will f@$k you up! The Caribbean sunset one was my favorite, Malibu coconut rum, Bacardi and orange & pineapple juice! A tropical paradise in a cup or bowl...If you want a loud spot with Rock & Roll blaring this is it! Bull riding anyone? This place has you covered. One cocktail bowl and you'll find yourself in Urban Cowboy! I love that movie...The PBR Rockbar was the neutral meeting spot for my party. I checked-in here with Yelp so I got the buy one drink get one free deal, that was cool; but the drink I ordered had pineapple juice in it, and I believe it was bad or the cup wasn't clean I don't know which but I swear the drink tasted like ice cold vomit. When we took the drink back to the bartender all she said was oh no the pineapple juice is good, smh it was soooo disgusting.  Where in the hell was John Taffer when I needed him!?!?! I can't believe I even tried to force myself to drink that sh!t. She took our drinks and threw  them out and said if we wanted new drinks we had to pay again,yeah right. Fxck these drinks. The first drink was just ok, and the second round tasted like vomit, umm pass. Probably would have tasted better if I was already drunk, but vomit flavored is very hard to ignore. There were some guys there playing beer pong, and they had the ball flying all over the damn place. A few times the ball was on the floor in the corner where the "VIP" couch and main window/wall is, if you look on the ground and see the filth build-up smh, I was thinking these MF'ers are gonna have Hepatitis A by the end of the night. Beer or alcohol doesn't kill everything, but good luck guys! What I was really surprised about was the music though. With the name of it being PBR Rockbar I expected to hear mostly Country or Rock, but they had a mix of Hip-Hop playing, old Hip-Hop but still. Anyway this wasn't a great experience for me and I don't feel like this is my type of bar anyway, so more than likely I would personally not come back here to spend money.

Pay attention.So the Mrs. placed an online order. The process was easy. Instead of delivery, we decided to have it picked up. Called into the location and told them I wanted to come in myself. After giving me and my wifes name the order was found, ( wow not organized at all ) . "Yes you can pick it up." Mind you, the new order total at the time with delivery charge is $19 and some change. 1830 I showed up to pick up. What do you know, couldn't find me again, so I looked up the confirmation. Yup there I am, and guess what, the driver is on his way to deliver the order.WOW REALLY?!!So I waited for him to come back. "It's Sunday, so stay calm Mikey." So the driver comes back and I'm shown my ordered pizzas. Ok they're good. Time to pay.  $32 and some change is the total. !!!!!WHAAAT!!!!? Ok explain. "Well the previous total was for delivery only. Since it was changed to pick up, the deal does not apply." GEEEZ!! RAAAAGE!!! PEE OWED!! is whats going on inside of me, but in the outside, "So then thats it?" Yup pretty much. All I got was a "I'm sorry that happened." When all they had to do was honor it. You couldn't find the order, you had me wait for your driver, and you upcharge me for coming myself to pick it up?!! REALLY!!!?? .. You know what, I'll cook. There's a reason why your customers are not happy or satisfied with you guys. Check the reviews. Pay a freakin attention. Waste of time. There's a Domino's down the street, or even Rossotis. It's bad enough I saw one of your cooks dropping food in the back kitchen area. Yes, the one with the bangs hanging from the front of his hat. Dropped a chicken wing while putting it in the order basket. Ask him what he did with it. Sorry I can not give 0 stars. They deserve it.

Poor Brgr! I went here about a week after I went to the new Wingharts burger joint down in Market Square. I think Brgr would have held up in the bigger better burger contest if I had tried this burger first. Since it was after Wingharts KILLER char-grilled burger deliciousness, it's sadly going to get a much lower rating. Don't get me wrong, the shroomz burger at brgr (I had to...) was tasty, but it just doesn't hold a pickle to this other burger. And by pickle, I mean the tiny little gherkin they perch on the top of Brgr's burgers. The thing I will rave about was the boozy milkshakes. I wish it was humanly possible to slurp down 5 of these like you can any other delicious cocktail, but really, that's not humanly possible without feeling like you're going to die. I got the boozy Almond milkshake, which had Ameretto and Kahlua mixed in with ice cream. To top that off, there was sugary almond treats at the bottom. My heaven would include these milkshakes being served at the pearly gates entrance! The service initially was so so. I had called earlier in the day to try and reserve a table for our party of 15. The person on the phone was a little pissy and told me they don't take reservations. I said, well I just want to let you know then that we have this large party coming in. He said, and I quote, that they only had 70 seats, with some being couches and two tops. Those 15 seats would take up most of their seating. I'm no mathematician, but really dude?! Do they not understand that we'll be spending a lot of money, especially with the part of the crew that likes to overindulge on the booze. So we get there and the hostess, and what I assume are the manager, are just walking back and forth around an L shaped area of seats and a longer set of seats. I went up to them and was like....we'll squish, just put that long set of tables together. I worked at a restaurant for 5 years, I picked a thing or two up I suppose. After that, service was just fine! I would totally go to Brgr again and space out my boozy milkshake intake after a meal, but I'm not sure I would come back JUST for a Burger. So for Brgr I say no burger but a round of boozy milkshakes for ALL!!The burgers are outstanding but, the customer service could be better. My wife, daughter and I decided to give this place a try. I must say I really dig the decor. It is very manly with lots of TVs on the walls, nice shades of blue and grey. Two huge all glass garage doors that open to let the warm weather in. There is a decent size bar area also, There is even a outdoor level on the second floor. We were seated promptly and handed menus. We order our drinks. My wife and I got Cokes and our daughter got a chocolate milk. When our drinks came my daughter tasted her milk and said it tasted funny. My wife smelled and tasted it. It was spoiled! I'm glad I didn't get a milkshake if they are using spoiled milk! We flagged down the waitress and told her that our daughter's milk was spoiled. She apologized and said she tasted it before she brought it out. You tasted my daughter's chocolate milk?! Are you going to taste our burgers too? I knew she was full of it because if she did taste it she would have know it was spoiled! She replaced it with a Coke and all was well. We already knew what we wanted as we looked at the menu already online but, the burgers we wanted weren't on the menu. Maybe they change ever so often. They do offer kids meals. Don't ask me why they are not listed on the menu. For kids meals they offer a cheeseburger, grill cheese or hot dog which includes fries and a drink. My daughter got the cheeseburger and loved it. I believe the kids burger is the same size as a adult burger as she could only finish half of it. My wife got the "Cease & Desist" which consists of a burger with American cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 island dressing. Pretty much their version of a Big Mac. I had the "Button Buster" which consists of a burger topped with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar cheese, b√©arnaise aioli and crispy onion rings. It was outstanding! I especially liked the bun as it was coated with butter and then lightly toasted. My wife and I shared a order of BRGR Fries tossed with parmesan and herbs and topped with cheese whiz. They were really good as well. Our waitress came over with drink refills without being asked I might add (which always gets you a few extra bucks in your tip from me), as we were eating to tell us that her shift was over at BrGr and she was going over next door to Spoon to start her shift there. And that we would be taken care of by her replacement. We sat waiting for a good ten to fifteen minutes for our check and a doggy bag. My wife flagged down a waitress would then got our replacement waitress to bring our check. Other then our daughter's spoiled milk and taking forever to get our check we really liked BrGr and would have given it 5 stars. We will defiantly be back!We had a catered event by BRGR in the top deck of the restaurant this week and I have to say it was really nice! The deck is pretty and has a nice view of the church and city. They had a variety of half burgers from the menu available. Because they were half burgers you have the opportunity to try a few different burgers. They also served their special crack dip ( it's a chili-esque, thin dip) served with tortillas. My favorite part was the potato salad. It's filled with fresh dill, and absolutely delish!The only improvement I would suggest is that they don't have capabilites to have a full bar upstairs. Soooo, they had to climb up and down the stairs to get drinks and it took forever....

My wife and I stopped in to try some beers on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. We waited probably 10-15 minutes for a small high-top table next to the packed bar. We both ordered a couple beers which were OK but not great.Our server asked what we'd like to order and we told her we just wanted to try a couple beers, we'd already had something to eat earlier. She responded saying she'd "have to ask us to leave" because they only allow people who are ordering food at the tables. Being that the bar was packed and there was a perimeter of 2-3 people standing around it, that didn't really seem like such a great suggestion to a paying customer. I seriously couldn't believe I'd just been told to leave the establishment because I wasn't ordering food. That was a 1st for me and the last time I'll ever visit or purchase anything from that brewery. Luckily none of their beers are that great anyway...

My favorite reviews are those where people actually name the food they ordered , that makes me happy and helps me when looking at the menu. Yelp reviews swirl through my mind and a lot of the time I order based off of  Yelper's reviews whom I trust have similar taste and expectation to my own.Orient House  has two styles to offer, the Americanized and the more traditional. I tried both. I had the chicken and snap peas, and for dessert the red bean paste bun. You get a lot for the price. I thought my entree was great, the sauce was light and the peas crunchy not overcooked. They gave 10 red bean paste buns! That's a lot! Also, I ordered delivery at 9:45pm from their online ordering on their website, and Yelp says they close at 10pm.... They delivered to me by about 10:30pm, so one can order all the way up to closing. My new delivery spot when I don't want to spend too much.

Note to self: next time I go to a place called a "sandwich shop," maybe I should order a sandwich?!Actually, my "Naked Chop" aka a chopped salad with turkey, greens, carrot, tomato, onion, and avocado wan't bad... it didn't blow me away either.  And it took awhile to make!  I was with Misti Y and we came here straight from the airport.  I must've worked up quite an appetite flying in from LA, because I was pretty hungry when we arrived... but I felt like a salad, so that's what I ordered.  It just wasn't the most filling salad around.  Hence, my "note to self" above...I'd give this place another shot and I suggest you do if you're in the hood, but take my advice - order a sandwich, not a salad!I was very excited to hear that one of my favorite sandwich shops was opening a Pizza joint.  So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!The restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.The Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.The second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.The third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.The last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.Moondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)Will I return?  You bet your Naked Heiney I will!!! I want to try some of the other Pies and definitely the other Subs that they don't have at their Sandwich Shop.I love the Naked City Sandwich Shop on Las Vegas Blvd, but we went there last weekend and discovered it was closed and had now "merged" with the pizza place inside of Moondoggies.We went there today and placed an order for 1 sandwich and a 1/4 sheet pizza at 11:15.  25 minutes later, my husband went up to ask if we could have the sandwich out first if the pizza was taking a while to cook.  The only lady working in the kitchen replied, "I'm trying to get it all together."  20 minutes later, we still had no food.  We waited 45 MINUTES for a sandwich and a mini pizza.  Ended up just leaving because we were so hungry and frustrated, and the lady ran after us into the parking lot.The loooonnggg wait time, not to mention the fact that it's now inside a dirty, dark bar with people getting plastered at 11:15 in the morning makes me not recommend this place.  Sorry, Naked City...you have fallen from my good graces."I didn't know it was a take and bake pizza." I took a bite of the crust as I love a good crust and that bite was really yeasty/doughy. I looked at the dough where I bit and was still translucent so therefore still raw. I grabbed from the other side of the pizza my 2nd slice, without crust. That was cooked, but still needed to be baked for a better consistency. I looked carefully at the pizza and the dough was rolled unevenly so the sloppy base made for the uneven cook. Like Angela stated about the sauce- she had a slice with no sauce and I had a slice that I could see the sauce present without digging for it. Shouldn't have to re-bake or watch each bite for raw spots when Angela H and I were plenty happy to wait 20 minutes to get a 'za but could wait longer if it meant not rushing to get it done. I looked at the crust on peoples pictures and can see those are brown and toppings like pepperoni are crisping at the edges. Just so people don't think I'm just looking for something to hate (though my review pattern is rarely negative) please look at the pictures. I posted a piece of pizza with all the toppings off so you can see the crust thickness change and the pale pizza crust and bottom. I'm sure some people will say "it's just a bad day" but uneven pizza dough and sauce is careless and seeing the crust isn't even brown but choosing to box it up anyways isn't the pride and quality control I'd expect from a raved about place. Yes, I cook some shit wrong, made a new recipe and it sucked- not for lack of care but inexperience. I've cooked certain things over and over (like you do at a restaurant) and can keep a decent standard on such items because I baby it and won't serve what isn't at least cooked well.  It LOOKED good, SMELLED good on the drive back home, the toppings were quality, but if you don't have the dough down right, cooked right then it isn't a fucking pizza. Might as well put those toppings on some sandwich rolls so I can enjoy the nicely spice-y sausage bits, red pepper, olives and pepperoni. Grease doesn't bother me too much, but just a note there was a good amount of it to dab off. $17 for a large and the only consolation I suppose is the groupon. Also we got cheese bread which gives me visions of dough bits with cheese. We got a sandwich roll stuffed with some cheese, mostly spinach and chopped garlic. I'd be cool with a spinach sandwich but it needed more seasonings other than the garlic so it was just A-OK. The settings really don't help. Neither of us was aware of what Moondoggies was about and partly wasn't sure if we have the right place without any pizza indicators on the outside. Odd that there isn't even a little sign... Alright, odd that it's in a bar, but I can dig it like how some  PTs have Robertos tacos attached. It's not quite separate but connected to the bar situation, but just a window on the wall of the bar where you can order.  It was just an odd vibe for two ladies to walk into a bar full of men with a few stopping to look at what we were doing. Odd vibes and no real seating aside from the bar or pool table, we hightailed our plans of staying in and took it to-go. Takes a lot to make two loud, social with all kinds of people kind of bitches want to just go home instead of stay in a environment. It wouldn't have been a place we could have comfortable conversation. I don't get the hype. I don't know about second chances with this one.Groupons FTW! I'll make this clear right now. I have not tried their pizza. I was there specifically for the Poutine.After zip lining down Fremont Street, we decided to hit up Naked City to use up my $20 Groupon. That got us a large Poutine ($5), 20 Hot Chicken Wings ($13), and a slice of cheese pizza ($2). The pizza slice was for my friend. I had no interest in trying it.So how was the Poutine? I can't compare to the Poutine I've had in Toronto because it's been a couple of years. For sure, it was Freakin' Huge. That's actually the size designation - Freakin' Huge (not "large" as I stated earlier). I'm not really sure if they use cheese curds, but it was yummy and gooey, albeit slightly salty after a while. It's definitely something you could share with a few people.The Chicken Wings were also good. It's not hard to make good wings, but I suppose it's not hard to mess them up either. My cousin said she really enjoyed them, but she admitted that she's been craving wings recently. I give them the thumbs up. They were pretty large too.Moon Doggies is not really a place I'm in a hurry to revisit, but if I'm ever craving Poutine again, I know where to go.Groupon alert!As a Groupon addict, I'm always excited when they offer one for a place I've been dying to try. We decided to order a pizza for takeout, since we were feeling pretty lazy after an exhausting weekend of doing nothing. I decided on a Not so Wee Royal and a Wee garlic fries. I was tempted by the Poutine, but I'm just not a big fan of gravy and cheese. I ordered the pizza on the well-done side based on some previous reviews about the pizza being under or unevenly cooked. When I got the pizza home, I was excited to take a bite. I didn't find any of the crust or dough issues that previous reviewers had mentioned luckily, so I was happy about that. I adored the texture. It was chewy and I really enjoyed the sauce. The added touch of ricotto was delightful and added a sweet flavor to accompany the savory. I was very happy with this pizza. My fella, on the other hand, wasn't as impressed. He stuck mainly with the garlic fries, which were much more garlicky than I would like. If only they used real garlic instead of garlic salt and I would've been sold!All in all, I was very happy with my meal here. I have a feeling I won't be eating here too often, unless I go with a friend. Hehe.I look forward to trying more menu items here sometime soon.I have to remind myself that this is bar and I am rating bar food. So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them.This menu is a fat kid's dream come true!!!!!!  Just look at some of the combos and toppings they got on these pizzas!!  This comes pretty close to last meal/end of the world type food for me.  If you have a "cheat day" on your schedule, you might want to make it a "cheat week" after ingesting all these glorious calories, saturated fat and cholesterol at one sitting.  We ordered a full Royal sandwich and the wee (smallest) Guinea pie which is really not wee at all could feed 3 Japanese people for lunch alone.  I now know why The Royal was rated one of the best sandwiches in Vegas last year by LV Weekly.  I loved how they just made the Italian sausage into one huge patty layered with all this cappicola and mozzarella.  A total flavor explosion!  The Guinea pie was equally as awesome with meatballs, spinach and cheese, cheese, cheese.  I really liked the thick crust.  We had no shot at finishing everything but they made for some great leftovers the next day.  Tons of other menu items I look forward to having like "The Stinger" which features chicken fingers, steak, three cheeses, hot & sweet peppers, blue cheese and lettuce in one sandwich!!  What??????  That's Man vs Food type shiznit right there!I also dug all the rock music they played in the bar.  Service was very friendly too.  This is also a Buffalo Bills bar so be warned.I don't really understand the great ratings for this place, I'm hoping I caught them on a bad night.I'll be brief.The pizza was nothing special and the service was God awful.  The people watching was great, if watching a couple dry hump is your thing.  Most of the bar patrons were DEEEEEEEE runk.  Note that I had been drinking and was pretty far from sober myself.I'll be back in the area to eat next door at Desnudo Tacos, but doubt I'll eat here again.  That is all.EPIC pizza hidden inside Moon Doggies off Arville And Desert Inn. Pizza Aficionados welcome, and bring an appetite. I nominate the Guinea Pie for best white pizza of the year. ''Please cast your vote by clicking the cool icon''. The Pizza here is made from scratch down to the meatballs, and the quality is noticeable. Due to this added quality assurance protocol and time honored method of ''Freshly prepared,'' you may have to wait for your food. Be prepared for a lengthy wait, though it is well worth it. Prices also reflect quality, but again the increase is worth it, and I will say a mediocre increase considering the taste and quality are exceptional.  Here you order your pizza by the sheet. 1/4 of a sheet was more then enough to feed 2 friends and myself, and half a sheet should keep your fridge well stocked with delicious cold pizza leftovers. A whole sheet? I dare not order it. That's cold pizza for a week! Think of it as the birthday party pizza. Suicide Fries = HOT FRIES. I like hot, and the sauce on these should not disappoint unless you inhale Ghost peppers by the handful, then you sir are the exception. The added plus of being located in a bar is the drinking options. You have plenty of beer and hard liquor choices to cover all bases. Enjoy your epic pizza!

Review Text :
There are a remarkable number of indie coffeehouses in Cave Creek/Carefree for such a small area, but Janey's is hands down my absolute favorite. The coffee is superb - beans are supplied by The Roastery of Cave Creek - and always hand-crafted perfectly to your specifications. The food is delish, always fresh and made when you order, not before. They have a lovely, well-edited wine selection, including a Riesling I was pleasantly surprised to also see offered at Zinc Bistro, and some great beer on tap. Stop by Thursday nights for local music, or weekend mornings to enjoy chats with the locals around the outdoor fire (in the winter, of course!).It is important to me to spend my money in locally-owned, family-operated business whenever possible, and that's another reason why I love this place. It is truly a family labor of love - all of them work here, and you'll see them all circle through if you sit there long enough. You're apt to be there all day if you sink into one of the overstuffed leather armchairs... Free wifi so you can work if you're so inclined.The highlight of Janey's, other than the great coffee, food and bar, are their two affable Afghan hounds, Moses and Ghandi. While some people come by just to play with the dogs, I suggest you at least enjoy a cup of coffee while you do so : ) Bring your own pooch too - Janey's patio is a great doggy hangout!Yoga Breeze was doing a full moon yoga session on the patio in warmer weather, and hopefully that will resume when this Arctic freeze we're experiencing ends.And by the way, if you can't handle a little dust on your car a la the dude from Glendale below, you probably shouldn't be coming to Cave Creek. But I think if dirt parking lots don't bother the owners of the multi-million dollar homes in town with vehicles to match, you could probably let it slide, too. If not, there's a $5 car wash up the road.

Review Text :
It all started with The Drunken Monkey which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. Hands down the best milkshake I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's Malted Banana Gelato, Peanut Butter Crisps, Frangelico and priced at $11. Whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. Genius. It is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by the booze. On to the grub. Starters: Philly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls with udder sauce $11 They were alright, but could have used more seasoning. The meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. I did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. For the beef and fake beef selections we had: The Classic with Two Dollar Cheddar (ridiculous) $15 Urth Burger with One Dollar Swiss $14 New Delhi Chicken $14 All served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. I ordered Ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the Monkey Shake. As far as the burgers go my burger was ordered Medium and came to me very well done. I ate one third of it. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. The veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. Pretty good. The Chicken burger could have been executed better. The chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. Overall I will absolutely be back because The Cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. The menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as Bull's Balls, Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Duck Confit Street Tacos. I will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!Gonna start with desert.The adult shakes are incredible espicaly the orange creamsicle (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a root beer float with pop rocks and rum).  The food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new American fusion.  You are rewarded for being adventurous.  The "Street Tacos" are made from duck confit, foie gras cranberry relish.  They are incredible.  Other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. The crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  Served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.Meat in a tube is well represented.  Try the Greek touri.  Different but very flavorful.Finally, the burgers.  Although I'm still partial to the Burger Bar, Holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  Cooked perfectly to order.  The "Rising Sun" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.Service is fast and efficient.One final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the Strip.Passion. Many of the earth walkers lack this. Many proclaim to have it. They're just lying to themselves. Being a die hard Rage Against the Machine fan isn't passion. That's just plain old shitty taste in music. I, on the other money clenching hand, have passion. In fact, I have many of them. The Filet O Fish passion being the strongest and most lucrative. Another of them is, that I am/was chomping at the bit to turn Osama Bin Laden's head into a canoe. That one can be let go of...maybe. Another (the list goes on and on), and probably more important, cheeseburgers. Warmly situated in The Cosmopolitan, where I can be my usual mogul self and drop $17 for a burger and cutesy mini bucket of steak fries, enjoy them, and not be hounded for autographs and paparazzi. I have grown tired of putting my sharpie to bare supple breasts and cheeks of the buttocks of attractive, but morally questionable women. I don't quite remember which burger I ordered, but I do recall letting out a, "Mmmm-mmm, that is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?" Blame the torrential down pour of Goose and Tonics from the the previous night for my lack of memory. However this review is more than fuckin' helpful. The duck fat fries are no longer on the menu. So you novelty food seeking bastards are in for a rude surprise. See, bishes....helpful. Suck on it. The kimchi quesadilla is good and spicy, but you might be hard pressed to find it worth the $14. Not me, I just refinanced my 1995 Maserati. So I'm good with the loot.Excuse me, I have to go water my passion(s).Rule No. 1:  Don't piss me off before I even get seated.Rule No. 2:  Refer to Rule No. 1Fresh from a Cosmopolitan Event at the Yard, their fourth floor pool, with ThreeKindsOfRumAndMangoPuree powerhouse drink in hand, my husband and I descended from up above for a burger at Holstein's.  Having attended a lot of beautiful, upscale, free functions at the Cosmopolitan, making it my favorite casino hotel, it was time to give back and actually patronize and pay for a meal there. Now I've traveled a good part of the world and most of the United States, and almost always have something drinkable in my hand, usually a Starbucks cup but, in a casino it's more likely a glass of wine after I've been gambling for a while.  Never, ever, ANYWHERE, have I been told that I can't bring an outside drink in.  This forced me either to leave the drink or chug-a-lug it.  Guess what I did?  But I wasn't happy.  The manager, when asked about their policy, was completely lame.  "We don't want anyone to get drunk."  Duh, is that why they have a full bar, complete with multiple flat screen TVs showing all manner of sports programs???  Bad beginning.  But I have to tell you that my burger - the California Turkey burger - may have been the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Moist.  Perfectly seasoned.  On a bun that was dense, so it didn't turn to mush like at all the other burger joints.  With all the other good stuff, too:  guacamole, pepper jack cheese, a huge tomato slice that was actually red and ripe, and a bit of slaw.  The steak fries were crisp, hot, and stayed hot, probably due to the little metal pail they're served in.My husband had Brisket Burger, a beef burger with a topping of juicy brisket in barbecue sauce.   He loved it.  He also loved his sweet potato fries, which were presented as one of the four potato options to accompany the burger.  But he wasn't told that there was a two-buck upcharge for them, which is a no-no in my book.We didn't try the shakes, because we were too full from all the drinks and chips we stuffed ourselves with upstairs, but they look great.  Our waitress was efficient, but not all that friendly, until she delivered the check.  Then it was all smiles and profuse thanks.  And we did appreciate the 15% discount for locals, though I'm not sure if it's a regular policy or because we bitched about the drinks.Given the quality of the food, we'll definitely go back.  Hmmm, if I pour my drink into a Starbucks cup, I wonder...It's almost hard to believe that Holstein's is run by the same people responsible for LBS at the Red Rock. I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.What that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.The Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).My wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.Each burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.Our son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.Even after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.Despite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. I'm not sure if I'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.Hands down the best burger place in town. I am writing this review after the 2nd time coming here...forgive me...I am a very busy person with 2 crazy monkeys to raise...Yelp kinda takes a back seat. I was lucky enough to come here a second time with my BESTEST FOODIE FRIEND, Rob M. (LL Cool Mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (I told you I was a busy girl). It wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. On our way back to our table I spotted the server we had last time...The lovely NOELLE. Noelle is what every server should aspire to be. She is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. If you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). We had the most amazing food:-New Belgium Hoptober beer-Lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a MUST...you will be licking the plate clean)-Mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a wild mushroom demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)-The Gold Standard burger (what they are famous for...I can see why)-The Drunken Monkey adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. They loved it)-Maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow I died and went to heaven).Now the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. Good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. I appreciated the wait time in between courses so I could digest and really enjoy all my food. If you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. Also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. You are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. If you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. I will be back soon and hopefully Miss Noelle will be our girl again.Came here on a Saturday night about 9 ish with 2 friends. We couldn't find any place to eat without a long wait or prior reservations, so we popped a squat in the lounge area. A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.We ordered simple little meals as follows:Red Stripe - $7Dragon Fruit Drink - $10Black and White Shake - $8Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9Truffle Lobster $16.50Pizza Twinkies $12Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack. I tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.The colorful graffiti art is a little in-your-face & is so trendy, it'll be out of style by the time I post this review, but it fits just right into The Cosmopolitan. Glamourous-sounding burgers, shakes with a shot of alkie (because last night's bender was not enough) & fashionable items like pork belly & lobster rolls...it's so been there, done that. The menu is so unapologetically predictable but I can't say I'm disappointed. Our meal before flying home consisted of:-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating.-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy! -- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right. -- 'tiny buns' Maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. Loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns. -- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): I wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, I couldn't do it. Yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: BF prefers chairman bao.) Four stars because I love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because I want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu. Like I said, predictably trendy, but it's got me interested.Out of all the places we experienced this trip to Vegas, this was by far the most memorable, happy and delicious dining experience we had!    Let me just say I'm a huge Top Chef fan.  Also a huge Yelper.  So I had done a lot of research before our trip to Vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  Having been a fan of Carlos on Top Chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), I really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.   So, early on a Monday night, we stepped into Holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  Waitress was quick and friendly.  Service could not have been better.  We were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...I ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but I knew I could count on Husband for that and he did indeed order the Birthday cake one).  Having eaten at Wicked Spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger.      THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER* / 16.5BEEF PATTY CRUSTED WITH BLACK PEPPER, HOLSTEINS CREAMY STEAK SAUCE, MARMALADE ONIONS, TOMATO CONFIT, WILD MUSHROOMS, SWISS CHEESE.    I asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as I don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  He chose shoestring fries for the side.     I asked the waitress if the "Top Chef" happened to be there on a Monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  She said she didn't know but would check.  Next thing I know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  What a delightful friendly guy!  AND he informed us that he had hired Craig from the same Top Chef series.  Yep.  A little while later Carlos came out with Craig!  Husband took my picture with both of them!  Oh my gosh, I'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and I so respected them and appreciated them for it.  And now I was not only meeting them but eating their food!  This burger was the best burger I've ever had (sorry Bobby Flay, you've finally been surpassed).  And fortunately Husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of the burger so I got it.  (waitress later told us that it had FIVE scoops of ice cream in it).    So, full, dessert was mentioned.  I said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  No they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  I expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  Next thing I know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and BACON.  YUM YUM YUM.    THANK YOU Holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to Vegas!  Excellent waitress (sorry I can't remember your name), thank you too and Carlos and Craig, please know you MADE our trip to Vegas this time!We dropped into this Las Vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean "Bull"Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.My friend told me this place was yummy. IT WAS NOT YUMMY!Sunday before checkout and we decided to eat here. It was filled with testosterone filled men watching football and yelling at the tv. Not my idea of dining out. Lobster Mac & Cheese was not good. I could've made it better. The macaronis were tiny little noodles. Chef boyardee style noodles. Not enough lobster and def not enough cheese.Fried pickles were exactly what it was. Not a fan.Calamari was actually tasty. Not the traditional with sauce on the side. It was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalape√±os!The gold standard burger was ok. Supposedly the best burger in Vegas but not to my standard. I asked for medium and it came out well done. It was too charred. Only tasted the burnt meat. The idea of the burger was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that's it. Just the idea was great. I wouldn't dine here. It's not worth the money and experience.The shorts on the girls were cute. It said "soft buns" or "perfect buns" on the butt but trust me, their buns with neither.While the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and I decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around Fremont Street.  I originally wanted to check out Holstein's after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!Although some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean "Bull"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ).The patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.All things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than "shoestring").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  Now I just have to go back and try one of Holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.After objectively evaluating this place in my head, I gotta stick ya with a three... maybe I'm a burger snob... maybe I'm too spoiled by the absolute majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory here in Seattle... but when it comes down to it... the burger was just good. Nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.Their spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.The ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?I don't believe I'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad... I'm just spoiled.3 one-nom-...-just-one stars out of 5As I walked through the front door...House music was blasting.The DJ was spinning.Girls in stilettos and slinky dresses were dancing.Boys in button-down shirts were standing and posing by the bar while sipping Manhattans.You'd be forgiven for thinking that I had just wandered into some Vegas nightclub, but no.  This atmosphere is par for the course at Holsteins, which may be the most self-consciously hip burger joint in America.Normally I'd be more cynical about the goings-on at Holsteins, but they're forgiven because they put out an excellent product.  Despite the crowds and clubby atmosphere, the hostess quickly found us a (relatively) quiet table in the corner, with a nice view of a staff artist making a new cow-themed painting to add to the dining room's already-extensive collection.  After we sat down, we knew we made the right decision by coming here, because absolutely everything on their menu is mouthwatering.  Holsteins has a pretty extensive menu, but ordering anything other than the burgers would be silly here.  I ordered the nom nom burger, which is Kobe beef, cheddar, Thousand Island dressing, and potato chips.  My dinner companion had their California turkey burger, which comes with sprouts, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepper Jack cheese, and a dollop of Russian dressing.  All of the burgers come with your choice of shoestring or steak-cut fries.I *loved* the flavors of both of these burgers.  They easily rank among the best in Vegas.The only place where Holsteins slips is service.  I asked for my burger cooked medium, and it was definitely cooked beyond that.  Ultimately, though, the Thousand Island dressing provided more than enough the juiciness for the burger.  My dinner companion also ordered steak fries, but received shoestring fries instead.  Again, this was a tiny problem that didn't affect our experience much.Holsteins definitely warrants a return visit.  I'll let their scattershot service slide, if it means tasting more of their meaty and mouthwatering creations in a sleek and stylish atmosphere.'Til next time, Holsteins.I came here specifically for the Urth Burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. But somehow my eyes were caught by the words "Guava Float."Damn, that sounds good. Skyy Citrus Vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! I just had to order it. Damn... http://su.pr/1OTBxJSipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http://su.pr/2KKpvMThe artwork in here, which I think is created by a local artist, is kickass! One of my favorites: http://su.pr/6tjK9nAs good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. Thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in Vegas! And yes, next day Urth Burger with skinny fries are still good!Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! Viva Las Vegas :)I decided to try this place out after work & what a lively, happening atmosphere I walked into. You can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the East side area. Once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says Wicked Spoon and Convention Center. When you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.I checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. Quick & prompt just the way I like it ;) I sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. It was literally a money spot. Front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. I like this spot.. oh yes I do.My server, Jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. Giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which I felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. A more personable approach I would say... I asked him if there was any way I could take my food to go, since I explained that I would like to share it with my Family and he was more than willing to oblige my request. He went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item I was interested in trying. I appreciate his honesty on how I should get my Salmon cooked and what I could possibly add if I would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the Turkey choice that I ordered. Jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. Kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & I gave him his well deserved tip. I think he even bowed & said thank you so much. Wait.. I think I bowed to him first?!?? Eh it's in my culture to bow when I appreciate & respect someone. Koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. Don't mind me.. I'm just being ME.Tom Turkey Sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the Tiny Buns Section - When you first glance at these trios... Adorably cute. It consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & Russian dressing on the side. The dressing itself is between a hint of Horseradish & Thousand Island Dressing. It gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. The tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, But I ended up liking the chewy bites. I generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. I was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy. Crispy Pork Belly Bun - ( comes in 3's ) Think of Peking Duck Steamed Bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. I swear there was cilantro in the mix too. The hoisin sauce is more like a Chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. The steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. The pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. A combination that anybody would love.Captain Hook - I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. I would say this is a good looking burger. Succulent and vibrant. Marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. Together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. This was definitely a Hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. I chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. Thin, crispy, and tasty! I have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. I'm Hook'ed!My Family and I enjoyed all the burgers. The music at Holstein's is fresh. Even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped Both of my feet to the beats. Friendly staff and wonderful service. I would recommend Jonathan again to be my server. I did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. He was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. I even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. I did skip on the shakes this time, but the Oreo is my favorite! The artwork here is uniquely admirable. I like the way they hold this place down with colors that will tickle your sweet tooth. Great location for people watching and even mingling :PEverytime I'm in Vegas, I always make it a point to stop at Max Brenners for one of their frothy, calorie-enriched shakes; however, this time, my resident-friend suggested I try Holsteins.  It isn't the same type of shake, but thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.Yeah I know they have alcoholic shakes, but it was 2pm, and all I really wanted was a milkshake. The shake menu looked pretty interesting, but I gravitated towards the cereal bowl, primarily for my love of capn crunch cereal. She ordered the smores which was cool cause I'd get to try hers too.Anyway, upon my first sip. WOW. I was blown away. That is one f@cking good shake, amongst the other complimentary profanities that erupted from my lips. Damn Holsteins. Now I'm excited to try your burgers n things.**** 4.5 stars ****One of the great miracles of Las Vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like "Sexy And I Know It", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. Holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as Public House, where I had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. The d√©cor here is also just dope. I love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. If you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so I suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.But, since it's Vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). Brian and I both took the luxury route on the menu here, although I passed on the Billionaire Burger with Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because I've already had half a dozen burgers like this across America and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. It was honestly more difficult passing up the Rising Sun burger, a truly unique combination of Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if I had been dining with someone I was dating I likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. Somehow I managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.I finally wound up deciding on the Gold Standard burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with foie gras. The result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers I've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done sweet potato fries (for a supplemental charge). My biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer the burgers with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. Eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a fried egg as I do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.Just make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.As for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese's, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.As for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  Overall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  "That's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. I don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good."HEFTY 8 OZ burger in the cosmopolitan!you can get your burger on a white OR wheat bun---gold standard burger: pretty good! i liked the strong cheese flavor & char-grilled smokyness to the patty... ALTHOUGH my patty was unevenly cooked, which was a bit of a bummer---burgers come w/ steak OR shoestring fries... shoestring were definitely yummier! NOTE:you can ask for other sauces besides ketchup & mustard, but the chipotle mayo sauce we had wasn't too impressiveFREE house beer OR house margarita w/ a foursquare check-in!Before hitting up Marquee Night Club (on Party Rock Mondays) we decided to stop by this burger joint.  I have been here more than once and though I enjoy the food the service not so great. It was a pretty slow night and not a lot of people were in the restaurant but the service was just just sad. PROS:Black & white milkshake was excellent! (It is a must try)ordered the Hen House burger (Beef w/fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & onion w/ mustard & ketchup).  -- I really enjoyed the taste and it was perfect.CONS:fries - blandservice - was slow & our waitress was not very friendly.the place was too loud - but then it was club night. I dont know if I am willing to come back, but for the milkshake i probably would.So I was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans. I was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. We made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. Soon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. Our burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. Another plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! A third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!A fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. Let's work on that self-confidence, shall we?Who would have thought I could really crave for a burger? I had been wanting to try this new burger place in the Cosmopolitan for some time. I didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, I did. After Marquee Day club, my friends and I headed over and waited about 25 minutes. When we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. For all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. The milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. For many, that's way too less. But for me, give me my Peaches N' Creme! I'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. But I love the fact of knowing I'm drinking in Vegas, still. :) I got the Rising Sun burger. It was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. Avocado always makes the burger better. They gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. Uhh.. SHOESTRINGS FRIES of course. I absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. On top of that, I also ordered the Holsteins cobb salad. I have to make sure to keep my food light if I'm going to all these pool parties, you know. I like the cobb. I'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. I did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. We had decent service. Could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. We actually waved down our waitress a couple times. But, it was a busy afternoon. The food was good and convenient being right across from Marquee on the 2nd floor. It's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected.Well, just a few days ago I learned that Holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior Chocolate Shake!  After being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped Popcorn.  It was unnecessary but good.  Next came juicy Fried Pickles with a really good Caper Mayo Dressing.  A hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  Meanwhile, I had a hard time deciding whether I preferred the delicious Chocolate Milk Shake with Chocolate Syrup or the thick and sweet Whipped Cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  I even lamented to Diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  And, so it did!    Then the burgers and fries arrived.  For me, a Classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  There was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and I had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty Shoestring Fries that accompanied it.Meanwhile, Diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare Nom Nom Burger with Kobe Beef and Cheddar Cheese, as well as fulfilling Fat Fries.  Our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. It was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which I expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.I really enjoyed my meal at Holstein's when we visited Las Vegas last week.  It is one of those places that executes both substance and style very well.  I loved the theme and all of the art and design elements here.  I also really liked the food too.  It was just a good all around dining experience.My order consisted of the Nom Nom Burger (Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing) and sweet potato fries.  Both were good, and I was very happy with what I chose to order.  The only thing that was not good was the complementary can of popcorn that was brought to our table while waiting for our food.  It had an excessive amount of sauce on it that tasted like butter mixed with vinegar.  Otherwise, I was very satisfied. There are lots of choices of places to eat when on the strip in Las Vegas, but I was glad that we came across Holstein's.  I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch, and I would love to eat here again the next time I am in Las Vegas.After passing by the restaurant in the Cosmopolitan hotel on many trips I finally decided to eat there. I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The don't take reservations on weekends but we arrived at 8pm with a group of 5 and were seated immediately. The atmosphere and decor was fun, the restaurant was clean, and the waitress was very friendly. I ordered the Carbonara Chicken burger with Grilled Chicken Breast, Bacon, Mushrooms, Sweet Pea Aioli, Fried Egg, and Provolone Cheese. This was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that I have ever eaten. They have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the Drunken Monkey shake and it was also delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!This place has been on my bucket for a while, going back to when I lived in Vegas.  When we had the opportunity to eat her on a recent visit, I couldn't say no.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with the The Longhorn (Burger, Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Cole Slaw, Pickle), $16.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q#l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg#GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtgI took one bite of the Burger and fell in love with it.  The combination of Beef Brisket with the Burger was awesome.  The BBQ Sauce gave it a tangy flavor while the Slaw softened it up with a sweet, creamy flavor.....yum!One thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.  The floor wasn't wet or anything like that, I think it just gets slippery when it's clean....probably over-polished.Despite that danger, we'll be back.Return Factor - 95%Despite the choice location and the cool decor, as well as the numerous glowing reviews, I have to say that I was disappointed in my trip to Holstein's. The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something. Actually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had. Those who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.It's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections. I wouldn't completely rule out giving this place another try because I feel like we may have just gone on an off day, but honestly there are so many choices in Vegas it's hard to overlook a bad experience.Thanks to Holsteins yummy Bam-Boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), I can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.After polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening. The first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins; Drunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico LiquorCereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla VodkaCampfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham CrumblePork Belly BunsSalt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary)The Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura AvocadoGold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive AioliThe Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill PicklesI do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins. I can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. From what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.  I will definitely try Holsteins again. Next time I'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so I can fully remember my experience. Till that day comes I'll give Holsteins a solid 4 stars.First thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous Cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. At first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti d√©cor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! We decided to stop by and try this place out before we left Vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). The hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! We were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. The lounge/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. We settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. This place has almost everything you could ask for:Shakes (bam -boozled shakes)IPA'sBeerWineOne of a kind cocktailsBut what I liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. Who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!All their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!With so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. I decided on the Nom Nom Burger- No bun, Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island DressingI have to admit I was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. I use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! But screw that though I told myself I'm going in!After ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! And believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  One guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. You would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in Vegas! He tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. Still the look on his face was priceless!Our burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) I had to try some of Minh's onion rings (which were delicious) I could have ate them all except I was given the "eye" so I swiped two more and went back to my burger! It was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! The burger was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!Be warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though I opted not to have the bun I got full half way through! I forced myself to finish this epic burger, which I am 50/50 that I did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy! Service was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!Hostess: friendly and prompt, she took down my info and told me they would text when a table was ready. That's an awesome feature. Who wants to stand in front of Holsteins for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sports book?! I received the text, although we snagged a spot at the bar before it came. Food:Truffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w/ Maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. Two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. It tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. That first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. Boo. We left half of it there and I refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not trueNom Nom Burger ($16.50 - Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. On one hand, the beef was realllllly good. Flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. On the other hand, the toppings added 0. My theory is they need to triple what they put on top the burger. When you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. Conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.Drinks:Ginger Julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite. Rhubarb Pie Bam-Boozled Shake ($11 - Absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. Should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? Probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!Would I come back here? Yep. Would I order differently? Yep. Will I finally end this review? Sure.I had to write an update to my review of Holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  Everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  Even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  What really stole the show for me though was the Rising Sun burger.  It was the best thing that I ate in Vegas during my most recent visit, and I am salivating just thinking about it as I write this review.  I also shared sides of sweet potato fries, onion rings, and fried pickles with my wife, and I loved them all.  I was so glad that we came back to eat at Holstein's again when we were in Las Vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  I can't wait to come back here again soon!Burger #267: Roll of the DiceI can't believe it's been over four months since my last burger review, sorry for slacking but this pace won't pick up soon. Anyhoot, Vegas, burgers, cheat weekend, let's go. Holsteins was my pick for the start of my carb filled weekend, and what better way to indulge in all things anti-paleo than lobster mac and cheese;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg#F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIgFlavor was spot on, noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, there was a nice crispy layer on top, and loads of lobster. But of course there was a "but," a very big butt; the sauce was like water. No creamy gooey goodness to be found here, just a soupy base to the above perfection. So close this was to being a perfect mac, but someone forgot to reduce the sauce or add some flour? To wash all that down, what could be better than a nice refreshing milk shake, the fat boy;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_g#qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_gNamed after my favorite Harley style, this obese child contained no less than the following; Stoli Salted Karamel Veodka, Reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. All I tasted was ice cream and a hint of caramel, it was damn tasty though.And lastly was my first bite of bread in a month, the gold standard burger; dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli, to which I felt it imperative to add a fried egg;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3Ung#a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3UngOverall, meh+. The sum of the parts was better than okay, not quite great, but somewhere around good. Once I began my dissection, I found the beef patty itself to be under-seasoned and without a nice crust. The bun could have used a few minutes on the grill to get a nice crust as well to protect itself from the toppings. Flavor-wise the meat was beefy, but it completely depended on the bacon for salt. I am happy to report that it was cooked to my order of med-rare;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQ#A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQBeing my first proper burger in months, I was a little let down that it wasn't mind-blowing, but overall everything was a-okay.Came here on a whim because my friends wanted drinks and food. We must of been really lucky because there was no wait and we were seated right away. My girlfriend and I each ordered a lemon drop, my boyfriend ordered a light ale which he really enjoyed. We also got the Holstein burger and a side of onion rings. The burger was less than average (dry and flavorless)  but the onion rings stole the show. They were a little but salty but in our drunken state, they were perfect! Next time I'm at cosmopolitan, I would love to come back and try some of their shakes and gourmet burgers out.Upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a "short" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!Most of us decided on selections from the "Big Buns" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the "Gold Standard" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.With your "Big Buns" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!*** Mmm-mmmm ....       That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it. *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers?        Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?      Ah, hit the spot.Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Cr√©me Br√ªl√©e, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.As a local I can give you the inside scoop on how these casino/resort restaurants work:1. A talented chef designs the menu and recipes.2. The restaurant serves amazing food for a short time.3. Accountants find ways to cut cost.4. The food goes downhill.Sadly, such is the way with Holstein's.  The first time I ate here the burgers knocked my socks off.  The second time, I wished I had just gone to Applebee's.  It's easier to park at Applebee's, the food comes out faster, it's cheaper, and THE FOOD IS BETTER!The saddest part: the resort restaurants keep getting away with this.That is all I have to say.Items Selected:Buttered PopcornTiramisu Shake - Mascarpone Ice Cream, Ladyfinger Crumbs, Patron Xo Caf√©, Chocolate Syrup, Cocoa Powder, Espresso BeansBanana Cream Pie - Bananas, Vanilla Custard, Nilla Wafers, Caramel, Cr√®me de Banane, Licor 43, White Chocolate Covered Nutty BananaCrispy Pork Belly Bun - Chinese steamed Bun, Hoisin Sauce, Cucumber, Pea ShootsRising Sun Burger - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado with Onion RingsTruffle Lobster Mac n' Cheese - Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce, Maine Lobster, Black TruffleShrimp & Grits Hush Puppies - Rock Shrimp, Andouille, Cheddar, RemouladeUn-Birthday Cake - Confetti Cake, Vanilla Frosting, Berry Crumble, Sugar Spirals, Cotton CandyAnother concept restaurant from Block 16 Hospitality that has generated raves since its inception at The Cosmopolitan I'd frequently entertained a visit to Holsteins but it was not until nearly three and a half years after first visiting the property that I finally sat down for lunch, a $130 meal for two at a casual 'shakes and buns' place rather absurd in retrospect even though much of the experience was admittedly quite good.  Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new "Un-Birthday" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.I was skeptical in trying Holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so much, I wanted a different burger place. Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!The decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. My bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchiesBamboozled Shakes:Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes. Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. Banana Creme Pie - My bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!Apps:Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshingCrispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari ringsMaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot onBurgers:Rising Sun w/ onion rings(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divineFun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over Rising sun because he prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(Gold Standard w/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!Note: Try and get a girl server. The first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. The 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmedThe unexpected touches are what elevated this from a 3 to a 4 star experience for me. I'd read the reviews, so I already planned on getting a boozy milkshake, skipping the sliders, and ordering the Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado) - all of which were fantastic recommendations. (Thanks Yelp!)But I wasn't expecting the complimentary popcorn (that our group quickly renamed crack-corn), nor was I expecting the complimentary nitro meringues to finish off the meal. It was clear that the servers, even on a busy Saturday night, were eager to make our experience memorable. And from start to finish, that's exactly what it was.Way Over priced for small portion and terrible costumer service! Would never return. $70 lunch and they automatically add the tip which they don't mention for a server who stopped at your table twice and was to busy to refill your water glass! Thanks but no thanksAfter spending an hour at Louis Vuitton at Crystals, I came here for dinner.  The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalape√±o, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  A note to the parents--leave the damn Webster's Elementary Dictionary in the room.  You don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.A pleasant meal.This place sucks so hard, you're better off going anywhere else for a burger.  The wait was super long not because they were busy but because service is extremely slow and inattentive.  Our waitress was no where to be found after she took our order and then our burgers took forever and a day.  The only thing I liked about this place was the cute wall art.  I got the Urth burger and it was bland and dry.  Took a bite of the Rising Sun and the patty was tasteless and dry also.  The tempura avocado did nothing texturally.  The fries were the worst fries I've ever had at a sit down burger restaurant.  I'm seriously confused about the 5-star reviews but chacun a son gout.Meating time.There are burgers, and then there are BURGERS.  Holsteins serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. and overall I had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.LOCATION:  Second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.On my recent trip, I visited Holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  We decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  Thank goodness for being early.  In this case, the early diner gets the burger.FOOD:  There were three of us and collectively we ordered the Gold standard burger, the California turkey, and the Big Fat Greek.  All burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  I was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, I decided on their award winning Gold Standard Burger.  The Gold Standard Burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  This has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  This dry aged beef sirloin (smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  I thought all the condiments served complemented the burger well.  My taste buds were quite happy indeed.  The fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  The burger was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.As for my two friends, I believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    Overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.SERVICE:  The hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  The server was a friendly and polite young woman.  She greeted us and took our drink orders.  She also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  As previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the Gold Standard Burger, and I thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  She  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and great company.  I strongly recommend the Gold Standard Burger.I've heard a lot of good things about this place. I wish I didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while the burgers here are pretty good, I wouldn't go wild over it. The manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 PM on a Saturday.  That's definitely a star well earned there.  The service was very good.  Warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. I loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  There's another two star there.I ordered the Gold Standard ($18) and added a fried egg ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for sweet potato fries ($2).  I ordered it Medium Rare because I love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  My expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall I say udder disappointment), my burger came out Medium Well.  Ewww.  Ground cardboard.  While the burger was still good, having it medium rare could have made it THAT much better and probably one of the best burgers.  So it was just good, not amazing.  I was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  At least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out Medium well to Well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  Um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  For $21 I was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.      I didn't have any shakes because I'm not into shakes, but I had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.   I would rule this place completely out, but I can't give it bragging rights either.  I still prefer Red Robin  burgers over my experience at Holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  Good burgers but poor execution.  I would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, I'd still with Cheeseburger in Paradise or Red Robin.  We'll try again later, Holstein's!I had this bookmarked for awhile! Finally had the chance to try this place. There was no wait at 7:30PM on a Friday night. We were seated right away. I ordered the one that yelpers raved about, which was Gold Standard and the Cake batter alcoholic shake. Don't judge me, it's Vegas! My friend got the Rising sun and Maple Bacon shake. The burgers and fries came out faster than the shake which was kind of strange. Unfortunately, after taking the first bite out of the gold standard, the word "MEH" popped in my head immediately. I took a bite out of my friend's Rising sun, and felt EXTREME JEALOUSY. That burger had more flavor and deliciousness. I loved my cake batter shake though, I love cake batter anything and if you have a sweet tooth, then you're good to go. You can definitely get the shakes without alcohol. Overpriced for a burger joint, but it's in Cosmo so I didn't expect any less.Reminiscing about my childhood memories is like the anticipation of a first kiss; it's (usually) messy, exciting, and puts a smile on a face. That is how Holsteins shakes made me feel, and their grown up version added a tinge of a twist to remind me that I am not 5 anymore, and I am okay with that.Holsteins is known for their milkshakes so I was curious to know if they met up to that prominent expectation. We sat at the bar and were greeted instantly; it was nice that the bartender gave us his full attention even though we were only looking for a taste of a milkshake. I'm not an ice cream or milkshake devotee, but I was taken away by the intriguing menu of unusual paired milkshakes, such as the Frozen Grasshopper (Peppermint, Chocolate, Cr√®me De Menthe, Pinnacle Chocolate Vodka), Cereal Bowl (3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch), Red Velvet Cake Shake (Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie), and even an all year around Pumpkin Pie (Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, Pepitas Brittle) shake! Although I was hesitant at first at the idea of an alcohol infused milkshake, they prepare virgin ones as well. I stay far away from hard liquor unless the social gathering is right, and this night was one of them. The bartender assured me that I would hardly taste the alcohol anyway, is this a good sign? C E R E A L  B O W L  [ $ 13 ]We decided on the Cereal Bowl; 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch in a vanilla ice cream base, yum! This milky concoction masked the alcohol so well that I didn't taste anything but the abundance of one of my childhood favourite cereals, Cap'N Crunch! So light yet sweet with a just-right cereal texture, this treat was more than the best milkshake I've ever tasted.I certainly see myself visiting Holsteins again, perhaps to try the Red Velvet Cake Shake or the Moscow Moo; it's difficult to say no when these milkshakes are completely inspired by cake ingredients to childhood inspired creations xReview #1000 goes out to Holsteins Shakes and Buns!The roommate and I were staying at the Cosmopolitan. Having to catch a flight a couple hours after we checked out, I wanted to fit one last meal into our trip. Thankfully, Holsteins was right downstairs!*Holsteins special lager (4.8%) nv, usa ($5.50 for 12.5oz)Having a meal without a drink in Vegas is weird to me. So of course I ordered a beer. This was super light and easy to drink.*Billionaire burger: kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo ($32)Yum! I'm a foie-aholic, so this definitely hit the spot! A huge tender piece of foie topped this beautiful burger. Great flavor. The kobe beef also melted in my mouth. I was in heaven.*The steakhouse burger: beef patty crusted w/black pepper, greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato, onions, mushrooms, cheese ($18)The roommate's burger. I took a bite. But after eating the kobe beef, this seemed tough. The roommate seemed to enjoy it and finished the whole burger.So is the billionaire burger worth $32?! Absolutely! One of best burgers I've had in a while!I've said it before and I'll say it again--it's hard for me not to love a burger place.  Throw it in a trendy location such as The Cosmopolitan and ba-bam, I'm all in.  Holstein's was the perfect way to end a LONG day of drinking by the pool. The fries were stand-outs and my hamburger was completely yummy.  Piggy/hungover me asked for extra non-clean/processed american cheese and extra crispy bacon on my burger...that could have been the booze talking, but nonetheless, it was delicious!  The Oreo shake could have been a tad more chocolatey for my taste, but rest assured, every last drop was consumed without sacrifice.  The service was great, the vibe was great, the people watching was top notch and all around, I'm a HUGE fan.MMMMM, Now that's a tasty burger, what was that called again?A bit pricy for a burger, but it is the Cosmo.Drinks at the bar, where we were not allowed to order a milkshake for one of our dining companions that does not imbibe alcohol was extremely annoying, but not as annoying as the gal that said it. Attitude much? Uh hello, this is a burger joint..Anny who, food was good, fries are amazing, super yummy onion rings, and that milkshake was flippin huge (when it finally arrived at the table)..Ignore the attitudes and enjoy the food..This place was okay! I was hoping for better! We got the ahi tartar sliders which were lacking flavor and super small, got the black/white malt which was good and a great sharer. I got a burger but it wasn't that good, it was okay and it wasn't hot it just came out warm, the onion rings were good. It's pretty cool inside and a chill place to hang out but the food was average. I wouldn't come back. Oh and other reviewers mentioned they bring out popcorn unfortunately we didn't get any. Boo =(Would come back for the shakes/malt which seem to be their speciality. Service was good too till the end till it took 15 mins to get our change back for the check. =X

Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Price: 4/5We easily made a reservation for lunch through Opentable as we usually do. Lunch reservations are much easier to grab than dinner! When hubby has the time, I tend to grab the opportunity to try restaurants during lunch time: easier to grab reservations, more affordable prices, but still very delicious food!Prior to arriving, we were originally opting for the √† la carte menu as we thought that was the only menu available. But no, we were greeted to a prix fix√© after we were seated! As I looked around the restaurant after ordering, it was very chic and beautifully decorated. Tourists, business professionals, locals like us were all having lunch (probably the prix-fixe) and overall it had a quiet atmosphere.3 courses for less than $30! When it is ever that affordable? This is why Montreal is such a great foodie city to be in :). It didn't take very long for hubby and me to change our minds and opt for the prix-fix√©; we might come here more often for lunch now that we know! The √† la carte is of course still available.We skipped drinks as it was lunch time and just ordered sparkling water to share. After complimentary bread was brought and it was oh so delicious! I didn't feel the need to butter my bread that day because it tasted better without it in my opinion. Wish I had some right now!My first course was more or less vegetarian, although I didn't intend to. I was very delighted with how the dish was presented - so pretty! The beautiful plating was kept all throughout our lunch and in my opinion, got better with each dish. I found the appetizer very refreshing and light, just how I wanted. It definitely doesn't fill you up but there are more courses coming your way anyway. Overall, it was a great Summer dish (I visited before Labour Day)!My husband's main dish was extremely delicious! It was extremely well cooked and presented. The yogurt sauce complimented the sausage very well and overall, the dish was enjoyable; however, the portion of the dish seemed a little small.Lastly, our dessert. Hubby didn't order one (so opted for the 2-course) while I chose to have dessert (3-course). The honey panna cotta I had was incredible! With the strawberry sorbet and sabl√© breton, it was a sweet party in my mouth. Everything was so incredibly well balanced and overall not too sweet which I really liked. Again, beautiful plating and personally, some of the panna cotta I've ever had!Overall, our celebratory lunch at Les 400 Coups was very enjoyable. The prix-fix√© menu was definitely a plus, as we were able to enjoy a great course lunch at a much affordable price point. The restaurant did not disappoint; every dish was not hurried, well prepared, and as the consumer, we could easily feel how much the chefs cares about their cuisine. Read more about them here - you'd be amazed at how dedicated and passionate they are about their work! Whether you're a student, business professional, a local, or a tourist, Les 400 Coups is for you! I truly recommend the restaurant as it is one of the best in Montreal (see their Press tab!) in one of the hottest areas of the city. Reservations are definitely recommended, especially if you're looking into going to the restaurant for dinner!

Review Text :
I came by for lunch last weekend to try the pho, since it was cold and I was craving a hot, brothy, noodly dish.  Because I was in the Strip for shopping purposes, this place was more convenient than the other Pho place further down Penn.  Since they both have similar ratings and each seems to have its adherents, I figured I'd try here.Since I'd never had pho before, I was excited to try it for the first time.  Because I don't eat beef, I ordered the pho ga (chicken pho).  It was served promptly, about 5 min. after ordering, piping hot with all of the usual accoutrements (sprouts, Thai basil, lime, peppers).  I added in the first three, gave it a stir, and dipped in.  The soup was very pleasantly savory, and had a nice balance of flavors and textures.  My only major criticism was that I felt that the amount of chicken included was a bit on the light side--but then again, as a first-time pho eater, I don't have a good feel for what's typical in terms of the amount of meat included.  Nevertheless, I ate the whole bowl with gusto, savoring my first pho experience.While I agree with other reviewers that the interior decor is a bit sparse and bland, this wasn't a make-or-break issue for me.  Service was fine, if unremarkable--exactly what I'd expect in this type of establishment.  Overall, I was pleased with my meal here, and I wouldn't hesitate to return for another bowl of delicious pho.

Ratings on scale of 1-5 (last visit)Tastiness.................................................... 4Greasiness................................................. 5Management yelling at employees......... 5  (including Greek accent)Ambiance (aside from yelling)..................3Price/Value....................................................3Ok, that's the best I could do to replicate Sean's impressively objective rating system without committing all out plagiarism.  It's just that I've chosen to include slightly different criteria.The fries are indeed cooked in grease from the heavens, and then served in a big greasy brown paper pouch.  They were so much better than most I've had, especially from such an apparent hole-in-the-wall place.The gyro was heaping full of flavorful, salty lamb/beef (at least I assume that's the mix, even though the menu doesn't specify).  It is then drenched in a creamy tzatziki sauce and topped with onions and tomato.  In all, very good.Another plus was the fact that the manager/owner told me he would have my meal ready in less than five minutes from when I ordered over the phone.  While I was at first a tad suspicious that quality might suffer from such hasty preparation, I decided to happily roll with the welcome comfort of an immediately sated appetite.And sated I was..... I now feel like I'm moments away from a food coma as I digest this big gut bomb.  The only comfort I have is that I got to chuckle a little bit about the owner/manager interrogating and berating his employee (family member?) in front of me as he inquired about how I discovered his restaurant.  When I said that it was from an ex-employee having left a menu and not from his guys dropping one off, he decided that maybe he should go deliver the damn menus to area businesses himself!  I agree that this is a sensible idea -- he sounded like he needed a break from the restaurant.Overall pretty good.  I just might be back again soon.  But I do think the prices could stand to drop a buck or so.

Review Text :
Sleek setting, somewhat slow service, and some of the best executed Thai in town.  Many might complain that it has been watered down to better accommodate the Western palate but I don't mind.  The food is light yet filling and the freshness stands out.it's not every day I eat Thai food, but it's pretty much amazing here. at least the catfish meal I had was. so much more than flavorful. I was supper pleased. and my colleague's beef bento box meal was the same. I also had the fried mango and ice cream dessert - loved that too.and excellent service.I wanted to come here again before leaving but had to try as many different spots as possible while in AZ. I was with you again in spirit tho, Soi 4...

Review Text :
I can't say that I'm a hotdog connoisseur but every once and a while I do get the craving for a good hot dog.   I don't eat beef or pork, so I can only eat chicken, turkey or vegetarian hotdogs.  My friend John and I were on our way to meet our friend to go bowling and I decided to stop by Maui Dogs and Slider. They  just had a soft opening, but I wanted to review them right away so people can find out about this place. The atmosphere, is very hawaiian and they have all kinds of   fruit relish with different   combination of mango, coconut, pineapple or banana. They have  a signature mustard being flavored with passionfruit. I tried their turkey hotdog with avocado and some sweet and spicy relish.It was pretty good. The only way it could get better is if they had beer on tap.  Maui Dog  is definitely a winner in the wiener category!Update: (6/9/2011)  I've stopped eating chicken & turkey for 8 months now, so I haven't been back.CAUTION: Maui Dog is Highly Addictive.The above statement should be printed on the menu, by the way.My friend has been raving about this place for weeks now...and last night I finally stopped in only to find myself waking up this morning CRAVING it again! Yikes. And it's on my commute home from work. I think I am in trouble...By my friends recommendation, I had the Lava Dog, Shaggy Style. Basically, an all beef hot dog, chili ("lava") - monterey jack cheese - Maui cole slaw ("shaggy"). The slight sweetness of the bun, bit of salt with the dog and chili topped with the crispness and freshness of the maui slaw creates the perfect balance. Now it's a "taste explosion" at a hot dog 'stand'? Better believe it.Next time, I want to try something different...like the Brat dog or Spam slider. They offer unique toppings for all dogs - maui style - chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, coconut and pineapple topping to name a few. I am going to have to go for the shaved ice next time too, especially Amy's recommendation of the "Tiger's Blood"Some inside SCOOP on this place, because I asked the owner John (who's super nice) a million questions. The Chili is Vegetarian. The buns are AMA-ZING and it's his own recipe. The buns are baked fresh locally. The brats are made especially for him as well. He was inspired by a place he visited all of the time in Hawaii - while he was surfing! A good enough reason for us Phoenicians to welcome a little ALOHA in our lives.SOME OTHER THINGS I LIKE?   - They DO take debit cards, it's NOT cash only.    - THEY ARE PET FRIENDLY (Patio, obviously)   - I love the surfboard painted out front, makes for some entertaining photo shoots for kids, pets and hey...even adults!I'm glad to support a locally-owned, unique business that offers a fantastic product. Mahalo!!!Aloha!It's been a couple of years since the Beautiful Carin and I took one of our vacations in the islands.Clearly, it's time to go back and "Hang Ten" (I told Carin I could "Hang Ten" when we first met, to get her to like me...by the time she found out I couldn't surf, she had fallen in love with me for my mind).Since we were on Maui last, it looks like they've invented an entirely new hot dog...the Maui Dog!Well, maybe not "invented" so much as "enhanced" the good old "Pooka" dogs that you find in the islands."Maui Enhancement"?OK, I don't know for sure that these bad boys (and since hot dogs are wiener related, I think it's safe to assume that they are boys) originated on Maui, but wherever and whatever fertile imagination created them deserves a hand-y!But we have always preferred Maui, when we visit the islands..."Maui No Ka Oi"...now, I guess I can add "Maui Dog No Ka Oi"I've seen a few reviews for Maui Dog on Yelp, lately...and I was watching Hawaii 5-0 http://tinyurl.com/yazfcs5 on the TiVo last night and that pretty much decided my lunch plans today (It's sweet of you to worry about my health but don't...I detoxed like crazy this morning, so I was ready and able to handle the nitrate/salt/fat onslaught at lunch today).I strolled in and looked over the menu...and I was momentarily confused (a hazard that us seasoned citizens learn to deal with by yelling at those younger than us, in an effort to confuse everybody and not feel out of place).The very nice proprietor came to my aid, briefly explained the workings of the menu, and off I went!I selected wisely and soon I felt like I was back in the islands noshing a tasty and satisfying Spam slider (Spam = Scientifically Processed Animal Material...I know, more for me)...so very, very tasty!I was also the proud possessor of a very satisfying Maui Dog!They started my Maui Dog with a nice big, beefy wiener (that's what she said!) and they put plenty of toppings on him...Spicy Maui Mustard (sadly, mayonnaise on the wiener just doesn't work for me) along with a sort of mango topping and dill spears...Maui Waui!The sweetness, the spiciness, the saltiness, the grilled flavor of the wiener...all coming through for a first rate Maui Dog experience!I know, seems like an awful lot of stuff happening on the Maui Dog, but somehow, it all worked for me...I haven't really been a fan of overly dressed wieners in the past, but these guys could change my point of view...a little, at any rate!So, I now have a Maui Dog "mahalo" card (no it doesn't mean "trash" in Hawaiian...it means "Thank You") and I plan to use that rascal whenever I'm back in town.That Maui Dog was delicious...good to the last drop!Aloha!This place needs some love, yo. Not the four to five star reviews saying "Yay!" and then never visiting the place again. I'm talking a serious customer base that will elevate this unique little Hawaiian joint to the level it deserves. It's completely different from any other Hawaiian food out there. Honestly, most of that island fare is kind of bland by my standards. Bland macaroni salad, bland rice, bland pulled pork. Blah, blah, blah.Maui Dog turns all these tired standards on their nose and tosses some wicked ridiculous flavor combos together. Who would have thought that a sweet pineapple and coconut slaw would have worked so well on dawgs and sliders? The aioli and shaggy-style island dog are also pretty fantastic. Plus they have Spam. SPAM! I love my pre-formed, processed pork products. Mmm hmm. Also a big fan of the fries and tater tots. (Everywhere should offer the far superior tot as an option in my opinion.) They are a bit soggy instead of super crisp, but I'm one of those queer birds that just loves soggy taters. Grease esssplosion in yo mouth!They have a drive-thru! They take cards! The guy that owns the place is hella nice and will chat your ear off! It's colorful! And different! But not so different that it's pretentious and annoying! I can't offer any more justifications. Get your ass to Maui Dog. Amazing doesn't do it justice.It's no surprise I write this, but I love independent restaurants. Don't worry, I'm not going to get on my soap box and preach about how they help the local economy by keeping more of their revenues in the communities they serve. Nor will I go on about the way they support other small businesses by sourcing ingredients and supplies locally. What I love most of all, they take risks that many corporation restaurants wouldn't dare.Take Maui Dog for instance, l mean really, who opens a restaurant specializing in Hawaiian style hot dogs? Ask owner John Stamatakis, who started his hot dog venture last year in the building that housed Ricky's Philly. The tiny structure has gotten the island treatment with tiki torches, bright colors and a warm friendly vibe. What they don't have in square footage they make up for in charm and of course menu offerings. The menu boasts a series of hot dogs, sliders and some serious toppings. There is one nagging question though, what's a Hawaiian hot dog? To be honest, I had no idea until I did some research. Ends up Hawaiian hot dogs are just like any other hot dog except for a slightly sweetened bun, some variation of garlic mayo and a laundry list of tropical flavors including passion fruit infused mustard to chopped banana and coconut. Before I go on about the food, I have to give you one bit of advice, ask them to make sure they steam the buns! On my visit this crucial detail wasn't fulfilled so what I ended up with were slightly dry and mostly stale buns. I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order, this is what I call great customer service. On first bite I felt deep love for MD's Lava Dog Shaggy Style ($5.50). Its a beef hot dog slather in lava, which is their house made chili, then topped with cheese and coleslaw, the later making it shaggy. I went further and ordered it Maui style, which means that it will additionally be topped with chipotle garlic mayo, Maui mustard, coconut and pineapple. I had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work. It's a whole lot of flavor but melds so well together. Fortunately the heat from the chili and hot dog also managed to make the extremely soft and what I love saying, squishy. Okay canned meat has a really bad wrap, nothing like congealed animal parts to make a person run for the hills. So bear with me when I say go ahead and try a Spam Slider ($1.25). Ordinarily I would have never ordered one but the lady at the counter assured me it was worth a taste. My only experience with Spam was my mothers doing, Span sandwiches, come on, you've had them too! Anyway, once you top a slice of grilled Spam with sweet mustard, coconut and pineapple, Maui style, I think you might have a different impression, sweet and salty is a great combo. If Spam isn't your bag, go for the Teriyaki Slider ($1.25), Maui style of course. This version replaces the Spam with a tender ground beef patty and a smothering of teriyaki sauce. If you love potatoes with your hot dogs and sliders, be sure to order a basket of MD's hand cut French Fries ($1.75). These are the real deal, tender with a slight crisp. If you want sheer crunch good times order up the Tater Tots ($1.75). These little chubs of shredded potato come out super crispy and well seasoned. Judging by the steady stream of diners, it seems like this indie resto is a hit with the locals. Just be sure to get those buns steamed.I ate a shaggy dog @mauidogs !  Or a fuzzy dog. I think it was shaggy. It had slaw and all sorts of other stuff on it and I liked it...alot.  I could eat another one right now.  And I would too, if I weren't writing this from a hotel in California.I also had a spam slider. It was good too.  I haven't had spam since I was, well, it's been a long time.I like this place...the food, the people, the vibe...nunui!'Oe pono he ekahi!http://hawaiiandictionary.hisurf.com/ALERT!!! ALERT!!!MAUI DOG IS CLOSING ON DECEMBER 29th.I had lunch here today and the owner passed along the news.  Landlord is hiking rent and he never made a profit so can't aford to stay and is out of the cash needed to move locations.A sad day for Phoenix.I have to say, SHAME on myself and the rest of the Phoenix foodies and Yelpers out there.  We all love this place, so why don't we go?  I work 2 miles from here and have only been three times.  AND I LOVE IT.  I've told people to go.  THEY love it.Alas...  Two weeks from today...  no more Maui Dog.Thanks to the owner for his pride and guts with this delicious concept.  I hope to see you pop up again somewhere in the valley.  If you do, I vow to be more supportive.I will definitly be back again before you close.  EVERYONE should.You know you have it bookmarked.  Change that bookmark to a Check In YELPERS!

Everything on the menu except for the sandwiches is overpriced. And the service needs a serious upgrade. For years, the consistency has been the careless staff and quite frankly, the food isn't good enough for me to put up with it more than a few times a year.Try to call in your take out order, but good luck getting them to pick up the phone.When you enter, if there's anyone else waiting, beware that you'll probably get ignored by all four employees who will inexplicably assume you are with the other customer- even though you guys walked in separately, minutes apart, and look nothing alike.Eventually you'll ask someone if you can place an order for takeout, and they'll act irritated that they have to give you a menu. They'll also give you the dinner-only menu that doesn't include the sandwiches, you'll have to ask again for it.When you finally get to this point, your pita sandwich can be made with falafel, shwarma, koobideh, or a couple other things. The first two are your best bet. Be aware that upgrading your wrapping to laffa will be an extra $2.50. $10 and a side of fries is decent for the wrap, which is packed with tahini, cabbage, Israeli salad, and the world's tiniest dab of hummus, but it's hella filling and can easily be your main meal of the day even without the fries.If you dine in, the all-you-can-eat salad for $3, added on to your meal, is a great deal...but be sure you will actually have room for it. And as others have said, the entire table needs to order it for you to be able to partake- if you're with more than one other person, it likely isn't worth it.

Underwhelmed, disappointed and regretful. Those three words sum up my visit to Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse. I brought a large group here on a Saturday evening (they weren't too busy when we got there) at the recommendation of a friend and I found it to be completely disappointing. We had 7 in the group. Everything about the place was disappointing. We weren't asked for a drink order for 15 minutes; our food order wasn't taken for 45 minutes to an hour; the food came another 30 minutes later; and the food was well below average. I ordered a 16 oz porterhouse steak with sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. The porterhouse was a little overcooked and had a mushy exterior with no grill marks or char as if it had been cooked on a grill that wasn't hot enough (or a Foreman grill). The sweet potato fries were decent but there were hardly any of them. The grilled veggies were mushy and served in a pool of what appeared to be oil...yuck. They did have a decent sample of beers here which is nice but I would never go here again for a meal. All told I left feeling like I had wasted 2 plus hours of my life waiting on food that I'd rather have not have eaten.

Restaurant name  Cast Iron Waffles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you've never had the opportunity of trying a Belgian Liege style waffle, A) You truly haven't lived and B) You're in for a treat. Cast Iron Waffles is churning these things out like they're going out of style and each one is a hit. My wife stumbled upon this place and fell in love immediately. Resting at the base of a town home in a strip of other small business (Connected to the same shopping center as Wings and Rings and Blink off of Ardrey Kell) it's a perfect little bistro-esque location for breakfast. It may be a bit difficult to find for first-timers and actually find a parking space (you can always park in the bank's parking lot) but the location is very quaint and houses tons of personality. For those of you who appreciate waffles, you may have to dash the idea you have in your head. These are Belgian Liege style waffles. They aren't pouring batter into a piping hot waffle iron and handing out faux eggo garbage. This is a brioche type dough that is hand-pressed into a waffle iron. Filled with tons of pearl sized crystals of sugar, each bite of waffle is crunchy at first, bursting with sugar crystals and finishes with a brilliant chew. Be prepared for intrigue as many waffle aficionados tend to be. You won't think "waffle" immediately, but rather "sweet bread." The owners have put a lot of thought into how these are prepared and their dough is no joke. There are different choices of toppings ranging from whipped cream, fruit, nutella, maple butter and powdered sugar. There are the occasional seasonal options on the menu but I have yet to be impressed by any. My recommendation is go au naturale. Just plain waffle to see what your taste buds will be up against. If you're looking for an added sweetness, go for the maple butter. Not too overt with maple flavor and just the right amount sogginess to add to those chewy waffles. Many of you may consider this spot as more of a "treat," than a breakfast joint. It all depends on who well you can handle the sweetness of the dough. These guys also do coffee and espresso drinks. None of which are a draw and pale in comparison to the lead singing waffles. One of the coolest aspects of the shop is the old school coke machine they have in the back. You have to get quarters from the register and then open the door to the fridge-style vending machine. Note: You have to pull your bottle of coke out REALLY fast for it not to lock down on your bottle. Ask one of the employees behind the counter. They'll be able to tell you more. Cast Iron Waffles is a must for anyone in the Blakeney area. The business owners are great to chat with and love to hear their customers' stories. Ask to hear theirs. What a great family. Love how they are operating this little joint. Hear, hear for Belgian Liege waffles in south Charlotte!For a Saturday morning breakfast, I can't think of anything better. Soon after this little joint opened, a friend said to me, "You HAVE to try this new waffle place!" But I was on my way just as soon as I heard the word "waffle."These are not, I repeat, NOT like Waffle House. They're Belgian Liege waffles. super dense, chewy -- they're made with dough instead of batter, and imbedded in the final product are crystallized sugar pearls. Your best bet for a top-notch waffle is going at a busy time...you'll have a bit of a wait, but tasting a freshly ironed(?) waffle is worth it. At non-peak hours, expect that you'll be served a waffle that was made a few minutes ago.They have an old-school coke machine that you put quarters in. It's a bit tricky, so take the advice of the staff and pull it out quick!! ;)Great spot for breakfast meetings, and they offer free wi-fi. Apparently their coffee is highly regarded by the readers of Creative Loafing. It's not my favorite, but when you need something warm and delicious to wash down your waffle, it's never a bad choice. There's a TV at the bar, so you can watch something if you're not keen on conversation. Outdoor seating is a plus, when the weather's nice. I always park in the bank parking lot and walk over. It's easier than parallel parking next to the shop.Definitely go for the "Extra Sweet" variety with maple butter, sans the powdered sugar. Nothing gets me out of bed on a Saturday morning like the thought of that waffle.

This is definitely one of my favorite late night, bad decision dining choices. I love the rolled beef tacos smothered in guacamole and cheese. Carne Asada tacos or tostada. The carne Asada nachos are awesome, but you need someone to share them. The green sauce salsa is my favorite. I could almost drink it. I eat here often enough but I never really thought about writing a review. I mean everyone knows what they are getting with a place like this, but the last time I was there, I changed my mind. The counter guy seriously washed his hands at least 3 times while I was there. I was the only customer. I was very impressed with this excellent display of good sanitation. He washed his hands before he took my order, after he took my order and again before he handed me my food. Cleanliness like this really makes me confident in a place.Ordered to go food. Came home and half way thru my son had a metal piece in his mouth. I called them to let them know and the guys response was What's wrong with that? Well that set me off! A simple apology would have sufficed but to say what he said?!? Is ridiculous! If you want a little more iron in your diet EAT HERE. WTF!  Wish I didn't have to put a star up but I wanted to post!

Restaurant name  Renegade Tap & Kitchen

Review Text :
I selected Renegade for dinner this past Monday evening for our party of five... we were celebrating of sorts and I thought it would be fun to try something new together.  I also figured it would be similar to Roaring Fork based on the reviews that came in previously and the fact that it's a Robert McGrath restaurant.I was wrong.Renegade was satisfactory, but we all agreed that nothing about it would bring us back.  While the restaurant's decor is modern and sleek, the atmosphere was kind of dull; not like the fun energy at Roaring Fork.  Service was alright (although Helene who delivered my wine was super friendly even though she was not our server).  The food and the check seemed to take a while...We started with the Green Chili Pork Stew and the Shrimp flatbread appetizers... neither one was a hit.  Jared took home the leftover stew but half the flatbread went to waste. A few of us had a couple of rounds of wine but Lindsey thought her sangria was too sweet and it also sat unfinished.  Entrees at the table included an entree salad, a shrimp appetizer, salmon and halibut... all were decent but nothing to write home about.We passed on dessert... Bottom line - Renegade Canteen is a nice addition to the area but it will not be a regular on my rotation.  I'm glad we tried it though!

Review Text :
Pho Nam must be short for pho-nam-men-nal! Oh no she didn't! Oh yes I did!  I was here for lunch today and it was so good!  Though my visit was around lunch time this place was pretty empty which I would generally take as a bad sign but the glowing reviews this place has let me know that I should not judge a book by its cover. The restaurant is large, clean, and bright; it's sometimes hard to get all three of these things with a restaurant.  The hostess was pleasant as well.  She was very attentive and sweet.  I ordered the combination fried rice and my guest the spring roll and a noodle dish.  We both really enjoyed our dishes. I asked for my rice to have an extra bit of kick to it and I was not dissapointed. The portions at this place are also really large.  I pretty much stuffed my face and looked down and realized that I had barely made a dent in my lunch.  You know what I call that?  Lunch for tomorrow! Hey!Yes, I love this place and I will certainly be back!I live less than a ten minute walk from this place, so I thought I'd check it out. The spring rolls (fresh, not fried) was pretty freaking amazing; the sauce was peanuty, sweet, and savory (and pretty perfect after I added some siraicha). I could eat those spring rolls every day (and I plan to).I love pho, but the broth is a tad lacking; however, it's savory and salty after you add some hoison and siraicha. I had to add almost two handfuls of cilantro, all the basil, and a whole lot of sauce and additives before I got the broth to be absolutely delicious (but by that time, the noodles had been sitting in there for quite a while). But I enjoyed the pho and the experience nonetheless.The menu is large. You can bet you won't experience a meal twice for a while (unless you plan to). Oh, and the alcohol menu is very, very small: 4 beers and one selection of wine, so don't come here to drink.Service is so fast; you can expect your appetizer within five minutes and your pho in seven. They refill your water pretty frequently, but this is from experiencing the restaurant when it was completely empty.Take-out / Carry-out service is spot on. They include hot broth, sauces, bean sprouts, cilantro, the whole shebang in your bag. They also include another larger empty container if you don't have a bowl that can hold the dish.Overall, I like this place. Planning on coming back and experiencing more dishes soon.I've never been so happy to live so close to Pho Nam. I stopped by the restaurant to get some pho to go. I've gotten to-go twice here, and the service is phenomenal. I can guarantee that you'll have your pho, ready to eat, in less than ten minutes. The broth has deep and spicy flavors that make you dig for more; for the prices you pay, it's worth the visit and more.One of the best experiences I have had with carry out has been with pho Nam. A few weeks ago, I called on a Sunday around half an hour before closing time. I asked for two bowls of pho and two spring rolls for carry out, and I told them that if it was inconvenient, I would order food another time. The man I was speaking to was so kind and so accommodating, and he said that my order wasn't a problem at all. Made me feel so welcome, and I appreciated the food all the more.I believe I was serviced by the same kind man again today when I ordered my pho. He is just the nicest man with a kind smile, and I feel welcome when he took my order. I couldn't wait to come back.Amazing food, great location, great service, best take out, and still some of the best spring rolls I've had. I cannot wait to come back.

Restaurant name  Tacos El Gordo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
So one of my fav  ex-yelper asked where Los Parados was located since she was hankering for a taco.  After a couple visits there she felt great tacos were to be had elsewhere.  A day later she proclaimed victory in finding a better taco at Tacos El Gordo.  Hmm... i'll be the judge of that ( then again, she speaks fluent spanish, knows mexican food like i know burgers so the reality is SHE'S THE JUDGE  not me ! ) All the tacos are $2  - they have about 10 varieties.  other options are tostada's ( also $2 ) and interestingly, asada fries which cost $10 ...$10 ?!?!?   okaaaay.When you come in , a lil unusual method of ordering - basically 4 separate lines based on which taco you order - english is definitely the 2nd language so be careful how you order, but the employees are very pleasant and work with you.  So i order a spicy pork, pork, asada and cabeza tacos.  You stand there as they chop the meat, place the meat on the freshly prepared tortillas ( you see the tortilla lady cooking away ) They put a guagamole/avocado sauce on the asada - very good .  the spicy pork had a creamy sauce, too - not sure what it was, but tasted great.  all had cilantro and onions.  btw - they also give you a plate of grilled green onions and a chile - wasn't sure what i was supposed to do with them - looked around - saw a few people gnawing on them - sure why not !  The cabeza was just ok, the pork was a lil on the fat side.  The tortillas were delicious ! I don't think i'll try the beef brain tacos ( not cabeza ) but the chorizo tacos looked great - next visit .Is it better than Parados ...it's very possible.  Further tastings are necessary.  Interestingly, this place is in the same center as a los tacos ( not a fan ) pics postedI was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.Good thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.The menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.The food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.My cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!I jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)I finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.Then I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.I gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.The only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.Will I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!If I'm going to rate this place, it's for 2 sole things: their slow roasted, tender meat(especially the suadero and spicy pork) and their free unlimited refills of horchata. What!? diosmio. Really though, there are more pluses. Keep in mind, their fresca cheese. Their salsa is spicy enough to sucker punch me in the mouth but not as an anesthetic, and I can still taste the fireworks of sauce and meat and celantro all mixed in. They're cooking and prepping right in front so you know there's no silly hide & seek games, "where are they taking my food?" Believe me, these kids are authentic Mexican grub-lords. They're more than willing to sample you a piece of their carne. That's how confident they are- and they earned it.It gets better, the ladies that work here don't joke about a clean environment. They're so fast, when a group heads out, they're already cleaning the table for the next..  All the workers are always smiling. 5 stars all day, and in my next 3 lifetimes.Very excellent taco shop serving up yummy, made with love, authentic street tacos south of the border right here in Las Vegas.OperatingHours:M-Th 9am-2amF-Sat 9am-4amI am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest d√©cor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with "what can I get you my friend?" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.Tace de Adoboda - ("Shepherd's Style") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!Taco de Lingua - The "tongue" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars.The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.D√©cor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right?Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph.Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast.Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice!Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall.Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.4 Stars!WHERE: Charleston & a little passed Maryland (toward the East).WHEN: I believe it's open until 3 or 4am. If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!I tried:Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good!Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol.Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS!Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!I'd love to try other things! This taco shop is way FLAVORFUL, FUN, AND OPEN UNTIL 4AM! Ch ch check it out!If you like grease, check it out! They serve grease in all forms at this fine establishment -- glistening on the surface of shreds and slabs of quivering meats, whipped into a slime and drizzled atop grilled-flesh-covered french fries, plastered on walls and windows and employees' faces...you can even get your grease as a sort of lacquer coating on grilled onions and jalapenos! They serve ALL FOUR grease food groups here!If you're an unhealthful, grease-lapping fatass, you'll dig it. But if you're a fitness-obsessed health nut who happens to be drunk and stumbling down the street at 3am, you'll like it too... shamefully enough.The best thing here is the people watching. It's ALWAYS packed with an amazing assortment of Mexican families, couples, kids, chunties and cholos. Even at 3am, there are familias with little kids sitting around eating and laughing and bullshitting! Since I find the food so abhorrent, I prefer to do my watching from the street, looking through the giant plate-glass windows at the hordes of obese people shoving greasy strips of meat into their greasy pieholes. It's like watching the Mexican version of Caligula, without all the Penthouse Pets.On the plus side, the staff is VERY friendly, even to drunken gueras like me. But even that won't really get me to come back here...unless I happen to be stumblingly drunk and starving in the immediate vicinity. And I live right down the block....D'OH!YUP. THESE GUYS ARE SO AUTHENTIC, YOU MIGHT NEED TO BORROW SOMEONE'S ROSETTA STONE SPANISH EDITION.When I got in line, there were about 3 people ahead of me. Each one of them ordered in Spanish. When it was my turn, the first thing I asked was, "Do you speak english?" The guy looked at me, smiled and said "Si!" I know that sounds funny but whatever I ordered, he translated it to his fellow compadres that were putting the food together. Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.So for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling. The person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL). As I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said "Gracias!" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, "No habla ingles!". As soon as I saw the look on her face I realized I just told her that I dont speak english! So in closing, you dont need to know Spanish to eat good food here. But in my case, it probably would of helped!Can you say PORK ADOBADA?!! Baboy introduced me to this place. Hands down THE BEST tacos I have EVER had!! They have the right amount of spice, they have slab on a rotating THINGY and the freshly slice the meat off into your perfectly sized taco! Get the pineapple added on there... a side of their HOT PEPPERS --They will leave your mouth on FIYAAAAAAAH and I LOVE me some HEAT in my food! Those peppers kick my ass and I LOOOOVE it! Also, the Adobada Fries!! Get a half order and it's still HUGE! The dollop of fresh guacamole makes it MMMMM FREAKIN GOOD!!waited in line for my "Adobada Taco" and after eating it I was bummed I didn't get 2 of them! For me it was the clear winner! Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the "Asada Taco" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called "Crack Tacos". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!The tacos here are magnificent. But before we get started with the big review, some quick tips.1. The meats are divided into sections with INDIVIDUAL lines!2. There are two locations for Tacos El Gordo, the second one being near the Encore.3. This locations prices are a little bit better, but if you're driving from the strip, it's probably more worth it to go to the first location.4. Try the Adobada tacos, their carne asada tacos are equally good too!5. For the Adobada tacos, everything means all the fixings EXCEPT for the pineapple! Ask the guy making them for a tiny slice of tacos.6. The fries come in three flavors: campenchana, adobada, or ANY meat. Don't be fooled that the sign says adobada or campenchana only.7. The fries come in half/full size, a half size is more than enough for two people to share and just right for three to sample!8. Plenty of parking! Two entrances!After discovering Tacos El Gordo on our second trip to Vegas, we have gone back every single time to eat at their fine establishment. There are MANY meats to choose from, but by far our favorite is the adobada. My personal one that I really like is the carne asada.What truly sets apart Tacos El Gordo is that they grill up/fry up their meat right in front of you. You can watch them cooking up your stuff and making the tacos. Another thing that I really enjoy is the great service. Every single time we've been there, they've always been really nice to me and my girlfriend. I think it might because they see us as Asians in a Mexican joint who have no idea what's going on. But beyond that, the place is really clean. They wipe down tables after people are done and the cleaning ladies usually offer to take our trays for us when we're still sitting down and finished.The last thing is the price. For Vegas, this place is a steal. We usually get somewhere from 6 tacos, a drink, and a half order of adobada fries for $20.Awesome food, awesome service, awesome price! What more could you want?!Oh. My. Gordo.When I see a spit full of deliciously spiced and marinated pig slowly rotating and being carved by a dude with a machete, I get in line. Immediately. Here at Tacos El Gordo, there are lines for their different meats: carne asada on the left, lengua and others in the middle, and al pastor on the right. Let's cut to the chase: get in the line on your right. The al pastor/adobada is PHENOMENAL and worthy of an ALL-CAPS adjective. Perfectly seasoned, tender with just a bit of char on the exterior, it's served on a warm, freshly made tortilla. Don't forget to ask for grilled jalapenos, onions, and pineapple on the side. The lines are long, but they move quickly. After you have your tray full of tacos (or fries, mulas, sopas, quesadillas, or tostadas), go to the cashier and pay. You also buy your drinks here. It's your typical taco shop ambiance, casual and divey, yet clean and friendly. On our initial visit, my wife and I were wandering around trying to find  seats when one of the workers cleared out a space near the cash register just for us. Excellent service!Ignore the reviewers complaining about the $2 per taco price tag. Each taco is generously filled with al pastor that is much better than what you'll find at your typical restaurant or truck. In fact, I'd bet that these same reviewers would gladly pay $2 for 2 tacos with less meat (and of lower quality) because it sounds like a better deal. It only takes one taste of Tacos El Gordo's al pastor to know you're getting your money's worth and then some. Highly recommended.Greasy, carby food always sounds good after drinking. Actually, pretty much anything tastes good after drinking...except for more alcohol.We went here after a fun night at the club. The other location on the Strip was way too packed and we were way too hungry to wait 30 minutes to stand in line and find a table with other drunk people on the same mission. A 10-minute drive and wait at this location trumps that.We got horchata, carne Asada fries and tacos al pastor.Carne Asada Fries:Even the small portion was a lot. Warm fried potatoes loaded with cheese, carne Asada and guac. 4/5Tacos al Pastor:Spicy meat. Yup, that's all I can remember so, I'm not even going to attempt to be descriptive about it. 4/5We were the only Chinos in this area at 3am. It's all good.Vegas has tacos ya'll. I repeat, Vegas.. has.. tacos.. y'all.I'm not talkin' about your gourmet fish tay-co or the horrid generic ground beef. No, no, no..Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries. Thirsty? From horchata & agua frescas to my favorite.. Orange Bang, Bang.. Baby. Like a mother and her child, the drinks and food go hand in hand. Then into my stomach. Not the mother and the child, the food, you sicko.The staff is pleasant, usually smiling and constantly moving.. This place is well kept and presented in a welcoming manner.  It truly reminded me of a few taco joints back home in LA, and that's a great thing! Amazing food, fair prices, up-to-par service and an alright location. Tacos El Gordo has the Nevada taco game on lockdown!This place might be the most chaotic taco shop you've ever stepped foot into, but it might be the best you've ever had. Before you enter, know that there are three separate lines for food. Each line represents a variety of different meats - just take a gander at the sign in front of each window to see if your favorite protein falls under that category. The crappy part? If you want multiple types, then you need to stand in different lines. That's why the buddy system works wonders, especially if you all want a little of everything. Even then we still ended up consuming partially cold food because we were greedy and wanted stuff from each of the queues in the restaurant.I heard this is a step up from the previous location that had almost no seating. We came on a Friday night and it was definitely jam packed with peeps, but we were able to secure a table for four without any problems. Again, this is where the buddy system comes into play and everyone needs to do their due diligence - it's almost fun how you all need to work together to ensure you don't starve at the end of it all.I would run down each of the taco meats we had, but the spicy pork, chorizo and asada variations were all delicious. Not only that, they were STUFFED with meat and I had to eat some with a fork before trying to finish it off with my hands. No complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic. I do think the extra love and flavor comes from their amazing handmade, in-house created tortillas. Those things were perfecto in my eyes.One thing that is a must is their asada fries. You're able to get it with any meat, but the beef was fab. We got the large to share amongst four, full grown adults and we barely finished. We were so full after the various tacos we had just pounded that it took a lot of courage and energy to muster up the strengeth to finish this heaping amount of delicious fries topped with steak, guac, cheese, and sour cream. You're gonna feel like you're about to give birth when you're done, but every bite is worth the pain you'll feel after over eating.Parking is a cinch as they share spaces with a huge shopping center.If you're in Vegas, you have to check this place out. It's delicious!"What is cabeza?"  I stupidly question my bud (an American via Mexico)."It's you know." he says, using two hands to point to his crotch."What the?  I'm not eating penis tacos!" I say to an explosion of laughter."No, no, no." he chokes, now pointing to his head.Having been many times before with Spanish speaking buds who handle all the ordering and just watch me eat their handiwork, I decided on this fateful visit to learn for myself what it's about.That said, Tacos El Gordo serves up incredible, if not the best tacos in Vegas. House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).Outstanding  "normal" proteins including:- Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity.- Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.Offal selections include:- Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.  - Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture.- Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty.- Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness.- Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).In a word:  outstanding.Always dependable for late night tacos.This is really a nostalgic review this spot when it was right by the Encore. It was the best to see hot messes while you were devouring hot messes. It was always packed as all hell.For some reason it always amazed me that they took plastic.If you happen to be in Vegas, this is worth a stop, even in the daytime.

Restaurant name  Rico's American Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Woo hoo! I'm a fan of Rico's. For starters: they've got a great happy hour and it runs until 7 so you can realistically hit them up after work without getting a speeding ticket on your way there. Happy hour includes a couple $2 drafts (and other drink specials), as well as, some half price "appetizers" which include a jalapeno, bacon, cheese burger. Hello! But it's also a great lunch option. It's spacious and you can have a private conversation with your lunch date without being squished up against other diners. Lighter dishes are available BUT remember this spot for when you're craving comfort food and get the kick-A meatloaf sandwich. It's open faced, piled high with onion strings and doused with their kitchen's secret spicy ketchup. WARNING: it's totally cravable!Expensive but VERY tasty breakfast buffet. Debbie was our server, but I felt she was cold - she was overly direct in her communication style and lacked warmth (which I expect from all servers). I used to be a server, and have admittedly high expectations for service. She abruptly asked  (almost barked) for breakfast vouchers "if we had them..." for all she knew we were locals.  She did the thing where you hurriedly hold your hand out and bend your fingers as if to say "gimme, hurry." The problem was we had a stack of $10 vouchers, and didn't know the total. We asked for the amount and she said "I don't know," almost annoyed. We had to tell her, ok... So go give us the total... She then tallied it up and told us the total over the railing. It was weird, and rude! I am convinced she pegged us as resort guests from the start, which we were, and just expected vouchers and an insufficient tip. We tipped her the full/standard amount on the total (pre-voucher price), but had she smiled, slowed down and showed some warmth, it would have made a huge difference and I MAY have given this 4-5 stars on Yelp. However, most of the overall experience when dining out is the service. As such, Rico's is left with a 3-star-rating from me. It's important to note we were one of three tables at 9:15am on a weekday - so it's not like she was in the weeds. I will add, to her credit, we lingered after paying and she checked back with us - and we asked for to-go cups for coffee, which she obliged. So... Let's talk about the details of the restaurant and the food. This is on the edge of The Squaw Peak Hilton Resort, and it's actually a mid-tier modern Mexican restaurant. It's nicely appointed and we were promptly greeted and seated by a nice young man. The menu was limited but had great options! Most entrees are $13, plus coffee and drinks are $3/each, while the buffet is just under $17. So if you get a drink, you may as well get the buffet because it includes your drinks. The buffet was nicely laid out with great FRESH fruit, yogurts, cottage cheese, etc. they have fresh squeezed juices, and cereal. Across from that there is an omelet station with a friendly omelet chef (not sure what else to call him.) I ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and very light oil, and asked for light cheese. He was great in accommodating my requests - sadly I had several pieces of egg shell, but spit them out and it wasn't a huge deal. I sort of appreciate knowing it was made with real eggs - but would naturally prefer no shells... They have hot syrup, fresh fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, etc. All of it frankly was fresh and perfectly prepared. They had the most incredible oatmeal - it had all kinds of stuff in it (oats, grains, quinoa, etc.). Add some honey, brown sugar and golden raisins and it's perfect! Oddly, it was SUPER tasty (I'm not usually an oatmeal person). They serve tasty Starbucks coffee - which I loved. Just check your cup... My first cup had a solid teaspoon of grains at the bottom! I dumped it in my water glass before she refilled me and it was fine after that. Then, there's the pastry station - yum! Super high quality and tasty muffins, croissants, and other carb-a-licious treats (plus fruit preserves). One person in our party had the eggs Benedict, and it was frankly delicious!  Net, breakfast breakfast was great (but pricy at nearly $17/pp), and our server was attentive/took great care of us, but wasn't welcoming/warm. The advice I would give Debbie is to simply smile, slow down, and exude some warmth and compassion. It would make for a better experience and probably increase her tips.If my review and photos were helpful, please let me know with the voting buttons... It encourages me to take the time to write these reviews.

Restaurant name  Technique Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Food-wise, I'm definitely a fan of Technique. But like Big Wong, the price point just sets it over the top. $15 for a five-course meal? As Axel Foley would say... "Get the F outta here!"Before we even ordered, they brought each of us some salmon tartar on a cracker. It was a nice touch to start the meal as we waited for everyone to arrive. I had their Mango Iced Tea to wash everything down. It had a nice hint of mango and was very enjoyable.On to the courses...Cream of Mushroom (Soup of the Day) - Very flavorful and had a nice consistency. Solid start.Lobster Endive Salad - The Duck Confit was tasty and tender. Not enough of it (and the lobster), obviously, but pretty good salad overall.Technique Salad - A pretty basic salad, but the avocado was incredibly creamy and added a lot to the mix.Filet Mignon - My medium-rare steak was perfectly cooked, was a very nice cut of meat, and was very tender throughout. The radishes, beet, pur√©ed potatoes, and the b√©arnaise sauce were excellent complements to the filet. The spinach was pretty flavorless, though.Pumpkin Cr√®me br√ªl√©e - Didn't have a hard crust, but I actually welcomed that. My favorite part is the inside anyway. It was the perfect level of sweetness and creaminess. It came with a gingerbread cookie that was very hard - the complete opposite of the way I like cookies to come out.So with only the spinach and the cookie being detractors, I'd say Technique has their technique down pat. The service was on point. The wait staff was very friendly and my glass of iced tea never dipped below half. Well done Cordon Bleu. I will most definitely return.I came with the BF finally after wanting to try this but rarely having the opportunity on a weekday to be off together. We went for dinner on 6/20. They have gotten rid of the 5 courses, and now do 3 courses for $16. Appetizers we shared: Israeli cous cous salad with  cucumber carpaccio and pickled  red onions. It was very simple and not much to it, but it was clean and refreshing. Vegetable medley with apples in a light curry cream sauce served with pilaf in a tomato was actually really good. The vegetables were all cooked just right to where they are soft, but still have bite, the curry was really nice. It was actually pretty hearty and could be a meal in itself. Entree I had poached salmon, sauteed spinach and rice pilaf. The poach on it was done right, and the rice and spinach was seasoned but it was missing something. There was a bit of sauce bercy and the description said basil oil which I did not see so it may have been forgotten. The BF had herbed mustard pork loin which we thought was odd to have been thin sliced and battered since the description didn't really sound anything like how it was. It was a tad salty for the BF and my taste. the buttermilk cheddar mashed potatoes were good, the veggies were cooked well, and the parmesan roasted tomato was a nice tasty touch. Dessert the almond cookies duo (one plain, one chocolate) were nice and crumbly and were paired with a well done bright raspberry sorbet. The panna cotta though was more like just white jello. There was too much gelatin in it when it should have been just enough to set the cream mixture. Overall though the food was good and there was some pride in presentation. The service was alright. Our server was didnt say much at all and was softspoken to where some of it we didn't know what she said. I found it weird that she  never came up to ask us how everything was while we were eating, never checked on us if we needed anything, no thanks for coming, come see us again, have a good night, etc. at the end of the meal.  It's a open room and we can see a lot of the front staff is horsing around and talking including our server instead of doing their job. When walking out there was a bunch of servers and the maitre d by the door who did not greet people leaving because they were talking amongst themselves and have "checked out" already.  I get that this is still "school" but you're still serving real people who are paying money so this is just like any other business. Some people didn't seem to take it very seriously or learn much from school from how they presented themselves as servers. Maybe harsh, but if these are students that are going to graduate soon then I would think they would cover basic service points so I feel it's fair to call them out on it. Upon dining, I'm a bit surprised that there wasn't any comment cards for diners....if this is for the students to learn from, shouldn't they hear feedback on the good and bad? I know that maybe they don't want to hurt feelings with really ragey commentary but perhaps the instructor can read and use valid critiques into instructing the class. Hopefully the school reads Yelps at least! It's my first time and I know it changes with each class. I will be back as the concept is interesting and the general quality is good.

Restaurant name  Snow Ono Shave Ice
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
SnOw OnO  is so ono!  The best shave ice I've had was in Hawaii, with all the imitators here in Vegas selling "shave ice" that has the consistency of a snow cone: chunks of hard ice that doesn't allow the flavor syrups to seep in.  Marianne of SnOw Ono starts with a block of ice, and shaves it to a fresh snow-like consistency, which allows the syrups to soak into every bite and makes for a very pleasing consistency!Speaking of syrups, there are plenty to choose from; 34 were listed on their menu today: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=BooUS55rP6XFtxwKzPOgNA  There are several add ons that you can use to customize your shave ice, some free and some available for only an additional $0.50 or $1.00.  Today I went with a small Li Hing Mui with Li Hing Mui powder: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=Gybt5eAcCrTM_VMPYnrD2w ; it was delicious!  Seriously, Marianne knows what she's doing (she's a self admitted shave ice addict, afterall!).  Definitely a place to revisit.  Be on the lookout for SnOw OnO at the local farmers markets, especially Fresh52 every Sunday!We love these girls and we love their shaved ice!SnOw OnO has been on our radar since the first mention of their truck and we finally got around to trying them a few months ago!  Boy, are we glad we did!For the Husband and I, we usually share a large with ice cream added.  Our favorite flavors are POG (Passion, Orange, Guava), Mango, Tiger's Blood, and Melona.  But there are still so many we have yet to try! They use those plastic flower cups (that are recyclable) that are often used in Hawai'i.  We think their version is powdery soft, just like Waiola's!  They have about 40 (give or take) flavors of syrups to choose from and you're allocated three for your shaved ice choice.  They also have sugar-free varieties too!Customer service - these girls are super nice!  Not only do they do their best to remember you, but they make a point to thank you for coming by again and again.  (And you actually feel like they really mean it too!)  On our first visit, they made sure we had enough syrup for our shaved ice and if we didn't, to let them know so they could add more.  This the real deal here!  No snow cone action!  Just real island style shaved ice!  The President would be proud!  If he can't make it home and has to stay on the mainland, he knows where to go now!  This truck will be waiting!Prices:Kids size $2Small $3Large $4Bowl $5$1 extra for ice cream, mochi, or azuki beansFree for snow cap with condensed milk, chocolate, caramel, sour spray, or li hing powder. Check out their website for their weekly schedule.  For the most part, they are pretty steady on certain days, but private and special events mix it up a bit!

This Cafe is located near the lobby of the Marriott.They have a full bar right near the hostess stand. The cafe isnt very big but they manage to keep the people moving in and out. We ate breakfast for 2 days and lunch other day. We did a buffet breakfast. They have the typical eggs, bacon, sauage, fruit you know the usual food. It was good though. We also had lunch and there burgers are awesome. I was happy that our hotel had such good food. If you an elite member at the hotel you get a free breakfast.

Review Text :
Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.I really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.They also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!I would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.You should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!!

Restaurant name  Buzz BBQ

Review Text :
Finally a good BBQ place in the southwest! Buzz just opened up about a week or two ago. It's owned by 3 guys and this is their second location (the original place is off of Craig Road). I stopped by and ordered a brisket sandwich ($8.00) to go. As I waited I chatted with the hostess and one of the owners. Both were incredibly nice and raved about some of their specialties. The brisket didn't disappoint. It was a huge mound of soft and tender beef brisket on a sesame seed bun. The BBQ sauce that accompanied it had a little kick to it but was also a little on the sweet side... maybe a little too sweet. But, it was still a delicious and filling sandwich. Their fries are also excellent.I'll definitely be back to try some ribs and pulled pork. They had their smoker set up on the patio so the whole parking lot had that amazing BBQ smell.

Review Text :
Ahh our second anniversary...we wanted to make it special and try out a few items at KALU to start the night off right. Overall, an B for effort, D for execution. Hubs and I made an 8 pm reservation on Monday night...yes, I expected it to be pretty dead on a Monday evening, but it was our anniversary so we didn't care. We drove up and circled the building for 10-15 minutes trying to find a place to park. After pulling into and out of a handful of different restricted parking lots, we chose the lot across the street from the restaurant. The sign said $5 after 7 pm but the closer of the two scary little boothes was "out of order." So, we rolled in to sit down.Upon entering we asked about parking - where the eff do you park around here? The lot across the street, for $5 apparently. And make sure you pay, because they do come often and check! So, hubs trekked back out to the working (scary) booth to take care of it. FYI - the booth takes cards. Overall, not an awesome start...and they don't have valet on the weekends either.On to the ambiance - it's lovely inside. Tons of modern Asian influences and big, BIG tables - which was a bit weird for us and we were sat at a 5-top with only two people. Not so romantico, but whatev. Our waitress, Lolita, was super sweet and offered a few different options to work through the menu...I will say, though, if there were more people in the restaurant we wouldn't have been able to hear her! She is incredibly soft spoken. Chef Bryan is also extremely hospitable and really made sure that we were comfortable with the menu and ensured that we enjoyed our dishes. And food...here's what we ordered:KALU Ginger Ale: 2/5: An interesting and super sweet combo of ginger ale and an assortment of upscale booze. A little too sweet for me. Wasabi Roll: 4/5 (on the house): Chef Bryan sent this out and made sure that we could "handle the heat." Indeed we can! It was a great start and completely cleared my sinuses! I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was different versions of wasabi, shiso and rice. Rock shrimp tempura: 1/5: Mah-jah bummer here. I was expecting something completely different...I read tempura shrimp and seasonal vegetables...what came out were huge clumps of french fries with a tiny amount of shrimp and scattered veggies. Pork Shu Mai: 2/5: Meh...I didn't like the flavor of the pork...but I know hubs did, though. Not a bad deal for the price...3 for $9. I'd like to try the shrimp next time. Wagyu steak: 3/5: (cooked on the rock): A delicious cut of meat, albeit extremely overpriced at $25. Instead of the pesto topping, it was made with black sesame - a really nice touch. So, will I be back to Kalu? Doubtful...especially considering the cost!Konichiwa! Kalu is located in the bottom of the Courtside building with little signage, but they now have a valet.  I had high expectations when making the reservations after reading a couple articles about it. Then I visited Yelp and say these very mixed reviews. When we first arrived they sat us in the bar area, which has a vibrant, loud atmosphere but there were a few drunk men making a raucous so we asked to be moved once our third person arrived so we wouldn't have to eat dinner in Animal House. Once we got sat in the dining room near the kitchen it was much more civilized. It looked like they had upstairs seating which I bet they use on weekends.The server who was very friendly said up front that it was tapas style, so it's made to share and it comes out when it's ready. In our case we got 5 things and it was perfectly timed to arrive as soon as we finished the course before.  We ordered:-Edamame to tide us over until the 1st course came. 5/5-Their "Chicken wings" - absolutely delicious teriyaki flavor with a lovely crunch from the potato starch they use as covering  5/5 - must have!-Hamachi sashimi on the lit ice bowl 5/5  I couldn't really taste the truffle oil which supposedly was on it but it was so delicious, fresh and almost melted in my mouth. I did study abroad in Japan, so I was really looking forward to seeing the quality of the sashimi. I could almost "cut it with my tongue".-Unagi, avocado and Japanese Peppercorn sushi - 2/5  Only 4 pieces came with this roll and I was thankful it wasn't 8. It was our server's fave roll, but it didn't sit well with me. First of all these kind of fancy complex rolls with lots of ingredients aren't found in Japan so this was really to cater to us. There was some sweet flavor that was a little funky and possibly they had Chinese five spice to the sauce. I love black pepper and usually I can never have too much, but these peppercorns had a totatlly different flavor. One of our party liked it. I couldn't really get to the quality of the eel though. As a result there was 1 unwanted piece at the end.-Wagyu skirt steak skewer with green onion and garlic chips.  4/5 Make sure this is at the end of the meal because it is really a distinctive steak that is very good but very garlicky. We all loved it-Chef's treat of rice with "truffles" but it was crimini and shittake mushrooms which was 5/5 - delish. One of our party was freaked by the crimini, but she's from the Midwest :) So the food was definitely what we all hoped it would be and the plating was exquisite.  So we were ready to cleanse the palate and dive into dessert but the server said that "japan isn't really into sweets" so they only have 1 dessert of the night and that night it was a citrus creme. I enjoyed it because it kind of reminded me of something from my childhood but the other two girls didn't touch theirs after the first bite. So given the selection (or lack thereof) and the group's rating, I have to give it a 2/5   Since Chef Emperor catered to American tastes of all the sushi rolls, I don't know why he wouldn't also throw a couple other things on the dessert menu like green tea ice cream, mochi or tempura ice cream,  or a nice citrus cake.  Maybe he should outsource his desserts to me :) This is the main reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Our total at the end of the night for food was $90 for 3 and wine was $75 which obviously we could have done without. I expected much worse for the food.Would I go back? Absolutely. Hopefully they've worked out all the kinks by now.  I am glad though that I didn't go on a busy weekend. Oishii desu.

I must update this review.. This place is on the way out.. It went from 5 stars to 2!!! The managers and the best bartender have bailed and their service has gone to *beep*.   I knew they were trying to change into more of a bar than a restaurant but come on guys.. I have ordered the lettuce wraps multiple times here and they have always been excellent.  They brought out medium size raggity old spinach leaves and lower quality cold beef.. Twice..  Ughhh.. Im so disappointed.  Especially because it is in such a good location. Sorry guys. It actually pains me to write this.  I was waiting weeks to write this and gave it multiple second chances.. I even got ROTD for my 5 star review of this place.. Ugh!-Ian M.This place is a low down dirty shame. It's a shame that service and ingredients were not just in short supply, they were.........well, non-existent. I wanted to really to like the place because the food was really good, but dang, how can I when they don't even have rice?The special lil' lady threw a surprise bday dinner and I graciously thank her for that. The restaurant's been remodeled and a complete change  from the previous tenant. Also, the views are still pretty impressive. On top of that, the food was seriously really good. Best Chinese I've had in a while. Enough with the praise though, lets get back to reality. Let the rant begin shall we? There was only like two servers and one of them was the owner. They ran out of bread for banh mi. They ran out of egg rolls. Crab won tons were missing crab. There wasn't proper ventilation so the entire restaurant smelled like smoke, thus probably leaving you smelling like chow mein for a week, and to top it all off they ran out of rice. Yes you heard me, they ran out of rice. How the heck? So anyways, aside from all of those "slight mishaps", I can honestly say the scallion chicken was pretty dang good. I just wish I had some rice. With such good food, it seems they have a lot of potential. I just sure hope they clean up their act, because I do want to see them succeed. I do plan to return for lunch in the near future, and please just have some rice!

It's Nathan's, which is normally very good....but for some reason, the airport locations aren't as good.  This one was just average....but it did the job and I was no longer hungry.Return Factor - 60%

Restaurant name  Luna's Living Kitchen

Review Text :
Menu is totally vegan, some raw. The burger (not raw) was one of the best I've had since moving to CLT - pleasantly warm, smoky and satisfying, big dollop of guac on top. Super tasty bun. Microgreens everywhere. Like eating a tiny forest.Pastries and bread available for take away, lots of brekkie options. Good coffee, and for an extra .75, you can add a shot of homemade coconut, hemp, or almond milk. Tastes awesome.But the entrees are really where Luna's shines. Raw/whole/vegan art food. Prices are high - sammiches 8-9, entrees 12-13. Yes, it's worth it. Probably the healthiest dinner in town. Let's keep them in bidness, ya'll!While I don't think I could ever eat (and live) life as a vegan or even a vegetarian, Luna's Living Kitchen gave me a really nice experience with that potentially difficult cuisine! I strolled in for a leisurely lunch and ordered up Lunasagna and a lemonade, upon the nice staffer's recommendation. Price wise, Luna's is higher than you'll pay at many a local spot, but the incredibly fresh ingredients can't be cheap (my lunch came to $15). I snagged a stool seat and took in a bit of work for about 10 minutes or so before my order came out. My Lunasagna was so fresh and just gorgeous. Seriously - go check out my picture. The portions were ample and I was really surprised by all the flavor that burst out of the layers, sauce, strands of veggies and cashew bits. The greens accompanying the lunasagna were just about perfect, so much so that next time I'll focus more on a salad packed with Luna's delicious produce. For those who think that vegan cuisine is boring and bland, I recommend trying a meal at Luna's. It may not change your way of life or daily cuisine, but the flavor packed items will surprise you in the best way!Luna's Living Kitchen is an oasis amongst eateries offering comfort food to the extreme. Don't get me wrong... Fried chicken, buttery biscuits and calorie dense mac & cheese hold a special place in my heart (and stomach!). But you won't find any of that at Luna's Living Kitchen. Their carefully thought out plates of well executed (and beautiful) food proved to me that you don't need refined sugar, preservatives, eggs, dairy, or animal products to deliver delicious food. Raw food was a foreign concept to me. It sounded boring and dull. I imagined a vegans diet consisted of eating carrot sticks, celery, and salads all days. I left Luna's with a changed view of the vegan diet and an immense appreciation for how delicious vegan cuisine could be. My girlfriend and I made our way to Luna's on a Saturday afternoon. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful day. Our waitress was attentive and helpful in offering suggestions. I opted for the Fire & Brimstone veggie burger and she chose the Living Burrito. We both ordered coffee with homemade coconut milk. My burger (one of the few cooked items) was amazing. The chipotle sunflower hummus added a nice, subtle, spiciness. My friend really enjoyed her Living Burrito. She was amazed at how well the collard leaf worked as a wrap. The coffee was nice and strong and the coconut milk added a great flavor to it. I am really looking forward to sampling more of Luna's menu. The Iced Coffee with coffee ice cubes sounds awesome and so do many of the smoothies. Yes, the prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for. Fresh, high quality, local ingredients (we saw a chef walk into Atherton Market and emerge with a fresh bunch of Collard greens!!) prepared in a way that is sure to please any palate! I can't wait to go back!Nothing else like it in Charlotte.  The best juices and living food within 100 miles.I was quite dismayed when I pulled up today and Luna's was no longer there.  Then I turned around and saw they just moved across the parking lot.  A much better location with more outdoor seating.  Still the same love being put in to all the juices and drinks.So many amazing options to choose from, but this time I just went with the chillied chai.  I should have gone for a berry smoothie, after I tried somebody else's, but no complaints on my end.  My chai was smooth and almond milk creamy.  Just the little kick I needed to continue my day.Not to much to tell ya on this one as I didn't get any food, but will be back soon!

Restaurant name  Rani's World Foods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Finally...my peeps have made it to Las Vegas. Rani's World Foods is an Indian Grocery Store/Chaat Stand that can hold it's own against the mega stores in California and Texas. This store has an amazing array of Indian groceries, frozen foods, produce and to kick it up a notch, they even offer Chaat (Indian snacks) that are served up in their in-house kitchen. We had gone for their opening today and it was a zoo...way too many people and the lines to check out were 20/30 minutes long. But...I had to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these guys have everything an Indian cook/home may need or want. Pickles, multiple lentil varieties, exotic Indian vegetables, flour, spices...everything was perfectly laid out and easy to find. This store is definitely bigger than any other Indian store in Las Vegas. It's well-lit, well-organized and well-stocked. The trifecta. Bonus points to them for their frozen food selections which were not unnecessarily marked up in price - something that the other Indian grocery stores seem to be doing that I frown upon. Gopal's for example, crosses out the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or two more. These guys don't (at least not yet). I haven't had a chance to taste their Chaat offerings as today was free food for all and so the lines were out of control. I hope to have a follow up report some time soon. An Indian store in Las Vegas that rivals Wal Mart. Wow...never thought I'd live to see this day :)The place is clean and very organized and it was nice to be able to find everything we needed easily...They also have serve food...different types of chaat and other snacks as well as mithai....The lady running the food section  is extremely sweet and welcoming..we went to order bhel puri and she offered us pakoras from a fresh hot batch she had just fried. I should never go to the grocery store when hungry cause I ended up also ordering a samosa chat. The portions are huge and I was full after eating some of the bhel! Also, they have free tea which is great..I was also impressed with their customer orientation...the guy at the cash register mentioned alternatives to some stuff we had bought. He even replaced a cauliflower we had chosen stating that it didn't look very good...I will definitely go again even though its a distance from home.We recently fell into an affair with Indian food. If they cook it, we have/will eaten/eat there! It led to a search of cookbooks with many spices I had no clue where to find locally. A little search on Yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants! The BF and I ate at the food booth in the back and shared a  vegetarian thali (comes with 2 dishes-among several choices, dal, rice, pickles, 2 bread:$5.99), samosa chat (I believe $3.99) and a paneer stuffed paratha w/ yogurt ($2.99). It was plenty of food for two and all very nice. I am a big fan of the samosa chat here though. The chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more. There is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area. If you're in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal, definitely drop in. Grocery side has everything we were looking for! They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you're not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not. I suppose it's hit and miss, but hey, it's packet food and isn't anything like the fresh. Eat, cook and be merry!My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, "International Market? That looks interesting."  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, "$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!"So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.The reason for the trip to Rani's was that a friend who lived nearby was looking for some special seasonings for a special dish to prepare. I decided I wouldn't mind going on a field trip and possibly discover some treats that were new to me. Neither one of us had lunch yet and were delighted to find that they had a little restaurant inside! Yay! A 2 in 1! Seeing that it was a new store to the both of us and how we LOVE to peruse international markets for hidden gems we combed the place. No aisle was overlooked. No shelf was neglected. We searched high and low for any and everything. He found the spices that he was looking for. The shelves were well stocked and the place was nice and clean. The place is obviously cared for in that respect. I did notice that things were higher priced here compared to what I have seen in other international markets around town. That was a bit of a disappointment. By the time we were all set to purchase there was no one at the cash register. We looked around and only saw other customers doing their shopping. We saw the bell by the register area and rang it once. The cashier came quickly and rang us up. She didn't greet. She didn't say anything actually. She just held out her hand for the money and practically threw the change at my friend. I thought it was quite rude. We tried to ignore it as we were plenty hungry by this time and wanted to get down to the grub!We made our way to the "restaurant" area. There was already a few people in line. We got in behind them as we tried to decide what we would order. The food that finally came to them did not look appetizing. Everything looked like leftovers just slopped on picnic-ware. It seemed to be taking an extraordinary amount of time for preheated food to be served. We decided to go across the street to find some lunch. I won't be returning to this place. With the overpriced groceries and poor service, it is enough to keep me away.Compared to a typical Indian grocery store, This place is very clean and organized. All the isles are properly marked and doesn't smell like a Temple(mixed smell of about 5 mil incense sticks)Kitchen looks very clean and some great items on the menu with close to homemade taste. Their inhouse sweets are just ok but they are fresh, not frozen for a week shipped from NY or Chcago.My only issue here is service. The lady at the front cash register is so rude, I don't even go inside the store because if her. Absolutely no greeting, no smile and if you ask her a question, lets just say you'll regret it.EDIT: Service has somewhat improved and I feel the review should be changed a bit. Changing from 1 start to 3 till my next visit. Keep up the good work.Anyways, here are my very accurate ratingsCleanliness 9.5/10Organized 9/10Variety 8.5/10Food/Kitchen 7/10Service 5/10Location/Parking 7/10Update!I went back here about two weeks ago to pick up a BIG box of tea...they were closed.  So, my friend and I were going to get back in the car to go kill time till they opened.The older woman who runs the kitchen knocked on the glass and motioned for us to come in.  She opened an hour early for us. THAT is grade A service.  The young lady who rang us up commented about me making "a cup" of tea in a joking manner, so we joked a little, but then I said how PG Tips is my favorite, and she AND the older woman made conversation with me about how its their favorite too.So personable, and spectacular!  :)An Indian friend of mine brought me here to purchase mixes for Indian desserts and I was so surprised by the variety of foods and grocery items this store offered. They had an array of spices, snacks and beauty items available. As for the prepared foods, they had over a dozen desserts made (I didn't get to try these,) but I did snack on chole bhattura (hot, fried bread with a side of tasty chickpeas,) and pani puri (puffed bread that you fill with cold chickpeas and potatoes and chutney.)They also had Indian chai tea (not your typical Starbucks chai,) that was available for hot food patrons. Did I mention this place is vegetarian? I'm an avid meat eater, and this place had the most delicious vegetarian Indian food for a reasonable price. I will be heading back here very soon.This city has a million ethnic specialty grocers: this one stands apart from the pack a little. In addition to a smorgasbord of Indian spices, rices, and teas, they have jewelry, accessories, and some kitchenware as well.Food sections also include  Mediterranean aisle and a British/English foods row. Unfortunately, the produce is not particularly fresh but they have tons of sweets from nearly every culture here.The food counter on the right hand side of the store sells vegetarian indian foods: mostly paneers, dosas, and chaats. The samosas are tasty and the chutneys and other sauces are no joke. Pricing is good, just wish they offered a bit more and weren't necessarily limited to a vegetarian menu.Insider note; they have 6 locations of Rani's, this is the only one in LV and there's another in Houston with the rest in California.

I dislike chains, but its 1am on a Thursday night. After a horrible night I needed some good old fashion comfort food. Place clean, no wait, waitress on the ball with refills.

They are open from about 11 Am - 3:30 PM Mon - Fri in the winter.They are open from about 11 AM to about 6 PM Mon - Fri in the summer.  According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.  The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.  The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.  The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.    The Mango Lassi is good for only $1.50I think they make the food while you wait.  Call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines.If you happen to find yourself in Oakland and in need of a quick lunch time fix, walk on down to bigelow blvd and give one of the street vendors a try. I previously ordered from thai express- it was 2:30ish and they were out of pad thai already so I had to settle for something else that I can't remember so I guess it didn't leave that big of an impression on me. Id give it another try though.I digress,  it was around 1 and I had a craving for something, but couldn't pinpoint what that something was. I knew I wanted it spicy and I wanted it now so I drove to oakland from greenfield with $6 and got a whole container of fluffy white rice topped with spicy palak paneer. The cheese cubes held up nicely to the velvety spinach. It satisfied my craving and didn't put a hole in my wallet.  For $5 and 5 minutes of your time, you can't beat india on wheels.I hit this truck for lunch earlier this afternoon.  After glancing over the reviews, I called ahead to place my order.  I thought 10 min. would be sufficient, but the guy on the phone told me it would take 20.  So, I gave them 15 min. before heading down to pick up my order.Based on others' recommendations, I ordered a small chicken tikka masala.  Given that the curry I'd ordered from the truck next door had been unbearably spicy for my taste at my normal spice level of 4, I decided to play it safe and order my dish with a spice level of 3.  I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it, which I typically order with Indian dishes.  Both items cost $6 together, which is a bargain, even in Oakland.Both the presentation and quality of the food at this truck were comparable to that of the truck next door.  The dish consisted mostly of rice and curry, with a few large chunks of chicken on top.  The chicken varied in quality, with some chunks consisting of questionable quality dark meat, and one chunk consisting of white meat.  The curry had a decent flavor and consistency, but was rather bland in terms of heat, which was a surprise after receiving super-spicy curry from the truck next door.  As for the mango lassi, it was similar to the one I received from the truck next door in its thin and rather watery consistency.Although the food from this truck isn't something I'd go out of my way for, it's a convenient lunchtime option, esp. for college students and people who work at Pitt or Presby Hospital.  In addition to taking phone orders, this truck is on Tapingo.  Regardless of how you order, just be sure to allow enough time for them to make it, given that the food is MTO.

Review Text :
It was definitely a pleasant surprise the first time ventured into Tryst Cafe.  Everything was so fresh, delicious, perfectly cooked, and the portions were substantial.   The restaurant has very spacious, wide open layout with trendy tables/seating in the patio area.   If you are at Desert Ridge, skip the chain restaurants, and head over to Tryst Cafe instead!   - Hummus Trio (traditional, cilantro, and red pepper) come with fresh Pita or cucumbers (Gluten Free).   - Tryst Ahi Tuna salad - Excellent portion and very fresh.  I would just ask for extra dressing on the side.- Portobello Sandwich - It was very juicy, tasty and satisfying.  The grilled bell peppers and Portobello will fall off of your sandwich. - Monte Cristo (two French toast slices, ham, Gruyere cheese topped with strawberry jam) - it is not greasy, and melted perfectly with the Gruyere cheese.  - Sweet potato tots are the best!  Try dipping with hummus dips if you have any left.  Skip the regular ketchup.What a deal!  All food and drinks are half off 3-6 everyday.  After 5PM receive 2 for 1 cocktails.Was here for happy hour once before with Mom- I'll have to search for the photos and add that review soon.I was looking for something sweet, something French, actually, and was heading to the Herb Box to see what kind of goodies I could find to take home to supply my brain w/ much-needed glucose (the organ's favored source of sugar!) when the Yelp app alerted me of the "seasonal" bread pudding at Tryst.  I called to ask which variety was available today and was told it was chocolate chip.As soon as the plate arrived, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=lmo2yH4mjOSzbhlZ0Vyi_w I remembered it was an item I had tried on the first visit- I felt disappointment at the sight of it, so I knew I must not have enjoyed it that much the first time around.  Well, I'm usually all about second chances, so I dug in.  It's alright.  I like the crispy-crusty bits that also had chocolate chunks the most.  The caramel and chocolate garnishes were just OK, as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=OPYRdqh1SVyR_nc7cWrWSwWas hoping the caramel would remind me of the wonderful goodness I experienced last week at Citizen Public House.  No such luck, but really, how could that even be a realistic expectation?I've just placed my order for the BBQ Bacon burger, minus the BBQ sauce (it contains mustard, and the gluten-free version contains corn syrup).  Happy hour (4p to close) subtracts $3 off all burgers on the menu!  Drink specials sound good, but I'm forgoing alcohol, as I've already consumed a lot of sugar by eating all the great bits of one of the bread pudding triangles.Stay tuned for my burger report (and photos).---------Update:  The BBQ bacon burger, w/ the BBQ sauce on the side, was OK.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=CFaFmlACU4OzZ7XVZt5flQThe pecan-smoked bacon added some flavor to what would've been an otherwise  bland burger.  Too bad I couldn't try the sauce, as server Ryan made it sound like it tasted really good.  I liked the brioche bun best when it had that toasted texture.  The beef is all-natural, no hormones added, but isn't ground in-house (the patties come from Washington, I believe).  No matter- it was good enough.  Ask for medium if you like your burgers tender and pink throughout.  I requested the accompanying sweet potato fries (you get a choice of side) to be extra-crispy.  I first found them a bit boring, but I grew to like them as I ate more pieces.  Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst, either.  The crispness was perfect.  As a Yelp friend noted, after seeing the photos, that the burger looked better than the bread pudding, and that the serving of fries looked a bit skimpy.  My sentiments, exactly.03/06/12My first breakfast at Tryst, and I cannot wait to go back!  (Especially since Tryst offers organic and local produce-- just say no to GMOs!)Arrived at 1pm and had only 45 minutes to spare-- good thing I already checked out the menu online and decided what I wanted to try: the Monte Cristo w/ a side of sweet potato tots, and a cup of organic coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=tYVvx24tyHyryZWgtiTVOg.  Was seated in Joanna's section- friendly server!  The Monte Cristo- two slices of French toast with ham, melty gruyere cheese, and strawberry jam, sliced into two halves, arrived nine minutes after I ordered it-- fantastic!!  The dish looked beautiful, and the plate hadn't even touched my table for two seconds when I overheard Joanna describe to someone at another table what I had ordered.  It was that striking!Looked so tantalizing, and I loved the sweet and salty combination.  I just wished it was heartier... I worked very hard to eat only one-half of the dish.  Same thing with the sweet potato tots (loved the crunch factor of these!)... It didn't take me long to work my way through half of the dish, and I still wanted more!  The Black and Tan organic coffee (black, no cream) was just OK.  I might try a cappucino next time, if only to check out the coffee art.  ;)I think I'm going to check out the Pineapple upside-down pancakes tomorrow!Note: Tryst offers "Tryst Around the World," and March is "Ireland" (I think last month was France).  Anyhoo, there's Potato leek soup (this sounds interesting!), and the salmon dish caught my eye. Tryst offers $10 off if you make a dinner reservation- something worth noting.7/28/11Took Mom here for happy hour, and the whole experience was just 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to three, since the cheese and charcuterie plate was solid, and I was given a second chance at a cocktail (when the first, the mojito, was not very good), so Mom ordered a Bloody Mary, but she didn't like it, either.  We couldn't wait to try the three-hummus plate, but we weren't impressed.  Even the sweet potato tots couldn't cut it.  Just the meat and cheese plate satisfied.  The chocolate chip bread pudding was a HUGE disappointment-- very dry, and not much chocolate flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMA#52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJg#uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJgI don't think I've been back for happy hour...

Restaurant name  Dillon's On Top of Central
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Maybe this place will stick? Over the years the building just south of Dunlap on Central has been many things, including its last incarnation a grill and steakhouse. But now things seem top be looking up for the location with west valley BBQ mainstay Dillons.Dillons opened its first location at the corner of Thunderbird and the 101 in 1999 and was at the time, pretty much the only thing out there. Since then they've become so popular that opening several more locations were inevitable. I've managed to visit each store and I have to say it's definitely the same experience across the board with a mix of BBQ, Southern cooking and some Tex-Mex thrown in to round the menu out. Fried Pickles ($6.99) are a favorite southern treat and are exactly what the name implies, dill pickles that are battered and fried. Be very careful eating these though because the juice from the pickles super heats inside and can potentially cause severe burns. I'm still pretty indifferent to these having never been blown away by them.You've probably already noticed that anytime there are wings to be ordered, I order them. These are one of the easiest snacks to make and also one of the easiest to mess up. Dillons version of Crispy Chicken Wings ($7.99) are served up juicy and meaty under a light crunchy coating. They also hold back on bathing the wings serving the sauce on the side for your dipping pleasure. The name may sound typical but the flavors of smoked the Chicken Quesadilla ($9.99) were far from it. Tender shredded smoked chicken tucked inside a grilled flour tortilla along with Monterrey jack and cheddar cheeses. Also served with sour cream and house made salsa, it's large enough to order as an entree. Piled high with thick cut bacon, smoked ham, melted cheddar cheese all resting on top of a crunch fried chicken breast, the Chicken Club Sandwich ($9.99) might give you palpitations but is worth every succulent flavor packed bite. The Turkey Club Sandwich ($9.99) is made much like its crispy fried cousin but instead uses sliced smoked turkey meat. After one bite though the meat tasted more like your typical grocery store cold cuts and not from the deli counter but the stuff that comes in bags, overly salty with little to no turkey flavor.Making matters even worse was the salt content on the Red Devil Pork Sandwich ($9.29). The pulled pork and smoked sausage was slopped up with a vinegar based red pepper sauce and then topped with coleslaw. It really should have been a hit but instead left me reaching for my water glass, a few sips and the salty pain was gone.Finishing off the meal was the surprisingly decadent Cinnamon Apple Dumpling ($5.99). A baked pastry wrapped apple surrounded by cinnamon and sugar tortilla chips then adorned with scoops of vanilla ice cream and gooey apple pieces. The dining room is covered with framed posters of old Hollywood. Who knew that Id some day dine with the likes of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn. Breakfast at Dillons anyone?Ain't nevah seen a rack o' ribs dat big, 'cept on a may-un I used ta date!I performed here.  The crowd was really supportive while they gnawed on them thar ribs.  Seriously.  I left that night, thinking of those ribs.There are a lot of regulars, which means a lot to me when I go to a new place.  I've known a couple of other restaurants in that location and they never last, but I hope Dillon's does.The service was super friendly and quick.  The menu is pretty big and I was quite surprised at that.  I'm sooooooo glad they've kept the decor from Central Grille.  I love the booths and brat-pack feel, as well as the dark walls.  There's a lot of wood, too.  That's not a pun, because most of the men were really old and, well, probably lacking in the wood department.

Restaurant name  Kennedy's Premium Bar and Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Just wanted to update my thoughts on Kennedy's.The patio is still in my opinion one of the best in Charlotte. It's HUGE and they have added a nice little bar out there. It's a great place for day drinking. They also have live music on some nights. Plenty of heaters available for chilly nights.Mondays are still the night to go. Kennedy's has raised the price for all you can eat crab legs, but it still can't be beat. Great deal at $24.95. Thankfully, they did stop taking reservations on Mondays. This makes the process so much easier for both the restaurant and patrons. I haven't had to wait since they stopped holding tables.If the Kennedy's parking lot is full, you can park at the other lots by Jack's and Philosopher's. Avoid the lot across the street from Jack's where the sub place is. They boot cars there left and right.I have to add that owner Kevin Marcuse is one of the most stand up guys I've met in this Charlotte service industry world. I have watched him go above and beyond for patrons of his establishments. He cares about people and it shows.Ok, since I've already written a review for Kennedy's a few years ago, I'm gonna give you the low-down on this place from the start.  This is absolutely BEST PLACE TO WATCH A BOXING MATCH in the Charlotte area bar none!  First, there is no cover charge at the door.  There is plenty of seating both inside and outside on their expansive patio area, and the typical bar food is always great tasting and very affordable.Being a native of #Rochester NY, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that they offer a #Garbageplate - the only place where you can get such a dish anywhere in the Charlotte area.  The only and I mean only, negative I can think of when it comes to Kennedy's is that parking can be very tight especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Otherwise, Kennedy's has everything us Western New Yorkers need to feel right at home here in the Queen City!

Restaurant name  The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar

Review Text :
In an alternate universe there will be more crazy fusion restaurants like this...fried chicken and pie...lasagna and hibachi...mole and milkshakes...ok maybe not. BUT, Cowfish does bring together two of my favorite foods - sushi and burgers and does them both surprisingly well!Since I've only snacked on hubs' burger, I'll focus my review on apps and sushi. Let's get to it...1) The scene: Super cool looking restaurant - very pop art-ish with custom sushi/Warhol esque paintings scattered on the red walls. Also, a huge bar and overall big concept (they took the Counter's space & the old Grape space - this place is magnanimous). Tons of tables in the bar area and general dining space. Make a reservation - it shall save you time! 2) The staff: Sharp, knowledgeable and friendly on both accounts I've sat down for a meal here. They are able to walk you through the gigantic menu and help you focus on a few things that catch your eye. 3) The menu: Huge. I mean Cheesecake Factory huge. Almost bordering on so large and detailed you can't take it all in. Think apps, burgers, burgushi, traditional sushi, creative sushi, make your own sushi, milkshakes, desserts, oh my. 4) The food: De-freakin'-licious. A few things I've really enjoyed here...-Crab Rangoon dip: Just as you would imagine, but better. Not for the dieting kind: fried wonton crisps, drizzled with sauce and dunkable in the crabby rangoony dip. Yes, please.-Tropical Storm Roll: super fresh, delicious and huge. *Word to the wise, if you want to actually fit a piece of a sushi roll in your mouth, ask them to cut the rolls into 10 pieces instead of 8. Trust me...your jaw will thank me.-Mango Tango Roll: Yummmm. I love just about anything with mango and this creative mixture is delightful. Plus - jalapeno! Nom.-Fried pickles: Tasty and crunchy with a delicious dipping sauce. -White Diamond: Normally I shy away from panko, flash fried rolls but this is pretty flavorful! I may ask for a bit more heat next time, too. 5) The prices: Honestly, pretty reasonable prices considering how much food you get to indulge in! Plus, the.sushi.rolls.are.huge. And the apps are pretty generous in size. Sharing is caring...share a few rolls with friends, you'll have plenty of food to go around. I also noticed that their lunch menu looks pretty slammin' and reasonable! So that's my long winded review of Cowfish. I really adore this chic fusion eatery and can't wait to go back!Sleek, modern, funky fresh and hip pretty much sums it up. From the Warhol inspired Godzilla painting to the burger "king" who I always found creepy; the decor is contemporary, atmosphere is live, and service is fabulous. Our waiter, Walter is a master of his trade. Prices are surprisingly affordable and if the name wasn't a dead give away - yep this place also has an eclectic menu. From the Burger bento box, to filet oscar roll to the Arnold Hamandegger burgah. It's all good in the hood. Fish is fresh with some traditional, some make your own and the ever so present specialty rolls. One point I must touch on is when the server brought out our food, she asked if we wanted anything else? I happily obliged and she had no qualms when I put in an order with her rather then our waiter. When we let our waiter know it was our first visit , he had the manager come out to introduce himself, greet us, and offered a free appetizer for the next visit. He was either: 1. Very personable, takes pride in the business, and delivering a great experienceor 2. Recognized my pretty lil' face from Yelp and wanted to bribe me ;)Before you leave, make sure you make a stop to the bano. Just as the crazy name implies, you will hear an even crazier recording of a phrase in English, then translated in redneck and lastly translated in Japanese.I could eat sushi every day but unfortunately the hubby doesn't feel the same way.  Cowfish is the perfect place for us since I can get my sushi fix while he can eat regular american cuisine.  Whoever came up with this concept is a genius!  The menu at Cowfish is very extensive including lots of tempting apps, a huge array of typical (and atypical) sushi, burgers, "normal" american entrees (grilled chicken, steak, etc), and plenty of milkshakes and other non-ice cream desserts.We started with a FREE appetizer by becoming a "cowfish junkie" online before dinner.  All you have to do is enter your email address on their website and they'll send you coupons.  We had the blackened ahi tuna nachos.  I thought they were incredible with lots of complementing flavors coming together in a perfect combination.I ordered a double salmon roll and the foreplay roll for dinner.  The sushi description says an 8 piece roll is big enough for an entree and I was a little skeptical.  Turns out, an 8 piece roll was more than enough to fill me up and I had to take 8 pieces home with me.  Each piece of the roll is huge and hard to fit in your mouth in one bite.  I would highly recommend asking for it to be cut into 10 pieces to avoid any awkwardness.  Both rolls were stuffed with fresh salmon and other ingredients and were delicious!  The sushi was definitely comparable to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant.The decor was modern cool with all red walls, black ceiling, and bright, colorful pop art on the walls.  This place could double as a decent date spot or a cool place to hang with some friends.  If you're cold-natured like me try not to sit next to the large garage-style retractable doors in the winter.  It gets a little breezy.Our waiter was excellent and he gave good recommendations for each section of the menu.  That was quite helpful and practically everything we ordered came from his recommendations.  At the end of our meal the manager came over to introduce himself and he gave us 2 more FREE appetizer coupons!  If I hadn't been sold already the extra free stuff would've won me over for sure.How many places do you know that serve sushi, burgers and burgushi (combine them both) in one restaurant? Exactly, none...for that reason Cowfish deserves a 5-star review. They back it up with their great food, menu and service. Been here at least 10 times and it's safe to say I've tried a lot of menu items. I usually sit at the bar because there's always a wait when I get there. Bartenders are knowledgeable and quick with their service. As for the menu. The sushi is really good. Not as good as some specialty sushi restaurants around town, but the rolls are unique and large. Recommendation...ask the rolls to be cut in 10 pieces vs. 8 so they are more manageable. The burgers are really good. This is my favorite part of the place. The Green Monster burger has avocado, pepparjack and jalapenos on it! They're also at least 1/2 pound...big! Choice of sides are abundant, but sweet potato fries are usually the norm. On a recent visit I went with the Ahi Tuna burger, which was very tasty and had a nice Asian slaw on it. But for something unique and light, go with the bento box...definiately for lunch. Comes with 5 sections. Small (4 piece) roll of your choice (think there's 3-4 options), a mini burger of the day, sweet potato fries, edamame and cucumber salad. A little bit of everything for those that can't decide because the menu is so BIG. My only two complaints are 1)the menu itself, as it's so big. Everything Ive had on it has been good, don't get me wrong...you just need a solid 5-10 minutes to look it over, hence the reason for multiple visits and 2) PBR tallboys are $5. From one who loves PBR, this is just a laughable price. I look forward to enjoying the large patio when the weather is warmer. This is the new hot spot of the Southpark area and it's well deserved.It was my last meal in Charlotte this go 'round, after another extended 5-day weekend visiting my parents, and I knew I really wanted something different before leaving. Having eaten my fill of Southern style specialties while staying at home with them, my radar began blinking frantically when I did a quick search for new (relatively) places in Charlotte since my last visit. Having worked in the area for many years selling wine I had already been to most of the more unique spots in the city, and then I stumbled upon what surely had to be a typo...The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar? Ummm, what? Then, my mind flashed to my last trip here over Christmas and some shopping that was done at South Park mall. I recalled riding past a place with a burger and sushi on the awning, and my immediate reaction at the time was a similar "what the hell?" Well, nothing more had to be said. I didn't even have to pull up the menu to know this would be my destination for lunch.When we arrived at our destination, which you would likely never find if you weren't specifically looking for it, it was a bit past prime lunch hours (somewhere between 1 and 1:30), but the restaurant was still surprisingly hopping for a Monday afternoon. I passed up the chance to eat outside, as you have no idea what the patio space looks like upon entering. This was a mistake, not because the inside was bad, but because after I saw the nice large patio adjacent a beautiful fountain I really wanted to be eating out there. Sitting inside did offer a vantage point of the strange and humorous wall art, half mocking half embracing the fusion of burger and sushi, along with an enormous fish tank and easy access to our server. A quick trip to the restroom revealed another of Cowfish's oddities, a foreign language "learn to speak Japanese" track playing, combined with what could only be described as "learn to speak Redneck" version. Hearing the cute little J-pop voice followed by Cletus was certainly a shock, and I made another visit before leaving just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating (and I had to rinse an obscene amount of grease from my beard).The real reason for coming here though is obviously the strange mix of food offered on the enormous menu. First are the appetizers, some of the best meal starters I've seen offered. This isn't your typical "hey let's fry something or add cheese to it" type of appetizer. They're all well thought out and incorporate a breadth of flavor profiles. Then you've got a page full of burger options, followed by several pages of very creative sushi rolls, and finally their signature item, a combination of burger and sushi they've deemed burgushi. It sounds like something the bumbling idiot Fabio from Top Chef would pronounce, but the concept is actually quite appealing when you see the menu descriptions.I began with a couple appetizers, hoping my mom would assist me in eating them so I would have room for a burger, and the "Mother Load" roll, which features a piece of every fish on their menu in one hell of a creative presentation. I wound up eating both of them by myself though, so I had to cut out the sushi. I started with the blackened Ahi tuna nachos, which are wonton chips topped with crab Rangoon dip, pico de gallo and avocado and some seared tuna. I thought the quality of everything in this item was superb, although the crab dip definitely overtook the flavor of the tuna. It really benefitted from just a few drops of added Sriracha to help balance all the flavors. Next up I dove into the Caribbean summer rolls, which have boiled shrimp, lettuce, mint, mango, cucumber and chive, and when combined with their spicy peanut sauce they were actually some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, anywhere. The size was huge too, definitely worth the $9 price tag if you're debating which appetizer to order.In between the appetizers and our burgers came the only real faux pas of the meal by Cowfish, and that was actually delivering our burgers just minutes after our appetizers had arrived. I had eaten literally one and a half of the big nachos, and not even begun on the rolls, when both our burgers were brought out. I decided not to complain and just go along with it, mixing bites from everything at once, but then I bit into my burger and realized that the medium rare I had requested was actually medium well, and produced no juice whatsoever. This I had to say something about, and it was promptly remedied by the chef, and comp'ed off the ticket by the manager. 1) Businesses take note, that's how you take care of a customer. 2) Yelpers take note, that's how you correct an error without bitching about it and deducting stars.As for the actual burger, I went with the Arnold Hamandegger (self explanatory), and when properly done was wonderfully juicy, with just the right amount of egg yolk seeping over the bacon and ham. The "Cowfish sauce" was pretty tasty too, and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly.Being a loyal fan of The Counter, I felt betrayed when it closed and this crazy fusion restaurant called Cowfish (what is a cowfish anyway?) took its place. Apparently, I am a weak-willed women because I eventually gave in to my curiosity a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I arrived around 9 o'clock and were shocked to see a flock hungry patrons sitting outside, beepers in hand, waiting for a table. We went inside to put our names down and were very impressed with the interior of the restaurant. I am not really one of those people who pics a restaurant based on the design or how 'cool' it is but this certainly worked in Cowfish's favor. After our number came up and our beeper started flashing, we were taken to our table and greeted by one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. We told her we had never been there before and she proceeded to guide us through the very large menu, answering any questions we had as she went. We proceeded to order the blackened ahi tuna nachos for our appetizer and we each chose the bento boxes for our entree. When the nachos arrived, I was in awe of how big they were. The 'nachos' are actually fried wontons and they are topped with their crab rangoon dip, pico de gallo, avocado, greens, and delicious ahi tuna. I took my first bite and literally fell in love. The tuna was fresh and all of the toppings tasted like they had been sliced and prepared to order. We scarfed them down in minutes and resisted the urge to place an order for more. Our bento boxes arrived soon after finishing the appetizer. I was amazed to see a huge selection of food with very generous portions. The box contained their mini burger of the week, the bib, which was served on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese and chili. The burger was tasty and fulfilled my desire for the comforts of The Counter fare. We moved on to the sweet potato fries (crispy and well-salted), Thai cucumbers (really delicious), and edamame (pretty standard). We saved the sushi roll for last, I selected 'Mark's Roll' which was spicy with jalapeno and siracha and very well-made. My boyfriend had the rainbow roll which was not as good as my roll but still very good. We had a great experience at Cowfish-- great food, great service, great atmosphere. I have been back since then and will continue to come back for fabulous food.It had been a while since I'd ventured into The Cowfish. Their long waits make it somewhat of a standoff for hungry Southpark goers. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were astonished at how fast we were seated. They make it happen here. Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass! For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries. Entrees:My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalape√±os. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat. I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!The Cowfish is worth anyone's time. Charlotte native, visitor, what have you, you need to stop in and sample their vast menu. Service is professional, fast and friendly. Warning: be prepared to wait on busy nights! That patio is hot to trot in the Southpark scene. Get in there fast!Cheers!Once upon a time, there was an amazing burger place right outside of SouthPark Mall: The Counter. This place was amazing, and when it closed I was devastated. Once it was replaced with The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, my grief quickly went away. The Cowfish is absolutely amazing. It's owned by the same people who own eeZ in Birkdale, and having dined there, I knew the food would be delicious &amp; inventive, and I was absolutely right. But then again, I'm always right =)The Cowfish has the traditional style rolls (Philly, rainbow, etc) and a huge list of wildly inventive &amp; exotic rolls to choose from as well. When Graham &amp; I visited the day after Christmas, I wanted to try something different than I had ordered on previous visits. We decided on three (although I wanted about ten...), one from each section: the rainbow (a traditional roll), the blackened tuna (a more unique/fusion style roll) &amp; the Doug's Filet Roll (burgushi).I'll start with the burgushi, because it's what makes The Cowfish stand out above other sushi restaurants (and Charlotte has a TON of them!). Burgushi is taking the elements of a burger and making it into a sushi roll, or taking the elements of a sushi roll and making it into a burger/sandwich.This was amazing. It was a Philly roll, topped with a piece of seared filet mignon, spicy sauce, scallions & masago. Absolutely amazing. I could even look past the blob of cream cheese (which I HATE in sushi). The roll was enormous, but everything about it was perfect, I really loved the spicy sauce and the very mild flavor of the filet. This is definitely my favorite item on the "burgushi" part of the menu, so far. The Rainbow Roll was, of course, my favorite. It was a California roll topped with assorted fish & spicy sauce. The fish was fresh & firm, the sauce was nice & didn't overpower the roll. I absolutely hate it when there is so much sauce you can't really taste anything else. I would have been more than happy to eat this all day. The last roll we had was the blackened tuna: Lump crabcake mix & cream cheese inside, rolled in temoura flakes, topped with blackened tuna, guacamole & a slice of jalepeno. While this roll was good, it didn't compare to the other two. The roll tasted dry & the slice of jalapeno was completely overpowering. However, the guacamole was a nice touch and absolutely delicious. I removed the jalapeno and added a different kind of heat with a little srirachia. It was a better flavor combination, in my opinion and I enjoyed the remaining pieces a lot more with this change. Not only was the food excellent during our lunch time visit, but the service was excellent as well. Our server took the time to go over every single aspect of the menu, and gave us a recommendation out of each category. The Filet Roll was one of her suggestions, and I'm so glad we went with that. My ONLY complaint here is that they are always busy, and they only take reservations from 11:00-6:00, which makes zero sense to me. Especially since most of the shops in the area (excluding the mall), close at 6:00 or 7:00. Lunch patrons can browse & shop while waiting for a table. Dinner patrons can not. I had wanted to eat here for our anniversary, but knew we would have to either wait forever or eat at the bar, so we changed our plans. We still had to wait, but 15 minutes isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things. Last time I went was on a Thursday night, and the wait was much, much longer so we ended up dining at the bar. Fine for a dinner with a friend, not as okay for an anniversary dinner with your husband. However, this place is worth the wait and I can not wait to go back on my next trip home.Is something really "hype" or "hyped up" if it fully lives up to its expectations?  Coming from out of town, I had not heard any "hype" about Cowfish. I was just in the area and as usual, let trusty Yelp guide me to a place that looked good.  I read a few reviews to get an idea of what to order, but it was not until I started to read more, that I realized that this restaurant had a reputation to live up to.We were intrigued that this restaurant specialized in two things our family loved: burgers (my husband & boys) and sushi (me!).  Starving, we made our way over for lunch on a Friday, only to be told it would be a half hour wait.  The wait was only about 20 minutes, which gave me a chance to explore the lengthy menu and look at yelp reviews for food suggestions. We were all ready to go when the very friendly server came for our order. Warning:  I think just reading what we ate for appetizers might give one coronary artery disease!  The two Moms and their teenage daughters (eating their salads) sitting at the next table looked at us in both horror and envy as we chowed. All I could tell them was, " Eating is different with little boys!"  They laughed and said, "We wish we got what you did!"We had:  Coconut Battered Onion Rings ($6), served with a horseradish aioli & Thai sweet dipping sauce. I am not usually an onion ring fan but i did taste these, especially because I love to dip. They were huge, crunchy,& delicious!Crab Rangoon Dip ($11) - great recommendation by yelpers! Unusual, creamy, yummy!Parmesan Truffle Fries ($8) - with Parmesan cheese & bacon. So tasty! Really sinful!  The apps alone left me stuffed!They have more unusual burgers at Cowfish than I have ever seen. Husband & 11 year old shared two: 1) the Hunka Hunka Burnin Love ($16):  Yes, a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas, & bacon. You could almost hear Elvis singing! It was good, but not as great as burger #2) the Arnold Hamandegger ($13):  cheese, ham, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions, cowfish sauce, onion roll. 9 year old and I each had our own Bento Boxes. These are combo meals with a mini burger, sushi roll, thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries, & edamame. It is really the best of both worlds and it was a fantastic choice!    9 year old got the Cowfish Bento Box ($9) which came with a plain mini burger and he chose a Philly Roll, which he loved. I got the Ultimate Bento Box. I really did not care much about the double stack featured mini burger. I thought it was somewhat dry and I just tasted it. I got the ultimate because I wanted to try one of the special rolls.  There are many unique rolls (as well as sashimi, nigiri). You can even create your own roll. I tried "The Boss" and it was original, satisfying, and delicious:  Spicy tuna, kani salad, cucumbers inside, coated in tempura flakes, topped with avocado, tuna, etc. Service was very friendly and efficient.  Our server even pointed out that Joey Fatone was in the house. Woo hoo!  The manager (possibly owner?) stopped by to see how everything was and I begged him to open a place in Fort Lauderdale.   Proof enough we loved this place?I think you can see from the number of times I've checked into this place that I love it hear. It's not just the food, it's the staff too. They're sweet as pie. :) The food is great too and the location is awesome. I know the wait can be long, but you can get a text and go to the mall. That's what we do. Now for food if you are a sushi love the rolls are huge. So thick you almost can't get them in you mouth and rolled tight! They also amazing nigiri plates, and burgers for non sushi eaters an then there's the filet mignon sushi roll. Yup and yes you can have that stuffed with lobster. So yeah, I come for the food stay for the friendly and fast service. It's a big ol bonus!:) timeI absolutely love this place. I'm not really sure how anyone couldn't fall in love with Cowfish. They have it all. Sushi, burgers, milkshakes, sake... they even have fried pickles! Yes, a sushi joint has fried pickles and they are damn good. First thing you need to know: there will be a wait on Friday and Saturday nights. A long wait. At least an hour. You may even wait on a week night. Scope out the bar. Grab a spot if you see one. Or, put your name on the list and walk somewhere else to have a cocktail or shop while you wait. They do not take reservations. Specials: Mondays- 1/2 price cocktailsTuesdays- 1/2 price martinisWednesday- 1/2 price bottles of wineThursday- 1/2 price sakeThe food: you can't really go wrong with anything here. There's a TON of options on the menu. You may get overwhelmed looking at it. Take a deep breath and dive in to the deliciousness.  I love to order the fusion specialty bento box. I go with whatever the slider of the day is. The sides are delicious. My favorite is the cucumber salad.Apps: do you like crab rangoon? ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON DIP. It's a deconstructed crab rangoon and it's delicious. It's worth noting again... the fried pickles are damn good. Big Al's Yellowtail, Tuna Nachos, parmesan truffle fires... all fantastic. Your biggest problem here may be narrowing down your order. Super unique and always worth the wait. This is a great spot for girls night or date night. I love to bring out of town guests here.Popular place where everyone can find something they like on the menu.I've been here many times and never realized I didn't review it. The concept is as odd as the name suggests. Cowfish...  You can get a bento box of sushi (really good) and your friend can be having a burger and milk shake.. it's great when you have friends who don't eat Sushi or don't want it and you are really craving some...Everything is great quality, but be warned when I say it is POPULAR, I mean you will have to wait to be seated on key nights.. and at lunch time.. but it's worth it.I find the parking situation for all the places in this center a bit annoying too, but it doesn't deter most people.

Review Text :
Vegas Yelpers!I'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!Came here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.This is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!I ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!I won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.Can't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.As for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.Casual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think.The custom omelette my wife got with bacon, avocado, mushrooms, and greenpeppers was good. As were the home fries it came with. My lemon blueberry pancakes, on the other hand, were too dense and thick. It was almost like trying to eat a wet dish rag. It was one of the most unpleasant things I've eaten in a while. The orange juice wasn't my favorite either. It tasted similar to frozen concentrate that was too watery. On the plus side of the dining experience was the friendly service. The two servers were busily rushing from table to table but always seemed to have a minute to chat.11:30 we walked in & greeted by the bus person. We ordered our food at 11:40 am.  I ordered coffee & asked the waiter for French Vanilla creamer. After waiting 10 minutes, I figured it slipped his mind.  So no biggie I asked the bus lady politely for creamer.  Our waiter over heard me asking her,  apologized & poured the cup of creamer. Now I'm starting to notice the people across from us had just gotten their food 35 minutes after we ordered. 12:15pm we asked the bus lady to check on our food she tells us the cook was by himself today.  Oh GREAT!  12:20 rolls around and they served my bf's french toast cold & set his side order in front of me.  So I didn't get my food at all. Lovely.  My bf walks up to tell them his food is cold & the waiter told us, "it JUST came out".  The food & plate were cold. So cold the butter didn't even melt! Ha, insulting our intelligence is strike 2. Then he says,  since we had not ate anything we could leave. My response was "GOOD!" Then come to find out they had a B grade by the health inspector & many demerits in the past.  They were featured on dirty dining (channel 13 news) before the name change.  Steer clear of this place to avoid food poisoning. I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes from what I could tell from my bf's order.  It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi. We're sitting down at The Cracked Egg on Sunset & Rainbow.  I waited 10 minutes & our food was up. They are reasonably priced for the huge portions. We've gotten coupons in the mail for our loyalty.I really wanted to like this place, because I love supporting local. However, I just didn't. First of all, the atmosphere is uncomfortable. There are a bunch of young kids working there that are really doing nothing. They kind of just wander around staring at everyone. It's not pleasant. It's not their fault they have nothing to do, but the owner should cut labor and save himself a little money. Secondly, the food was not seasoned at all. I am not sure why but our home fries had no salt at all and were only partially cooked. Lastly, over 30 dollars for two people to eat breakfast is pretty steep. I wouldn't have a problem with it if it was good, but it just wasn't.Sucks and Yucks. Where do I begin?Came on a Sunday afternoon, dined al fresco because the weather was beautiful and my party was starving and it meant we would be sat right away. Server came over quickly, teas and coffees arrived, menus were perused, then orders placed...ENTER THE VOID!Servers disappeared, bussers kept glasses full, but nothing... Our server was MIA and 20 minutes later a table that sat way before we did got food. Ours arrived about 20 minutes after that. I am all fine and dandy waiting for something to be cooked fresh (45 minute waits for Chicago pies is half the adventure), but what arrived came out lackluster, underwhelming, and just gross. I got my eggs poached. They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad. The ONLY redeeming thing about this visit was the pumpkin pancake I ordered. That ish was the bizzzz-ness!WORST. BREAKFAST. EXPERIENCE. IN. LAS. VEGAS. I could have had 2x the food and it been more palatable at Denny's or IHOP! This is a mom & pop that makes you remember why you HATE going home for the holidays. So much potential down the drain.Omg where do I start! This place is a hot mess! Joel and I were on this side of town for his job and we hadn't eaten breakfast. Since it was a Monday other places in the area were closed. So Stacks & Yolks it was. Right away when you walk in there is confusion. It's not a lack of staff either. There are plenty of people just total unorganization. When we were finally seated. (There was a hostess stand outside, but no hostess.) We weren't even given menus. We had to sit there for a while until we finally could flag someone down. They took our drink orders and came back to take our order. I had decided on the Crab Cake Benedict and Joel had the regular Corn Beef Hash with a side of sourdough toast. While waiting for our food I had to practically beg for a refill on my coffee and a water. Also, while we were waiting our waiter came over and asked if we had ordered something that we had not. Then he went around to all the other tables asking who's order it was. Wow. That was not a good sign.Our food came out and I was ready to dig in. The waiter not the original waiter asked what kind of toast Joel had wanted and he repeated Sourdough. The waiter said it would be right out. My Crab Cake Benedict looked kinda sad. The Crab Cake itself was crisp and tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was clearly old cause it wasn't runny, but congealed. The potatoes had no flavor and tasted like something they threw on the flat top for 1 minute and pulled off. Well, after 10 minutes Joel finally got his toast. It wasn't Sourdough however, but Wheat. It was so dry and cold that the fake butter wasn't even melting. It was some seriously sad toast. Talk about sad was Joel's Corn Beef Hash. We were both assuming it would be freshly made in house. We were very wrong. It came out of a can and was gross. I really felt we could have made it better at home. He asked for his eggs to be poached. Which they were, but  they were served in a little bowl that still had some water in it. Why not put them dried on the hash itself?  So we are done with our meal and I ask for the check. The waiter said he'd bring it over. 15 more minutes roll by and no check. Meanwhile, people were standing outside glaring at us because they are waiting to sit down and eat! The waiter comes back and asks "have we gotten our check?" I respond with a "no." He walked away. I was hoping to get the check!! By this time my debit card is out and I'm annoyed. Finally, some other guy brings us our check. I didn't even look at it. I just handed him my card and the response I got was a fist bump. Normally I'm down for fist bumps, but a fist bump is not an acceptable form of apology for bad service and bad food. Just sayin! I will never again return here. It was a total waste of my money and my time. Believe me heed my warnings and steer clear!! Run, run now!!!A popular breakfast spot! We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm and this place closes at 3pm so we were very surprised to see a line and we ended up waiting about 15 mins in the rain so I was really hoping the food would be outstanding. The small restaurant is very colorful and has a fun vibe so things started off well. We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of pulp. Next came our egg breakfasts, mine with bacon and his with ham. The portions are huge here and both plates were very delicious, no complaints and we would definitely order them again. Now to the disappointments. I ordered a single stack of the lemon & blueberry pancake and it was very dense, no fluffiness, no moisture and no lemon flavor. The portion was huge but I didn't want it :(Next came the single portion of the French toast which again was dense and covered in cinnamon which wasn't pleasing. Both sweets left us regretting we ordered them. The service was fantastic and our waiter was a funny one which I always love. I hope someone reads this who can make improvements on the pancakes & french toast. Overall we enjoyed ourselves except for the sweets.I loved it! The service was impeccable, the food was on point and I loved the decor. Saw that they had 3.5 out of 5 stars on Yelp but decided I was in the mood for a late breakfast and they were conveniently located. I don't know why they only have 3.5 stars. The waiter was attentive, friendly, informative and quick! We got our fresh squeezed orange juice immediately and perhaps less than 10 minutes after ordering our food was in front of us. The orange juice was delicious. Fresh squeezed yumminess. The poached egg on the eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked. Love when you cut into the egg and it drizzles perfectly over the Canadian bacon and English muffin. The home fries that they were served with were perfectly seasoned and the small biscuits and gravy I ordered were perfectly smothered in honest how gravy. Yum! I also had a bite of my fianc√©'s French toast and wow was it good. Fluffy, cinnamon, sugary delight! They cooked the side of bacon he ordered just as requested extra crispy! They were just on point. We're looking for a house in the area and once we move I think this'll be my go to breakfast joint.

Review Text :
When you're in the Vegas, it's all about excess, whether it's gambling, drinking, clubbing, eating, or snorting coke. Uh. Yeah. I meant drinking Coke. Caffeine is essentially a major food group in the Vegas.Anyway, if you enjoy other food groups and excessive eating, then Rock & Roll Sushi is as safe a bet as any in the Vegas. For $24.95 you get all you can eat made to order nigiri and rolls. Here are the rules of the game: you have a one hour time limit, you order a round of sushi at a time, and you are charged if you leave anything on your plate. I went two rounds. In round one, I had some miso soup, plenty of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, albacore, tuna), a fried spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll with shrimp tempura inside. For round two, I enjoyed more salmon, yellow tail, and albacore. The salmon was delightful. The albacore was tasty too. The yellow tail could have been better. I was not a fan of the tuna, but I have never been that into tuna for some reason, unless it is toro. My main grip with the nigiri was that in round one, the fish slices were very small. Look, I came here to eat and you're going to charge me if I leave food behind, so you might as well get my belly full early.As for the rolls, they were good (especially the fried spicy tuna roll), but were sloppily made. For an all you can eat joint, they held back on the rice, which was nice. The staff was cool. It was interesting to see a female sushi chef. I heard somewhere that you don't see many female sushi chefs because they have warmer hands than men, so it ruins the fish. I just think it's some urban legend that Japanese men spread around so Japanese women would have one less reason to wield a knife. I am not sure if my urban legend conspiracy theory is true, but I think other men in other cultures should try this too. I am sure John Wayne Bobbitt would agree.Great Sushi!!!! Great Chef!!!!! Horrible service!!!! Born and raised in these united states, I completely understand English and after 16 year of schooling I can definitely read a menu, for some reason I was treated by a server/ manager as if I couldn't comprehend... LolAfter leaving the nail salon in the area we decided to walk over to this place for a bit to eat. They have a special for "all you can eat sushi" for 25.00, so it was automatically assumed that we wanted the special..... So details about the "all you can eat sushi" were discussed right away, and that we had to eat everything on our plate before we could order more, and we needed to understand that an 18 percent gratuity is expected....and so on and so forth. I finally interrupted her and explained that we were not interested in her "all you can eat sushi" special, it was 1pm and we were just grabbing a couple of rolls (lady, please calm down). We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave a little giggle as we made comments about the manager/waitress being a lunatic. I ordered the dragon roll, it was sooooo yummy. My friend ordered the crunch roll and we kinda shared both of the rolls. My tab was about $14 which was not bad. We tipped the Chef and got out of there before she added a price to the water, pickled ginger and wasabi. Lol 3 stars for the Chef and the food only. My next visit to Vegas I will be sure to search for a place with better service.

Review Text :
Love the new Sandbar at Desert Ridge!  The patio is so inviting, and a place like this is much needed in this area.  I'm pretty sure that this will be my new spot for strawberry margaritas during happy hour.  We came for opening night and tried the guacamole and mussels.  It was insanely busy, but I couldn't believe how quickly our order came out, considering it was their first night open and how many people were there! The guacamole was great- I'm very picky about my guacamole, at some restaurants it gets a stale taste to it.  At Sandbar, however, it was fresh and nicely prepared.  The mussels were phenomenal.  I've always been more of an oyster gal myself; mussels always seem to come out a little too fishy for my taste.  However, ours came out very well.  Overall, we had a blast.  FINALLY, a great place in the Desert Ridge area! Kudos!So here is the deal, I get that this is supposed to be like being at Manny's in Rocky Point, the ocean on one side, drunken slutty girls on the dance floor, and more booze than you know what to do with. But the thing is if I were at Manny's, I'd be wearing a bikini, some denim shorts and flip flops. Totally comfy and cool for a night of humidity, wind, sand, tequila, lots of sweating and bad decisions. Ok now I'm wishing I was five years younger and I could actually BE at Manny's right now. I digress, this environment just isn't conducive to a normal prissy girl's get up. I know I'm not the only one fighting the granules of sand in my heels, because that seems like it is the only thing my girlfriends and I talk about all night. "Ouch, I can't get this damn sand out" "Well take your shoes off" Shoes taken off, shaken, and placed back on. "Damn it! More sand!" ...yea. It's a vicious cycle. So, really cute guy with the GORGEOUS blue eyes, I really was interested in what you were saying...I just had little tiny pebbles cutting into my skin the entire time you were talking to me. Maybe next time you'll still think I'm cute in flip flops? Here is to hoping...+1 star for the street taco stand. Saves whomever is my DD a stop at Jack in the Box on the way home.Wow, so if you want to eat at a place that advertises Happy Hour specials on 4x4 cards and then charges you full price despite the fact that you are handing the specials card to the waitress, who then supposedly talks to the manager and comes back to the table and said it was a "printing error" and you still owe full price, than this, my friend, is the place for you.My five friends and I came here for happy hour that they had advertised as starting on Feb 12th. They have a DJ spinning some fun tunes, the sun is shinning, and we are drinking and munching away enjoying ourselves thinking we may have found a new HH joint. Our waitress seemed new, as she would have to ask the bartender every once in awhile if the offered the drinks we wanted, but she was really nice and apologetic to us and thus we have no qualms with her. It's the management that would not give us our happy hour prices that were literally laid out in front of us. It's not that we can't afford regular price, but who doesn't love a good happy hour. Poor business strategy. You lost five patrons. Back to Old Town for us!Whhyyyyyy?? Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much.Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude. One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me. I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad.Ugh.Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!! I love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer! This place has always been super friendly!! As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!! :)  Hope you enjoy it!!!My buddy calls me a week ago, he says: I reserved a cabana at Sandbar for next weekend, can you go? Not knowing anything about Sandbar, my first thought is: ... a cabana? This guy's known me for 20 years. When have I Ever given him the impression that I want to hang out in a cabana?  ... An effing cabana!? I answer: Sure man! What time?Fast Forward One Week...It's Saturday night around 9:30-10pm. I pull into the parking lot and I see Sandbar Mexican Grill. Oh ok, I get it. This must be a little Mexican restaurant that has cabanas and we're going to eat and make interesting conversation. This should be fun!I walk up and first notice the motorcade of taxis hanging around outside. Hmm interesting. Then I almost reach the door, and there are 3 door men... ok... that's a bit odd for a Mexican restaurant in a suburban outdoor shopping mall, I thought. The one guy who checked my ID was really nice. I told him I was meeting some friends but they hadn't arrived yet. He told me to go on in and grab a drink. So far so good, I guess. I opened the door and get bombarded with loud club music, in a dimly lit club-like atmosphere. I'll be honest, I went into fight or flight mode. I turned right back around and proceeded to walk outside, then told the friendly door man I'd wait for my friends to arrive. To my car I went, to contemplate ways to feign illness so I wouldn't have to go back into that awful environment. Then I got the call... We're here, where are you? Actual: I'm in my car hyperventilating. What I said: Cool, I'll be right there.We all checked back in with the helpful door man and were then escorted like some kind of VIPs to this coveted cabana area. The ladies sat down and us guys stood and talked college football... because that's what men do, right? A nice young lady came up and took our drink orders. It was at this time that I realized how old I am because I just called her a "nice young lady". We were fitted with wrist bands that symbolized to the other people in the bar that we were awesome, and only we could enter the cabana area. Only Us! Not You! There were even four tough looking chaps guarding the entrance to the cabanas so no "unauthorized" people could enter. I felt like such an asshole. My friends ordered some food. I didn't eat. It was way too late (another sign I'm old). The food looked okay. They seemed to enjoy it.We had a few drinks, chatted and stayed until about 12:30am. I enjoyed the time with my friends, but this is not a place I would generally choose as a hangout. At least not at night. It may be less... umm what's the word... douchey, during the day. The people bumping, the people grinding, the people making out in the cabana next to ours... this just wasn't my scene. If you're in your twentys and single, you may enjoy the night life at this place. I'm neither of those and hope I never have to come back.This is a generous three stars.I don't get it.  This restaurant has mediocre Mexican food but the prices are reasonable. Every time I've been here the service has been terrible and this includes going for lunch when they weren't very busy. On one occasion my chips and salsa showed up after my entree was served and I'm still waiting on that drink refill.They do have a patio. But, it's right on Tatum Blvd. If your idea of a beach style patio includes thousands of vehicles whizzing by then you have found your place.I guess the draw here is the bar.  I wandered in with some friends one evening and the place was hopping. It was loud, crowded and packed with 20-somethings. For me, it was too loud, too crowded, and I've outgrown that "go out and get wasted" phase.But, if you're into that sort of thing - go for it.I not sure what is worse.  Bad service, or no service at all. However,  taking a look at all the other reviews it seem the vast majority of complaints about this place. All revolve around their bad service, or lack thereof anything resembling service.Today, when I arrived with a group for a business meeting, we found ourselves waiting for a long time for anyone to come over, we eventually had to flag someone over to us.The kicker was, we had to do it many times before the "hostess" (don't say waitress,  it seems they get offended by it) came over.Once there, she lied to us. Saying, that we needed to wait to get seated, and that the place we had decided to seat our ourselves at, is a $200 reserved table. Yeah, I did not buy that. Especially seeing that this place is not exactly a high end restaurant and the table was located outside in the baking Sun.My boss decided what the hell, he will pay the $200 and it should not be a issue, since nobody is using this table anyway. Instead of accepting the money, the awful and very rude waitress... Sorry I mean hostess, made it clear she's not accepting our money and walked away. And there we sat.After, a few minutes we decided we're just gonna leave, seeing that we're not getting any service. However, before we did, my boss and a fellow co worker went to talk with the manager and found out, that they do not reserve those tables and that we are allowed to see ourselves wherever we want.I can only assume she had some kind of personal issue with us. Anyway - The damage was done .DANGGGGGGGGGGGG this place generally has terrible reviews. Why? I came here as a meeting spot to get on a party bus, and was actually surprised at how warm I was being that its generally an outdoor venue. My complaint: the bartenders werent very friendly. And we're very anti talking. Most bars I go to, when there's NO ONE at the bar, I appreciate not being rushed to order, here... They just want to talk amongst themselves as employees, very unprofessional if you ask me. The people that come here are pretty laid back, and a diverse crowd as well. I'd come back, but the drink deals aren't as impressive as other bars and their appetizers are mediocre. At least I can say I've tried it! Probably won't be back though, not unless I'm meeting friends who care for this place.Where do I begin...I guess I will start by saying that Sandbar Desert Ridge has lost a customer and the 12 people that came to celebrate my Birthday. I reserved a table for Super Bowl Sunday which was my Birthday on 02/01/15. My first issue was walking up to the door of Sandbar and the lady saying that there was a $5 cover charge. I tell her that I have a reserved table and wasn't told that I have to have a $300 minimum on top of a $5 PER PERSON cover charge. She says we just decided to charge a cover charge BUT it will be deducted from your tab. I say ok since it will be deducted. (Issue #1)When I called and talked to Justin the "VIP Host" over a week prior to my Birthday he asked me how many people am I expecting...I said probably 8-10 and he said ok. He never mentioned the amount of chairs allotted per table. I get there as planned at 2pm on Sunday and the table is all the way in the corner in the back. Barely no one was at the other reserved tables yet so I ask to move tables. I guess the waitress felt like she needed Justin "The VIP Host" and he comes over and doesn't say hello or nothing just goes into NO YOU CANT MOVE TABLES and I told you over the phone that the tables seat 6. I said No, you didn't and he proceeds to say yes he did. (Issue #2) So, I notice my attitude turning the wrong direction on my birthday so I decide to let it go. Also, had we left he would have still charged me for the $300 minimum on my credit card. I was pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, I let it go and proceed to enjoy my Birthday. The staff was super slow. Justin the "VIP Host" was super rude. Oh yea, so as I am leaving to my car the waitress runs me down talking about I have a tab for $50 and we didn't meet the $300 minimum. Now, between 12 people everyone's tab was well over $55 EACH how did we NOT hit the minimum? Plus, my guests bought my drinks so how did I have a $50 tab? Oh yea, the waitress once again ran and got Justin when she chased me outside and brought him to my car because I told her once again that the lady at the door said that all of the cover charges would b deducted from the tab. Justin told me that I wasn't told that and he is not talking to me anymore and turned his back to me. (Issue #3) My friend just ended up paying for it but I will be calling today to talk to a Manager about all the discrepancies.  I have never been treated so horrible by a restaurant that should be catering to its customers. From the moment we walked in I was in a bad mood by the unprofessionalism of the staff at Sandbar Desert Ridge.

Review Text :
Here's what I learned from my journey to Sal's:1.  When your husband commits to meeting his cousin for dinner who is in town for business, get an address of where he is staying before looking for restaurants, because when your husband says Glendale, he really means Avondale.2.  Expect that many of the area restaurants close at 8 pm.  Sal's was the welcome exception.3.  Do not, I repeat, do not follow GPS from Scottsdale, unless you like a half dozen unnecessary freeway changes.  Why the hell did I need to get on I-17 or State Rt 143?4.  Skip all the research and just go to Sal's.  Who doesn't like a good wood-fired pizza?5.  Order Sal's Special Pizza...pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Something for everyone.6.  Do not stuff as much pizza in as humanly possible, as they will box up the leftovers.  Skip my advice, and it's a long ride back to Scottsdale.If I lived in the area, Sal's would be a go-to spot for me!

Review Text :
Ever since Mad Ave was shut down, Whiskey River has stepped up to take the crown as the trashiest bar in town. Overrated is the only thing that can describe this hotspot of guidos and girls with fake tits. The door is manned every night by a couple of self-obsessed meatheads who think they own the entire sidewalk in front of the building, and the godawful fratboy music blasting out of this place on every weekend night should be considered a threat to the safety and well-being of the general public.The employees at this bar are the most unprofessional people I have ever had experience with at a bar in Madison.  My horrible experience started with a bartender, who literally threw ice at someone who was waiting for their check but not looking.  They threw ice on a patron!  Later that night my purse was stolen.  I had set it down on the stage next to my friend and walked to the bathroom 5 feet away.  Upon returning it was gone.  Shortly later, at bar time, my friend and I were looking for my purse near the back of the bar when the bouncers started screaming in their usual rude-tone to "GET OUT OF HERE".  I politely told them we were looking for my lost/stolen purse and was told that 'we had plenty time to look'.  Ends up he grabbed my friend by her arms and carried her across the bar (a good 50 ft) to the door. She did not incite this attack, and told him she would walk out herself-yet he would not let go. She has DARK bruises on both arms.   Come to find out that was the second purse stolen that night.  I will not be going back to this bar and will tell everyone I know how horrible of an experience it was.My best friend came to visit from Mexico, and wanted to go out. A couple of friends said that a band was going to play at Whiskey River so we decided to head over there. there was a line and we only waited around 15 mins to get in.  The man at the door checked our id's and my friend presented his Mexican Passport to prove age. This bouncer, started going through the passport  pages and I told him the age was in main page of the passport. He said he needed to find the "Visa" to let him in because he wasn't a US Citizen.  This upset me because it is none of his business to look for the visa stamp, I can understand if it is and police officer, TSA, government official, but not this "bouncer" who gets paid to check ages.  Very unprofessional and just plain racist from his part. After finally going in, the music was good and the band was great! until someone vomited in the middle of the dance floor (not the place's fault). it was cleaned right away. Drink prices were reasonable and the place is big. But the bouncer ruined our experience and I will not be back to Whiskey River. Incident happened 01/16/2011 around 11pm.Creeps on creeps on creeps.Whiskey Jacks (or Whiskey River if you refuse to acknowledge the change like myself) is a great bar in concept.  It's big open space that can literally accommodate hundreds of people, and yet there is usually still a line if you get here past 11:30. They have two bars along the right and left walls so your line to the tapper shouldn't be very long. If you are into games at the bar they have quite a few billiard tables, darts and even some basketball hoops games. They do have a dress code (essentially you can't be wearing workout attire) which helps limit the creeps in the summer - they usually travel in hordes and one of them has to mess up, but in the winter everyone's so bundled up that anything goes.The dance area is the best (if not the only real dance floor) on campus, and they have live music or a DJ every weekend. If you're here during live music you are bound to have a ton of fun, apparently a pop country sing along is not the scene for a creep. You're in the clear until after the last set when the DJ takes over, then ladies you gotta watch your back (no really, that's where they come from, try to make it as inaccessible as possible). There are lots of cute guys here, make sure you pick one to dance with, don't get prayed on. If you do, you're going to turn around to a mustached Adidas tank top that smells intensely of Indian food or body odor, you won't be able to tell which. You can have a great time at Whiskey Jacks, just make sure you go in with a big group, your big strong boyfriend or incredibly low standards.Oh how I wished I would've read reviews before the girls and I picked this place. Idk maybe I looked like I wanted to be grinded on (at least buy me a drink). After 45 mins we left, too many creepy guys and the music kinda sucked *maybe I'm just getting old lol

Check in on yelp and you get 50% your second entree you order!This place is a casual pub/ bar located right next to sushi wa on Coronado and Eastern. I cannot really rate the beers since I was here for lunch and it was too early to drink. I ordered the fish n chips  which consisted of two large pieces of battered fish and coleslaw and potato wedges. I was very impressed how the fish was battered and fried to perfection. The fish itself was crunchy and not soggy. The potato wedges and coleslaw was delicious as well. The service was great, she was very pleasant and had a great personality. She did not forget about me even though i was sitting outside enjoying the beautiful weather. Overall I had a great experience with this place, I definitely  will go back to dine in the evening and to try out the beers. This looks like a great place to relax and chill with friends.Heads up: HH is only Mon-Fri, even though their website advertises it as daily. Staff is aware of this, yet no one has bothered to update the site in (their estimate) 2 years?!The Yelp Book Club timed our visit for HH, so being rudely informed that it didn't exist wasn't the best start to our visit. Our server came by twice in 45 minutes and drinks took 20 minutes to come out. We had to go to the bar to place an order- and we were the only table. With such aggressively unhelpful service, the food did not make up for our experience.POUTINE: This spot goes the extra mile to bread and fry the cheese curds. So the dish is basically cheese fries with cheese sticks, with some underwhelming Guiness gravy. Fries were unseasoned, gravy was lackluster, dish went unfinished split among three people.SOUP OF THE DAY: $5 for their daily bowl, which was chicken curry. It was mostly rice and had no spice, as though this were Campbell's interpretation of a curry. Not thrilled.SCOTCH EGG: Sausage was eerily reminiscent of a breakfast sausage, but the mustard aioli on the plate kicked things up a level. This is sided with a heap of spring greens they call a salad, but nothing else. Odd.STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Spiced and sauced bundt cake, with a bit of whipped cream. This version does not come close to comparing to any others in town. Go elsewhere for your fix. Another unfinished dish for us.Dismal food and shitty service make for a large empty bar in the middle of the weekend, despite large screens showing multiple sports games. I wouldn't recommend this spot and I won't be back. Crown & Anchor has friendly service, a similar menu, and better quality.A fun night at Shakespeare's this past Thursday w/ other Yelpers who all came to attend a UYE - Unoffical Yelp Event, to play Cards Against Humanity.More than a dozen of us exchanged funny answers with card questions, ate plenty of British bar food and indulged in several drinks over a 4+ hour evening.*This bar/restaurant is big inside and able to accommodate large groups w/ ease. **Smokers welcome outside on large parking lot patio to commit suicide as they choose. ***Loud background rock music, several large screen TVs showing the Thursday Night Football game, pool table and dartboards also added fun to our Unofficial Yelp Event.I tried a couple of food specials offered during the football game including 16 chicken wings w/ Honey Sriracha and Buffalo sauces. I liked the Honey Sriracha better than the Buffalo sauce. Wings were very average in size and taste. Discounted game special price of $15 was kinda high. Underneath the wings was a bed of skinny fries drowned in buffalo sauce from above wings. Came w/ blue cheese & ranch dressings, and a side of celery & carrots.Also tried a bucket of 6 fish n chips w/ seasoned wedge fries. Pretty good tasting battered cod which was a bit larger than average in size, moist and cooked to golden perfection. Served w/ a very good tarter sauce. Wedge fries were better than the skinny fries that came out w/ the wings. This football food special was a fair price @ $15. A bottle of English HP malt sauce on the table was a nice touch. Drinks were reasonably priced. I liked how my Guinness beers were served in a Guinness glass.*Long bar w/ video poker machines, excellent draft beer & liquor selection served from a friendly designated bartender. **Cooks in the kitchen are obviously talented to make the battered cod to perfection and heard compliments from others they enjoyed the poutine, nachos and other food dishes ordered. ***One friendly guy multi-tasking the floor as a server/busboy/etc who showed effort. An extra server would've been very helpful to everybody's night, but overall was a good time.A couple of early evening group photos have been posted by others. (see photos section)2015 Review #303

Restaurant name  Tuscan Oven

Review Text :
If you want to over-pay for a mediocre meal and spend most of your visit wishing you were somewhere else, I highly suggest Tuscan Oven.We should have known right from the start that we were in for a less than stellar experience  - Tuscan Oven was the only spot in Westgate that did not have a 45 minute wait.  Since we had fantastic tickets for the Coyotes/Sharks game and didn't want to miss any of the action (our seats were great!), we went with the restaurant option that could seat us immediately.  Ooops...We ordered a half carafe of the house Pinot Noir - while it arrived quickly, it came complete with two straight out of the dishwasher hot glasses that tasted like soap and really did not do much to enhance the flavor of the wine.  Yum...Our waitress apologetically replaced the soapy wine (she is the only reason to add a star to this review - she was trying her best).  We then ordered baked ziti and a wedge salad to share - and proceeded to wait an incredibly long time for two seemingly simple dishes.  While the ziti was OK (how can you mess up pasta with cheese & sauce?) the wedge salad had the skimpiest portion of bland disappointing blue cheese dressing I have seen.  Now I know iceberg lettuce is not exactly flavorful, but due both to the wimpy dressing (flavorless even after adding more) and practically nonexistent garnish (bacon, blue cheese crumbles) this salad was like eating crunchy water.Blech.

Flow Rider is the New Truck in Town, they have a pretty solid menu offering burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches.The first thing you will notice about Flowrider is their Portions, let's just say they're BIG, and every order includes fries and a drink.The menu is pretty expansive, I had D Porker, which can best be summed up as a deli that exploded and ended up on a bun, D Porker includes: Fried pork, beef, bacon, ham, sliced hot dog, beans, egg, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, served on a grill french bread.It was a huge sandwich (camera on my phone doesn't work so I was unable to snap a photo), but trust me it was impressive!The fries were rather forgettable, but it's nice that they were included along with a drink, other trucks are a la carte and the price can add up quickly.My friend had the 12" Loco Dog which includes: A 12" beef dog wrapped with bacon, grill onions, jalapeno relish, special sauce, and guacamole on grill bunHe said it was really good, a little messy, but good.I liked Flowrider, they still have a few kinks to work out, but given time they could become a contender for the vegas food truck crown.Ok...here's my few complaints so they can work on improving and getting 4 or 5 stars on my next visit.1- The fries are weak, they were under seasoned, a little soggy, and were rather blah. I may have just gotten a bad batch, but they were pretty forgettable.2- The Toppings, there is a point when you reach overkill, when a sandwich has more than 10 items on it you might be going a little overboard, all of the ingredients in my Porker were great, but they got lost when they were mixed all together, I actually dissected my second half and ate it piece by piece, all of the meats were amazing, but it may be a little overkill.3- Location I know finding places is hard when you start you, and the place you were at had a ton of traffic (rainbow and russel), parking was ok (hospital lot across the street), but there were no tables, benches, grassy areas, or anywhere to sit, I don't mind eating in my car, but if a group of people want to eat it can be a little hard.4- Your Hours, I know you're new and you are still getting things worked out, but being open 3 hours a day 11a-2p is not enough time for people to get a chance to try your grub. I really think with your portions and prices, you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck, you could corner the post bar greasy food market if you found the right location and got the word out!!!I will give flowrider truck a few more tries, and hopefully they earn a few more stars, the more quality trucks this town gets, the better!!!

Well, there are only so many places to eat in Terminal 2, the oldest and smallest terminal at SKy Harbor Airport. There are more since they remodelled it a few years ago at least.When the young freckled red head that is "always fresh" and "always juicy" seems to be a little tired an old to you, you can opt for the Knights of the Round Table to fill your hunger. ROund Table pizza, that is.1 combo #3         $5.751 slice cheese    $3.35Total                      $9.95I don't remember what the combo thing was. Soda and what?

Restaurant name  Steak 'n Shake

Review Text :
Yelpers on Talkback know that I've been waiting for this day.A tear nearly rolled down my cheek upon the news several months ago when I discovered that Vegas was getting a Steak 'n Shake.  I had fond memories of the place when I first discovered in in Florida several years ago, and the burning jealousy that later formed once I moved from my home state of Texas only to find that, surprise!  They put one in right after I left.  I tell you, isn't that always the way?Personal story aside, I waited and waited until lo, this day has come, and the Steak 'n Shake has landed in Vegas.I went to the South Point Casino to get my "Tron Legacy" tickets when I saw the line.  It was well around the corner.  I just wanted food.  I didn't need to sit at the restaurant.  So I asked if I could do take out.  They promptly sent me to the front of the line as I wasn't needing to wait for a table.  The manager was there and he greeted me warmly.  I guess he knew in his heart of hearts that this was a special day for us all.I ordered two of the double steak burgers and some "Buffalo" style sliders.  The prices were reasonable, all things considered, and the wait wasn't that long.  When I got my bag, the server girl was all friendly and smiles.So away I spirited my treasures like how Rumplestiltskin covets....  Well, whatever it is that Rumplestiltskin covets, I was like that, but holding onto my prize even tighter.  As I was leaving, some woman pointed to my bag and said "Look!  He has Steak 'n Shake!"  This helped to further my feeling that I was the coolest kid in the casino.Away I dashed home, eager to eat my steaky, shakey goodness, nibbling their fries all the way home.  I can be a "fry snob", but these are tasty.Then came eating time.  It was like an angel descended from upon high and said onto me: "You've been a reasonable sort of late.  Here's a hamburger for being so well behaved.  A hamburger... MADE OF STEAK.  Because you are awesome!!!"  And so, I ate my angel laden steakburger, and was thusly full.Is it truly that amazing?  Honestly, I'd give it a four star experience, but the service was so helpful and friendly, I'm giving this place a five star experience.  My enthusiasm for being there "Day 1", coupled with the wait made it a fun and tasty experience.Tomorrow I go see "Tron".  I'm also going back to Steak 'n Shake before the movie starts.Could the day get any better?What the HECK SnS??? You totally let me down today! Being the "Yelper" amongst my friends I convinced a group to wait in line for an hour to be one of the first to try this hot new place....and you made me look so bad.Downers:1) They forgot our shakes and brought them after our meal was served and almost finished2) They forgot our order and we had to hunt someone down to get it put in.3) Everything was wrong on everyones order except one burger. YIKES! No cheese, no bacon, forgot to take the onions off... disaster! When we asked for the cheese the waitress put a cold slice of cheese on the burger and brought it back. WTHeck.4) When the manager came to the table he was not at all concerned about all that went wrong with our experience and did not want to take care of us at all. Finally he suggested giving us our shakes for free (the ones they forgot to order and brought after our meal) Really??? 5) The meat in the burgers were really small, nothing at all like the photos. It similar to the size of the kids meal McDonalds burger. Disappointed for sure!6) There is no bathroom in the restaurant and you have to go out to the casino to go..if you have too go :)Some Pluses:1) The shakes were awesome - once we got them :)2) The taste of the meat in the burger was really good....just really small....3) The hostess at the front had the best guest service. She was the one who noticed that no one had brought our food or shakes out and rushed around to make it right. She was awesome and should be manager!4) Price - the price was decent. They even had $4 menu that gave you a burger and fries for $3.99. Thats a pretty great deal!5) I love the South Pointe and think it is a great idea to have it inside the hotel.Overall - this place has nothing on In-n-Out. Not worth a hour in line wait at all. I might give this place a second go in a month or so and see if anything has changed. I totally understand that bumps have to be worked out in the beginning but as of now......not impressed. Steak - n - Shake.....I'm still not over what you did to my good name today...not yet anyways.Jumping on the current bandwagon and braving the crowds...the Husband loves steak, and I love shakes...so we headed to the grand opening week of Steak 'n Shake at South Point Hotel and Casino in Vegas.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, "Do you know when they are going to open?"On Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!  The Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt "Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough."  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.  Meanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.Of course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact! I also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.And yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)Overall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.They are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).  Happy hour: Weekdays only, 2 pm to 4 pm, and 2 am to 4 am - Half off shakes and drinksMy love letter to Steak n' Shake:Ever since the first day I saw your picture online I have thought about you...longed for you. Love at first sight? Perhaps. I am a hopeless glutton, and the fastest way to my heart is through my stomach. The more I read your menu and explored your website the more I was drawn to you.  I dreamed about you. I imagined what our first meeting would be like. I knew what I would order and knew exactly how it would taste. I wanted to meet you in person but the closest SnS was in Texas...just like Romeo and Juliet, the universe was keeping us apart. Yeah, sure, I explored other options...In n' Out, Five Guys...but while I was with them, I was thinking about you.You can only imagine my excitement when I heard that you were coming to Las Vegas, my home away from home. My heart soared. I didn't want to appear too desperate so I gave you a week to get settled in to your new home. When I arrived I knew exactly how it would be...how you would look...what I would order. You made me wait 30 minutes, but what was 30 minutes more of  a wait to meet my soulmate. And it was indeed worth the wait. It was a love connection! We spent two amazing nights together...nights I will remember forever. And although I had to leave you, I will return to you...soon, and often.OK, now that I have totally creeped you out here is what we ordered. We actually went twice in 2 days...yeah, it WAS that good:Wisconsin Buttery Burger-two delicious crusty perfectly cooked steakburger patties, one slice of gooey melty cheese, all covered in butter. Yeah, this was pretty much heaven.Guacamole Steakburger-the same two delicious patties, jalapeno jack cheese, and yummy guacamole. So good!Triple Steakburger with cheese-more of the same goodness...3 patties and two slices cheese.The burgers come with amazing shoestring fries. They are thin and crispy and the seasoning salt is awesome!A side of chili- A bowl of luscious chili flavored reddish-brown liquid filled with perfectly cooked kidney beans and ground steakburger meat. More like chili beans than standard chili, but you can pay a $1 for extra beef. It was really delicious.Hershey's Special Dark Shake- Creamy, fluffy, frozen, chocolate heaven. The shake was gigantic and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips.Peppermint Chocolate Chip Shake-This was one of the special holiday shakes they had on the menu (Along with white chocolate and egg nog.) It was a minty, chocolately Christmas celebration in my mouth! We had great food and great service both times we went. It is in the casino in the South Point Hotel, and there was a 30 minute wait each time. I am just so sad there isn't a SnS near Los Angeles.My Fiance who isn't much of a foodie actually wanted to try this place. I guess she saw a grand opening sign a little while back that caught her eye. Well, thats wonderful because I'm glad I ain't always the one trying to dine somewhere new! This place is located in my favorite Vegas Casino, South Point! I just really like the ambiance in this place and I won my first and only (so far!) Royal Flush here!! Enough of the small talk,  we got here starving and had to go in the "To Go" line since it was about 5 times shorter than the "For Here" line!!! Yes, the line was sooo looooooonnnnnggg, that at first I thought they were giving away free burgers or something??!!After about 10 minutes in line and then another 15 minutes to pick-up, this is what we literally inhaled:My order:Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger and Fries: I love butter, probably as much as Paula Dean does.. Maybe?! Wisconsin butter, never had that before.. I'll take one of those! Wow! I've never tasted anything like it before. First off their meat was unique to my taste buds but without a doubt one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had - in a small package! The butter, sloth of onions and their meat just.. just made me happy!Western BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger and Fries: I always love this type of burger. Now, their take on this one was humbly satisfying. I mean its their meat that sets them apart, its thin and cooked well yet not dry at all. Edges are purposely crisped on some sides and it just adds another positive attribute to the burger.. the slightly crunchy onion rings, a bit sweet/tangy bbq sauce and cheese all together made me an instant fan off one bite! Fries (Skinny and Crunchy): I did have 2 orders of fries and I did demolish both of them with ease, along with the burgers! The fries may had been skinny and crunchy but they were perfectly cooked where there was still some evident soft potato meat in each fry. My Fiance's order:Spicy Chipotle Steakburger and Fries: I saw here unwrap it and literally within a minute and half at most, the thing vanished!! I knew she was hungry but dayum! She ate that thing like I was gonna snag it from her! She did say "That was the Best Burger I've ever had. My Grandma used to make me something that tasted just like this Meat when I was young. It brought me back to that time. I want another one!"CONS:- Ridiculously Long Line and Wait- Burgers were sized for light eatersPROS:- The Burgers tasted Unexpectedly Outstanding- Prices were Inexpensive - Atmosphere made me wanna ' Eat Steak 'N Shake, RATTLE and ROLL!!'I was eager to sample the offerings of South Point's newest culinary addition, Steak 'n Shake, but until very recently was deterred by reports of huge lines just to get inside the restaurant.  On this night we were lucky, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were admitted to the inner sanctum.  The place was bright and lively, and packed with happy people.  Servers were scrambling quickly about delivering steakburgers and tantalizing-looking milk shakes to the eager awaiting diners seated at white-topped tables and booths.  Huge photographs of food preparers clad in white 50s-style uniforms with cocked military-style caps adorned the back wall, looking not much different from their present-day counterparts.Diane and I were both quite hungry after a long drive from California; we hadn't eaten for several hours; and of course I had to order mightily to round out a good review of various kinds of fast food fare.  So, we showed little restraint.I noted that canned chili was sold on premises.  And, I logically reasoned that any restaurant that cans and sells its chili out the door must make a memorable species of the hot stuff.  And, I am a sucker for good homemade chili--with beans or not.  So, I opened with a side of Genuine Chili with onions but no cheese.  As luck would have it, this chili came with beans, which is the way I prefer.  It was quite good, with a lot of liquid goodness, and a noticeable but not extreme backbite to tickle the throat on the way down.  As a testament to the quality of this chili, I ate all that was set before me, and took a can home that I enjoyed as part of my lunch the very next day.Next up was a Chicago-style Frank & Fries.  The dog contained a slightly split all-beef wiener, classic emerald green relish, chopped white onions, two sport peppers, and a slice of ripe tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  After downing one complete sport pepper, it seemed like my stomach had turned into a hearth with a log fully ablaze inside it.  So, I elected to bypass the second pepper.  The hot dog was very, very good.  But I would have preferred an untoasted soft bun, and some juiciness had probably escaped where the meat had been sliced.  But the dog was still juicy.  Fries were shoestring style, slightly crispy, and tasty enough.  And, although I couldn't get my Original Double Steakburger with Cheese & Fries (I told you I lacked restraint in ordering on this night!) made even close to medium-rare, it was still fairly juicy and tasty with two hamburger patties, crunchy circling strands of white onion, a tomato slice, a couple of pickles, a slice of orange cheese, fresh lettuce, and tomato ketchup added.But the real highlights of this particular meal hands down were the two majestic milk shakes.  We each had a hand-dipped "specialty shake"--which means the most expensive variety served.  Diane selected Double Chocolate Fudge, which was really chocolatey and naturally enhanced by hot fudge; and I chose Butter Pecan.  As luscious as that shake was, it had a surprise in store for me that made it probably the best milk shake I have ever had the pleasure of savoring.  For, it was dotted with small bits of pecan.  But these tiny pecan pieces were unlike any I had tasted before.  They were more like pecan seeds that when bit into simply burst with the flavor of pecan.  When at last I got through the cherries, whipped cream, and tall milk shake itself, about 100 of these morsels lay at the bottom of my milk shake glass.  And, I just scooped them up repeatedly with the long spoon provided, and crunched them on the roof of my mouth in spoonfuls, letting the bursts of intense pecan flavor lazily wash down my throat, until at last all were gone.  A heavenly end to a fine fast food meal!This location always has a ridiculously long line out the door.  You'd think they were going into a niteclub.  We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.  SOOOOOOO..welcome to "plan E".  We opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  "Save it for the burger" I told myself. Finally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.    What the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets.If you order the royale, you cannot request an over easy egg. Fried only and over done.So I have this love, hate affair with all things diner. I love the nostalgia and the feel. I typically hate the food.The burgers here were just okay for me. It was hard for me to love and/or enjoy because I so bad wanted the Royale burger with my egg yolk all nice and runny but they couldn't and wouldn't make it like that. Something about health regulations. Must be all the old people and kids that eat there or something. Please explain why some places can do this and others cannot. However the patty was pretty moist and juicy and the toppings fresh and good.The fries were good, as long as they were hot. Once they got cold, forget about it. It was just not good.I also ordered a milkshake and I have to say one of the worse ever. I don't know what I was expecting because everyone was saying that their milkshakes were bomb. But they truly were the nastiest part of my lunch.I took it to go to be polite and threw it in the trash when no one was looking. It was like it was made from old ice cream that had melted and was refrozen, three or four times over. YUCK!I would only visit again if you twisted my arm and were a guest visiting and really, really had to go.I will say that this place is super cheap and super budget friendly.A good choice for quick cheap eats at South Point. We were in Vegas a couple months ago & stayed at South Point.  Once we got to the hotel,  we had lunch at Steak & Shake. I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger which was very yummy.  The flavors were really rich.  The burger itself is a medium sized burger.  For the average eater, it is definately filling with fries & shake. The cookie dough shake was yummy with lots of chunks of cookie dough.My favorite thing about this restaurant is the decor.   It felt like we stepped back in time to the 50s.Tip: they have a to go window on the side of the restaurant. Recommended for yummy burgers & shakes.Ever have one of those moments where the experience doesn't exactly live up to the hype? Unfortunately, that was Steak 'n Shake. Which is so sad, since I've enjoyed many a late night meal at Steak 'n Shake across IL and MO. And since Las Vegas is as far west as this diner chain reaches, was VERY excited to have a taste over the holidays. Maybe it's because we actually dined in (vs. pickup or drive-thru)? Or maybe it's because this Steak 'n Shake is inside a casino? Or maybe it's because it was bright as hell inside? Something just didn't feel right. (I was about to blame it on the clientele, but let's face it: Steak 'n Shake tends to attract the same type of customer no matter what part of the U.S. they're located. Overweight, loud, eating with their mouth open kind of people. Hey, it's cool, I'm from the Midwest!)Was the double steakburger as good as I remembered? Pretty much. I will say that it tastes WAY better from the comfort of your own home. After a night of bar hopping, of course. I did appreciate the two sides of melted cheese for dipping fries. I only asked for one and was given a second... Yay to gluttony squared!This particular location was extremely clean and well-lit, no complaints here. It just didn't feel like a slice of the real deal. But hey, that's why it's in Vegas! Next time, I'm getting it to-go.I can count with one hand the times I've been to a Steak n Shake. Everything is just super salty, greasy and blah. I'd wake up the next day with a huge zit on my face from all the nasty grease.I've tried a burger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries and Parmesan herb fries = salty, greasy and blah. Not worth the calories even for a cheat meal. The only saving grace is their milkshake. But how hard is it to make a good milkshake? Flush away all the bad food from my system! $15 for a bad burger/sandwich, bad fries and a milkshake? You might want to go somewhere else for better quality burger and fries for less or pay extra for better quality burger and fries.

Stopped into Robertos for the first time the other week after a binge study session at the Starbucks next door. I have heard mixed reviews about the franchise and decided to just find out for myself. I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I just got an order of carne asada fries to go and ate them outside and enjoyed the weather while people watching. The carne asade was a little too salty for my tastes and the fixings with the fries were alright. I think the saltiness of the meat threw it off for me. Way too salty. The portions were great though. It was huge and I had enough for a whole other meal the next day. Granted it wasn't as good the next day since the fries were a tad soggy but hey a meal is a meal sometimes. Honestly, I'm not sure if I would come back to any of the chain locations. Maybe out of convenience if I'm ever near one and I'm craving some Mexican food. There is also an ample amount of parking at this location so that's always nice too!

tucked away in the illustrious ahwatukee foothills lies an exquisite new addition to the phoenix restaurant scene. it's exactly what was lacking in this neck of the woods. or neck of the desert, if you will. it's a place to come for cocktails after work, a place to enjoy a delicious italian dinner and a place where you can dance the night away to live music. the kind of place you go and spend about 3-4 hours at a time, just savoring your night. they just opened a few weeks ago, so we had no idea what to expect..... but when we walked in, for the first time since i left san francisco, i felt like i was home again. it has a sexy, loungey, elegant but urban feel. the kind of restaurant you would find in a sophisticated world class city, not the remote desert foothills of arizona.there's a small, intimate patio area set up outside (think couches and candles) but with the temperature in the 100's we opted to sit inside close to the sprawling bar area. the live music hadn't started yet, but we wanted to be near it when it did.for starters, we shared the au gratin potato dish with pre-dinner cocktails. it was so cheesy and good. for dinner, my dining companion ordered the lobster ravioli and i actually ordered something not on the menu at all. i described what i was craving (a linguine in a light cream sauce topped with chunks of grilled salmon) and they made it exactly how i described. i took half of it home, but then kept thinking about how good it was and ended up finishing it later that night anyway. haha during dinner, the proprietor of the restaurant stopped by our table to say hello and we ended up chatting for awhile. she's just lovely. apparently her and her husband opened the restaurant and named it after their 4 daughters. hence, the name "le ragazze" which means "the daughters" in italian. she also told us she was from NY, which explained so much about why i liked the overall vibe there. service was top notch, just enough attention without feeling like she was hovering.after dinner, we stuck around for a few hours with our cocktails to hear the live music which had started. at one point a few giggly girls (who seemed to have consumed a LOT of wine with dinner) got up and started dancing around. it's a happy, festive kind of place though, so people just looked on amused. we didn't stay too late into the night, but i can see things getting really fun in there towards the wee hours.i may not have lived in arizona for long, but i have been exploring the restaurant scene here quite consistently.... and this was the first time i got excited about a place. i couldn't wait to go back. in fact, we're going again tonight.ok so, it might be a little out of your way (ahwatukee isn't exactly centrally located) but i assure you it's worth the drive. i promise.

I have been out to try each food truck vendor that shows up at the Downtown Phoenix Market whether it be for the Wednesday evening market, the Friday Food Court or the Saturday market, they are pretty consistantly the same vendors.  However some show up more than others.  Well and I am not all that consistant as well so we keep missing each other.  Today I took a walk to the Friday Mobile Food Court.  And since I have tried almost everyone else there it was their turn.  I ordered the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos and their crab rangoon.  Yes this was my lunch.  I got some veggies, dairy, protein in... The jalapenos were roasted sliced in half and each half was filled with a cilantro lime cream cheese and wrapped with a piece of bacon.  The crab rangoon tasted like the same cream cheese filling with crab in a wonton. Both were very tasty and the rangoon came with a home made citrus sweet and sour sauce  that was really good. I like the touch of the girl taking your order and then placing it with the chef in the truck.  I would have liked to try their chicken curry burrito but it was sold out so obviously everyone else wanted to try it too.

This is THE McDonald's that everyone wishes were in their neighborhood.  Probably the newest one in Las Vegas, it definitely sets the bar of what you hope all McDonald's could be like!Located on S. Rainbow with its major cross streets being Warm Springs and the 215, it has generated quite a buzz!With a flowing fountain to welcome you, the inside feels more like a coffee lounge.  Cool color tones welcomes you to take advantage of their free WiFi and the large TV has you hanging out longer than you normally would.  Instead of the typical outdoor play area for kids with those plastic balls (an area rarely ever cleaned), this location has an indoor area that looks like it could be cleaned and inspected on a regular basis.  There's also a few larger tables set aside for what could be private parties - birthday parties at Mickey D's are coming back perhaps?Nonetheless, this fast food joint and design are a welcome addition to the neighborhood, even if there's another McDonald's less than a mile away in the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.

Review Text :
Another Charlotte Restaurant Week experience!Again, it is my personal belief a participating restaurant should put their best foot (or dishes, for that matter) forward during restaurant week. It's two weeks out of the year, folks. Do it up and do it right.That being said, I was absolutely jacked to try The Mint Museum's newest addition - Halcyon! Their fresh (no freezer on site) farm to table concept is just as lovely as their decor. Gorgeous twig chandeliers, lots of deep, rich browns, ocean blue wall, interesting silverware and more. Plus, that patio is going to be stunning during the warmer months. Service was friendly and efficient and we were in and out within an hour. I can, however, imagine staying a while once CRW is over. The food, however, is where Halcyon fell a bit short of wondrous, both in flavor and in portion sizes. I see on their Yelp biz categories they listed small plates and new American, perhaps I should have paid more attention to the small plate mention. Listen, I don't expect grandiose portions, but I left Halcyon hungry. That's sayin' a lot. Here's what I had:Amuse Bouche - Hummus w/pita points: 3/5: This was actually a generous helping of hummus, especially for an amuse bouche. Our server brought us extra pita points because the heaping pile of hummus only came with three. Ha. I love carbs, I'd like some extra pita. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the hummus,Farm Salad: 4/5: Local butter lettuce with a few sunflower seeds, tasty tomatoes and a delicious mustard vinaigrette. Great texture and full of color. I really, really enjoyed the dressing. Short Rib: 3.5/5: Let me put this out there right away - I love the flavors on the plate. Loved the tender short rib, the tasty glaze, the potato puree and the root veggies. My problem with this dish? There wasn't much of it. At all. Three very small slices of short rib, two bites of potato and the equivalent of two baby carrots diced. Normally I offer hubs a few bites of my dish, but I didn't have any to share. Color me disappointed, but they said this was supposed to be a main course*? Maybe I got the runt of the short rib  - it was very short. *In the same vein, hubs ordered the chicken and I chuckled when they set it down. The chicken was the size of a kiwi with a protruding bone. Creme Brulee: 2/5: Very cold inside and the texture was pretty off. Not smooth, creamy and delicious as I had hoped. Plus, the flavor was lacking. So, maybe I should have paid more attention to the small plate classification? I'll take a bit of the blame, but that could have been advertised a bit better on their CRW menu and website, for that matter. I know I'll come back to Halcyon as I really adore the concept, but I'll be sure to have a snack before I arrive."Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese." -- Benny & Joon (1993)Wow this place is gorgeous. I mean, it seems a shame to actually eat in this place. I feel like I should be dressed up and drinking champagne and looking at the decor. But truly, it isn't like that at all - talk about first impressions being off.Another business trip dinner and this place was highly touted on Yelp (thanks, guys!). So my co-workers and I made our way over after making a reservation. Uptown was not close to where we were working, so we made a later reservation. Luckily, they took us early. We ordered cocktails immediately and started sipping and deciding on the menu. I got the Sow Not - a rye cocktail that was not at all sweet - yay! We did our usual ordering of the cheese board - 3 cheeses, one was local. The server rattled them off so quickly that I have no idea what they were. One was a blue goat - I was not a fan at all. I think that was left on the board as my friend Mike hated it too. The others were devoured.As for dinner - here is what we ordered:Bleu cheese souffl√© - Mushroom Veloute. Roasted Shallot. CognacDuck breast - Foie Gras Boudin Blanc. Sweet Potato. Spiced Turnips. BrusselsPiedmontese Ribeye - Spring Onion. Garlic Scapes. French Horn MushroomsSwordfish - Shrimp. Razor Clams. White Mirepoix. Potato Saffron Rouille. PersilladeCharlie ordered the souffle as he was not having any of the cheese plate - he was a big fan. I had a taste and enjoyed it immensely.  The veloute was rich and creamy without being too heavy while the souffle was the right hint of cheese without being over powering.  Our entrees were both hit and miss. The duck duo was Charlie's - he loved the breast, but the boudin - which was like a sausage - had an odd texture and he really disliked it. The rest of the plate was good for him, but he could not get past the foie at all. So over all it was 2.5 stars. The Swordfish was Mike's - he enjoyed it but it was heavier than he was expecting. He rated his higher than Charlie did his. The razor clam was a hit, as was the swordfish. The sides were just okay. 3.5 stars.  As for the ribeye - they did a song and dance about this beef and honestly, it tasted like every other cut of beef I have had. Nothing special - not greass-fed or anything. Seriously, the server did go on about it being local and special. I could not tell. It was delicious, and cooked properly. I enjoyed the scapes and mushrooms - but it was not worth the upcharge for fancy beef. 3.5 stars.Since we were all disappointed in our entrees - we ordered desserts:Brown butter cake with roasted pineappleLayered chocolate cake with hazelnutsFrench toast & gelatoObviously I could not taste the chocolate cake, but both the brown butter cake and french toast were good - again, nothing to write home about. I would have liked the cake to be more moist. Mike loved his chocolate cake.Overall service was good, at times a little slow, but not too annoyingly so. We were in no hurry. Oddly, a table came in not once, but twice, sat and looked over the menu and then left. This is a place where posting the menu outside the front door might help. It is odd to be a patron and watch that happen a couple of times. Trust me - this menu is not for everyone.

Was essen Syrer respektive was erwartet mich in einem syrischen Restaurant? Mit diesen Fragen betraten wir das Alibaba und bevor wir auch nur einen Bissen gekostet zu haben, weiss ich nun, dass das syrische Essen hier beliebt ist. Doppelt gebucht sind am Wochenende die Tische, so dass wer ohne Reservierung aufschl√§gt, erstmal keine Chance hat. Dass wir doch noch zu zwei Tellern fanden lag an unserer Hartn√§ckigkeit, daran dass die M√§dels m√∂glich machten, was irgend m√∂glich war und sicherlich auch darin begr√ºndet, das wir bereits um 19 Uhr aufschlugen.So fanden wir nicht nut einen Platz, um uns rum war es sogar ziemlich leer und wir konnten uns in Ruhe   dem Alibabataller (Kufta mit 5 Vorspeisen) sowie der Grillvariation widmen. Dazu kommt Brot und wir hatten noch eine zus√§tzliche Vorspeise - wer bin ich, dass ich Hummus widerst√ºnde!Extraw√ºnsche in Sachen no bread, no milk waren kein Problem, die Speisen, die dann kamen waren interessant gew√ºrzt, leicht s√§uerlich mitunter, nussig und mit gutem √ñl angereichert.

Review Text :
I'm on the fence about this place still. It could go down to 2 stars or it could go up to 4 stars. I'm currently exercising some forgiveness since it just opened and a few kinks are pretty much inevitable.When I walked in, I was greeted by 4 hostesses. Yep, 4. I'm assuming it was part of some kind of training. And, technically, I was really only greeted by 1 of them. The others just sorta looked on. I was asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or dining area (bar area includes high tops). I replied that the bar area was fine. The hostess then went back to the other 3 hostesses, conferred for a bit, and then led me to a high top in the bar area.The bar and dining areas aren't really divided at all. It's all one big room with no physical division. The dining area is all booths for the most part. The bar area is a long bar with stools and then a cluster of high tops, including some high tops that are part booth.Upon seating me, the hostess explained that the only part of the menu available was - the nachos. The rest of the menu is not available until after January 1st.And so I sat there for awhile. No one even so much as looked at me. Though, I counted at least 12 staff (hostesses, bartenders, and servers) milling around and there were only 4 other customers in the entire restaurant. But ok, I was waiting for someone, so maybe they were waiting until that person arrived. Nonetheless, seemed strange that no one took my drink order, brought water, etc.After the person I waiting for arrived, we continued to wait for about another 10 minutes. At that point, a woman who I assume was a manager came over and asked if we'd been helped yet. She then promised that our server would be right over and she took our drink order (stating that the drinks were on her). She was incredibly sweet and friendly. Things were looking up.The bartender, after being all befuddled at how our drinks could possibly be on the manager, brought us our drinks one by one. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the draft beer selection was rather decent. They have the standards (Bud, Coors, etc.), and they have the slightly better (Blue Moon, etc.), and then also have the way better (Snow Cap, 2 Below, Dogfish Head, etc.).After a few more minutes, our server arrived. She apologized for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. The nacho list is quite extensive and inventive (and you can also build your own). And all of the nachos are available as a half or full order. We settled on two half orders - the Buffalo Hot and Sloppy Daddy. At this point, we were informed that they didn't have the chips the Buffalo Hot is supposed to come with. Ok then, we'll just have it on regular tortilla chips.Our server was very nice and was good with timing, checking on us, etc. However, it definitely seemed like she was very new - new not only to this new restaurant, but new to serving. She was super sweet, but seemed a little flustered. In fact, I think the same could be said of the majority of the staff here. And by staff, I mean young, thin females with a strong preference for blondes. Possibly trying a little too hard for a Hooters feel.It seemed to take a while for our food to arrive, especially considering it is nachos. But it didn't take too long, so all ok. The nachos were pretty good. Good enough to warrant us coming here again. The chicken on the Buffalo Hot was just the right size and perfectly spicy (which in my book, is on the very hot side). The pulled pork on the Sloppy Daddy has a great flavor. And the best part was that they didn't skimp on the cheese. Unlike other plates of nachos, we were not left halfway through eating with a plate of chips and no toppings. The cheese permeated every inch of of the chips. They weren't the best nachos I've ever had. In fact, not even close. But they were different and they were yummy. The prices, though, did seem a little high for what you get. You can get full orders of nachos elsewhere for less than the price of the half orders here.The manager came over two additional times, asking what we had ordered (and making some small talk) and then again after the food had arrived (asking how everything was). Major props.The decor is nice and everything was very pristine. Several large flat screens in the bar area tuned to different sports channels. Even a couple of flat screens in the corners of the dining section. No gaming. No smoking. Music was neither too loud or too soft - primarily all Top 40.Overall, a decent experience and a decent place. I fully intend on patronizing here again, especially to see how it is after the kinks are ironed out. And ok, yeah, I might already be craving the Buffalo Hot nachos a little bit.I have to give Nacho Daddy some credit where credit is due now. There's a new chef in town and you can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients and the food is much more interesting and enjoyable to my palate.We ordered:GUACAMOLE- Fresh and flavorful.3 Kinds of SALSA- A tad watery and not enough bite for my liking. Didn't care for any of them. Side of White QUESO- The only thing that would make this cheese better is if naked Ryan Gosling was feeding this to me with his fingers while whispering sweet words in my ear.ENCHILADA NACHOS- Not a huge fan of the red enchilada sauce they used, but overall still grubbed big time on these. Nice huge chunks of white meat chicken.CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP- My partner in crime loved it.Dessert Nachos/FRIED ICE CREAM- I was lovin' on the chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips! Delicious ice cream, too!Not only was the food a huge improvement from my last visit a year ago, but the service was spot on, too. Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu and offered up her recommendations and also made sure our cups were at least half full at all times. Just a doll. (Only small complaint was when I was walking to my car in my VS yoga pants the cactus bush was strategically sticking out into the sidewalk and scratched me below my belly button with her big ass bush! Ughhhh. Please trim ya big bush!)Now I definitely don't think the food is five stars and is really closer to a three stars, but when you throw in the awesome service, cleanliness and UNLV on the tvs, I'M THERE.  Nacho Daddy does not suck balls anymore. He actually gave up ball sucking to make some nachos! Good stuff!Ok, this is the first review that I have felt the need to update on Yelp. It looks like Nacho Daddy has achieved the impossible... they blended chips and cheese!! Actually since I wrote my initial review (rated them a 1) they have hired a new GM (#4?) who knows what he is doing, they have a new kitchen manager (# who knows) and have cut down the menu to a point where they can actually achieve a high level of execution. I think they have finally reached a level of competency in which a business can begin to win over customers and become successful. For this I will move them up to a 3 of 5... but that is because I still hold my breath when I walk in and order. I keep expecting them to mess up my order, but they seem to have a renewed energy and I think its because they are finally on the right track.Lets be clear. The service was never the issue here. It was always that the Management staff (GM and Kitchen Manager) could never find a consistent formula that worked. Now that the issue seems to be solved the food is reflective and its worth giving them another chance. Its now save to eat the Nachos!! PS. Keep it up and I will have no problem changing the rating to a 4... its that much better these days!Had a 10 for 20 dollar Living Social coupon so me and the fam decided to try it out. I guess I went AFTER the improvements were made all around because I had a very pleasant experience. Half the reviews were not too positive, but until you actually experience it for yourself, then you can reflect it here on Yelp. So my expectations were neutral.As we came in, the hostess greeted us and were sat down right away. About a minute later, Victoria, (who was our server), came by to take our order. As soon as we informed her we were noobs, she politely gave us a little overview of the menu. As we were deciding she got our drink orders and left to get them. When she came back, she gave us a small order of the Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins! I gotta say it was good and just the fact that Victoria gave us some to try was very commendable! I got the Fajita Nachos, my two kids got basic kids items, (chicken fingers, bean n cheese burrito), and my wife got endless chips and salsa. Good thing I only ordered one plate of nachos because what they give you is a lot! All for of us shared it after they ate their meal already and we still couldnt finish it! The chicken fingers were basically cooked like Katsu! For those that don't know what that is, its a chicken breast lightly breaded and deep fried to a golden crisp. For dessert, we had two choices: Deep Fried Ice Cream or a Churro topped with Ice Cream, Chocolate Drizzle, and surrounded by different colored tortilla chips. We chose the Deep Fried Ice Cream! Again, we all had to share it because it was a pretty good sized item.So props goes out to Victoria and the rest of the Nacho Daddy staff. I wouldnt mind bringing new people to this place especially if they are craving nachos.This review is for 4.5 stars.If you love nachos, this is THE place for nachos. I'm not a health fanatic, but a real person who believes in exercise and moderation, so going to this place does not make me feel guilty- I do not have something like this everday. Some people love chocolate (my husband), some people love meat and potatoes (my older brother), and some people love nachos- yes, I AM that person. (Ok, I LOVE ice cream, too.) Ok, enough disclaimer, on to my review. At the top of the menu, it reads "Home of the Gourmet Nachos." And I totally agree!There were some interesting combinations (I'd like to try the thai nachos sometime), but the one we really wanted to try was the Enchilada Nachos- pulled chicken- very tender and seasoned perfectly, very cheesy, and well-topped with pickled jalapenos (I love medium-spicy). I'm a bit of nachos enthusiast, so I like when toppings are evenly distributed, just saying. I don't like when there are chunks of something, like sour cream or guacamole, in one spot only. Oops, I almost forgot to mention the mini jalapeno corn muffins- so warm, fresh and delicious!!! Now, that's a starter. And we did have the fried ice cream for dessert- talk about huge. I thought the nachos were over-the-top, but in a good way. Some of the chips were chocolate, and everything was topped with raspberry sauce, which I normally don't really like, but it sure worked here. Well, I had to stop because I was too full, and couldn't eat another bite. I don't think my husband wants to go anywhere else for nachos.  So, we went here again, this time for lunch; the crowd is smaller, compared to dinner. We chose the pulled pork nachos- complete with a white cheese sauce, bbq sauce, and topped with fried onion strings. This is a combination that you wouldn't really picture with nachos. But the savory combination did work very well, indeed. I did think that the topper (fried onion strings) was very generous. Anyway, what I am trying to say, is that there are ten types of nachos here and it sure is fun trying new things. There is the appetizer version and the entree version for a couple dollars more (we always choose the entree version because we share it). I think the next time we will try the "nacho average burger" nachos.  The decor is pretty casual. The servers are nice too. Clean place. Seats are booths as well as chairs & tables. The baby gets his own sling. All games are on the tvs (it's a sport bar), as well as videos for the music lovers. The womens bathroom (located up front) is unique, there are three different mirrored sinks, each with its own partition. But, since I am a new mommy, I did notice that there is no baby- changing station. Also, check out the picture booth, 2 strips is $2.00.Oh wow, what a find. I've always made jokes about the large Nacho Daddy billboard currently at I-215 and Eastern but I'm not laughing now. I'm smiling from ear to ear and planning a return visit. Where to start? First off the wait was short, they quoted 10 minutes and it was barely 5. From there things only got better. From a big bowl of guacamole that was priced right and was made with fresh ingredients to hot chips that were replaced without fuss with more hot chips when we ran low, the appetizers were good. As I had my fiancee and my son with me we ordered a soft taco off the kids menu, a Supreme Tostada nacho for her, and Florentine Nachos for me. The only thing in our carry out bag when we left was the soft taco as it was huge and my son loved the rice and beans and was full on that before even making it to the taco. Both of our nachos were loaded, and when they were brought to the table we were impressed. You definitely get a good value here, and these nachos were good all the way to the bottom, you were not left wishing you had more cheese or toppings to scoop up at the end. The chips were thin and crisp but strong enough to hold a lot of toppings without breaking apart. The Supreme Tostada nachos is their classic take on a loaded traditional nacho plate, it is everything you would expect to find, done right. But the Florentine Nachos...when I read the menu I was skeptical. But anything with sun dried tomatoes, prosciutto, and asiago, romano, and parmesan is usually not going to be a disappointment and my plate was left empty when I was done. This is the stuff that has you thinking that trying to explore the rest of the menu on a return visit will be very hard to do! On and on I can go with this but the best part of our experience was the service. It was incredibly good. From start to finish, we were taken care of. My 3 year old ended up touching our server's arm by accident as he was reaching for his drink and I was like uh-oh. Unlike some places where the server would recoil and freak out if they didn't like kids that didn't happen here. With 2 different servers they made my son feel comfortable and treated him right and even picked up a toy he dropped. But my fiancee and I were taken care of too...again chips were replaced on time, tea was taken care of. It was the way it's supposed to be. I try and not just hand out 5 star reviews. I'm known for my Absolutely Not and Jackassery lists so calling it as I see it is something I've clearly established my ability to do. But based on how good the food was, coupled with hands down the very best service I've received in Las Vegas in the past 2 years, 5 Stars is most appropriate. And I can't wait to go back and am already telling others about this place. (Our server was Chelsea, and I rarely name names in Yelp tips or reviews. But Chelsea raised the bar for me regarding how servers can be, and the customer service experience in general.)(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #23)After my first visit to Nacho Daddy I didn't think I'd ever come back (see the reason here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-henderson?userid=UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw#vvSCsR6z5ae2NEu_XkqxWQ). Nearly two years later, we returned for trivia night and it was a much better experience. Bordering on 4 stars, but not quite. We arrived around 6:30 for trivia that starts at 7. One of the great things about this place, unlike other places in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserve tables. That's awesome. Service was incredibly slow as trivia got underway. Understandable since they were pretty busy, but honestly, if the restaurant knows they get busier on these days they need to staff accordingly. We decided to share some Nachos Florentine and they were so much better than our previous visit to Nacho Daddy. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were nice, but I still wish they would spread out the toppings better so that you're not left with tons of plain chips on the bottom of the stack. I appreciate all the different nacho offerings. They are quite creative. Service was slow throughout, albeit friendly. We won trivia that evening, which was a blast, so we'll be back next week to spend out $50 in winnings. Hopefully I can try some of their other offerings.Omg when I am craving fish tacos, Nacho Daddy is my go-to. The fish tacos here are grilled and they come with a delicious homemade mango salsa. Everything tastes really fresh and the waitstaff is very nice but also casual.The location is right up the road from my office and they were very efficient with their take out service. But when you dine-in, I would definitely recommend the margaritas. My favorite is the Daddy's. Order it.I wish they were closer to Summerlin but I heard they are opening a second location in downtown Las Vegas, so I will definitely be visiting that one soon ;)I always give in to my honey and his obsession for Nachos. He talked about this place for days. So as our first meal in Vegas we decided to go here (of course). The atmosphere inside the restaurant is a typical sports bar. Filled with multiple TVs. On this day it was perfect, since it was a Sunday = Football Day!! We decided to sit at the bar area. We were served by a lovely waitress. She was very friendly and always asked us if we needed anything. We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in offer of free salsa and chips. They brought us two types of "colored" chips and salsa (hot & medium). We ordered the VEGAN NACHOS. If your expecting nacho cheese sauce. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's basically chips placed on a hot skillet they topped with Crumbles of veggie patty, Daiya cheese, beans, corn, saut√©ed peppers and onions, guacamole and a small amount of green salsa. This nacho was DRY as hell! It seemed like they put everything together and then slapped it into the oven. The nachos stick together. Making it hard to pull apart.Just when I thought the Nacho was dry. I was "served" the Driest Tex-Mex Burrito. Is there a shortage in sauce? I won't go into detail with it because no amount of sauce can make this taste good. It's like eating dry rice and beans. The sad thing is both Burrito and Nachos are not cheap. I did think the massive Bloody Mary bar was cool. Other than that I don't think I would come back unless my honey begs me to. Then maybe just maybe, I'll give in!

First off, the waitress seated us and immediately poured oil and balsamic for the bread and yet, no bread came until after we ordered 15 minutes later.  (I hate when restaurants wait for you to order to bring out bread/chips!)  The bread they brought out were breadsticks that I swear I've had at some other restaurant.  If you're called 'gourmet' I expect you to be making and baking everything from scratch.  We ordered a cheese plate that consisted of cheese and crackers that I'm sure they bought at Wal-Mart.  Three different types of bland cheddar and a bland brie.  The Caesar Salad was literally the best part of the meal.  Shaved parmesean and what looked like homemade croutons.  (Really?  Homemade croutons but not homemade bread?)  I got Spaghetti and Meatballs and my wife ordered Fettucine Alfredo and we could have had less bland and much better food with the Classico that is in our pantry.  My meatballs were dry and the alfredo was very runny.  I went here because I had a Groupon and it's near my house but I probably wouldn't go back again.  I read the other reviews and let me say, the service was fine and we were seated right away.  The appetizer, salad, and entres all came out within a reasonable amount of time so there's no complaints there.  The decor and music were just fine but I really can't get past the food.Came here with a friend that lives in Henderson.  I liked the decor and the music they were playing (Andrea Bocelli) during dinner. The restaurant was also packed on a Tuesday evening, but luckily we made a reservation and did not have to wait too long.We ordered their fried calamari and the Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) as our appetizer, and since the restaurant was all out of chicken we ordered a Veal Marsala.The Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) was something I have never had before, and it was the highlight of our dining experience here.  I recalled reading another comment about getting two orders of this and have that as the entire meal.  I too think that is an excellent idea.The Fried Calamari appetizer was an EPIC FAIL. It came out looking like it was left unattended in the fryer, and was rescued from the scolding oil after it was completely crispy and dark brown, but not completely burnt. If it was a kitchen mishap by inexperienced culinary students learning to fry food, I can totally understand.  Newbies tend to overfry/cook fried calamari, instead of flash frying them.  But after tasting it, and discovering the not-so-pleasant fishy after-taste, indicative of seafood that has started to turn or already completed the left turn, I believe it was intentional and to mask the lack of freshness in the calamari.  I usually finish everything, but we opted to left half of the calamari on the plate and asked to have it taken away.The Veal Marsala was okay.  It came with a buttery Marsala sauce and pieces of sauteed white mushrooms, and a side of spaghetti.  The consistency of the sauce would be graded a C+/B- at best in my Saucier class, and I definitely have had better Marsala Sauce at the Cheesecake Factory. Overall, there is nothing to really complain or praise about this dish.  It was just very "homemade".  Service was good.  We did not take too long reaching a decision for what we were going to order, and the bread basket and order we brought out in a timely manner, even when the restaurant was packed.  So if service was an issue in the past, it has since been resolved.In conclusion, I thought we had a decent dining experience in all aspects of dining out, excluding the food.  The food experience spanned the full spectrum of "Oh my gato, that's terrible" to "it's alright" to "Yes, I would totally recommend that!"But with the overweight on "food" score, it only gets a 2 stars.The restaurant does have potential. And I respect the fact that they want to honor their family's recipes, but taste change overtime as should some recipes. Clinging to the sacred family heirloom recipes for the sake of doing so, is IMO a mistake.  If the customer constructive feedback is decidedly less than positive, it is only wise to be open-minded and see if updating the recipe is needed. P.S.  Thank you Andy T and Li Ly.This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Don't waste your time or money.in detail: arrived with my hubby and three kids around 7pm. There was only one other couple dining there at the time. I walked in while hubby gathered the kids. No one waited on me at first, then a hostess came up and asked in a very snooty tone if I had RESERVATIONS. I pointedly looked around and said 'Do I NEED them?"  She then proceeded to argue with me as to why I should choose a table that had high stools. I told her my kids are too small for that, they need a table for five. She insisted on a stooled table.At this point I walked out to find my husband about to enter the restaurant with our three kids. I shook my head and said "I dont think this is a good place for kids." because I thought the reason she was treating me thusly was because I had kids.A woman going into the restaurant overheard me, asked me what had happened, and ushered us in, insisting that they serve children, she went to the hostess and fussed at her, saying "people do NOT need a reservation to eat here." I didnt really want to eat there after that, but my kids were hungry and the woman (I guess the owner?) insisted.unfortunately, the owner/manager left after that, and the hostess then proceeded to seat us at a four-topper table (we needed a five) and pulled a chair up so my sons (ages two and three) could sit next to each other. WTF? I TOLD her we needed a five topper. If you dont have one give us a six topper, or an eight, but this was just unbelievable. The restaurant, as you may recall, was mostly empty. The restaurant started to fill up with other patrons and there were other people with kids, and also a kids menu, so at this point I didn't understand her attitude.If got worse as the night wore on. We waited and waited for her to take our order. She finally took it, and then we waited and waited and waited some more for it to come out. When it finally did, she didn't deliver it, someone else did, and they didnt wait around to see if it was correct. I was busy getting the food ready for my kids (the side dishes were all wrong), so it was a few minutes before i tried my own food.It was the totally wrong order.So was my husbands.But no wait staff were in sight.We were starving by this point, so we proceeded to eat it anyway. But my husband has a bad stomach and can eat only certain things, and he couldnt eat his meal.the waitress didnt check on us for THIRTY MINUTES. We had to wait for everything.At that point my meal was finished, though it was the wrong thing (the food was totally immemorable), my kids were done, and my husband hadnt eaten his food. She offered to bring him his original meal. He said ok.She went into the back and brought out the original ICE COLD plate he had ordered!!! I could not BELIEVE this!!! My kids had sat there for about two hours at this point and they had had it, so I took them to the car. My husband followed after paying the check. He was FUMING. This woman had had the GALL to charge us for three entrees!' The bill for this fiasco was EIGHTY-EIGHT DOLLARS!!!I have NEVER had service like this, anywhere. the waitress was argumentative, but did it with a smile on her face as though that made it OK. She was snooty the entire time we were there and acted like we were unwanted. Her whole attitude SUCKEDI hope to God the owner reads this. If I had an employee like this, I would fire them immediately. I was so upset by this, I couldn't fathom why on earth we were treated this way except perhaps that my ten year old daughter has downs syndrome, so I was actually relieved to read that other people had similar bad experiences here just so I knew it wasnt just us.If I could, I would give this place a negative five stars.

Okay, what did I do wrong people?  I am going against the grain... I didn't like the pizza... Is there a secret to ordering here?I had to go El Boro with a regular pepperoni and mushroom pizza to please the masses.  Should I have ordered something else?  I admit, I do like Chicago style, deep dish the best, but I've had my share of thin crust that I've dug.  Now, everyone's really going to hate me... the pizza crust was like cardboard, the cheese was rubbery and there was hardly any sauce on it.  There, I said it.  Sorry!So is there something else I should be getting here or did I just come on an off day?  I'm open to suggestions... this place is in my hood and rocks so many of your worlds, what's the secret!?

Huh. Huh, huh, huh. All in all, a fine experience, but will I go back? Eh. If people wanted to go there, sure. But I feel like I did it and it's done. (And I should have gone to Nostrano.)Our waitress was nice, she had some good things to say about the menu and about her personal preferences. She also let us swap out some pancetta with scallops in a risotto starter so that was cool. It was good, lacked depth though in my opinion, and the scallops themselves were a little over cooked yet didn't have much of a crusty outside from the sear. I'm going to say the pan wasn't hot enough and they were in there too long. Cesar salad was probably the highlight. Salad? Yup. Roasted red peppers should come on EVERYTHING and this salad proves that. The dressing was mild yet tangy, and dressed the romaine enough that each leaf was coated, but not overly so that it became soggy. And theeeeeeeeeeen my entree. Whole wheat pasta with vegetables and sausage in an "herbed broth". First of all, I have no idea what "herbed broth" means. Is that like chicken stock with thyme? Second of all, there was no broth and thus there was no flavor. Third, the amount of pasta was overwhelming. They don't make it there because nobody would send out (I'm not joking) nearly a box of penne in a bowl. It was nuts. I ate around most of it but found the veggies to be way overcooked and the sausage while made in house lacked the flavor profile that I'm used to from Nostrano and Underground meats. My biggest pet peeve though is being told I'm supposed to leave, without being asked. At about 9:00pm or so a bus boy came by sweeping the dining room into a dirty little pile of the evening's food scraps, bread crumbs and dust. Then he started to re-arrange furniture. Then the music faded. Look you guys, tell me it's time to go and I'll go, but we made a reservation for 9:00pm, we got there at 8:30pm which you were excited about and you told us you close at 10:00pm. A few months ago I stopped at a Culvers just as they were closing, asked if I could grab a burger and they said, "As long as our doors are still open, we're here for the customer." Culvers!

WOW!  Tropicana has done it I tell you.  The Casino is completely remodeled as well as all the rooms, but my review is not about the Hotel.  Tropicana recently opened its new day club (Nikki Beach) and night club (Club Nikki) on May 26th.  This place is off the charts!  The beach club is an all white theme, with white day beds everywhere.  They even have some kick ass white "Tee Pee" cabanas.  The pool is a little small but the day club is simply amazing.  The vibe is much more up my alley compared to other day clubs like Rehab and Wet Republic.  In these two clubs there are numerous drunk college kids and what I like to call Guebos (Jersey Shore type guys that are completely ripped and like to do monkey dances as they try to attract the opposite sex).  Not at Nikki.  They are a little more strict there (dress code, no drinks in the pool, guys cant dance on ledges, etc).  Don't get me wrong you can still have fun Vegas style. but the rules tend to not attract that "party till Im retarded" type crowd.  The service could be better honestly, the staff was all incredibly friendly but I felt like it took an hour to get a drink once we ordered it from our cocktail waitress.Now the night club....    Again....wow!  This is a smaller club compared to most but the atmosphere was very similar to the pool, chill but people are here to party.  They have an amazing light show to dance with, the dance floor is fairly good size, and they have plenty of tables.  They also have three bars around the club which makes it nice ordering a drink (you dont have to wait forever compared to other clubs that have one bar).  Elaine was right, they have a wood platform around the dance floor that girls can get up and dance on, but if you are of the male sex security will grab your ass down within a heart beat.  NOW HERE IS THE BEST PART OF THE CLUB: They have a champagne muse (looks like a circle chandelier) that goes around a track on the roof and will drop down from the ceiling to your table if you order certain types of champagne.  Their is a beautiful girl on it dressed like an Angel and she will literally deliver the bottle to your table while being dropped from the roof!  Awesome right!?!?  If you are debating about going to check out these clubs because they are located at the "ghetto Tropicana" I would wait no longer.  Tropicana has outdone itself and I can honestly say these clubs are among the top clubs in Vegas.  GO!!! =)It's a great mix of people and a fun time!THE DIRTY:While there were "cocktail waitresses," not one came up to us, ever. We were there for 4 hours..... just saying.The people who work at the walk-up bar are soooo sweet/awesome/amaze-balls!THE SCENE:It was pretty random. I was def the hottest chick there, but that's not to say that there wasn't eye candy. It was just a true blend of people and social diversity. But, the main focus was that we all wanted to have fun! LOVE it!OVERALL:Someone jacked my sunglasses, whatev...Poor chair-side service....The pool water was chilly....A good vibe from the people there....Order a Mojito! Sooo Good!!I can't say if i recommend or not, bc i was there on e Wednesday and it wasn't crackin'.xo-andrea

Dang, where is the crackhead ghetto speaking midget counter guy as was described in another review?  I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thingI wasn't there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn't want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. So I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  Then I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like "Da!! I lost my money" we said, "Yum, we're gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger" and it was good. With a soda, it's over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn't run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble.

I thought that this place was pretty great! Rand H. another great Yelper had recommended it,so I always wanted to try it.I came here with a friend to celebrate her Birthday early (crazy Schedules we have.)Anyway ,the first thing I noticed about this place is how absolutely Beautiful it is!Honestly,it has 2 of the most beautiful Chandeliers. The place is done in some gorgeous tile,and some beautiful statues as well.The food is fresh and a lot of great selections. They even have a Mongolian Chef,as well as a Sushi Chef. All very good.I wish they brought a tea pot with hot tea. But instead they bring you a foam cup with a straw and lid. But, my friend got Ice Tea and she got a glass with a straw. I thought that procedure was a little odd. Lots of parking outside, and the service was good. He kept coming to check on us. The Bathrooms however, could use a little attention.But, all in all, the place was beautiful and the food was great.

Review Text :
This restaurant lives up to its name. They are really true to their concept here. I've dined at the Camelback True Food several times and so when I learned that the new True Food Kitchen was opening at Scottsdale Quarter, I couldn't wait to check it out! A couple visits later and I can rightfully say...Fox, you've done it again! Believe it or not, I actually like this True Food better than the original location. The vibe is a lot cooler and more "natural." I really feel healthier when I walk in. With the garden out back (or is it the front?) and the airiness and open feel, for a brief moment I feel like I'm on the countryside near a stream rather than in the middle of fashionista central. Yes, it's the same exact menu as the other location and maybe because newer always tastes better, but I taste a different for the better in this menu! Everything has a bit more flavor and that's saying a lot because the flavor at the original location is pretty darn good! The hummus here is my favorite starter dish. They add olives and the pita bread is soft and chewy. One of my favorite go-to lunch items here is the Turkey pita sandwich. YUM. It's just as good if not better as I expected. In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of either the hash or the kale salad. The hash has also been kind of blah and the kale salad tasted like I was eating a leaf. But, here...I like both! I don't know what they did, but the hash has much more seasoning and taste. I had the sweet potato hash so that might have something to do with it. And the Kale salad wasn't quite so leafy. As for the sides aka drinks and dessert, my favorite drink there is the Medicine Man. It takes a pretty spectacular non-alcoholic drink for me to pay $6, but if there's any drink that lives up to par, it's the Medicine Man. I could probably drink 11 of them, but I hold back. As for dessert, I normally don't opt for dessert at True Food because there's something anti-climatic about it there, but when I do splurge, the Carmel brownie is the way to go. So welcome to the corridor True Food! You've made it just a little tastier here!True Food Kitchen did not live up to the hype I was expecting after ready so many good Yelp reviews...  It was A-OK at best for this Fox Restaurant.   We arrived for lunch and the True Food Kitchen was very busy so we opted to sit on the patio in 109 degree weather.  We were shaded and they have misters, so we were relatively comfortable.  Restaurant ~ there has plenty said already about this place on Yelp and the pics are a slide show for you to enjoy.  It's a nice looking restaurant both inside and out.  The decor and color schemes are nicely done.  I did not care for the flow since there are really two main entrances, one on the north side and one of the south side.  We entered the north side and stood in front of the bar area for a while until one of the bartenders informed us we had to go to the other side of the bar to see a hostess for seating.Service ~ This was one of the more disappointments during our lunch. We were off to a bit of a rough start but that really didn't matter, it was the service we received throughout our dinning experience.  It started off great with placing our order and receiving our drinks but after we received our meal... our server must have checked out.  We tried to stop a few other passing by servers however they they too seemed disinterested in their customers as if they were all having a bad day.   We did not see our server again until we were ready for our bill.  Food ~ I ordered the grass fed Bison burger, which had shiitake mushrooms and onions, mayo, parmesan cheese on a flax bun. It was supposed to be an Unami burger but it was more of a Tsunami burger.  The parmesan cheese was too much for this well cooked and seasoned bison burger.  It over powered the taste so I had to remove it.  I ordered the sweet potato hash as my side, which was good for the first few bites but then it became somewhat blah...We also order the shaved turkey sandwich but they were out of shaved turkey.  It was 11:30am... So we opted for the turkey burger with a side of kale salad.  The turkey burger came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, provolone cheese, and mayo on a flax bun.  The burger was cooked very well but could have assembled better.  They placed the tomato's on top of the not so ripe avocados which were on top of the lettuce.  This made the burger like a pin ball machine, with every bite out shoots a chunk of avocado.  Bite  ~ ping, out shoots a chunk onto her blouse.  Another bite ~ pang, out shoots another chunk and it bounces onto the table.  They should consider making an avocado aioli spread for this burger.  The kale salad was also good for the first few bites then it tasted blah.Since this was our first visit to the True Food Kitchen I raised this review up to 3 stars.  I am hesitant but will consider going back for another try in hope the service and quality of food is better.  I will be sure to select something different on my next visit.I've been to this TFK more times than I can count, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now.  (I have reviewed the Biltmore location).I've been here alone, in small groups of 2-4, in larger groups of 5+, with and without my toddler.  I've never had a bad experience.  That says a lot.  The food is consistent, healthy, and delicious.  The service is attentive.  The atmosphere is lively.  The bathrooms are clean.This has become a go-to place for us to meet friends that live in North Scottsdale as it's kind of half-way...Standout items on the brunch menu in my opinion are the johnnycakes and the open faced egg white omelette.  I enjoy the "bright eyes" drink as well.  For lunch/dinner, you really can't go wrong but some of my faves are the vegetable crudite appetizer, the kale salad with salmon, the pan seared sea bass, teriyaki brown rice bowl.  You can't go wrong with their turkey burger either, and their pizzas are great for kids!On the FRC website, they say that "At True Food Kitchen, we want you to feel better, live longer, and make your mouth happy in the process."  I'd say they are making good on their mission - one meal at a time!****It's worth noting that the parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter is either in the big lot or valet unless you have really good parkma and score a spot on the street nearby.Okay, this place really got on my nerves, and this is why: I went there for dinner at the hotel receptionist's suggestion for a local vegetarian restaurant. I walk in around 7 pm and sit at what looks like a juice bar. I pick from the menu something called "medicine man" which purportly contains pomegranate juice. I ask the 20-something server, "This is real fresh juice you make yourself, correct?" "Everything you see here is made here," he says - a brilliantly vague answer considering the sham he is about the serve me. "So you actually have the pomegranates and then you juice them yourself?" and he nods affirmatively. I see a commercial juicer so I believe the little punk.Guess what I got? For $6 + tax, I get this pinkish watery thing in an 8-ounce plastic cup, at least half of it filled with ice. No, this gotta be a mistake. Maybe it tastes like heavily watered down Kool-Aide because the ice has melted. So I send it back and ask for juice without ice. I am informed that without ice I would get half as much, which was fine with me, thinking now I'm going to get something that actually tastes like fruit. I watch him return almost instantly with a smaller glass cup. Wow, he's gotta be the fastest juice-man on the planet, I joke, but inside I am cringing because freshness and instantaneous don't go together and the realization that I've been had is beginning to settle in.  Yes, it tastes the same. It's the same pinkish watery crap with all of four blueberries floating on top. "I thought you said you have fresh juice.""It is fresh," he insists matter-of-factly. "We just sell so much of it that we have to make it in the morning." "And why does it taste so watery?""Oh, we top it off with soda water."I ask to see how it is done. He shows me a large dented metal coffee urn, labeled "medicine man." He pours the now day-old "fresh juice" and then tops it off with a soda gun. There is nothing fresh about the pomegranate either. It's right out of a POM bottle. I paid, even left a tip, and strolled out, hungry but polite. Even thanked my server. The kid wouldn't know fresh if it crashed into his forehead. But I was more anguished for not having the guts to do what needed to be done: refuse to pay, throw the "fresh juice" into the little pissant's face and hollered curses at the corporate jackasses that pull this off on the unsuspecting public.Why am I such a chicken? Oh, I'm in some fancy shopping mall with all these model suburbanite's cluelessly huffing down soda and old juice and congratulating themselves for being healthy. Doing what needed to be done would've precipitated the painful jamming of my head between the floor and the flabby but insistent ass cheeks of the nearest security guard.By the way, there is absolutely nothing vegetarian about this fake of a place. My quick scan of the menu didn't spot a single meatless entree. And to add insult to injury, these shameless lovers of the planet serve sea bass!True Food, my ass. Or maybe they're just being ironic.Stung by audaciously corrupt capitalism, I took refuge at a true vegetarian place, here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/organic-shores-phoenix?hrid=6Unfw6K79UO3B6q1edEjzAOoo, i am most certainly a fan of True Food Kitchen! The restaurant is basically one big open box with the patio wrapping around 3 sides of it. Definitely a great place to take a lunch break when you are out shopping in this really cool area of Scottsdale. The staff all seemed really fun and cheerful. To start off with I had a honey infused lemonade that was fantastic! Then came the vegetable crudites, wow, there's a show stopper for you! I huge bowl of absolutely beautiful vegetables - you can order a half order and I highly suggest it, between two of us we probably ate about half. Then for my main I had a perfectly spiced Panang curry rice bowl with wonderful jumbo prawns. Mmmm! I would order that again in a heartbeat! Thanks so much to Gabi M for taking me to this really fun spot. I can't wait to go back and actually do some shopping along with the eating!100 times better than the True Foods here in Fashion Valley. Service went ABOVE and beyond, I wish I knew the name of our server for a shout out... she was AMAZING! She was such a great help she really knew her stuff and made great recommendations (a healthy brunette with beautiful blue eyes) and way on top of her game. The drinks came out slow but I am sure that was not her fault. I had the scallops and they were SO DAMN GOOD and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish! All of our party of 12 seemed very happy with their meals. I tasted the curry and it was very good. We had a great crudette appetizer with a beautiful and delicious variety of veggies and hummus and pita. Everything was fantastic. I have to say I was not very excited when the boss wanted to go here because I have been to the fashion valley one a couple of times and was not impressed with any meal or beverage. This location changed my mind about True Foods. It's just the fashion valley one that sucks.okay, so this place is part super healthy, part experimentally interesting. and the bathroom is outside.we had the edamame dumplings to start. excellent.my colleague had the mahi mahi special - she was underwhelmed. she gave me all of her vegetables. I love veggies, but the tough, half green cauliflower I wasn't feeling. (apparently it's a half breed of another vegetable i'm not familiar with.) I had a spaghetti casserole thing with a bison burger on top. i wasn't mad at that at all. dessert. we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. it's made with 72% cacao, 0% sweetness. meh. I also got the squash pie. I was into that, until the crust that was so hard I needed a knife and brute strength to cut, cut the roof of my mouth. it's still healing. if that crust wasn't so hard the pie would be fairly amazing.Always a hit, my bad experiences here have been very limited, almost always leave a happy customer. So I returned to True Foods a couple days ago after having not dined there in about a year or two and I think this last visit was my favorite! There is so much variety here, healthy food and the vegetarian options are bountiful. I noticed that the menu was a little different since the last time I'd been there, but they still had my faves so I was happy!It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, but luckily I was able to get a seat right away. The server there was super nice and attentive to us. I absolutely love pizza, and I get the mushroom pizza almost every time I come here. However, I decided to change things up this time and went for the butternut squash pizza, and I am sure glad I did. I love both of the pizzas, but I think I prefer the butternut squash pizza. The walnuts definitely make it infinitely better, so good! Plus the fresh arugula on top is a nice touch. The spaghetti squash here it good too, but a bit pricier. I still have yet to try a Juby true juice, for sure on my list of things to try. Gives me reason to come back!

Review Text :
My wife and I had a Groupon to this place.  We were pretty excited about an outing here for dinner on a Saturday night.  I checked out the menu and had high hopes because this appeared to be a classic French brasserie.  We were greeted by our very cheerful waitress.  She warned us up front that it's "team service" so if we couldn't find her, to be sure to flag down one of the others from the wait staff and it would be no problem to get what we might need.  Unfortunately, it went all downhill from here.We started with the rabbit rillettes ($11).  The rabbit meat was tender but watery and tasteless.  There were capers and some watery sliced black olives on the side.  I just didn't get this dish.After that, there was an ENORMOUS wait for our entrees.  I nursed my glass of wine waiting for our entrees.  My wife ordered the Bouillabaisse ($27) and I ordered the Steak Frites ($30).  From what we could gather, the table next to us did not like one of their entrees.  The person next to us re-ordered a Bouillabaisse.  We suspect that my wife's order was given to the table next to us by accident as her entree came back pretty fast after the re-order.  Oh well.During this waiting game for our entrees, nearly every single waiter was missing in action.  If they did come out to the dining room, they didn't make eye contact with us or pretended not to hear us call for some help.  Not a good sign.Then, I overheard some ruckus between the owner or general manager raising his voice to one of the busboys.  He ordered him to take off his bow tie and just go home.  Our waitress told us it was her favorite busboy that was fired right in the middle of our dinner service as well as someone else.  Therefore, even longer wait...Finally, both entrees arrived.  My wife was pleased with hers for the most part.  She was needing a spoon to get at the broth in her dish.  After so very many attempts to get a spoon (someone in the back got fired so we can assume it was a dishwasher), it finally arrived as we were wanting to leave.  As for my entree ... the frites were good.  The steak was horrible.  I ordered it medium.  Well, it came out charred on the outside and raw in some spots.  It was a very cheap piece of meat and it was absolutely prepared by someone who I assume was drafted to serve in the kitchen.  There is no way a professional cook cooked my steak.  The good news: we had a Groupon.  For some reason, not having to pay full price took a little of the sting out of this dining experience.  I think mangling the classics like rillettes and Steak Frites are totally unforgivable when trying to pass off as a French brasserie.More good news: besides dinner, we were treated to a show with all the drama in the dining room.  Even more good news: we won't be wasting anymore money here.  Stay away.This place was terrible. It is a good thing it closed down. They didnt do any justice to the french. The food was dry and pointless. The atmosphere was useless. I could see the people at all the tables making that face of disgust. Each plaint appeared on the table as though it was just thrown together but a terrible team of kitchen workers. If there was one chef in the kitchen then things probably would have been better.

Review Text :
Fiesta Filipina is another good Filipino restaurant gone bad.  I was in love with this place when it first opened!  Everything about this restaurant was legit, from the theme, food and decor. Not baduy, or bakya at all, looking classy with all the Filipino paintings/decor. After more trips, and a few months later it went down the same horrible path as other Filipino restaurants.  Shit service and a shittier smell. The service is always good, unless you get the female worker.   Beware of the female worker!!!  Trust, she is not hard to spot.  She's the cashier queen.-Tore up from the floor up-Caked up face thicker than the earths crust.-The most vibrant, electric, blinding eyeshadow. Whenever she takes our order, or rings us up she always rushes.  Rushing leads to confusion, confusion leads to pissed off customers and bad reviews.  She kept on saying "extra charge for credit,  so i give turon .50 cents, .50 cents!!" In her mind that means, I'll say the charge is .50 cents, but its really a few bucks, and I wont give you any turon- ___-  I felt raped, robbed and broke after leaving the restaurant.  The food was shit too. -Barbecue is good. But  DONT use the same brush you use to baste raw meat, to baste the cooked ones too :) Big mistake and health hazard. -Carioka was hard, tough to chew and over priced.-Ukoy was (excuse my language) the worst fucking shit ever. Honestly, do yourselves a favor and never make it again.  Paste is what it is, thick pasty batter that was slightly fried.-Puto was pasty, and a few were rotten, before the sell by or expire date.I guess if you need a Filipino food fix, come to this place early, and stick to simple dishes.Filipino food super close to my house in Henderson... shooooooot.i even took my boy from manilla here, and we went nuts on some pretty good pinoy grub.the GRUB:- chicken adobo... salty, soury, peppery chicken stew... a good version of a very philippine food staple... mix the sauce in your rice with a little patis for the real deal.- chicken bbq stick... red like tocino or char siu sauce, sweet and charred over fire... very tasty- they dont have Sisig on the line up ever (because you have to order it in advanced only) but they do have lechon kawali - fried pork belly - which is pretty dang awesome with hot white rice and mang thomas sauce- lumpia (shanghai) was standard fare - dip in the spicy jufran for a kick- my friend ordered chicharon bulaklak and mung-go beans... and said it reminded him so much of home... it was that good- HIGHLIGHT: CRISPY PATA !!! nothing like the picture on the wall... made to order (done in like 5 mins) - but a deliciously deep fried pig hip with crispy chicharon skin, soft roasted-like pork meat on the inside, and on the bone w tendon attatched for extra eats - so much flavor... it is accompanied with a house dipping sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and hot chilis... so awesome.- turon (banana fritter), babinka especial (rice cake with cream cheese), leche flan (caramel custard), halo halo (filipino shaved ice and ice cream sundae), and calimansi or ube or mango shake... all yummy choices for dessert- they have canned soda only (booooooo!!!) - but at least they have sarsi soda... or the fresh cantaloupe juice drink.the JOINT:- best comment from my manilla friend: "ferds, this might be the cleanest pilipino restaurant ive been to here in the states... actually, anywhere for that matter."- plenty of seating, plenty of light- very filipino decor... including a small seating section that looks like a backyard (barrio) fiesta / straw islander hut / hawaiian lanai- there should be alot of available parking in the strip mall- 3 46" LCDs - usually showing TFC, but i have seen sports on too - like the NFL playoffs (49ers) or NBA games (Lakers)the SQUEEZE:- about $9 for the combo and the drink- $14 for the crispy pata - but i think it feeds a family of 4 - ha!- everyone if very helpful and friendly- cash and card is acceptedFINAL SAY:for Henderson, especially right off of Eastern and St Rose Pkway... this is a great find... and probably a good place to meet single pinay nurses on lunch break from the Hospital across the street. ha!2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #8We found ourselves at Fiesta Filipina for our 8th Halo-Halo taste test.  I can't believe that we just started this challenge last week and we are now only 2 contenders away from completing this challenge.  Terri and I met up with Ian A for this challenge.  We had some eats, but our primary reason for this stop was obvious...how is their Halo-Halo? Fiesta Filipina has a regular Halo-Halo for $3.99 and their special for $4.99.  The only difference between the two is ube ice cream.  Since we are maximizing our craving, we decided on the special of course. So, what's in this special Halo-Halo.  You get ube ice cream (two scoops), condensed milk, shave ice, nata de coco, macapuno, pinipig, azuki (red beans), white beans, and some legit ube.  This is our only 2nd stop that had real ube in it.  What's missing is the flan and lanka.  After mixing my Mix-Mix and sampling it, I already knew that Fiesta's Halo-Halo is ranking up there in my book.  The ice was just right, taste superb, and the mix was almost perfect.  I stress almost perfect because flan was the one missing ingredient that I was looking for.  By the way, you can order flan on the side (about $5) and add to it if flan is a must have in your Halo-Halo.On a side note, I did have some food here too.  The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the Flip joints in SF, SoCal, and Daygo.  I loved it and felt at home.  But I wasn't too impressed with the food.  The food is cheap and for $5.29 you can get two Chicken BBQ Sticks with rice. Sounded and looked appealing, but I'm no fan of rubbery chicken. Overall, I am a fan of their Halo-Halo and see myself coming back just that. Food...well, that's a different story.PS:  One thing I learned during this quest for our favorite Halo-Halo in the valley is that real spoons (not the flimsy plastic ones) are ideal when mixing your Halo-Halo. These plastic spoons work like catapults when you're mixing your Halo-Halo. Last thing I want is an ube shot in the face.  Stay hungry, my friends.  2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WATook em down a star for their rude azz f*ck pushy attitudes behind the counter.

Review Text :
After reading about the wait most people have at Babycakes Cafe I decided to give another breakfast place a try (I'll try Babycakes one day...). So I Yelped a spot and was instantly intrigued by Rise and Shine. It was the location-not far from where I live- and those darn cute flower umbrellas that they have hanging from their ceiling.It was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!!Anyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!The food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though...I loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!!I will be back and the BF can wait in the car....I love it when locally owned and operated restaurants survive in LV.   The place is absolutely cute with their huge flowers spinning from the ceiling and the servers in their pajamas.  This is one of my favorite spots to do breakfast on the weekends.   Everyone I bring here raves about the place too.  The food is really good.  Some of the notable things I've had here include: - Chicken Fried Steak (Thick and delicious gravy.  Steak might be a little too thickly battered.  Feel a little guilty eating it =)  Tasty hash browns on the side)- Two Egg Breakfast (Think grand slam, but much tastier!  Not crazy about the kielbasa, so I'll stick with the sausage or bacon next time)- Corned Beef Hash (Not like the smushy corned beef - its "real"!)- Southwest Turkey Panini (Panini's here seem like a good option for lunch!)- And always get their cute little pot of bread! (A light and fluffy Cinnamon roll - Yum!) Like everyone else says, the service here is good.  Always kind with a smile.  I wouldn't say the food is OMG, but its solid.  Prices might be a tiny bit on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it for the lovely experienceVery cute breakfast place. Amazing food!I'm sitting here drafting this review as I watch my son finishing our breakfast. It makes me a bit sad that this place is so far from my home. I drove here from Henderson, its located on Southern Highlands Pkwy & Cactus. If it was close, I'd be the Duchess...fast! And weigh much more, probably...I was a waitress back in the day at locally owned restaurants like Rise & Shine, and as I giggle watching these ladies serve food dressed in flannel pajamas, all I wondered was "Why didn't I work at a place where pjs were the uniform?!?!" How much more comfortable can you make it, right?! So you can imagine, it definitely has a warm feeling. The smell of French toast and coffee and cinnamon gets your nose up as you walk in the door. The menu - you can order your standards. Omelets, pancakes, bacon & eggs. Then you see Crunch Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and Spiced Rubbed Rib Eye Chilaquiles, Fried Chicken and Waffles, and homemade Corned Beef Hash. What else? Most egg plates come with your choice of toast, biscuit, or the ever popular pot of bread. Very adorable little round loaf of slightly cinnamon gooey deliciousness seem to be on many tables during my visits. The drinks - freshly squeezed orange juice is always a favorite of mine I share with my son. But I had to try their French press coffee after reading about it. A generous serving is brought to your table, accompanied by a sand hourglass, with three separate colored sands. You decide which sand to follow to determine how strong you want your coffee. Love it!! (see photo if you can't picture what I'm saying)I haven't dined here for lunch, but I slightly glanced at it while drooling over the breakfast choices. If you're not in the mood for breakfast, like their current special, Baked Blueberry Pecan French Toast Casserole or my personal favorite, Make-Your-Own Yogurt Parfait, you can choose from burgers, salads, panini sandwiches, and daily specials like meatloaf, fish & chips, and chicken broccoli pot pie, served until they run out. They also offer a few kid's plates, however, if you have a toddler like me, the generous portions they serve is more than enough to share! Prices are decent, the service I've received have been warm, inviting, and prompt. I think if the next few visits are as awesome as my previous ones, they definitely warrant a 5-star review. For now, it is far to drive to, and I do wish they offered lighter healthier options, too. Do I end up ordering them? Not much. But I like having the choice when I'm feeling weight-conscious on those rare occasions. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Rise & Shine's yummy breakfasts!hello LV Yelpers!Came here last week for breakfast the morning it poured/flooded.One of my coworkers love coming here so a group of us made our way through the rain and flooded streets to rise and shine.I was excited to try their pot of bread from reading all of the reviews. I don't live close to R&S so I really hoped for a good experience.It was mid morning and they already ran out of pot of bread! really?! :(I had the corn beef hash with biscuit which was really tasty. My coworker comes here for the steak and eggs.If you're in the area and looking for breakfast stop by here! I wouldn't drive out of the way for R&S.Casual dining. No frills.Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive. Here's the rundown:French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee. Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats. Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious. Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER. Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm. If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it. I'm rating this a 5 star plusI'll definitely be back.Your first thought when walking in? "Look how neat this place is!" Servers in pajamas, upside down flower-print umbrellas hanging from the ceiling (some even spin!), and overall relaxed vibe. The wait for me is usually about 10-20 minutes depending on what time I get there. Like Marie T., this place USED to be my favorite breakfast place. It was also icing on the cake that it is walking distance from my abode. I keep giving them chances to change my mind, but I get disappointed every time.My favorite thing to order is the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. Thankfully, its taste consistency has remained the same and is always "good." My second favorite would be the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle. I was never a fan of Chicken & Waffles until I ate it at this place. The New York Steak, Spinach, & Benedict-Bagel was the worst thing that I have ever ordered. The presentation was extremely lacking.. The words Hot Mess came to mind; which made my food unappetizing. The Pot of Bread for a side is one of the reasons why I keep wanting to come back, but for the last THREE times they have been unable to keep up with the demand and simply say "they're out." Instead, customers have to choose between getting toast or a biscuit. Ugh. If you're a server and you see that my hash browns are either burnt or undercooked then do not bring it out to me. I will say something. Also, we keep getting handed other people's tabs.. get it together guys.It had been over a year since our last foray to Southern Highlands to dine at Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issues that had kept us away for so long; the ineptitude of the hostess staff.  We added our name to the list when we arrived and were given a 30 minute wait time.  At the 45 minute mark, I asked about our table and was told that there were still 8 parties ahead of us and that they were seating the larger parties first.  uh, okay...  I asked if we could sit at the counter and was told that the counter was part of the wait list, but it was empty.  At the 1 hour mark, I inquired again and was told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  I asked again about the counter (now with one patron sitting there) and was told that it was closed today.  Weird  Even though I was annoyed, I felt committed to stick it out after waiting so long.  We were finally seated after waiting an hour and 20 minutes, but only because two parties of 2 in front of us gave up and left.  Maybe they did not appreciate being told that larger parties were more important than they were. On to happier subjects:  The food!  I ordered the Ultimate steak & egg breakfast: $12.95 for an 8oz Rib Eye, two eggs, and hash browns with the pot of bread.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, the eggs and hash browns standard, and the pot of bread (basically a cinnamon roll) was good. solid 4/5  The BF had the Fried Chicken & Waffle: $11.95 for a boneless chicken breast coated in buttermilk and fried sitting on top of a Belgian waffle.   I didn't try this, but was told that it was just okay. 3/5  I also used the Chamucos Jalapeno Hot Sauce on my eggs and saw that it was made in Henderson.  The waitress noticed that I was reading the bottle and advised that they had bottles for sale for $6, so I scooped one of those up for home use!I can't really say for sure if we'll ever go back, but I hope they work out their front of house issues.After a rather lackluster first visit to the other Rise & Shine location on Flamingo, it's with disappointment that I note that the original location also failed to rise to the occasion of a great breakfast.All puns aside, I do really want to like this place. Service is spot on and incredibly friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired for me I'm afraid. I found the fried chicken flavorless and dry, the waffle was a soggy mess and the chilaquiles were as well. The only thing from my meal that I halfway enjoyed were the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. They were good when paired with the flavorless and over-battered chicken to help make it more palatable. Aside from the pancakes, the service was the only other saving grace about this place. I don't see myself making any extra effort to come back when there are much breakfast spots near me that have cheaper prices and better food.I always love trying new places for breakfast in Vegas before the ride back to Cali and I definitely made the right choice in stopping by here. Very friendly staff and super cute that they wear pjs as their work attire.I ordered the Rise & Shine Chilaquiles and by the pics on Yelp, it seriously did not look like it'd be such a large serving. It could probably feed at least 2 adults in my opinion and for only 10 bucks. I loved how much cheddar cheese it had. I wish it had a bit more beans though. The flavor of the chili was very different from what I'm used to. Sorta had a Tex Mex type flavor.

Review Text :
Sometimes hotel restaurants are at best mediocre. Harvest Moon Grille at the Dunhill is off to a great start.  Located in the historic Dunhill Hotel uptown. From what I can tell, it's a simple menu, focusing on local and seasonal produce and meats.  My eggs benedict, with a southern twist of toast and sausage were delicious, served with potato and sweet potato hashbrowns .  It's a little bit on the hotel expensive side, but easy to pay for when you know it's good products and made with care.  Can't wait to try dinner! Two pluses, were good service and decent coffee.After my first good, but not great, meal at Harvest Moon Grille many months back, I've returned for two more rounds - another lunch and a delicious breakfast. Because of these return visits and some kinks worked out in the kitchen, Harvest Moon Grille has certainly earned another star.In July I enjoyed a quiet and lovely breakfast to myself which included an iced tea and a delectable, uber fresh bowl of yogurt and berries. A first when the kind and efficient waiter set down the bowl, I thought it was a smidge shy on the portion. But oh no...I couldn't even finish it. The vanilla yogurt was perfectly creamy and accented beautifully with their house made granola. Which rocks. Big time. I left happy, full and healthy, indeed.More recently, I trotted back over for another healthful meal when I ordered the farro salad. I don't think I've ever made farro at home, so I was anxious to try this groovy grain. Again, a small-ish looking bowl of whole farro and seasonal vegetables with lemon-garlic confit dressing arrived at the table. And true to form I finished it but I left happy, full and healthy. The farro wasn't overdressed, peppered or salted and the confit dressing was the perfect light touch. This is the one time in my life I think I would have liked a bit more dressing, actually. If you're traipsing around Uptown and looking for a great meal with a fantastic local focus (all items sourced with 100 miles of Charlotte), Harvest Moon Grill is a great choice. They have defined eating local.

Review Text :
The Golden Grill is the 24 hour cafe in the Gold Spike Hotel and they are really known for one thing only - their $5.99 12 oz. Prime Rib dinner.Yes, this $6 dinner is available daily from 4 pm to 11 pm!  It also comes with a baked potato and veggies (in our case, corn).  Sure, it's not the fancy kind of prime rib you find at Lawry's Prime Rib, but it's also less than six bucks!  And as far as I'm concerned, that's a pretty sweet deal!Walking into this brightly lit but small cafe, you really don't need to even look at the menu since this special isn't even on there.  Most of the waiters know what you're there for anyway, so they are used to the majority of their dinner guests coming for prime rib only.  For late night eats, they also offer a $4.99 7 oz. Top Sirloin and Eggs which is available daily from 11 pm to 6 am.Great upscale lounge Downtown that boasts a modern decor and feel. Located in walking distance from El Cortez parking garage in the heart of Downtown. We were pleasantly surprised by this venue that marked the start of our Project Dinner Table experience with a cocktail hour hosted here. We enjoyed handcrafted signature drinks and exquisite appetizers while mingling with other fellow foodies and playing corn hole along with other games like shuffle board, large Connect Four, extra large Jenga etc. Ample seating is everywhere that also features a large bed for lounging or taking silly pictures and cushy love sacs in the middle of the room. This place is like the dream adult version of your favorite after school hangout if you were a kid in the 80's. We would have never known of this ultra cool hangout if it weren't for Project Dinner Table. Downtown is all a buzz right now and this gem is a place you must try out when in the area.

Review Text :
============ WORST RESTAURANT ENCOUNTER TO DATE ============10/31/13 - To be brutally honest It's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever. Mine happened tonight. I've had a lot of bad experiences in restaurants but this one experience tops them all. in fact none of my previous bad experiences even compare to what I'm going to tell you now and that is out of all the 64 restaurants I have visited and reviewed so far. This being said I drove a little more than a half hour to Cave Creek with my wife Carol, Grandson Michael, my sister Mindy her husband Jon and his brother Howard to get here. Our waiter Matt took a while to take our drink orders then once he delivered them to our table and then took our dinner order. He wasn't seen or heard of again for at least 24 minutes. We didn't realize this at first because we were all talking. Two people in our party wanted beef ribs but they were told there was none. Our order was as follows: 2 filet mignon (medium) 2 rib eye steaks (medium) 2 pork ribs and 1 corn bread. Once our food came out things went down hill from there. First off our waiter Matt couldn't tell the difference between a filet mignon and a rib eye steak so he placed the wrong entrees in front of the wrong people. One rib eye went to my sister it was more on the well done side than medium but she ate it and said it was delicious. The other rib eye went to my grandson. He asked before he ordered it he asked if it was fatty and the waiter told him no. Well it was in fact half it wasn't edible because there was that much fat on it. Then my grandson asked 5 times for A-1 sauce and was ignored. He finally stood up  as Matt was walking by and said he wanted to talk to him and was told to sit down and just relax for a while. My grandson replied he just wanted some A-1 Sauce before what was left of his meal got cold. My sister got up and went to the bar and asked for some A-1 sauce the bar tender handed her an empty bottle of A-1 sauce.  Mean time two people who ordered the filet mignon, me being one of them cut into our filet. Both were well done. I sent mine back but Howard didn't because he had to get on the road because he was going to Rocky Point. We asked to see the manager who came to our table dressed as a hippy wearing marijuana leaf glasses. She didn't introduce herself or remove her marijuana glasses as she spoke.. We explained to her our filets were well done and the problems we encountered and she offered to get me another one. When my filet came back the potato was so cold the butter wouldn't melt and the steak came back well done again.Meanwhile the two people who ordered the pork ribs received their meals. Both pork rib dinner were lukewarm, the broccoli that came with them was cold and the potatoes were warm. My wife opt'd not to eat her meal because she like her food hot. So once again we called the manager to our table who was in a defensive mode, crossing her arms as she spoke. We also told her how the bartender refused to serve my grandson (22) another beer stating he already had two drinks within a half hour. I never heard of this before so we told her he isn't driving but she still said no. We told all this to the manager who ended up giving us a comp on one steak dinner and an additional 15% off our bill which ended up being $135.00 after every thing she did. They even added a 16% tip to the bill.  FOOD: Food Is terrible. Very disappointed.  SERVICE: Worst service I have experience so far. PRICE: The price was in line with other BBQ touristy restaurants / steakhouses.  I would say they were even on the high side. AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!!  This place  is a joke. If you want to go eat at a restaurant where they couldn't care less, then try it out for yourself. RETURN FACTOR 0%. Bottom line don't waste your money.************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH

I love BBQ and I'm always looking for a new BBQ joint to try.  Thanks to @keith I found this place.  I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was shocked that the place was dead.  Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.I decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.After a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.I went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.Next up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!I had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.Overall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.Will I return?  Hell yeah!  I want to try the Ribs next time and there are two interesting pseudo-BBQ Sandwiches that I want to try.

Restaurant name  Bistro Japonais Furusato
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Furusato is simple, well-done, authentic Japanese food (which is what my Japanese language school told me as well about this place). Don't expect any fancy presentation √† la "Jun I" or other high end Japanese restaurants, but expect quality ingredients full of flavor, prepared expertly. The beef teriyaki, as pedestrian as it sounds, is superb - just the right balance between sweet and savory, full of beefy goodness, and perfectly cooked - Japanese comfort food really, and the teriyaki sauce is definitely not from a jar. The Japanese salad with seaweed and octopus is a great small dish to start with, and the Yuzu mixed with rice vinegar and soy sauce was a fantastic dressing I was even tempted to drink (thank god I had plenty of sake instead). The Yellowfin collar was perfectly cooked and something you won't find elsewhere. We also had eggplant in a nice tangy broth, and an array of some of the best sushi I've had in Montreal, included the tuna hand roll, and the melt in your mouth unagi and ikura. The service is efficient and very friendly, and this more than makes up for the slightly depressing, dilapidated interior. They should move the dish washing station away from the sushi bar, move the fridge to the kitchen, and have the sushi bar be more of a centerpiece. Still, other than Kazu (which reigns supreme), this is the best place for authentic Japanese I've found in Montreal. Itadakimasu - bon appetit!Not being a big fan of dynamite rolls with tempura flakes, I was looking to find a restaurant that serves fresh fish and authentic Japanese dishes and here we are!I love the place; nothing fancy, very ordinary but clean, small but cute and cozy. The fish is extremely fresh you can taste them even sweet (no fish odor at all). Katsudon was very tasty also, will definetely return to try more.

Review Text :
I just had to be an Indian foodie today.  Lunch buffet at India Palace, now dinner at Jai Ho.-Chicken corn soup:  Was very creamy and flavorful.  The sweetness of the corn paired with chunks of chicken made this bowl of soup so good.  Because we like it a  bit hot, we asked for some soy sauce and hot sauce.  This took the soup to a whole different level. -Goat Karahi:  yep yep, love my goat.  The first bite I had, it was a bit tough.  I was a  bit disappointed.  But nope, I didn't stop there, I can't give up on it yet.  I took another bite, it was more tender.  So what did I do...I was on a hunt for the more tender pieces in the pot.  I wish they were ALL tender.  It's ok.  I might not order this again though.-Chicken Tikka:  I am used to more flavorful chicken tikka (I am from Houston where there are many indo-pak restaurants...)-Keema Naan:  It was decent-Garlic Naan:  lots of garlic on this naan.  Very good.-Kulfi Faluda:  I have been on a hunt for a Faluda ever since I came to Las Vegas.  This has been the only place that have something similar.  The icecream that was given to me was the pistachio icecream (hence the kulfi in the name).  I am used to the vanilla icecream.  It changes the flavor by alot.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but just not as good as I remembered it.The server actually gave us a free order of chicken boti because he did not mention to us that the chicken tikka may take 25 mins since they made to order.  This free order was actually my favorite.  The chicken was nice and tender.  I place this on a garlic naan, some onion, a squeeze of lime, then dunk this bad boy in the tamarind chutney sauce and WALLA!  Made my night!Service: 5 stars!Food: super close to 4 stars!Results:  Definitely recommend and I will come back Fo SHo!

I should've known better when I entered Athena and it was hotter inside than outside. Yet I was craving some gyros and hummus and had heard good things about this place. I should've walked out when the host grabbed the last few crayons from the bowl for my son and the bowl was lovingly garnished with dead fly bodies. Man I'm an idiot.I should've gotten up from the table when after five minutes we were completely ignored by several servers waiting for a glass of water, but I thoroughly enjoyed not only the company that I was with, but also the dozen or so extra diners that joined us by landing on our napkins, forks and faces. I should've sent back the dip platter that was finally delivered thirty minutes after ordering. Especially because I find warm tsatsiki gross, hummus that separated into an unrecognizable film probably sometime the day before and the feta dip thoughtfully studded with wilted olives. But I digress, at least my son's fries were accompanied by ketchup so wonderful and distinct it had broken into a clear layer of oil and another layer of powdery grit, but that's probably just because it sits out in the kitchen for several hours to fully mature.I should've asked for the manager and demanded my check to be waived, but I didn't, I just didn't. I should've gone to Arby's.

Review Text :
I've been here twice since it was renamed.  One time it was a five star experience, and the next it was more like three.  Interesting, since I ordered the same thing (teriyaki beef and tempura bento) both times!The first time, the beef in the bento ranked in the best beef anything I'd ever had.  The flavors were so savory and delicious, they blew my mind.  But the last time, it was clear that either the chef was having an off day, or that it was made by a different person entirely.  It tasted charred and strange.  While it wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't great.That said, their sushi was pretty good both times, same with the tempura.  The miso, though, demands special notice.  Both times I swooned.  It's savory and delicious, a tad salty, with fresh seaweed and scallion bits.  Usually miso has a bit of bonito powder in it, but no fishiness was detected here.  In that sense, it might not be as traditionally Japanese, but I don't care.  I can't stand fishy miso, and I love (love) their version.  Enough to go again.The service is good, the atmosphere is cute, and the prices are, well, maybe a tad high.  The waitress helpfully handed us a Clipper Magazine with a buy one entree, get one half price coupon on the back.  But  that was on our way out.  The full price of my gigantic, splittable bento was 20 dollars before tax and tip.  This place can do some damage if you're hungry.

Review Text :
Stopped in for lunch after landing in Edinburgh. All their menu items use locally sourced ingredients from all over Scotland. I ordered the Ramsey's ham and mustard sandwich with 2 side salads. The salads were fresh and tasty, but very small. The sandwich was disappointing. Literally a slice of ham, lettuce and dijon mustard on wheat bread. Approximately ¬£8.5 ($14.20), it was incredibly expensive. Had I stopped eating at this point, the place would have warranted 3-stars. Tops. However, I made the decision to order a tea and a scone with clotted cream and housemade strawberry jam. BEST DECISION EVER. The scone was slightly crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside. It went wonderfully with their clotted cream, AMAZING jam and a cup of tea. Overall, a decent place to grab lunch if you live in the UK. Tourists with horrid exchange rates find food elsewhere. However, if you choose to dine at Edinburgh Larder, save room for their scone and tea. It's wonderful!

Review Text :
This waffle joint is a half mile from Aliante Casino.  When my relatives start hitting the slots, they say I'm bad luck if I watch, so they tell me to scram."We'll be here a half hour, see you then..."  They say they kinda feel sorry for me, but they get over it, and so do I.  Why?  It gives me an excuse to head to Waffles Cafe. Carbs rarely ever taste this good.  I love waffles, and this waffle by itself is near perfect -  light, slightly sweet, tender, and slightly crispy all at the same time.  When it comes out warm, no matter what it's topped with, it's heavenly.  This time, I opted for the peaches and strawberries.  The peaches were sliced canned cling peaches, which I like, but I loved the sliced fresh strawberries with a dollop of whipped cream in the middle.  I decided to get it to go and eat it in the parking lot of the casino, well aware the Casino videotapes the parking lots.  All I can say to the security staff watching my one tape, "Get your own!" The aromatic, juicy berrie slices were naturally sweet with the waffle, the peaches were a good contrast visually, in taste, and texture. The variety of waffles is fantastic, you can order one of their pre made concoctions, or create your own.  There is nutella, pumpkin, pecan, apples, blueberries, and so many others.  They have a great $5.49 breakfast waffle special with egg, bacon or sausage, and can add hash browns for a price. Of course, waffle sandwhiches are popular, too. They had some bobas and teas.  But I had their Columbian coffee to go, it was decent, though I prefer my coffees bolder (i.e. French Roast) but it was a great accompaniement to my sweet dessert.  All told, it was about $8.  Definitely, I'll come back again.  My relatives didn't win this time, but in a half hour, I was far happier and my wallet was heavier than theirs.

Restaurant name  That's a Wrap

Review Text :
Thada boy That's a Wrap...you opened yet another tasty location that's perfect for a quick lunchtime bite! While in the middle of meeting mania today, I entered into the lunch hour on the road and in Phoenix. I knew I wanted a sandwich and I'd been itching to check out the new That's A Wrap location. My experience was top notch! I parked right in front, entered the quaint little shop, ordered, got a seat, got my food, ate it and went on my merry little way within a half hour. The service was quick and friendly. They have an open kitchen so you can see your creation getting made and they have desserts tempting you as you order. I went with the Fiesta wrap which was onions, green peppers, avocado, pico and chicken. Delicious! It's the perfect blend of Mexican food in a sandwich and it's a light lunchtime option. It filled me up without stuffing me. The shop is cute and quaint but has enough seats to accompany a decent size crowd. If the weather wasn't so cold today, I would have opted to sit on the patio in the front All are good options. This is a great treat for lunch and it gets you in and out in a timely manner. And that's a wrap for me!I fell in food love at the original That's a Wrap location, and I fell once again at the new location today... I'm a huge fan of the casual atmosphere, modest prices, and of course the wraps, sides, and salads at this place.I went for lunch today and had the Greek Salad and black bean soup as my side.  One friend had the albacore tuna on a wheat wrap with a side of fruit and another had one of the specialty wraps with a side of pasta salad.  We were all pleased with our food.The only negative is that I don't think this place has air conditioning, so I hope they get some fans or install a/c before the temperatures rise.  Regardless, I'll be back, even just for carry-out or to check out their "wrappy hour."

Review Text :
I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done. First, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location. Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds. So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service. Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!Wildflower Bread Company has grown on me through the years... What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it's quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.  Due to this convenient WBC location, I've been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!  Lately I've been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.  I'm currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  I'm also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.  While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table.  I'm sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.I learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more "private dining" for groups.  I may just have to look into that in the future.  Keep up the good work, WBC - I'm sure I'll see you again soon.This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize. It's worth reading. Please share.After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen.  He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong. By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture. A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation.Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review.I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate. The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing.The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more.On the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply....great. This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly. Last time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off-morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent.I am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot.Louis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people.When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit.

Restaurant name  Swish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Skinny: the switch to new management has really hurt this place, that includes the rather poor details in the food (2) service: I'm not sure what was worse, our absent-minded waiter or the rather brusque attitude of the waitress (1) this place really went off the deep end on service and food within a year (2).It may be a surprise but shabu shabu and sukiyaki isn't rocket science. But the lack of attention to essential details makes this place on my no-go list.Enticed by a Groupon Now! deal, the hubs and I headed to Swish for dinner. When we stepped in, we put in a drink order. And waited. And waited. Essentially we entered into the building at 8:05 and didn't get to put in our order until close to 8:30pm and that's only because we flagged him down.I guess that is the running motif around Swish. If you want to get service, you not only have to signal for service but you have to ask for everything. When I mean everything, I mean things like plates.But how could the food be possibly bad here, you may ask? Isn't it just veggies and raw meat that you cook in a pot yourself?Even though the food is simple enough, it can be disasterous if not prepared appropriately. Take for example my order of Chicken Fiesta ($12.95 healthy portion) sukiyaki style which came with one small plate of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. The chicken, was carelessly cut into various shapes and sizes - some as large as a 1 inch x 0.5 inch x 1 inch cube. The uneven size makes the cooking time highly variable and uneven. Plus trying to cook really thick pieces of chicken in a little iron skillet with minimal liquid takes forever. Added to the fact you don't want to cross contaminate the raw chicken with the other food, it ended up taking a long time before I could eat.The haphazard plate of vegetables were also cut unevenly (some were really large pieces of napa cabbage and carrots which were hard to eat) which also exacerbated the above stated issues. The vegetables itself were okay, but I was a little irritated by the fact they put less than 15 leaves of spinach on a plate to make it look full. (For those in the know, that amount of spinach cooks down to less than a mouthful.) It's a total turn off because they charge another $3.95 for a miniscule plate of poorly cut vegetables.My hubby ordered the hungry sized Kobe Chuck ($20.95) portion. Although his meat cooked better than my stuff because it was thinly sliced, the accompanying dipping sauces were horrible. The sesame sauce was musty, weird, and watery. Tasting like swamp water and looking like the crappacino they serve on Fear Factor, it was a horrific combination. The ponzu was okay but nothing you can't get out of a bottle from the supermarket.To cap off this experience, the servers at the restaurant were poor. Our waiter, who was nice, appeared to be very absent-minded. He'd frequently forget to start the cooking pots, plates for food, cooking utensils, etc. Running the cheque took way longer than it ought to. The waitress on the other hand was more on the ball but had a poorer attitude towards the patrons (ie, sounding exasperated because someone didn't know what the meat choices were, grilling me on why I wanted a second set of chopsticks - because it handled raw chicken and we had no cooking utensils... that's why!... to name a few examples.)One might argue the joint was busy. However I'd like to say something about that. I normally don't make comparisons but I just have to in this case. Shabu Shabu Paradise (Henderson) not only has one waiter in the whole joint but she handles the same number of customers all on her own. And, the service is way better than what we received here. Plus she has to deal with refilling unlimited plates of correctly cut vegetables, bowls of salad, condiments and rice.Although the food was edible, the service and the improperly prepared dishes really ruined this place for me. Plus, the rather lackluster portion sizes given the price of the meal is also a big turn off. Even though our other favourite shabu/sukiyaki place is 30 minutes away, I'd rather go there than suffer through another round of Swish. (2 starred review).

What's up Doc? A rabbit burger on the brunch menu, that's what. I've never seen a rabbit burger on any menu, anywhere. So when a group of Yelpers rocked up here for our monthly brunch, I was already excited about trying the famous Nobles Benedict - eggs benny on black pudding. So when my eye first of all noticed the duck sandwich, I was excited. And then the RABBIT BURGER. Oh lordy.I went for the rabbit burger (without the bun, as I'm wheat free) with a portobello mushroom and gruyere cheese on top, fries on the side. It was a great portion, and filled me from breakfast, lunch and some of dinner. The other dishes around me seemed very hefty too - the full breakfast were impressive, the Eggs Nobles on black pudding swiftly demolished by Joe A, and Susan M was very proud of her clean plate that had contained eggs with smoked salmon. Everyone, except those who ordered pancakes, were really happy with their brunch. Now I can see why it's so famous in Edinburgh.The bar itself is beautiful. Not one most folk will walk by, given it's out-of-the-way location on Constitution Street, heading into Leith. But through the small doors you'll find a big, open, airy space that is constrasted with the dark wood, and then some stained glass windows. The only thing I found amusingly awkward was that getting into the ladies toilets are difficult as the space between the two doors is tiny. But that amused rather than frustrated me.I really liked everything about Nobles. It was busy, almost full, of Sunday brunchers in the morning and afternoon. They host a weekly open-mic night on Wednesday's with The Black Diamond Express' Toby Mottershead - I'm a fan, so will probably come and check that out soon.The staff were very, very helpful, lovely and friendly, and really were the cherry on the cake of this lovely Yelp brunchy munchy out.

The Shops at Pecos Ranch have been empty since I moved just down the street a year ago.  Finally a couple of months ago we started seeing signs of life!  When I first saw the logo for Uncle Bears I thought is was a store for dogs.  Don't laugh....look at the logo....does that say sports bar to you?  But I was pleasantly suprised when I checked their website and checked out the menu.  I had the opportunity to check it out on a recent evening when my daughter was on vacation with my sister.  When I'm on my own I like to sit at the bar and this bar is awesome.  It's a nice long bar with pleanty of room and three giant flat screens.  And there are screens all over the restaurant.  There is a beautiful patio and the bar also opens up to the patio.  Nice!  The bartenders were friendly and attentive and they have lots of nice beers on tap.  All I care about is that they have Guniess and they know how to pour a good one.  They do.I had some nachos which were good.  We will be coming back since I know it's family friendly and my daughter will love the dog theme.  I hope they will keep up the good work and become one of our "go to" places for a decent bite to eat.

Review Text :
I am may be picky but I can tear apart a blue crab like nobody's business. I consider myself an expert in this area as I grew up around the Baltimore, MD area - home of the Blue Crab if you ask anyone who knows anything about how to get it done.I told one of the owners, John, that wouldn't it just figure that 3 weeks before I am leaving Las Vegas....I would find Blue Crabs after 20 years. I actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here. I am not even kidding - but then John offered to ship the crabs to D.I.A. for me and I decided to stick to my plan to move to Denver.But I digress (as usual)....this place is LEGIT. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT if you ask me. I went with my dad, who is in town from the MD area, I knew that he would be the one to experience Crab Corner with me. We already knew that we were set on splitting an order of #2 males. But what else to get....BOARDWALK FRIES? Stop it right now. As I bit into the fry, I was immediately taken back to Ocean City, MD. And then the crabs came that were SO fresh and prepared perfectly with Old Bay sprinkled all over their bodies. H-E-A-V-E-N.And then I just read below that Utz Potato Chips are on the way. All I can say about that is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I already have 2 dates set to go back and visit the Crab Corner before my departure from Vegas on January 8 and you better believe that every time I come into town to visit, this will be on my list of Top Stops. Thank you, Crab Corner, for bringing a little piece of my hometown to my homeplace, Las Vegas.I was very excited when Lisa L. chose this as the location for our double date on Saturday. I have had it book marked for nearly a year now, so I was thrilled to have an excuse to try it with friends! I can honestly say it lived up to my expectations in every way - if you are a blue crab lover, you must try it!My husband's family has a house on the water near Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. My husband grew up eating crabs from Maryland, and I got to experience to go crabbing with their property last summer. Watching the little crabs squirm around while being steamed to death isn't really a fond memory, but the taste of those fresh crabs is something I will never forget!!Eating at Crab Corner really replicated the Maryland crab-eating experience for me. The crabs were very fresh, and they were prepared the same way as they are in Maryland. I really love that they used an Old-Bay-like seasoning, and didn't go the douse everything in freaking HEAT route that way too many places seem to go. I love tasting the seafood so it kills me when places like Hot and Juicy ruin a perfectly good crustacean with mouth burning spice! The other awesome thing? When you leave here your clothes, hair, and skin won't REEK of garlic for days! I didn't need to take a bath after eating here, so that really rocked! The special price of $35 for a dozen was more than fair, and the beer prices were reasonable as well. There were several enticing sides priced at $1.95 as well! MMMM sweet potato tots....Whether you are from the East Coast or just a fan of all things crab, don't screw up like I did and wait a year to try this place! I will definitely be back now that I know how fabulous this place is!You need to know right now that my Wife grew up on the Atlantic Ocean very near the Chesapeake Bay. Her family were all Watermen. They fished and raked both clams and oysters. Just what do you think she ate every day of her life? Right, seafood. Ok, me too.Crab Corner food is what I remember from my Maryland and Virginia peninsula days. It is absolutely authentically prepared each day with 'flown in overnight" fresh seafood.Our meal last night (Monday) :Appetizer  -  Calamari.     Fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating. This offering is cooked quickly. The crispy coating is light, brown and in place. The squid inside is hot, tender and clean tasting. Remember, if you cook squid over a minute you get rubber, These folks know how to do it.Soup:   -   Cream of Crab.     Hot, creamy succulent, and filled with blue crab meat. This is something Libby's Grandma would make.Entree   -   Crab Cake Platter.     Let's start with the fact that these huge cakes are nothing but blue crab. There are NO FILLERS. They use a very light bit of coating and then broil them. Nothing but taste here. Excellent menu item. Comes with two cakes and two sides.Entree   -   Soft - Shell Crab Platter.     The best you can get. They have a number of sizes. the three we had were called Chesapeake Bay, MD "Prime Size". Crunchy, sweet and juicy. Very "home style Maryland".Sides   -   Don't bother to fool with the regular old frozen fried. Pay the extra $1.00 for the wonderful Boardwalk Fries. These are hand cut and fried in peanut oil with a hint of crab spices. Then you make them swim in some great malt vinegar. Just like on the Boardwalk in Ocean City Maryland. I can almost smell the salt are as I eat them.Mimi's Potato Salad is the home made style that is uses by Mom's and Grandma's all around the Chesapeake Bay. Seriously flavorful, rich, and creamy. The Cole slaw is creamy and filled with that course slaw you want. The texture and flavor is right there.Drinks   -   Iced Tea was fresh made, cold, and clean tasting. A fine thirst quencher.We had no room for desert. I think for my next trip in I will start my meal with a Baltimore Shaved Ice "Snowball" with about a dozen flavors to choose from. My Wife did manage to get out the door with two packs of Tasty Cakes. (that's a comfort food from MD)The menu is extensive. It is going to take us a while to try everything. You see above what we had on this first trip in. Go on line (CrabornerLV.com) and take a look at their menu. It is extensive. Their claim to fame is the "flown in daily" Maryland Blue Crabs. They are steamed with Crab Blend Seasoning and the dumped on your table. You just use your mallet and pick to bring that sweet crab meat right on to your taste buds.My next meal is going to be fresh single fried oysters and a bunch of steamed hard shell blue crabs.For the quality, quantity, cooking, and freshness of what you get at the Crab Corner the cost is very reasonable.You want a great east coast seafood meal? This is the place to be.It is incumbent upon Rex to apologize for his long absence...let's say that Rex was training for the Olympics and now that is over he can get back to writing reviews...his true passion. (That is a much nicer story than coming to the realization too late that apparently old folks homes don't want to see Rex's erotic version of Winnie the Poo...especially the poo part...and that it took 4 arrests and 5 stints in county before he realized this absolute truth...yes...olympics is nicer.) In between...um...workouts for the Olympics...Rex aways would crave seafood. Let's just say where Rex was...um...working out...they didn't have access to the freshest seafood...damn jail...Rex means London...whatever.The powerful pull of amazing seafood is one that Rex is often subject to...but in Las Vegas Nevada there is a very low...VERY LOW chance of being able to find that great seafood. Even at the classiest restaurants their dumpsters are filled with leftover subpar seafood. Also, in these recessionary times Rex...like all of us...is ever conscious about finances...when he makes his own roofies...he uses immitation Mentos...that is how broke Rexy is right now...but that is another story.  So, where does a budget conscious foodie who is desperate to get that sweet meat from the sea...(ironically Sea Sweet Meat was Rex's nickname in the Navy)...well...Rex has found the best possible place. A place that isn't just good for Vegas...which many places could be labeled...no...this is GREAT for anywhere. Where is it...Crab Corner. Even the words are great...Crab (not crabS...that isn't good)...and Corner...which we can all agree is better than a square. First and foremost before we get to the menu...which is all brilliant...one thing must be said...ALL OF THE SEAFOOD IS FLOWN IN FRESH EVERY DAY!!!!! Really read that and understand what it means. FRESH EVERY DAY!!  Not this frozen crap that is sold in stores...that isn't seafood...that is a waste of money. Since Rex has spent his time in the east coast...he knows great seafood...and you CANNOT FREEZE SEAFOOD AND THINK IT IS GOOD!! The fact that these two brothers (great guys, they don't even mind when Rex licks their dumpster) would go to this extent to provide great ingredients is a testament to their commitment. At this point it would be almost impossible to screw up and they dont.Let's start with the greatest dish they have and the FINEST bowl of soup in town...the lobster bisque. Proof in one bowl there is a God. There are no fillers, it isn't some cream filled monstrosity with some frozen crab thrown in it. NO!  This is the real deal. The depth of flavor they get is just out of this world. No life can be complete and NOT eat a bowl of this soup. Rex wants his ashes to be thrown in the soup and then served to unsuspecting customers...that is how good the soup is and how bad Rex is.The rest...is all great. The crabs are obviously amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. The jewel of Rex's heart is the FRESH, hand battered oysters. Salty, briney, sweet, perfectly battered. Just amazing. Rex could go on and on but there is nothing bad.  If there is one minor complaint, to nitpick, their cole slaw is uninspired, the sweet potato fries are sometimes too soggy and one of Rex's lobster tail was extremely overcooked to the point of rubbery. Sometimes the attention to detail in the more delicate culinary pursuits are just not done as well as they should be. Still, on the whole this is the BEST seafood restaurant in town and it won't break your bank.As the great Rex Marvin says..."does it smell like fish....then give her to Rex!"  Enjoy!One of the best compliments you can give a restaurant is to say that it reminds you of home -- provided, of course, that you have fond memories of home. Crab Corner is that kind of place. I spent the first thirty-plus years living in both Virginia and Maryland, where it was routine to buy bushels of crabs on the weekends or go boating and crabbing with my father. Being the lazy person that I am, I opted for the crab cake platter instead of the steamed blue crabs. The platter ($25.95 for 2 crab cakes) came with two sides. I upgraded to a cup of Maryland crab soup (an additional $1.50). It's served with half of an in-shell crab. The second side dish was an order of hush puppies -- some of the tastiest ones you'll find in town.The crab cakes were excellent. They had all the marks of a good crab cake -- very little filler and loosely formed with plenty of lump and jumbo lump meat that falls apart with little effort; enough seasoning to enhance the flavor but not too much as to mask the sweetness of the meat. They're the best crab cakes I've had in Vegas, by far.They do have a kid's menu that consists of chicken tenders ($5.95) or popcorn shrimp ($6.95). Both come with fries and a drink.The place is owned by two brothers from Maryland who also own and operate Nevada Seafood Wholesalers, which supplies much of this town's seafood for restaurants and markets like Seafood City. And with those imports comes a slice of nostalgia for any east coaster used to eating fresh seafood.This place has been on my radar for a while, I finally made it over!  We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!The decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. So as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking I luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram/tutorial to help you crack them!  They have a Yelp Check in offer good on regular priced orders and beer and wine.  I will be back! :DNever had blue crabs before...Read the reviews, and decided this would be a good place to try them out!$3 Thursdays....the crabs as well as all the beers they sell for $3.  Can't go wrong price wise!  So how does the food fare?The crabs were very good.  A bit of work to get to the goods, but worth it IMO.  I tried the brains/stomach, and it didn't do anything for me....gave them to my friend.  But I did enjoy the leg joints and claw meat.  And for $3 each, solid choice!Also, the jumbo shrimp/prawns (head on) are very very good!  First of all, their "pound" seems a lot more generous than other quick seafood places I have tried.  Obviously it should be the same, but maybe it is because they are larger and you get more meat than shells.  The seasoning is the winner here...very very good and not super salty and overly done like some places in comparison!  You have to try them!  The crab dip and crab cakes were also good, but I felt like they were a little spendy for what I got.  Although they were good, I will probably put that money towards more shrimp and blue crabs truthfully.Tip, the blue crabs are cooked to order, so if you plan on ordering a few at a time, plan it out so you aren't sitting without in between sessions.  I think they took appx 15min between orders, so plan accordingly!This will be a regular spot for us!Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.10 dollars to smell.  Well, that's what they should charge.  Amazing for the sniffer.I got an order of Blue Crab, halved and cleaned, in garlic butter.  $11.99/lb....eeeee owww.  Served with rice.  Awesome.It was gorged in butter, parsley, and Old Bay - it was delicious.  The problem is that with all the necessary work, the food turns cold after bite #3.The service, gents, were very nice and gregarious.  The ambiance turns a corner of a mini-mall into a pretty good Maryland-ish vibe.All in all, save yourself the work.  Go for crabcakes or a crab salad sandwich, and call it a day.I'm in this area of town for work for the week and bookmarked several places to grab lunch. Crab Corner was my #1 pick. Sadly, on Monday, I got out at 11AM for an hour lunch, only to find this place closed. Looked it up later and they don't open til 11:30AM for lunch. Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open. Highly suggest they open a smidge earlier, they're losing out on business.In any case, I managed to make it in and service was polite- placed a to go order for a crab cake sandwich, had a little bit of sticker shock at the $13 price tag that didn't even include fries or an add-on option for a discounted soup (as other menu items do). Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.Crab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed. Filling portion, though.Would come back for some fresh seafood or other menu items. Their website indicates that they have various discounts and promotions, and Tuesdays in particular they offer $2 male or female blue crabs and $2 beers, which I sadly could not take advantage of during work hours.Was feeling like seafood tonight so me and my girlfriend decided to try this seafood joint.  It close to where we live which is a plus.  It's literally on the corner.  Upon entering the restaurant it has a divey feel to it.  It's pretty small as well.  We let the guy know it was our first time there and the next thing they tell us is that they are out of Blue Crab.  I checked in to yelp after that and there was a special check in for Blue Crab. So I had crab cakes and calamari for appetizers.  They had oysters as the daily special for 1 dollar each.  I finished the meal off with king crab legs that were delicious.  The tab was around 80 bucks.  Normally when we spend that kind of money we are at a fancy restaurant.  Service was ok for a small restaurant.  Would I try it again....maybe....but when I or my lady spend that kind of money it's normally at a all you can eat seafood buffet.I've had a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place for nearly year and just now finally got around to using it. I wasn't too excited going in. I've been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.It's a small and unassuming restaurant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.We were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.The menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.After ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)We opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it's called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have "regular" up to "jumbo"), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.The soup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).We will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?

Review Text :
*swoon* Era squisito! From the olives and bottle of red waiting for me on arrival to the complimentary shot of limoncello on departure, Locanda de Gusti delivered, and then delivered again and again, all I hold most dear in the world of fine food.I have had a longing to go to Italy for over a year now. The cities, the culture, the history, the sunshine, the coast, the wine. And the food. Oh the food. Italian food and me should really get a room. And Locanda de Gusti, as Mike S has already said, serve up real Italian food which was only confirmed by the waiter we were chatting with. The head chef and 'boss' is from Naples and the food, served in Naples portions, was as authentic as you can get. Scan the menu and you'll see no pizza. And limited pasta options only as starters / middle courses. As it turns out, in Naples pizza is more like a biscuit rather than the large pizzas we get here. I have now added Naples to my Italy-trip list to try these types of pizzas.The menu was largely made of meat dishes. Anyone who knows me can imagine the glazed look of sheer joy at this fact. I eat meat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and between-meal snacks. So it was only obvious that the boy and I were each going to choose from the specials menu the two main meat platters. He opted for the red meat, and I the fish.The red meat platter served up a sirloin steak, lamb chop, pork loin, spicy sausage and some chicken. The fish platter proffered sea bass, tuna steak, swordfish steak, a scallop, and two langoustine king prawns. Both served with some fresh vegetables, roast potatoes and salad. (See uploaded photos).Words cannot do it all justice. From the cured meat starter, the melt-in-your-mouth mozarella, the rare cooked tuna (the first time I've had it served properly rare in Edinburgh), the charcoal-grilled flavour to the fish, the giant langoustine prawns, the very generous servings (we are told this is the Naples-way), to the so-sweet and delicious balsamic vinegar on the salad. I must have eaten about 2 1/2 whole servings of fish. After a giant platter of cured meats to start. And yet I didn't leave with the dreaded 'food baby' that some Italian meals can give when they serve up an unhumanly large amount of pasta slathered in creamy sauce. Now I know how Italian woman stay so svelte and stunning. Because they don't eat British-Italian. They eat real Italian.And oh that berry liqueor I had as a digestif was just divine. It smelled of herbs, wonderful herbs, and tasted of berries and was just all good things in a dark, sweet liquid.Can you tell that I'm a little bit in love with this place? Tucked away at the very bottom of Broughton Street, on the corner, it had avoided the tourist-crush of the Festivals which was pleasant but I also hope that they do get enough customers through the door. Locanda de Gusti is far too good to go unnoticed, so at once I want to tell everyone about it, but keep it as my little secret.So go, eat real Italian food, mop up oil and vinegar with your bread, order the tiramisu (I was too full to, but am told it is excellent), enjoy the limoncello and toast Salute!

First visit yesterday- I ordered a burrito.  Whole wheat wrap, no lard black beans, steak asada, shredded cheese mix, lettuce, jalape√±o slices, and sour cream.  $8 and change. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2#ejrnr7b_7ryVNTisxMGpvQ  Tiny wrap, since I had omitted many fillings, but delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2?select=NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ#NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ  I'd like to return, but $8+ is a little pricey.  I'll have to make sure not to be/become hungry while at the mall...

Review Text :
I had this bookmarked since I saw Nelsons review, but until I saw people saying there are French macarons, good French macarons, I about suggest this place to the BF every chance I get. We finally made it a bit before closing so there was a lot sold out, but we managed to get a few of the "must try" on my list from stalking the pictures and reviews. French macarons are a big deal to me since they're my favorite confection. These are smaller and sloppier made than I'm used to but it's the taste that matter. The flavors are decent, but this was not quite there on the texture...I think the size is partly the reason. We both bought 2 of ginger, pistachio, cherry, peanut butter since it's too small to share.This is a hard thing to perfect so even though I'm a bit disappointed, it's not gonna effect me coming back. I'm happy to finally have a neighborhood bakery. I just will go to Bouchon or have my macarons shipped from Los Angeles. The BFs mom is obsessed with finding pastries/croissants with almond paste. Nothing has fit what she's looking for which I think she's looking for a marizpan consistency with a strong almond taste. None the less, we bought a slice of pithivier and a almond croissant for her to try. They were too eggy and not enough almond which I was expecting to happen so they were then for me. The pithivier was good specially when eaten warm. The almond croissant is the star. It was almond and chocolate which at first I was disappointed since I haven't ever liked chocolate croissants, but then I took a bite. Then I just wanted to shove the whole croissant in my mouth since it was delicious and addicting. Nice croissant texture, the right kind and amount of chocolate to compliment the almond. We got the BFs grandma a puff pastry with berry in it and she disappeared off with it so she must've been very happy if she didn't share.I also got a plain croissant to make a sandwich at home.  It's crunchy and flaky outside and then the inside was just soft, buttery. Based on that, the pithivier and the almond croissant that they really know how to achieve the proper flake. A almond shell with what I was told was hazelnut cream caught my fancy. It was good buttery cream but it was not hazelnut....more like sweet cream. I liked it- definitely better than a cream puff. Petit Four was the BFs pick and it was like a black forest cake sans cherries. It was really goof cake texture and moist and the right amount of chocolate and liquor flavor. The prices are reasonable for what they are. We spent about $25 for all of it. The almond shell w/ cream being the most expensive treat at $4.50, $1 macarons, $2ish for the croissants, pithivier and petit four.Will be back very soon to try the savory side and come early so we can sample of the bread!First of all, I have to say thank you to Lisa L. for her review of Patisserie Manon -- in particular, her mentioning that this place is in the complex behind Roy's. That saved me time and probably quite a few trips up and down Charleston to find this gem of a shop.When you walk in you'll probably be sucked in by their display of sweet treats. Yeah, they all look delicious. But once you get past that, you'll see a counter and display of some of their savory options. I opted for a simple ham and swiss on a baguette (about 7 bucks). It's made to order and is quite large -- at least a foot if not more. For the price and size, I think it's a good lunch time bargain. The only negative is that the bread was a little too hard for my tastes. Instead of it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it was just hard all around.On my way out I just couldn't resist the macarons ($1 each). My mind was saying no, but my stomach was saying, "hell yes!" I figured a little treat couldn't hurt so I got six of them (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, chocolate mint, blueberry, vanilla). All were delicious with a light and crunchy shell and soft, creamy center. But, the standouts were the pistachio and chocolate mint.I'll be back to try more of their savory dishes, but I'm sure I'll walk out with a few more macarons or pastries as well.My wife and I have been here 3x in the last month!  That NEVER happens.  This place automatically gets 5 stars for sucking us into their French culinary vortex filled with delicious quiche, croissants and pastries.Everything looks great here.  I swear we're looking at the choices for a solid ten minutes everytime as the lunch crowd continues to ask us "Umm..are you in line or just looking?".  Then we do the same thing for dessert.  The $8.95 lunch combo is great bang for your buck.  You get your choice of a soup (usually more than 5 choices), sandwich (baguette, croissant or panini) and drink.  The baguette sandwich is HUGE.  They cut it into quarters and could easily feed 2.  I'm still trying to perfect my ideal panini but prosciutto, swiss, onion and mustard did me fine.  My wife loves the quiche.  We've tried the four cheese, veggie and bacon and the mushroom.  To have one of these everyday would be amazing.We always try to save room for dessert and usually split a tart or some kind of cake.  Eclairs, black forest cake, assorted macarons, fruit tarts..I feel like I'm on a game show and need to make a choice asap.  But alas I shouldn't feel pressured! I will be back for more!!Are you French... no??  THEN SHUT UP!!!  Who remembers that??  Anyway, this has become a spot I love to go to lately.  I wish it was open a little more late though, I've been several times that it's been closed.  Having said that, this is a great choice for lunch.  Their lunch combos are cheap, delicious, portions are big.  I never had beef bourguinon until coming here.  And to be honest, I would never have ordered that unless I was with my friend, but by golly that beef was tender!!!Everyone that works here is so nice as well.  Staff is so polite, I love that.My one critique is that they can make their macarons look better.  With so many competitors around, they don't seem to have much attention to detail put into them.  But who am I to say?  I've never made a macaron in my life, I just eat them.A macarOn is not a macarOOn.  I learned the difference when I ventured over to this quaint French pastry shop in my neck of the woods.  Macarons are meringue-based cookies with buttercream filling; think a French Oreo, but they come in all flavors and colors. So many choices, but the pleasant young lady behind the counter helped me narrow down my selection.  I ended up leaving with the chocolate mint, lemon, chocolate, and pistachio--d√©licieux!  With bonafide French chefs creating these delectable works of art, Patisserie Manon also offers other treats like Black Forest cake, tarts, pain au chocolat, candies, croissants, breads, and more. I'll be back to try the bistro offerings--the quiche looks good!  √† bient√¥t!So they are not the sexiest macarons but what they lack in beauty they make up for in sheer macaron goodness!  The "cookies" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!True Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.Outstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).Great looking shop.  Friendly and passionate service.  If this small sampling is any indication, tout est bon!Meep Meep!!That was my first thought when I first walked into Patisserie Manon for their macarons.  I remember being out on the golf course in Palm Springs a few years back.  I remember seeing a bunch of mini-birds running across the fairway.  I asked my friend, what the heck is that?  He stated, those are what you call a Road Runner. Funny, that was my first time to ever see a Road Runner in real life and never expected them to be so small.  Yes, I was one of those that thought a Road Runner was the height of an ostrich.  I guess I watched too many cartoons as a child.  Now fast forward to my first macaron.  The only thing I ever knew about a macaron was what I've seen in pictures or what I've seen on Yelp.  I honestly expected a macaron to be the size of a burger slider.  You can now see why I thought of "Meep Meep" when I first walked into Patisserie Manon.  I didn't expect a macaron to be so small, like a Road Runner.Small, but huge on taste.  These little road runners tasted so good and I don't even have a sweet tooth. Tried their Orange, Lemon, Cherry, Blueberry, Cafe, Vanilla, and Caramel.  All were good and would have to say that Caramel had to be my favorite.  These little treats are served cold and if not kept cool, will begin to break apart.  Because they are bite size and so tasty, it was easy to finish the box.  Sorry Honey, Daddy still left you a few.  You snooze, you lose litte girl!!Service was great and the ambiance reminds me of a cafe.  But not like one of those fast paced cafes ala Starbucks, but one where you can kick it and enjoy your macaron.  The macarons have a certain bite or kick to them.  You will notice it a few seconds after your first gobble.  Their other desserts also looked good, but I didn't try them. Maybe on my next visit.  Thanks Yelpers...you guys got me here.  You guys helped me realize that I actually have a sweet tooth.  Now looking forward for my next Road Runner, I mean Macaron. And of course, I recommend.  Meep Meep!!These pastries are not to be trifled with, no comparison comes to mind.I've been to plenty of places, but amazing apple's hard to find.You can quote me, if you'd like.I'd suggest you take a hike,To Manon, a destination to unwind!Manon came highly suggested for a sampling of their $1.10 French macarons, of course I couldn't pass that up, especially since I was just a half mile away. I took a quick look through their displays and discovered they had some pastries with apple, and some filled with cr√®me, a few with raspberries, and chocolate too. If there is a dessert filled with Apple, you can rest assured I'm going to order it, and Manon had two. I chose to the French apple tart this time, I'll save the other for my next time through. It's not often that a pastry makes you blush, but this French apple tart sure did ;-)The macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise. Rest assured I'll be back for that one when I visit again. If you've not been to Manon yet, I would strongly urge you to check your reservations and come by for some of the best pastries I've ever had.Happy Yelping!French lesson of the day...did you know macarons are pronounced mah-kah-r≈çn and not like macaroons (the coconut chocolate chunks).  Of course the uneducated people selling the items won't say it correctly either and they may look at you like you are crazy if you do pronounce it properly...but deep down inside you can know you are right :)Onto the review, this place is macaron heaven!  They probably have 12-15 different flavors of macarons! (rose, mango, salted caramel, lemon, blueberry, orange, ginger, peanut butter, coffee, pistachio, mint chocolate, and the list goes on....)  Okay, are these bad boys as good as the ones from Bouchon.... that's a resounding no, but they are only $1.10 each.  They aren't the prettiest macarons I've seen since they seem to be put together haphazardly, but they are still delicious little morsels.  They have tons of other cakes/pastries/meringues to choose from as well.  I didn't get a chance to sample their food, but they seem to have a good selection of sandwiches and comfort French food.  I will definitely be back to try the food.Seriously. Top-notch quality macarons for $1.10 each? Patisserie Manon's macarons were definitely worth my visit here! While there are lots of other pastries, baked goods, and delectable looking cakes in the front of the store, my eyes were set on the colorful macarons behind the glass display that greets you the moment you walk into the store. These macarons are a little differently shaped than the ones I am used to (more flat and cookie like) - these are strange puffed up shells making them longer and less wide than I am  used to. The color of the shells also look a little artificial because they are so bright. BUT, they were amazing. I bought eight macarons, trying to test all the different flavors. Overall, I felt that the macarons had a really puffy texture upon first bite, but then became chewy afterwards, making the perfect combination of shell and filling to give you that great macaron enjoyment. My favorite flavors were: Rose - not too heavy. It contained the perfect flowery taste to delight my tastebuds. And the shells were pink and white! Salted Caramel - I loved the flavor of the caramel! Not too sticky, but had a good consistency that worked really well with the shells.I also really liked lemon and strawberry. They didn't taste extraordinary, but they had very good taste. The strawberry even had bits of real strawberry inside of the filling. Flavors that were a-ok: Ginger - Interesting flavor, but not my cup of tea. I love ginger candy, but I thought the taste was a little weird for a macaron. It was also really sticky. Mango - It was interesting, but a bit too artificial for my liking. Pistachio - I thought the pistachio had good almond flavor in the shell, and the filling was also decent. I'm not a big fan of pistachio macarons, but these were okay. Mocha - It wasn't too strong on the mocha taste, but I liked it. Not memorable, but something I would try again!When I was buying the macarons, they informed me that they had salted caramel and mango in the back. I don't know if they would have told me this if I hadn't asked them about the flavors, but as I am a big salted caramel macaron fan, I would definitely have been bummed out if I missed out on this flavor! If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be coming by a few times a month to pick up macarons! And their cakes! They were gorgeous and very elaborate (but expensive!)! Patisserie Manon is located in a quiet plaza next to the Whole Foods market plaza. We weren't sure at first where it was, but we saw a man standing outside with a sign. I also saw another location for this place down the street. I guess they have two storefronts? They have lots of seating inside the restaurant, and I believe a caf√© where you can order drinks and sandwiches further inside the store. I definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!Let them eat Cake.Although I've never been to France, I tried to envision myself in a Paris cafe with a cup of coffee and French pastry enjoying the food and scenery.  Alas, I just had to contend, for the moment, with my wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon as a substitute.  Ah well, c'est la vie!A friend and I decided to venture to this location, which is located quite a trek from the Las Vegas strip.  And though we did take a wrong turn here and there, we finally made it to this French bakery in the middle of the desert.The pastry showcase is just a plethora of sweetness.  Glucose levels will rise surely just by the mere stare of the variety of pastries and macarons on display.  I admit I wanted mostly everything that morning, but I figured I had to settle for just one thing as there were many places yet to visit on this recent Vegas foodie adventure.After finally making a decision, I chose the strawberry cream pie.  Now of course, this does NOT resemble any version of American "pie."  Sandwiched between two flaky layers of croissant-like texture are sliced strawberries and whip cream, while the entire pie is finished off with powered sugar, MORE whip cream, and a whole strawberry.  The entire pastry was simply divine.  The BEST way to start the morning paired with a cup of coffee.   I was reminded of that cafe scene in "Inglorious Basterds" where Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are having coffee and pastries.  More so for the pastry they ordered, with the topping of whip cream, and the flaky crust of the pastry itself.  Before leaving we took an assortment of macarons to go.  My favorite was the salted caramel.  There were any flavors, but truly that was the most memorable.....and the blueberry, of course.BOTTOM LINE:  A wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon.  Bon App√©tit!!My plans to rampage the strip in Vegas were dashed when the wedding party reserved rooms about 20 mins away. The silver lining was that I was pushed out of my comfort zone and forced to find new things. One of those things was Patisserie Manon, a French bakery close to SunCoast. I wasn't sure what to expect but we were greeted by giant display cases jammed with every kind of pastry known to man. Rainbows of macarons, custard filled eclairs, fruit tarts, lemon cremes, pies, cakes, cookies. It's a sugar addict's dream in there. The bistro is in back, an order counter where they'll pile a plate with a giant croque madame or some goat cheese quiche or a big salad. The soups need some help but then, when it's 115 degrees outside, soups aren't a big priority. Our service there was great (it's order window) and they've got a cute kids table for your little ones. Definitely a find if you're in that area or are looking for a little (or a lotta) sugar.Ever since I read Michael C.'s (Yelp Hawaii) review of this French bakery, I knew I had to go there. Then, I read LA Yelper, Tiffany C.'s and Rod U.'s (Hawaii) reviews -  I was even more encouraged!  When I saw Vegas Yelpers' reviews - Norm, Sylvia, Nelson, Terri, Mel, Ania, Stefany, and Philip -  that put me over the top!I just wanted a little dessert. I ended up with a Kiwi Raspberry Tart, a Mango macaron, and a Peach Rectangle Tart. Wow. The crust, the fresh fruit, the quality of ingredients. ..I could tell that it's authentic! Then, I ventured to the back of the shop... oh, no!  There is a separate cash register for the savory goods: soups, sandwiches, lasagna, French Hot Dog, croissants, and QUICHE!  OMG - I had just had dinner,  but I NEEDED a Quiche. ..but how to decide between Ham and Cheese,  Spinach, Goat Cheese, and many other flavors?  I went with the most popular: Quiche Lorraine. Ahhh. .. it was THE BEST quiche I had ever had!  That buttery, flakey crust and the "broke da mouth" combination of bacon, cheese and eggs made me continue my feasting! It was so fluffy and decadent! !I'm quite sure that I'll be back for more quiche and other goodies!  Vive la France!

Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.Thought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe. It's been a rough morning. Needless to say, my therapist is not going to be happy about this.See photos.When it comes to bagels, Einstein Bagels is 3 5 star good. However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.

Even through all the crazy menu items CJ has had over the years, the taste is still the same. The burgers are consistently good. I miss the days when you could get a Famous Star WITH cheese for just .99! The fries are horrible sice they changed them. My favorite fries were at CJ but not now damn it. I came the other morning for breakfast with a coupon and tried the Maple Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuit. The sausage was freaking good. It reminded me of the Johnsonville breakfast sausage my wife cooks. The biscuit was hot and damn good for a fast food place. The hash browns are nuggets and surprisingly not too greasy. Now if I could just get them to bring back their baked potatoes and original fries all would be right.

Review Text :
After a trip to the Market, I was roped into trying a short leash dog. I generally as a rule of thumb, refuse to eat hot dogs, but I decided to make an exception, because Sean S. said they were sooooo good. I decided to have a vegetarian dog with mango chutney, jalape√±o, and mayo. It was pure heaven and served on a delicious piece of naan. Kudos to the creativity of the dog topping combinations. The combinations are named after the owners pets, dogs none the less - how cute is that? Delicious, filling, and unique. What more can I say? Stop by the Market on Wednesday night or Saturday morning and try one for yourself!Great sausages (from Schreiner's), creative and tasty combinations for fixins, on hot naan bread. And wonderful, friendly people - they made sure that I enjoyed what I ordered. A great meal, definitely. I wish there were more than one truck, and I wish one were stationed closer to where I live.I am a HUGE fan.  Partially because this was the most filling hotdog I have ever had.  I 100percent put my taste buds in the hands of the owners and just said give me whatever I should have.  They brought me out two halves prepared in two different styles,  One had beans and was delicious (the Miko I think)  and the other was spicy (the Aiko I think).  I was absolutely in love with both.  They apparently will be at Shady's every Thursday night and Public Market more often.  From now on every time I see them I'm stopping.  YUM!I'm not really a hot dog guy (not that there's anything wrong with that). When I crave a hot dog, I might get one and one is always necessary at a ball game and once in awhile i will get a hot dog at the gas station when in a pinch, but in general, I am not the sort of guy to go out of my way to find a wiener.That being said...The first time I went to Short Leash at the Public Market with Ayesha S. It was damned good but ya know...still a hotdog, not my thing necessarily. Second time I went was with Julia T. and I think "yeah I kinda get it, if you are into hot dogs..." Third time...something just opened inside of me...something magical and warm and I felt like Belle in Beauty and the Beast, my heart opening up and for the  first time not viewing it just as a hot dog (There must be something there that wasn't there before) but as a sandwich, a meal, a real step above what I am used to in the hot dog department.The actual hotdog...it is...How do i put it?...the texture and flavour are like BAM. Then the toppings...pick your own or go with one of the choice combinations they list...also they run specials with pet dog namesakes. You probably aren't going to get it wrong no matter what you go with.  The toppings are fresh, tasty and they are not stingy with em. It all gets loaded up into a flatbread which sounds odd but works.Here is the real kicker...these people are effing rad. I walk up and guy says to me "I'm sorry, I forgot your name." I had been there twice and not that recently I didn't even expect him to remember who I was at all. So then I go pay with my card and realize I forgot to get a bottle of water for my dog. The guy gives me a bowl of water for him and then the lady behind the counter asks if he can have a hotdog. She even assures me they are 100 percent beef. Gives my dog a free hot dog! Mind you I think they appreciated the work he was doing gathering signatures for the DT dog park. *ching* I felt tingly all over and knew it was true love. Cray good. CRAZY good.I have no doubt that Brad and Kat could put just about anything on a hotdog wrap it in the wonderful flatbread and it would be absolutely amazing! While I usually don't stray far from the Aiko (fresh diced mango, cilantro, onions, jalape√±os on a beer hot), I have become quite fond of their Corn Pups (corn dog with spicy jalape√±o cheese inside).  Recently tempted to try something new here while reading their Specials board I was drawn in by a hotdog topped with blackeye peas, onions, green chile, old fashioned english cheddar and crumbled Fritos corn chips.  FRITOS...*drool*...I couldn't decide! Seeing my dilemma, and not being too busy at the moment, they offered to do half of each the Aiko and this daily special.  Needless to say I was yet again BLOWN AWAY with Short Leash's delicious creation.Don't doubt the Masters!  Brad and Kat know their stuff!This is the first review I've written where I wish I could give more than five stars.I was so hesitant to try this place based on all the hipster reviews and and the preconcieved notion that is overpriced stuff that appeals to granolas and hipsters. Well, that may be true, but I think it appleals to everyone as well. I ordered the Noki, a dog with green chiles, pintos, cheese, and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog. They serve the dogs on flatbread which is awesome beyond belief! The taste and quality was definitely there and the portion is enormous. Where I really want to give this place more stars is the service. I want to say they have worked in high levels of service industry before because name usage was constant. They took my name for the order and used it at least three times in conversation with me. I noticed they had a catch for bottle caps from the sodas they sell, so I asked if my girlfriend could have them for an art project she is doing. Not only did he say she could take them, but gave her a ziplock bag for them, offered to save them from future days, and tried to refuse when I recognized the great service and gave a tip. in short (get it?) these guys get how to run a business. They are friendly, helpful, serve high quality food, and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs. They take credit cards as well through a Droid app the guy has on his cell phone, and you sign with your finger on the phone's touch screen. I don't go to the market much, and I try not to eat hot dogs, but if I'm ever out and about when this truck is there, I'll definitely stop by again.One hundred stars, thanks again guys!My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart? Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!Wiener wiener wiener!I can't freaking believe I haven't reviewed Short Leash yet!!!!!!!  I go pretty much every Friday to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market food truck court.  Is that a mouthful or what?????I make a beeline here.  Not only are these people totally kick-ass but so are the hot dogs.I try to get a different one each time, but I always end up with the one that's got the jalapenos on it.  I don't remember the names ever.  I am there to eat, not read, but I think it's the Igby.They have a new one I learned about last night, the "Lady," and my mouth is watering right now at my desk.  I will be trying it out today for lunch. :}Oh, and when business owners remember the names of their customers, they are tops in my book.  After all, I may be eating their hot dog, but it's still....all about me.  ;}After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday. Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs. I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day. I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway. WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG! This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric. Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too! P.S. For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.There has been plenty said already about this crazy hot dog wagon ~ Short Leashed Dogs, and most of it true!  Their hot dog creations are  creative, tasty and just freaking awesome!  Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.  I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalape√±os, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.They have bottled H2O and soda in bottles. I found the diet black cherry goes well with any hot dog. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations around town.  Look them up on FB, find them and enjoy a creative and delicious bite to eat.Imagine every hot dog you've ever had. Ok, now throw every image out the window because you haven't tasted anything until you've had a hot dog from Short Leash Dogs. Everything I heard about Short Leash Dogs is true and today I finally got to experience one. I visited Short Leash Dogs during their Pop-Up lunch at 335 W. McDowell today (a location which is pretty cool and I can't wait to see what it becomes, by the way). I studied the menu and had major menu anxiety while trying to figure out what to order. I wanted my first Short Leash dog to be perfect! I noticed that the special was called the "Sunny." It has peaches, goat cheese and prosciutto. They told me that it's only on the menu for a limited time, so of course I had to order it, especially since it has everything I love in life on it! I anxiously awaited my order and envisioned the luscious flat-bread engulfed in the goat cheese and prosciutto on top of the hot dog. It finally appeared and it took just one bite for me to be in a scene of "All Dogs Go To Heaven." I got the chicken hot dog and it was seasoned perfectly. The flat-bread complimented the meat and toppings and the prosciutto, peaches and goat cheese were the perfect summery twist on this hot day. After my visit to Short Leash, I decided that I will tie my leash to their food cart and follow them religiously around town. Not only are the owners two of the nicest people around, but their hot dogs are an extremely tasty addition to the Valley. Now if only Old Town allowed more food carts to post up shop. You'd think with the amount of bar and foot traffic, they would want gourmet food carts like Short Leash!Short Leash Dogs is amazing, for sure.The owners could not be sweeter and more friendly, and that is the secret to their success. In addition to buying an amazing product at good value, you get to meet and become part of the extended family with Short Leash. Even on the busiest of days, the SLD crew has time to say hi, chat, and make you feel like you're a good friend visiting their home. On a recent order I messed up what I typically get, and Brad stopped me and asked, "Hey- you usually get a beer hot, do you want something different?" Nope- I just spaced it, and he caught it.The food is as amazing as the service, and I highly recommend getting a corn pup (with mustard, NEVER ketchup) and an Aiko dog with beer hot, or as I am trying to get it renamed, the Baiko!Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT miss this amazing little food truck. Every visit I make you will see that Short Leash Dogs is the busiest and most popular, and that is for a good reason. Don't stress if there is a line, the SLD crew does not screw around- and the food is more than worth it.Keep up the amazing work guys, I hope someday you guys have a brick and mortar location- because I will be the first one in line.Since I discovered shortleash's gormet spin on the dreary old dog, I have dreams of coming back time and time again. Pick from one of the solid regular menu options, try and experiment by making your own custom dog, or mix it up by adding toppings to one of their menu choices. Choose your dog, such as bratwurst, spicey beer hot (my personal fav), a regular dog, veggie dog, etc. Choose from toppings like Fried pickles, cole slaw, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, fried onions, sauerkraut, mango chutney, sliced jalenpenos, and so much more, all of which seem to be fresh and extremely tasty. Wrap it all up in an indian naan flat bread. This is the stuff of legends.I think I read somewhere that this weeks feature of the week comes with bacon - I think I know what I'll be eating for lunch today. I almost always make my dog custom. Sometimes I will change pace with the featured dog of the week, which are usually a little different and exciting. Check them on facebook or their website for their weekly schedule, they usually hang around down town for lunches through the week and dinner on select days.... I think "food truck friday" at the phoenix public market should be re-named to "shortleashdogs and the food trucks" - expect a 20 minute wait in line to make your order if you show up around 12pm on friday for lunch. I promise it's worth the wait!Quoted in the weekly Yelp newsletter 7-4-2012: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=L5AQHJ8yFfPtBRNI_xIRyAThe Ultimate Phoenix Downtown Destination!On a day where it's 106 degrees in the shade, 30+ people standing in line can't be wrong. If there's this many people willing to risk 2nd degree burns from the scortching sun waiting in line for their turn to order up a hotdog, there really must be something to it. No where else in Phoenix will you find people this dedicated. I just couldn't help myself; I was drawn to get in line with everyone else.Brimming with excitement from all the possibilities, the wait in line seems miniscule compared to the payout I am about to receive from such an amazing dog! Will I get a Mokie and add fried pickles? Will I order a Lady and top it off with green chilies and pinto beans? How about the Oliver and throw in some of that tasty coleslaw? Wait, no, I'll have the Bear, naked style. Maybe instead of the Bear, I'll get a corn dog, with some of that awesome chipotle cream cheese. The possibilities are endless - I guess I'll just have to keep coming back until I've had them all!Oh no!! after getting closer to the front of the line, I found out they've even got a featured dog of the week with customized specialty toppings and this week it's Beef and Bean Chili topped with Fritos and Cheddar! What will I choose?!?!?A quick visit to Food Truck Fridays in downtown Phoenix (McKinley and Central) between 11am and 1:30pm will prove there's Short Leash, and then there's everyone else. Don't make the mistake and get stuck ordering from "everywhere else."Happy Yelping Phoenix and go grab one of these awesome dogs!Ode to Short Leash.I once heard a whisper of a much beloved hot dog; of island dreams come alive atop a six inch bun. I dared not believe there could be another to even compare against my precious. I feel as a guilty lover drifted away from his one true love in a moment of weakened convictions. The hot peppers and spicy caribbean sauce left me breathless and weak in the knees. As a guilty lover always does, he comes crawling back from rediscovery of what he once knew to be true. Short Leash's love is ever lasting, and how dare I even consider another. I have faith in our bond; Short Leash, and our ties are not easily broken. I regret even the consideration that there could be another out there to quench the lunchtime desires for hot dog delights. I promise I shall not stray again, with a conviction of the strength of stone.From hence forth, I promise to remain faithful to the lovingly topped gourmet hot dogs. Available with sauerkraut, cole slaw, pepperoncini's, jalape√±os, mango chutney, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, diced tomatoes, fried pickles, grilled onions, peanut butter, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, blue cheese, green chilis, smoked gouda, relish, bacon and barbeque sauce.Happy Yelping Phoenix, don't stray far from your one true love.This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart! No sirree Bob, if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water, steamed buns, and French's mustard you may want to keep driving.However, if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook, then this is your place. Hot dogs with gouda cheese, bacon, and even peanut butter as toppings. I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious. Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed them.Additionally, at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as well.Finally, the service was great! Despite the crowds, service was friendly, attentive, and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucks.Short Leash Dogs - we will be back!Went to a Sit Stay UYE Friday night with my daughter & a friend, I had been wanting to try Short Leash Dogs for awhile now, so this opportunity sounded like the perfect time for that!I found them in an alley way off Central & Camelback, and when I walked up it had a nice cozy feeling, couple of wooden tables, a fire pit and plenty of cool people.I knew that this would a hot dog eating experience that I haven't had before; I ordered the Pippin Style Brat, came with grilled pears, prosciutto, watercress, goat cheese & topped with some honey & pepper severed on naan bread.  Ok sounds interesting right? Let me tell you, it was amazing, who would have thought, everything blended so well together, what a great treat!My friend and I had been lil standoffish about the Bear; I just couldn't get my head wrapped around it. Friend asked if I would be up to splitting one, that we came this far and to not try it would just be an epic failure on our behalf, so I said yes!The Bear, it's interesting, has peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon & bbq sauce on a brat wrapped in naan bread. The peanut butter sort of melts and mixes with the bbq sauce and it kind of reminded me of Thai Peanut sauce, which I just love!   Over all the hot dog was good, just was unsure of what to make of the cracker jacks, would I order another one, Heck yea I would! Glad to have finally had the chance to try Short Leash, look forward to my next run in with them!

Review Text :
This is a great place to come have a few beers and watch some games.  There's tons of TV's, tons of seating, and ton's of beers on tap.We ordered the stuffed jalapeno's for an appetizer. When I bit into one, hot cream cheese spewed out and burned my lip. Those things are dangerous! Tasty though ...The entree food fell flat. My summer salad was drenched in dressing. My friends shrimp scampi was super bland, and my BF's salad looked wilted and just not good.Come for beer or sports, not food.Props for having Oregon's "dead guy ale" on tap.Good Service, quality food, decent prices, fun restaurant/bar scene with pool tables and an awesome atmosphere overall.I had lunch here with one of my gal pals who actually introduced me to it and who bragged about their food.She ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and I opted for fish and chips. Both meals were tasty and great quality to say the least, lots of food for a great price! They have daily specials as well. I will be back to check out the bar and have something on tap for my next visit. This place is fun!I am on the late freight with checking this restaurant out however better late than never!I have to say...I am a fan of Miller's Alehouse.  But I'm only a fan since it's a great place to catch the game and there's enough of a selection for everyone on the menu.  When you go to most places to watch a game, you're stuck with your usual bar type food.  Miller's has all the fried foods, burgers, and nachos if that's your thing.  However, Miller's also has other options from fajitas, soups, salads, and steak.  Even though they were known for their super-sized nachos, we didn't partake in any of it during our most recent visit.  I've had it before and they are pretty damn good.  They're perfect to share with a group if you're not counting your calories. I ended up with a bowl of chili and a steak/chicken fajita combo.  Both meals were decent, nothing spectacular.  But I'm still giving Miller's Alehouse 4 stars because I see myself coming back one day to watch the game.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (499/500)Thank you for being good sports and taking care of our extremely rowdy table of 25 . They knew ahead of time that we would want separate tabs and there was no confusion in the end on what was supposed to be on whose bill. The drinks and food we ordered also came out quickly and efficiently.Yessss! Someone ordered the gigantic nachos and I was able to have some. Actually, everyone at the table was able to have some because there was just so much to go around. The calamari and wings were other standout items that I was able to try. They have more than just bar food available so peruse the menu and I'm sure you will find something to strike your fancy.Overall, a good sports bar or hangout spot with buddies.Located in Town Square, it is a great location for some food and drinks!We stopped in after our shopping excursion to appease our appetite.  They were very friendly as soon as we walked in the door.  As soon as we sat down, our waiter was over with happy friendly service. Our entire table spilt the fiesta nachos.  As an appetizer for 4, it was perfect.  The plate of nachos were piled high with plenty of toppings all around.  Something else to share is the Miller's Steak Sandwich.  I split this with my husband.  It was filled with marinated steak, onions, mushrooms and provolone.  So delicious and filling!  Tip~ if you order sweet potato fries on the side, it is a HUGE basket and can also be shared.  This location has good service and good food!  Just a great option when in the area!

Review Text :
So...I went when Pastitsio first opened and was a little disappointed. There weren't many options, the portions were small and pricey and my bf and I were just "meh" about it. I haven't been back since that visit until today....All I have to say is that I am disappointed in MYSELF that I didn't return to this place sooner! It is super close to my house, and I had no idea I could have access to fresh, DELISH hummus all the time. Hummus is a food group for me, and being a vegetarian, it is one of the only things I can order at a lot of restaurants/bars besides salad. So I love it, I never get sick of it. Pastitsio's does it FRESH and RIGHT! It is so good paired with their warm pita! You can also buy containers to go, and now that I know this, I will probably be back frequently!They also have an array of fresh (vegan/veggie) salads like Tabboulah and potato salad with olive oil, not mayo. They have daily specials (bf got the carved chicken sandwich) and many other fun things in their to-go fridge. BF loved the salad dressing as well!Plus, they were so friendly when we walked in! Super nice people, they brought everything to our table on nice plates, and just made the extra effort. Can't wait to be back for my weekly hummus fill!I cannot believe I've waited this long to come here!  I passed it on Butler for months and months and never went in, but always thinking I had to go.  Now to think of how many delicious meals I have missed out on makes me sad!I tried to order the lamb sandwich but they were out, so it could have ended badly.  But don't you worry, they still had veggies, so I opted for the roasted veggie sandwich.  It. Was. Incredible!  I loved the soft doughy pita, the delicious perfectly roasted roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant with a creamy saziki sauce. Of course, I also couldn't resist a beet salad side.  When you order a beet salad you never really know if you'll get (I mean, unless you read the menu...I just see beets and get excited!), greens and beets or just beets.  This time it was just beets, but it was still great with a slight taste of orange and vinegar.   The place is super tiny, but wasn't too crowded.  The one negative thing was it was hot as hades inside.  I believe it was probably around 40 outside, so when I walked outside it was refreshing.  I even started fanning myself with a City Paper at one point!  Other than that, killer meal and I will most definitely be putting this on my lunch rotation in Lola!

Double rainbow all the way* at this Vietnamese eatery.Try the Rock Star. Vie et Nam's rendition of the popular banh mi sandwich is filled with a medley of moist pork and chicken chunklets plus cilantro and jalapenos, atop a respectable baguette. Their pickles are sliced rather large, but I'm still a fan of this rock star; it holds its own against competing sandwich places.Don't like banh mi? Don't worry: They offer dishes besides sandwiches.* My obsession with Vietnamese sandwiches borders on the unhealthy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX0D4oZwCsA

Before you eat here, know that there's a Starbucks just up the way, and a Sbarro just across from it. Both are better options, kids. I was attracted to the idea of freshness, but that's not at all what I got. My turkey and pesto panini was salty, and although they had grilled it it was still cold. Very unappealing and gross. For an $8 sandwich, I expected a lot more. There are very few food options in this terminal, but believe me when I say you're better off eating at any other than Fresh Attractions.

Restaurant name  Pinky's Westside Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If opening night was any indication this will be a great & sorely needed addition to the West side. The strongest thing about Pinky's is not the car on the roof or the airbrushed hood by the bar, it's the menu. Yes, there are fried pickes, yes they serve burgers but there is more than that. For my first visit I ordered the Pterdactyl (their standard size burger). As more patties are added the name changes to a larger dinosaur. That should explain the concrete triceratops you'll see on Freedoom Drive. Standard lettuce, tomato, etc is available but I really encourage you to try the other topping combinations like Ding-Dong style: a ginger slaw, with crunchy peanut butter, and sriracha sauce. Cost: $3.75. They're still experimenting with some menu options so the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette I had will be replaced with a better value. When I go back I'll be trying a basket of popcorn shrimp that's paired with their waffle fries, and more of the slaw from my burger. Outside of fried food & carnivores there are multiple filling salads available, as well as sandwiches, and hot dogs that all had tempting descriptions.Layout of the space maximizes seating options with a long bench along the glass wall of tables for 2, high backed booths as a row in front of the bar, and more tables by the roll up glass garage doors. The vibe of the interior does have some automotive elements of its former home but I wouldn't say it's as dominating as the motorcycle theme is inside Mac's Speed Shop.The staff was very friendly and already had opinions on favorite menu items. One of the partners sat down to talk and shared their enthusiasm for the space. Their liquor shelves should be stocked by the end of the week and but I forgot to look at the beer list to have an opinion.I think they'll earn a 5th star, but a few more visits will tell.I didn't even know Charlotte had a Westside. YeAH, WESTSIDE!! in my best gangsta voice.Pinky's is heading for success, it already has a comfortable feel, I can't believe they have only been open for a week, already feels established. I sat at the bar waiting for friends and this nice guy beside me shared his pimento cheese, seasoned waffle fries. He has a friend for life now. Sharing is caring. Guess what?  They passed my french fry barometer. Need I say more?My hot dog was delish, I tried a bite of a corndog- soooooooo good. The outer heavenly shell was sweet, light and a little bit of crunch. Corndogs are sent from heaven. Pinky's had a nice mix of customers, single fun drinkers, the child slingers and nice men who sit at bars and share their food with the ladies. P.S. I told him to start Yelping.  Our check average was $13 without tip -food and adult beverage. I think that is flippin' fantastic.I can see we are heading for a beautiful relationship. Crush factor: OrangeJust.What.This.Area.Needed.Yep, Pinky's fills the quick, tasty, cheap food void in the Wesley Heights area with a stacked menu, cool place and really, really great staff. A bunch of yelp peeps dropped by Pinky's for a grand old time and I got to taste a smattering of stuffs. Some of my faves from the menu...Crab Hush Puppies: ZOMG. If a little crab made love to a hush puppy, this is its delicious baby. But it's also a big puppy. And served with a delicious tartar sauce. Oh, and there are 13 per order for $4.95. If that's not love, I don't know what is.Pimento Cheese Fries: A heart attack in a basket, and delicious. I don't know if I could (or ever should) eat an entire basket by my lonesome, but these were magnificent. Pterodactyl burger: A seemingly basic burger, but nicely seasoned and well cooked. Oh, and it's a steal at $4.25. Veggie Corn Dog: The only reason I tried this is simply because I didn't believe my buds that a veggie corn dog could be delicious. Oh, but it is. Veg heads celebrate!Fried Pickles: Perfectly fried with the light, crispy breading we all know and love. With the saucy sauce. Oh I'm a fan of you Pinky's and I'll be back soon...Last night was my 1st visit with fellow Yelpers... I'm happy to say finally some cool dining/hangout options in that side of town.  I remember driving by this corner with the old service station, can't believe they got it all pretty up.  Heads up peeps, parking in the front is PRIME, but they obviously work out with the lot owner across the street (coming from uptown, go down Morehead, past the light @ Freedom, immediately on the left) for additional parking.  Be careful when you dash across toward the yummy smell of fried food.My 4-stars is a little... skewed.  Explanation: I am a fan of the restaurant but I didn't eat much.  But the fried pickle was good, a little thick in my opinion, but heck, it's fried and came with ranch... what more can a girl ask for?? The Crab Puppies were HUGE, as in size and portion.  For $5, that's a great starter to share.  OK, let's be realistic here, 5 bucks will NOT get you a mouth full of fresh crab meat.  But I could taste the crab taste.  My fav of last night visit, $1 Miller Highlife, the champagne of beer... with a twist of lime, and I got myself a poor man's corona!  The $3 cosmo was good, as in it was not weak :)  One day I'll update my review on the food... but for now, 4-stars for the location, the ambience, and the drinks.Can't believe it took me this long to make it into Pinky's! The crown jewel of biker bar/dive bars on the west side of Charlotte. Packed full of personalities, tattoos, the beer flows like wine, and tons of cardiac inducing treasures to be had. The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind. I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives. Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last. Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job. White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time. Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?I'm just going to reiterate what those who have been fortunate enough to experience Pinky's have said in their reviews here:White Trash Burger: Yes, you should get it at least once but be prepared for a gut bomb for real. (I haven't had the Ding Dong burger but have heard it's pretty dang good as well. I might be adventurous enough to try that someday... Maybe.)Cheese fries: Yes, get those also. But again, gut bomb.Corn dogs of any sort: Hell yeah. Get those too.Atmosphere: Super laid back, hipster, casual and diner-ish. I went there today after not showering for 2 days and no one seemed to care. (Let the judging commence...)Pricing: Average, affordable diner food pricing. ($22 for 2 meals and 2 soft drinks)Service: Spot on! Did not have to ask for anything at all as our server was seriously on top of everything. Also, on our way out the door today after lunch, we were told "Have a good one!" and "Thanks again!" by several of the employees. That really goes a long way for me.And lastly... Why are the "Shrimp Corn Dogs" not called "Shrimp Puppies"??!! It is just beyond me. It would be such a cute little name for those delicious morsels of fried battered shrimpness. It just makes sense. (Yeah, go ahead and get those too.)**Oh! Almost forgot... park behind the building in the gravel lot or else you won't be parking anywhere.

Review Text :
FINALLY I made it to @smashburgerlv and boy was I glad I did!!!GREAT Burgers!! Excellent selection of Sides & Fantastic Shakes!!!1st time out I had to try the Mushroom+Swiss Burger which was OVER the TOP good, 2nd time I had to go for the BAJA Burger which was great as well.The burgers remind me alot of Fuddruckers with a great selection of fresh toppings but the sides are unique and quite incredible especially the pickle chips and veggie frites.BEEFY CHILI IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!Since this location is right across the street from the Village Square Cinemas its a good spot to fill up before seeing a movie instead of paying $12 for a popcorn & soda :) Prices are fair for a sit-down burger joint and service is SUPER-FriendlyStopped here for lunch the other day and decided to order a 1/3 lb Spicy Baja Burger ( Pepper Jack, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Chipotle Mayo, and Fresh Jalapenos on a Chipotle Bun, $5.99), Chicago Dog ($3.99), Fried Pickles ($1.99).  Yes, I was starvin' like Marvin!This was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.The first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.Next I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.Next up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.Overall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.Will I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour.Finally hit up the Smashburger to see what it is all about! I joined the Smashburger club via their website and in return they emailed me a voucher for a free entree. Hell yeah a free burger of my choice sounds like a great time to give them a try! I did not have to manually print the coupon they accepted it via looking at and deleting the email from my phone.I am glad we did as I was very happy and satisfied with my meal! The service is Amazing as well, all of the employees so helpful and sweet always checking on us to make sure everything is perfect! Andy and the crew at this location kick ass!!! They were even patient with me while I stood at the counter trying to decide what I wanted to order as the menu is neat how you can add stuff on to your burger. They have their own creations and they have the option to create your own burger or chicken burger. Lots of free toppings! Mmmmmm yum!I decided on the "Classic" and decided on the "big smash" size which is 1/2 pound Angus burger. Includes American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion, pickles and smash sauce on an artisan egg bun. I added sweet relish and extra purple onion as a free add on. The sweet relish on my burger was divine, it just took the flavor and taste to a whole new level. Reminds me of when I was a kid and would order a burger from an old school diner my Mom would take me to in San Diego, CA, they put sweet relish on their burgers, I will never forget how good it was! Thank you for the trip back in time and fond memory Smashburger! :)My boyfriend ordered the "Spicy Baja" which includes pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo, fresh jalapenos on a spicy chipotle bun. He added for .75 more fried pickles on the side and haystack onions to his burger. He really enjoyed his burger, his only complaint was that the meat patty is smashed out further than the bun. I said babe it is called "Smashburger" lol That is what I liked is that the meat patty was bigger than the bun, I enjoyed that meat hanging out on the sides mmmmm yum!The Angus beef so juicy, flavorful and literally was running down my mouth and chin. They make a messy burger and they have plenty of napkins available on the tables. If a burger is not messy then it is not a well made burger!We also ordered smashfries to share which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic, mmmm delicious as well.This was truly a treat for our lunch today! I enjoyed it very much along with the Outstanding service we received from Andy and the crew!We will be back! They have a burger worth sucking silly and I want to do it again!Our total for two burgers, two drinks and fries was $25 after my coupon for my free burger it brought it down to $18. Had a great lunch, tried a new place and saved some money! WIN WIN WIN!Thank you for the happy ending Smashburger, my tummy thanks you! :)Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.Lots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.Re-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#afd8gM9iwR4AZ1mcdECpygI think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my "Berger knows Burgers" list, http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).The Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRwIn summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of "Smash", "Sizzle", and "Savor" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country.I have been torn about trying Smashburger since some of the reviews for their locations have been less than smashing.  Last night, we decided to try something different and decided to try Smashburger.I looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.Sarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.A short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.I'm not going to make Smashburger a regular on my rotation schedule, but it was good enough that I'll be back sometime.  I need to try the nutter butter shake.This place is a good location,but during lunch you have to park far away because, it is a little crazy. That is OK because,you need to walk after all those Calories right.  The staff is friendly and very helpful. Since I had never been before they explained everything very nicely.The menu is quite large for a burger joint. I got the Mushroom Burger sin mayo. It was very good. The fries are so so.Next time I will try the Sweet potato fries or the Smashfries. They look interesting.Prices are not too bad at all and the place is very clean. Which is very good!In reading the menu I see you can even build your own Burger.Choosing your own type of Bun as well. It only took 10 min to get my items to go! I thought that was pretty good as the place was packed and they make it all from Scratch.I have driven by it 100's of time,so now I am glad that I finally stopped to check it out.I've been a big fan of the Smash*burgers* for a while. The Arizona burger with jalape√±os is one of a kind for quickie burger joints like this one. Add on a side of smash fries and I walk away a happy carnivore nearly every time.The other night, I gave the Arizona Grilled Chicken a try. The meat was surprisingly good for grilled. Cooked through. What made it remarkable were the spicy toppings. I don't consider myself a "heat wimp" but the peppers had me chugging coke after each bite. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but I was still satisfied with my choice. Aside: One of the cashiers was quite pleasant while the other guy, who took or order, acted like it was forced labor. Or, like he was too good for taking burger orders, literally taking a long swig of his beverage as we concluded our order. Smashburger is not the best of the best in terms of burger establishments, but for the speed and price, it does the trick.Sorry kids , I  have to give this one a just okay .  nothinbg terrible about the taste but nothing mind blowing as well.  And a word to the wise the smashburger Fries are dripped with a rosemary grease. Now rosemary grease I am sure has a place somewhere in fooddom...but I am thinking it's not on the plain fries. YThe burger was okay , tasted like the kind dear mother used to make , fried on a skillet. Hmmm  for 9 bucks ..not my thing. Oh and heads up ..one size on the togo cups....and it's not big.I have been dying to try this place because I am a big fan of the burger. I will keep this review very simple for you. Three wordsOversaltedOverpricedOverratedCheeseburger, fries and drink at Smashburger= $10Cheeseburger, fries and drink at In n Out= $ 6.59How's that for simple?Found a BOGO deal and I wouldn't come roaring back here based on what we ordered.  What we had was OK but OK just doesn't cut it in a town full of great burger choices. Got the Spicy Baja which was described on the menu as with "pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalape√±os on a spicy chipotle bun."  Not spicy enough for me.  People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.I liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with "fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun." I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.  What's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?  A plate would've been better.  I found them awkward.  Stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off something without holes.As Austin Powers would say, "Smashing baby, yeah!"I have tried every one of their burgers and my favorite is the Spicy Baja! With that said, for you noobs and/or connisseurs, your perfect starting burger and sidekick should be the All-American or Classic Burger and Smash Fries.All their burgers are made from 100 percent angus beef and come in two sizes. Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.The fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.For a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.comService is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. Random story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.

Review Text :
Sometimes I just want a slice (or two!) of pizza.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing wood-fired or artisan.  No three hour wait.  No ingredients I can't pronounce.  Just pizza.  Pizza with puffy crust, red sauce and gooey cheese.  That's it.That said, I was looking forward to the opening of this Barro's location, as it is within lunchtime range of my office.  Thanks to Alexander C's review, I knew that the 'Coming Soon' sign finally changed to 'Now Open'.  Yay!  To be sure this new location was just as good as the other Barro's that I have grown to love, I had to try out a couple of pepperoni slices.  After all, quality control is important, right?  I am happy to say the 'za was warm, soft and cheesy - just what I wanted.

Review Text :
I feel like less of a person for being a resident of the South Mountain community and having eaten at the Secret Garden for the first time last night.    My friends took me here for a  birthday dinner......they had made reservations and had a table set up for our group that seated us comfortably.  The service was IMPECCABLE and the food.....oh the food.....was so ridiculously good that I have no words.   I'm sad that there were only two other tables in there the entire time that we were there, for  a total of four more people.    This place is easily the best restaurant on the south side of Phoenix...potentially to include downtown.   Frankly, this made for an even bettter experience for my group - but I don't want this place to close.Highly recommended.  A+.   Go.I came here for lunch and what a pleasant surprise.4 stars for atmosphere. This is an old house (hence the name) set amongst a garden right around the corner from the Farm and South Mountain. This reminds of a place in Napa that you'd stop in for. A nice, rural out of town feel not to far from central Phoenix.While there was nothing on the menu that immediately jumped out at me, I settle for a ham and cheese sandwich. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! And the sweet potato chips were a fantastic side considering that I HATE AND DESPISE sweet potatoes.The salads and greens all look amazing. I will definitely be back.I've been to this restaurant for lunch usually, but I stopped in for dinner on their "famous" patio.  Here's my take on this place.Service:  Incredibly professional and wonderful staff.  Every time I have gone, the staff's attention to my every need and concern was a priority to every single person that I have encountered.  I can not say enough of how professional their staff is.Food:  again, wonderful food that bursts with flavor.  I've had several things here to eat, my favorites are the polenta fries and the Wild Boar sausage with the pasta (I forgot the name on the menu) - incredibly delicious and bursting with a warm exotic flavor that is both satisfying and filling.  I have also enjoyed a popular dish there, the shrimp and grits.  This dish was ok for me, I think it could be better if the items on top of the grits were all placed in the middle with the cheese.  Patio:  this is why I give them a. 4.  Needs live soft music on the weekends.   The ambiance is a bit dry without it.The name says it all. This truly is a house in a secret garden. Hiding within a working farm, The House is true farm to table. It's intimately hidden within a large orchard filled with well-grown trees and it's hard to believe you're in Phoenix. The patio is a perfect place to dine on a nice night or breezy day, and the indoor seating area is just as charming. Believe it or not, my favorite thing to get here is their burger. Their burger is freshly made and tastes delicious with every bite. Their salads are also delightful. You really can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Make sure you try anything pumpkin that they offer during the fall season. Note that as you're driving to The House, you'll question whether you're going the right way. You are. It's just that hidden!Who doesn't like secret gardens?  Especially secret gardens that are lovely, romantic with food that is charmingly delectable!   You don't even feel like you are right next to a large city with a farm and South Mountain as a backdrop.  I made a reservation on the patio because my sister was in town from the Bay Area and I knew she would want to enjoy our warm AZ weather and watch the sunset.  Honestly if you are coming here I would just sit outside, the house is cute, but the patio is much better.  The server placed us in a perfect spot shaded by palms overlooking the koi pond and not far from the fire!  Gentlemen, talk about a place to bring a hot date, would definitely set the mood for me!  But, it was also perfect to laugh and catch up with the sister too!  We ordered a cheese board to start and a bottle of Salneval Albarino to cleanse the pallet!  I HIGHLY recommend the Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese!  I am not even a cheesy kind of person, but I could eat a whole wheel of that stuff.  This is going to sound funny, but I came to this lovely restaurant with a big black/purple/blue/violet eye-cheek from an accident and trust me for the last 2 weeks I had been getting domestic violence and thug looks from various 'service providers'...  Well our waitress Megan didn't even bat an eye at my whacked face and my glorious bruise was even on her serving side!  So extra bonus points for that, which is why I rounded my 4.5 star rating up to 5 instead of down to 4.So after asking our poor server a million questions about the menu, because it is really hard to decide, as everything looks good and unique, we finally ordered.  I opted for the seasonal house special: hand made ravioli.  It was a spinach ravioli topped with an interesting lemon cream sauce, with almonds on top.  The raviolis were delicious, the sauce was quite good, and the almonds brought it all together.  I think I was expecting a little bit more POW to the dish, but it was still very unique and delicious.  I have to say my sister chose the right dish!  The New York strip with Red Chimichurri Sauce is AMAZING!  The thing they don't tell you on the menu is it comes in a corn puree of sorts that is mouthwatering!!! See picture.  It sounds weird to go with a steak, but it completely made the dish and set that steak apart from your typical steak at a nice restaurant.  I was actually trying to talk my sis into one of the other dishes and she trumped me...I am glad she did!!  The corn puree sauce was so good we asked the server what was in it and she said she would ask the chef who was in house.  She wrote the recipe on a note for us!! Sorry I promised not to divulge her secrets.  But the last ingredient was cute:  Love :)If you are skimming just do the following:  Sit on the patio, select Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese on the cheese board, somebody order the steak.  You will come back for more and if you are on a date you will get lucky!

Restaurant name  Bliss ReBAR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The place is simply beautiful. The venue spans two buildings. The North building is Bliss (restaurant) and to the south is ReBar (the bar). You can go back and froth between the two venues (with your drinks in hand). And you can't beat the view of Downtown from their circular bar that is outside. There is also a beautiful full bar in the building to the South.  We were served some samples of the Coconut Chicken and Sausage Ravioli and they were freakin great (at the "VIP" pre-view event we got invited to). But I can't speak to anything else on the menu.The menu looks Damn good. And although the prices aren't cheap they do look fairly reasonable. Certainly better then what was here previously (FATE). The drink prices also seem reasonable ($4 for bottled beer and $5 for most draft).The hamburgers buns are made of pretzel dough and they also have Mac & Cheese (with Chicken and Bacon) both of which I'm dying to try.And the best of all, the place is 3 blocks from our house so I'm very excited to try the full menu.A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently "comfort food" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the "vip opening." c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.I don't like the food that I've had here so far. the fries are just plain disappointing. they play awful, terrible popular music that makes me want to slit my wrists. the music is interspersed with several-second gaps between songs, so my friend's slightly aghast exclamation ("i would *never* shave it!") echoes throughout the bar and garners our party some awkward glances. the reason(s) i'm offering Bliss/reBAR 3 stars is b/c of the bar staff and the drink prices (at the bar, specials seem to be different on the restaurant side).I like the bar's space, other than the echo issue (get some local art on your walls,  your neighbors will love you for it), and will return, but it would really make it easier and more enjoyable if they actually played good music.This review is strictly for reBAR, because I did not eat at Bliss. I very rarely give out one star ratings, but I very rarely get terrible service. I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables.I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, "you will wait your turn" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service.I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back.Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. Eggplant.Ohhhhkay then. It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. Just UGH in every way.I used a groupon for lunch at this place which was a smoking deal. And I really wanted to like it. I really did. But unfortunately the food was just not good. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The tortilla was very dry which made the whole thing fall apart. I had to cut it up and eat it with a fork. And if it wasn't for a few drops of buffalo sauce that I saw but couldn't taste, I probably would have sent it back thinking it wasn't what I ordered. It didn't taste like it had any sauce what-so-ever in it. I would've guessed it was a grilled chicken wrap with no sauce. And the little "salad" that came on the side was more like some leaves of lettuce with a drop of oil on them. There was no flavor at all!This place does deserve some credit for the atmosphere. The place is super cute and the service was good. All of the staff was very friendly and I really liked the feel of the place. Which made it even more upsetting the food didn't match the ambiance. But I will give this place another try. Maybe in the evening because it looks like it might be a cool place to chill and have a drink!I have been to Bliss Rebar a couple of times now. It is a pretty cool place in Roosevelt district.  Every time we have come the services has been great.  The servers are pretty quick and our drinks are always full.  Every day they have a $3.00 cocktail drink and the happy hour specials are pretty inexpensive too.  So far the Mac & Cheese and the Meatloaf sandwich are really good.  I know I will be back to try more.  If you are ever in the Roosevelt district during First Friday or just in the area, you should try at Bliss Rebar.The food is amazing, especially anything on their pretzel buns.  The staff is all very friendly and dangerously close to too good looking.Most places I frequent I end up finding one dish they make that I just stick to.  I can't do that here, with the exception of the Shrimp BLT I have loved everything I've tried and can't pick a favorite.  Try anything on a pretzel bun, you won't be disappointed.The wife and I have been here enough times for me to write a real review of Bliss, and ReBAR for that matter. I've been for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, for drinks. I've been on a Monday, a Tuesday, probably a Friday or two, likely Saturday and definitely a Sunday. Heck, lets just throw in Wednesday and Thursday for good measure.It's the type of neighborhood bar where every one knows your name, as long as you happen to know everybody who's there that is. One of the best Macaroni and Cheeses in town - the best? perhaps, you should judge them on that one for yourself. The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are poured 'well' ;-), the food always comes out tasty, and the friends are always here. What else could you really need?I wouldn't exactly call this a dance venue, but there's generally always dance music playing in the bar and on the patio over the weekends; I've seen some people get down. They've got a cool patio for brunch when it's nice outside, an interesting outdoor bar with heat lamps for those chilled "winter" evenings, and indoor dining in the bar as well as the restaurant.FYI, this is a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), so if you're looking to pickup on the opposite sex, you might have some trouble with that here, but it's a great spot for gathering with your friends.Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)"Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." ‚Äï Ron Swanson, Parks and RecreationRich women?  Diets!?  That's why I had a Bloody Mary with lunch.  #WerkBitchStrolled in for a lunch date with four guys because I'm a pimp and boy were things hot!  It was 111¬∞F outside and it felt about 90¬∞F inside.  Ick!  Anyways, it seemed like a slow day inside the bar area which was great since there was only one or two people working.  Drinks were ordered, food was ordered, and a lot of waiting ensued.  I'm the type that like to sip at a drink throughout my meal but the wait was so long that I was staring down an empty glass, olives eaten, before my macaroni and cheese was out.  The food was delicious.  Cheesy gooey goodness!  I had ordered another drink to go with my meal after Tom D. tempted me... that seducer!  I ordered a Strawberries & Champagne and what I got was a super flat Shirley Temple.  Where's the bubbles?  The champagne!?  I couldn't even taste the vodka.  After a few tiny sips, I abandoned it.  Tom had it sent back since I wasn't feeling it and it was taken off my bill.  One of our lunch companions also received the wrong order and had to endure another torturous wait before getting his sandwich.  I had originally wanted to try the cr√®me br√ªl√©e but with our meal quickly approaching the two-hour mark, it just wasn't worth it.  And so we left!Service was so-so.  Granted, there was only one true worker but they should hire at least one other person to help. The food was delicious but the cocktails were a let-down [did our Bloody Marys even have vodka in it!?].   I was digging the Lana del Rey tunes though and the ambiance was nice.  Also, please turn on that A/C.  It's the desert!  My make-up was melting!   Bliss is more on the 3.5 stars side.

Restaurant name  Maryanne's Breakfast & Lunch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I adore these little out of the way places that most people never realize exist.  According to our waitress, Maryanne's has been in business for 30 years.  It seems implausible considering that I grew up a few towns over and had never known of its existence until yesterday.Primarily a restaurant serving area truckers (and there are a ton, considering Stowe Twp. is Pittburgh's industrial mecca), this place is as hometown blue collar 'Burgh as you can get.  That's what I loved so much about Maryanne's.  The food is simple breakfast/lunch fare.  Typical breakfast options (eggs, meats, toast, waffles, french toast, omelettes, and potatoes), but in ginormous portions!  A whole back menu of breakfast and lunch hoagies.  Our waitress, Evelyn, informed us that the place is packed with truckers and day laborers in the morning. They get their MASSIVE hoagies and eat half, saving the rest for lunch.  After seeing these hoagies (of which I had a hard time even eating half), I completely understand.  Btw, the hoagie was tasty, fresh, and on Mancini's bread... yum!Other than that, this place is set up like a truck stop out west - with a Pittsburgh flair of course.  Little gnomes, fountains, decorative brick-a-brack, random benches and outdoor seating, etc.  The bathroom is around the side, but it's not an "outhouse"; Clean too!  Our waitress looked like a trucker herself, and had a gruff friendly demeanor.  She was awesome!  The coffee is serve yourself and the homemade iced tea comes in a giant pitcher which is left at the table.  You'll see lots of local color.  Oh, and it's cash only.Go here!  Immerse yourself in the culture of Pittsburgh.  And, get some really tasty eats!

This place is 5 stars good but the walk through the smoky ass casino is gonna cost them a star. My meal and I'd order the exact same thing again was some complimentary fresh baked bread, a side salad with some of the best Italian dressing I've had and the most excellent clam linguini in red sauce (the red sauce was a tip from the waiter).  The piano guy playing in the background was a nice touch.

Restaurant name  Island Paradise Jamaican Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Ya mon'. Sorry, I couldn't resist. So the location might appear a lil' shady or eclectic, depending on your perception. It's nestled in a little strip mall near some empty suites, Club Kiss, Red Door and some kinda ahem, 'gentlemans' club. My kinda place? Eh, who cares, the food's good.So I've been a long time fan of Carribean food and Jamaican curry has always been one of my faves. Jerk Chicken is great when it's done right and I think Island Paradise does it right. Nicely spiced, both spiced and spicy, chopped up with a big cleaver (bones and all), and piled right on top of rice and beans, cabbage, plantains or even mac n cheese (huh). Yum.

Review Text :
Asia meets Europe. Das sagen zwar viele, aber das Konzept ist extrem durchdacht. Asiatische W√ºrzmethoden verbunden mit europ√§ischen Garpunkten und eine absolute Frische der Produkte.Mittags gibt es "nur" das Mittagsmen√º f√ºr 25,80 f√ºr 3 G√§nge. Aber was f√ºr welche. Das hat mich echt umgehauen. Auf der Karte sieht das unspektakul√§r aus, weil man sich hier dem Trend zu hochtrabenden Wortspielereien verschlie√üt, sondern mehr oder weniger die Produkte aufz√§hlt die verwendet werden. Das klingt lieblos, aber die Ergebnisse sind meilenweit davon entfernt.Als Vorspeise hat ich eine Stubek√ºkenbrust (hauchzart) auf einem Bett von Perlgraupen mit Mango, Sellerie etc. Top angerichtet, top gew√ºrzt (ich tr√§um jetzt noch davon).Als Hauptspeise hatte ich (bretonischen) Seeteufel auf einem Hummerschaum mit winzigen Pfifferlingen und unglaublichen Schupfnudeln. So etwas habe ich noch nicht gegessen. (Ich glaube da war auch etwa Vanille drin)Als Dessert gab es Ingwereis (toll), Passionsfrucht, Schokomousse und ein weiteres Eis (das ich vergessen habe und auch nicht auf der Karte stand)Herr Stiegele ist ein bescheidener und angenehmer Gastgeber mit dem man prima auch √ºber kulinarisches plaudern kann,In der K√ºche steht seine Frau, die diese unglaublichen Geschmacksexplosionen zaubert.Baden meets Thai. Eine wunderbare Kombination. Mein neues Lieblingslokal in Karlsruhe.Ein Wehrmutstropfen sei nicht verschwiegen. Es gibt keine feste Karte, sondern eben nur die jeweilige Tageskarte. Daf√ºr aber mit topfrischen Produkten. Anders kann man so etwas nicht darstellen. (Die Alternative ist eben, dass alles aus dem Gefrierschrank kommt. Das gibt es schon zuviel auf der Welt.)

Happy Buffet should change their name to happy 420 buffet, cause they are a stoner's paradise.a gajillion different options, and all of which were delicious and not greasy in the least!I walked in the door with my best friend, who resembles the most accurate real life depiction of james franco's character in Pineapple Express, and we were shocked to see almost no one inside! It was a buffet ghost town! sad news for the owners, great news for my belly!I shoveled lbs of tasty grub into my craw! plate after plate, the few people working there smiled uneasily as I'd gotten up and waddled to the buffet for my third go round. coconut shrimp, pork shumai, drunken chicken and mushrooms, garlic string beans, crab legs, you name it, it was probably there. As I finally reached my breaking point, I thought of Adam Richman, and my loathing for him turned to a begrudging understanding, I'd fought that buffet with a relentless intensity that only his fat sweaty brow could fathom, and I'd won. A quick victory lap to the soft serve machine and we left conquerors like two young mongols after the sacking of some prosperous northern chinese village. When I got home I looked in the mirror to survey the damage done, I resembled a starving ugandan child with skinny limbs and bloated stomache, only I wasnt starving I was sickeningly full! Come to Happy Buffet and be prepared to make a cow of yourself!USA!!USA!!USA!!godblessamericalandthatilovestandbesideherandguideherwithahmmsomethingsomethingfromabove!!

Restaurant name  SEA: The Thai Experience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The food at SEA is definitely good.  I don't know if it really is worth the price you pay for it though.  I never thought I'd pay $16 for Pad See Eiw ever.  Most Thai places only charge about $8, and in Thailand $1.50.  Seems like an overpriced Thai restaurant to me, kind of like P.F. Chang's is to Chinese restaurants.  In any case, the food here is delicious, price may not be a deterrent if lady luck is rolling with you in Las Vegas.The decor of this place is surprisingly trendy, especially since it's located inside an older Bally's casino.  There are nice tables beside a pool of water that centerpieces a nice Buddha statue.  Pretty cool for a Buddhist, like myself, to see such a remembrance of belief.  The restaurant looks very much like a few Sukhumvit restaurants and lounges I've gone to in Bangkok.  The bubble seats, in particular, that hang from a ceiling mount at the entrance reminded me of the trendy & cool Bangkok nightlife.  Personally, I just like sitting on them.My family and I ordered:Pad See Eiw w/ Chicken - $16Chicken Wing Lollipops - $9Green Curry w/ Chicken - $17Queen of Thai Basil w/ Beef - $16Tamarind Whole Fish (tilapia) - $32Everything tasted great.  Even, what I thought, was an overpriced Pad See Eiw had my mouth drooling for more.  The tamarind-chili sauce from the tilapia was exceptionally tasty.  I poured a lot of that saucy goodness all over my white rice.  Combining the sauce to an already aromatic jasmine rice made it even better.A note of warning though, SEA charges 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I didn't really like that since I thought the service was mediocre at best.  Fifteen percent would have sufficed since our waters were not refilled even once.  And, I'll be damned if I order another $5 Thai Ice Tea.  Anyways, I'll come here again if the dice are rolling my way or if I want to bring a date to a nice looking restaurant, otherwise I prefer to go to a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant on Spring Mountain Road that's just as good.She sells seashells by the seashorehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/personLiving out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.

The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.

The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight dealYelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #14 - #365My family was craving for some Asian food and did not want to walk too far from the hotel. So we found the SEA Thai Restaurant just across from rj hotel elevators. I never heard of this restaurant in Bally's so I'm assuming it just recently opened. The wait was around 15-25 minutes and the inside looked full, so it must be that good. The decor was modern and also had a small fountain inside the restaurant. I love love Thai food with their different uses of curry on their entrees and chicken barbecue. Lighting was pretty dim and I see they were going for an intimate setting. Flat screens were around the dining area and was Putin the Vevo channel with no sound. The food had taken about 30 - 45 minutes because it was so busy. Speaking of food, the chicken barbecue, curry beef, spicy rice and pad Thai were all a hit. It reminded me of the small Thai restaurant not too far from our place that serves good food. Our waitress forgot to fill up our waters and we were so thirsty after eating he spicy curry beef. The prices were typical for a Vegas strip hotel at $$$. I wouldn't call this place fancy and I have eaten at fancy eateries in Vegas. I would rate SEA Thai in the middle. I prefer to go to China town for some cheap eats compared to eating in the strip.This place sucks now! 2 years ago they had a Vietnamese menu with pho, vermicelli, rice plates and bun rieu. They changed their menu and we asked the server about the old menu, he said (in broken English) the chef "went away" (we thought he said "ran away")... And that's exactly what we should have done when we heard that there's a new chef! RUN AWAY NOW!! They still have Vietnamese pho but more Thai now. The WORST pho ever! My sister found a hair AND a bug in her soup! She asked them to take it back and they took forever for another one, she wasn't hungry after waiting another 30 minutes for pho. My other sister found a hair net in hers but she decided to just eat it. The pho was lukewarm, the broth was salty and since it wasn't even hot the meat didn't cook and it stayed raw. My friend asked if they could just microwave her pho for it to be hot and cook the meat, again it took forever. How long does it take to microwave it? The only good dish was the drunken noodles, which wasn't exactly hot as well. We also got the seafood soup and it was cold, and too sweet. It's like they let it sit out... I don't think the chefs in the back are actually chefs, they probably hired a chef school drop out... I mean, pho soup should be hot, not lukewarm. You probably wondering, why are we getting pho on the strip? And not go to china town... We didn't have cars and were hungover and SEA is across from our hotel, trust me, paying $21 dollars for nasty ass cold pho with hair and bugs was not what we were looking for... This place should close down, it's a disgrace to Pho restaurants out there. I'm ashamed that I ate this.

Getting an RSVP at one of Montreal's best restaurants has become difficult. Liverpool House? Three-week wait. Le Hangar? Sure there's room, if you want to eat before 5:30pm or after 10:30pm. Bremner? No matter how early you plan, making an RSVP is difficult if no one answers the phone or calls you back - well done on joining Opentable. Ah yes, planning a night out is currently necessary even in Montreal, especially since popular restaurant trends promote smaller, cozier, bustling restaurants that fill up fast.That's how I finally ended up at Tuck Shop. I've wanted to try this place for a while, so I called a week early to reserve for a group, and opted for the dinner-table-style menu that includes 4 appetizers and 2 mains (a steal at $45 per person). A taste of everything for everyone? Aww yeahhh.We started with a salad - white beets, coriander, mango, arugula, radish, cucumbers and parmesan. It was yummy and refreshing, especially with the tart lemony dressing.Next, we had the most delicious smoked salmon ever. At Tuck Shop, the salmon is wild, house cured and smoked, and comes with "potato rosti", trout caviar and cr√®me fraiche. And I repeat - delicious.Our third appetizer consisted of cheese tacos. Made with fried mozzarella, coriander, corn and lettuce, they were soft and delightful. Awesome, because tacos can easily be flavourless. It might be surprising, but it's true.Our last appetizer included caramelized salmon with bok choy, root veggies and quinoa. The salmon was crispy on the outside and prepared to the point of a perfect soft pink on the inside. The veggies were cooked but crunchy. Delish.Having forgotten how many dishes were included in our menu, we thought our meal was over. Lo and behold, the waitress came over to tell us that our mains were on their way. Oh baby! These included the most mouthwatering jerk chicken accompanied by black bean pur√©e and fried okra. It was spicy and juicy and everything jerk chicken should be. Perfection.Finally, our last main consisted of hanger steak with chimichurri, wild mushrooms and rapini. Again, so good. And the best part? We didn't even have to say "medium-rare".We wrapped up our meal with three delicious desserts to share. Tiramisu, warm apple pie, and caramel fleur de sel "cheesecake". The tiramisu was good, but not something to rave about. It's ok - a tiny bit of sub-perfection makes Tuck Shop human. The apple pie was amazing - warm and so satisfying with its crumbly crust and just-sweet-enough apple center.  Needless to say, our favorite was the caramel fleur de sel "cheesecake" that was more of a silken cheesy-caramel-y-salty-cream than a cheesecake. Whoa.Yes, I absolutely loved Tuck Shop. It made me think of a smaller Orignal and a non-pretentious Garde Manger. The music was super fun (Tom Petty and Gypsy Kings, anyone?) and added to the bon-vivant vibe that permeated the small restaurant. The service was good and the food was varied and delicious. I do hope that Tuck Shop's tables continue to be difficult to book for a while - it would certainly be well deserved.Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere 9.5/10, Pretty people 9/10, Music (superfun, goodvolume) 9.5/10, Service 8.5/10.Pictures: http://www.belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/tuck-shop/What an incredible meal I just had last night at Tuck Shop! After a long wait to finally try this place out, I managed to snag a table for four just a couple of days before we wanted to come by. For starters, the team at this resto is probably one of the friendliest, most hospitable I've found in Montreal! The service was perfect: approachable but professional.Taking a look at the one-page menu I spotted starter items like beef tartare (a must), market salad, fresh burrata, cured salmon with homemade tzatziki, crispy pork belly,  just to name a few. Reading over the mains: Rib Eye steak, Ricotta Gnocchi, Duck Magret, Arctic Char, Hanger Steak, all served with fresh, seasonal sides -- a very tough decision! Our group decided to start with the Beef Tartare, Cured Salmon, and Crispy Pork Belly. Boy, did we clean off the plates! The beef tartare is served with a type of celeriac slaw and matchstick fries with aioli. Incredibly delicious! The salmon was oh-so delicate, served with paper-thin crisps and veggies, and the homemade tzatziki was just right. The Pork Belly (an obvious hit at the table) was out of this world! A cube of perfectly crisped pork belly served in a creamy morel sauce -- a dish that will remain in your memory.On to the mains. Dishes ordered around the table included a 16oz Rib Eye steak, the Duck Magret, and Arctic Char. As I couldn't decide which main to order since it all sounded incredible, I let our waitress surprise me. The Rib Eye was a beautiful cut, cooked to perfection (medium), and served on a creamy bed of mashed potatoes with a side of grilled Quebec Asparagus. I'm not a big meat lover but this dish was perfect! I could not say anything less about the duck that my friend ordered. It was served with a sort of fresh, citrus salad which balanced out the gaminess of the duck amazingly. Also, cooked to perfection. My first time actually trying arctic char, and definitely not the last, this dish was not lacking in taste. My surprise dish was their homemade Ricotta Gnocchi served with a very hearty vegetarian "bolognese" sauce consisting of carrots, mushrooms, etc. -- meat was not missed on this dish! The portion was spot on as gnocchi tends to be very filling. Fresh shaved parmesan was a great addition.Of course, a meal this flawless must include dessert -- especially if said dessert is homemade by "la maman de Theo"! One of our party was celebrating a birthday. The waitress brought out an incredible platter of brownies, apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and a pot of (if I remember correctly) caramel cheesecake. We enjoyed these desserts with some dessert wine and porto. Honestly, this whole meal was so perfect and I'm certain that my dinner mates would agree. I cannot encourage anyone more to dine at Tuck Shop as it really is an experience -- from the service to the atmosphere to the perfect food reflective of what is in season....Go! I must add that I am a big fan of creative cooking with ingredients that reflect local produce and seasonal ingredients. All over each of our dishes we could spot in-season asparagus and fiddleheads (or t√™tes de violon as they are called in French) -- loved it! Please, do yourelf and someone special a favour and go eat here if you haven't been yet. And, if you have, go again since the menu changes often! (Note: I would say that the price range is about $$ - $$$ depending on how many dishes you order & wine. For our group of four with one bottle of wine @ 44$, four starters, four mains, dessert and digestifs, the total was about 80$/person w/ tip. I would have gladly paid more than that for the meal that I had! The dishes are well-priced as is the wine list.)

I don't know about you, but a move is not complete without pizza delivered. Recently I moved and just didn't have the energy to make anything to eat or go anywhere. I remembered getting Jet's Pizza coupons in the mail and decided to give them a try.They do a fast delivery! I got a basic special: pizza, breadsticks, and wings. It was all so good...greasy like crazy, but delicious! They have a great price point, deliver, and make my taste buds happy, what more can I say?I live in a pizza Bermuda triangle where almost all my options are chain stores.  I'm outside the delivery areas of Intermezzo, Libretto's (both locations), Pure Pizza, etc. *shakes fist*  The few non-chain places that deliver (looking at you, Wolfman) fail to impress.Jet's Pizza was my last ditch effort to find good delivery pizza.  The reviews were good, the website was decent, and I could order online.  Looked promising.  Everything went smoothly until it came time for the actual delivery.My apartment complex is gated, so you have to ring a call box and be buzzed through.  The delivery guy reached me on the call box and I hit the number on my phone to allow him in. I am literally (proper use) the first building on the right after passing the gate.  It takes a car 10 seconds at most to get to us.10 minutes go by.  No pizza.  No sign of the car outside my window.15 minutes go by.  No pizza.  I call the pizza place and ask where their guy is.  The manager said he hadn't gotten into my complex and was still waiting outside.  I politely corrected him by saying I had successfully buzzed the dude through.  The manager would give him another call and see what was happening.20 minutes passes.  I called the restaurant again.  The manager was getting irritated with me and gave me attitude, as if it were my fault that the driver couldn't find my apartment.  In an antagonistic fashion he finally barked, "What, you want a credit?"At this point I gave up hope on getting a hot pizza.  Or a pizza at all.  "Sure," I replied.  Manager confirmed the credit and hung up.  25 minutes later, I hear a knock at my door.His excuse, "My GPS took me the wrong way."  Normally I would have given him the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I had written turn-by-turn instructions on how to get to my house on the order.  I could see them printed out on the ticket he had in his hand.  The one he chose to ignore for 25 minutes.A 10 second trip past a gate became a 25 minute odyssey of crappy customer service and lame excuses. It's a real shame because when I finally tried the pizza it wasn't bad for lukewarm deep dish.  Even with a credit waiting for me I'd be hard pressed to give them another chance.  Crap customer service always leaves a bad taste no matter how good the food.

Mattie's deserves another star...why?Fantastic flapjacks, folks. Freakin' fantastic. I kid you not, I indulged in one of the best breakfasts I've had in quite some time. I'm a total pain in the ass and ordered my flapjacks with more toppings than a deluxe pizza. Yes, I went with flapjacks with bananas, pecans and chocolate chips. It was a mass of amazing. The flapjacks were chock full of those delicious morsels, light and fluffy on the inside and had a nice, light crisp on the outside. Oh, and let's not forget the sausage patties. Taaaaasty little patties, they were. I have been thinking about those pancakes every morning. Thanks Matties, now in addition to your incredible milkshakes I'm now addicted to your flapjacks. Hello my name is Nicole and I am a Mattie's flapjack addict.How have I not reviewed Mattie's before?! I'm pretty much a regular over at Mattie's Diner and have had lunch there plenty of times. The service is always on point and friendly - never had to wait more than the standard time to receive my food which is basically unheard of. I tend to always get the Big Holla with tomato, which is a massive grilled cheese... no no, understand the word massive. This is definitely a big kid grilled cheese and it is STUFFED with cheese. As soon as you pull apart the sandwich the cheese is falling off the slices. Awesome sauce. I also dig the California wrap (I think that's what it's called) which is actually served on a pita and not a wrap. But it's turkey, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce and tomato. Also a winner and tastes fresh every time. I tend to pair these with either the mashed potatoes or the mac and cheese, which also doesn't skimp on the cheese and as an avid cheese lover, hey, I appreciate that, Mattie's! Another favorite is the buffalo dip - mighty tasty although the dip is a bit runny and I prefer my dips a bit more thicker but still worth an order. All in all, if it is your first time remember it is an old-fashioned diner which means it's a bit small and the grill cooks are right in front of you cooking up your order - which doesn't bother me but just a heads up. The diner is open 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays so great for a late night bite after running around the Music Factory. They also served about 8 selections of bottled beers and about a dozen different milkshakes as well. Nice  : )It's been awhile since I ate here. We stopped by on Sunday for lunch because I was craving breakfast food. I was expecting more expensive menu but was surprised to find a breakfast plate for $4.99. It was the SOS, the gravy on toasts caught my eyes. I live and die for sausage gravy and theirs was pretty good. They layered half a toast and half a sauage pattie and covered it with gravy with 2 eggs on the side. Lots of food for the price. The picky eater ordered wings, and the wings are of good size. Our lunch tab was less than $15 for 2 people, not bad not bad. The service was good as well, and it seems like they have a good crowd of regulars. I may just have to come here more often.

I've often used the word Chinamerican to help describe food being made at some Chinese restaurants. This type Americanized Chinese cookery usually includes the same suspects like sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, lo mein and can be found pretty much anywhere except Old Town Scottsdale. Now the owners of Geisha A Go Go and Stingray Sushi have opened another Asian concept capturing the essence of Chinamerican, Jimmy Woo's. While cool and modern inside, they somehow managed to pay homage to the type of Chinese restaurants I knew when I was a kid. There are no white and pink table cloths here but the half moon shaped black leather booths, dim lighting and old school Chinese menu evokes a 70's mod vibe. Be sure to check out the enormous abacus, it'll be the largest you'll ever see. Outdoors, Woo's has a fantastic patio that faces Scottsdale Road which is great for people watching.Woo's offers a daily happy hour that starts at 3pm, which gets you drink discounts and a well priced small plates menu. Offerings such as plump and juicy Pan Fried Pork Dumplings ($4) and a plate full of fork tender, lightly fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($5.25) are stand outs. If you pair these with a carafe of hot Sake ($4), happy hour could be a meal in of itself.Looking over you'll notice that it's all about the classics and these classics are done pretty well, starting with Hot and Sour Soup ($5.95). Yes this is on every single Chinese menu around town but Woo's version adds tofu, mushrooms, egg, bamboo and chicken making for a hearty robust soup. Be sure to ask for some chili paste, the nose clearing effect is like tasty medicine. After one bite of the Chinese Chicken Salad ($8.95), you couldn't help but notice that while well dressed in a peanut ginger dressing, it lacked any sort of flavor punch. Made with napa cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, snap peas and scallions then topped with fried noodles and almonds, the ingredients were vibrant and fresh. Hopefully they reconfigure their dressing since the added brightness from citrus juice or vinegar can be key to taking ho-hum to wow. Slightly crispy, tender, sweet and sour tossed with bits of chili and citrus peel, the Orange Beef ($13.95) was decent. For me this is what Asian style cooking is all about, appealing to many of my senses without any one being overwhelmed. However on another visit this dish was so overly sweetened and gloopy that it was pretty much inedible. Different chef?I thought it was funny the veggie only, Eggplant with Tofu and Mushroom ($15) dish was one of the most expensive on the menu. Don't get me wrong, this dish was tasty with its slightly sweet sauce and well cooked vegetables it's just priced oddly high. I found it  funny that many of the shrimp and scallop dishes are priced less than this one. Go figure. Jimmy Woo's may woo you with its sophisticated yet fun atmosphere, but for me it was the friendly service and their ability to make Chinese hip and cool. I only wish the food was as hip and cool.

On my way to the Classic Gaming Expo at the Tropicana Hotel I decided to stop by this deli for lunch while I waited for a friend of mine to show up.  I ordered the Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye and a side of Fries.The place wasn't too busy, but it took forever to get my order.....it was pretty slow.  I knocked off 1 Star for that.  The Pastrami Sandwich was very good and the Fries were a little too salty and nothing to write home about.The prices here are pretty high, I paid $15 for a Sandwich, Fries, and a bottle of Water....ouch!  At least the Sandwich was good, otherwise I'd be a little pissed.Will I return?  Maybe.

This place is a little like the white kid in Scottsdale who listens to way too much rap.  It's in AZ center which will always have a pretty corporate feel.  Second it's in the old Pizzeria Uno and there was enough of the old decor left to still feel like one.  They did do some updates and the bar looks great, but the updates do just enough to make it feel like it's trying to be something other than what it appears.  The music that was playing was great and I heard plenty that was on the playlist I had going before I walked in.The service was fair.  It started off a little spotty but quickly picked up.  Servers are definitely the stereotypical hipster  type.  Take that as a positive or a negative but it definitely goes far in setting the tone of the place.The menu looked incredible.  I had a white pizza with jalapenos, onions, and chicken.  It was tasty but I felt the jalapenos were a bit overpowering and I love spicy food.  I saw lots of items with pork belly which is exciting and my update will definitely include something along those lines.All in all I will give it another chance but was a bit underwhelmed the first time out.Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous! Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!Terrible service. Had a bachelorette party of 14, they took our reservation and did not honor it as "they got too busy". They did not apologize, nor make an offer and worse... did not call us to inform us they gave away the table. We even arrived early and they said "We got busy, you can go somewhere else". Absolutely Terrible!So we went to 1130 which as a restaurant next door to them, and they were AMAZING! Great service and even gave our party a discount and free drinks for the inconvenience and terrible service we received at Brick.

Steve Wynn is a radical vegan these days, so all his restaurants feature vegan options. I am most definitely NOT a vegan...but I like to try new stuff, so a friend took me out for a little sampling one night. We started with appetizers at SW steakhouse (see my other review), and then walked across the hall for dinner here.Food-wise, the vegan menu was about the same as at SW. We ordered the "clam" chowder, which was ASTONISHINGLY like real clam chowder -- they use chopped oyster mushrooms to give that rubbery clam mouthfeel you know and love, and I swear even the crustiest old sea dog out of Nantucket wouldn't know the difference.For entrees, we had the "crab" cakes and the "fried chicken," which was made from this weird protein substitute called Gardein. Whatever it is -- it is AWESOME! Tastes like chicken, feels like chicken, looks like chicken...who knows what the hell it REALLY is (knowing the capitalist kingpin proletariat-grinders who frequent the Wynn, probably Soylent Green).The waiter (actually, now that I think about it, it was the sommelier...the waiter wasn't too engaging)  was very attentive to our desire to try vegan stuff, so he had them send us a vegan bread basket, with vegan butter (more soylent green). It was great! We also had some wine, and then strayed from the vegan shtick for dessert, and ordered a few fun fruity little things that were fantastic.Atmosphere-wise, I appreciate the fact that this restaurant is half open-air, on a sort of patio overlooking one of the fake lakes at the Wynn, facing a giant waterfall. Every 20-30 minutes or so, a cheesy 5-minute "show" takes place on the waterfall: two balls of colored light dance around, cooing and making weird sex noises until a little baby ball pops out. Weird! Another show features two giant steampunk-esque mechanical flowers that bloom and sort of flirt with each other in a creepy flowery way. Another mini-show is a weird avant-garde 80s pop-art extravaganza set to that lame-ass 80s song "Oh Yeah" by Yello. YOU know the one. And the last vignette (or whatever the hell you want to call this weird/lame-ass shit) is this SUPER-cheesy giant frog in a UBER-corny black Stetson who sings Garth Brooks's "I've Got Friends in Low Places." W..............T.....................F!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know Steve Wynn is a vegan.....but maybe he should lay off those MUSHROOMS a little...ya know?!?!?!?!!!!!!The typical New American seafood restaurant, with the prerequisite fresh raw bar and delicious, fish offerings sauced and dressed to turn the good into the sublime.  Solid.So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other "services" in Vegas)Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.  The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.Good wine list.  Resort prices.Indulge.  It's Vegas!We dined here at Lakeside on Saturday night with two other couple. It's located inside Wynn right across the SW steakhouse. This Restuarant is beautiful & has a waterfall outside. They played a laser show every 20 min or so. It was so nice. The lighting & the colors of the restuarant is just perfect. The bathrooms are so nice with orange sink. Very unique & trendy ambiance.They have the Rib Eye Glatt Kosher steak!!!! I personally asked to see it, it was sealed & had the OU sign. I was so happy that they had this service. We ordered the Glatt kosher Rib-eye steak, the black bass & 2 of our friends ordered the regular steak with chili & crab on it. All dishes were very delicious. Mine was a bit more well-done than what I wanted it to be but I was so happy I was having kosher steak in a Restuarant like that with the beautiful ambiance, I didn't care at all. Usually when we go to restaurants, my husband & I are forced to get sea food because they don't have a kosher option. We just have to sit & watch our friends eating their yummy steak while we eat our boring salmon!! So the fact that we could have our kosher steak with everyone else was just priceless.I also heard all restaurants at Wynn have vegetarian & vegan menu.For desert, we ordered the coffee creme br√ªl√©e (very unique), orange chocolate & macadamia donut with tea & coffee. The desert was so delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness. Not too sweet.We asked to be seated outside for the desert part so we can watch the waterfall show better. Jason, our waiter was so nice, respectful & he made that happen. The service was outstanding, I highly recommend this place & will go back to it next time I go to Vegas.

What a pleasant surprise !Probably give the place 4.5 stars but round down because it's a STUPID NAME FOR A RESTAURANT !  also, not sure i understand the location - would've loved it 5 months ago when i worked about 200 yards away - even then, the place is way off the street so it's not easily seen.the space is clean  comfortable.We orderedThom khaThai beef saladyellow chicken curryregular rice and sticky rice (or is it stick E rice ?)sticky rice w/ fried banana and coconut ice creamNothing over $10 ( the curry might be if you order shrimp ) the standouts - the curry was excellent ! Dessert also very good.  I liked that the beef in the salad was tender and the dressing had a nice citrus-y tang to it.  The Thom Kha was "standard"Not sure where this place fits in the  Las Vegas Thai restaurant order - i put it above the "chains" - Pin Kaow / Archi's, better than Kung Fu, definitely better than Krung Siam ( that place has really dropped for me ) , I'm waiting to see how Mix Zone does under the new owners ( first visit - ok )  - I still gotta hit Komol and yes, I'm still a fan of LOS.crappy / blurry pics included

Review Text :
Something had to be done at the mess formerly known as the Common House, and it seems they've found a new formula that should work.Kickstand is a burger place at its core, but it also served as a pretty decent neighborhood bar, complete with reasonable drink specials and TVs for all the sports fans.  In fact, they've got so many TVs in there it's a bit outlandish.  They've got TVs on their TVs.I got the New Orleans cajun spiced burger and asked them to spice it up with a bunch of jalapeno pepper.  They did a really nice job with the burger.  I got this "potato cake" on the side, which turned out to be a type of cheeseless au gratin, if that makes any sense you you.  It was pretty tasty.  The whole meal was very satisfying.  My wife got a turkey burger and declared it quite tasty.  She opted for a side of tater tots, half regular and half sweet potato.  I'd never had sweet potato tots before, but I discovered I like them a lot.  They serve the sweet tots with this butter sauce that really is a little too rich and over the top.They had a bunch of good beer on tap, and on Tuesdays, several draft choices are $2.50/pint.  Also, they've got trivia on Tuesdays at 9 p.m.One little hiccup was that about half the tots on my wife's plate arrived cold.  The waitress got a hot replacement order to us right away.  They seem very eager to get the food and the service right.  If they stay focused on food quality and service, they will hopefully avoid going down that long downward spiral that finally spun the Common House out of business.Where can you find a juicy and delicious burger, friendly staff and kitchsy atmosphere? Kickstand!I was really intrigued about Kickstand so when a business contact suggested lunch here I jumped at the chance. What I walked into was a really relaxed vibe with bicycles all around - in their menu, on the premises, etc. I like it! Plus, they are working through some great events that will benefit local nonprofits through this bicycle feel, so that's just grand with me. So, I bet you're wondering about the food, aren't you? Well, here we go...Beer selection: Nice selection overall...lots of seasonal brews, too! Specials looked pretty super, too. Fixed Gear Burger: Their juicy classic cheddar cheeseburger cooked to absolute perfection - I had a bit of pink in my burger which made me practically drool all over the table. Total noms. Plus, the cheese was super duper melty - total win. With these two qualities, plus a toasted bun I was a very, very happy camper.Sweet potato tots: I love me a tot and these have potential. They are eponymous: sweet potato tater tots and served with a mapley buttery dipping sauce. I just wish that they were a bit saltier -  some kosher sea salt added to the mix would be delicious, as I'm a huge fan of the sweet/salty combo. If Kickstand boosts the flavor/richness/saltiness and I'll have to restrain myself from turning into a tater tot. Parfait desserts: These were on the house as they asked my dining partner and me to give them a try. There were three kinds: chocolate brownie, strawberry cheesecake and key lime. As I'm such a sugar head as it is, these were pretty damn tasty. Creamy parfaits (no, not yogurt) topped with deliciousness of all sorts. My favorite was actually the key lime. These are listed for $3 each and they are a really generous and sweet (ha-pun) end to the meal. I truly enjoyed Kickstand and I'm very much looking forward to coming back.I have a personal rule whenever I visit a restaurant - everything deserves a second try. On my first visit to Kickstand, I went with a friend and we sat outside on the little patio area. The food was decent but not exceptional. The burger itself was pretty plain, but the toppings and bun made up for it. I had sweet potato fries and they were a decent compliment, if not a bit squishy. They were served with a thick sludgy brown sugar syrup that was more sweet than flavorful. Decent service balanced it out, and I was ready to give it a second shot.On my second trip, the service was beyond great. The wait staff turned our in-booth TV to the Virginia Tech football game because they saw us wearing our school colors. The food on the second trip was... Well, again, mediocre. I got the Hungover Cyclist which is a variant on my personal holy grail of burgers - the grilled-cheese buns hamburger. I've had it in several places that all put their spin on this cheesy miracle. I really hate to say it, but the one in my neighborhood did the worst. The grilled cheeses were enormous Texas toast slices that drowned out any flavor of cheese or burger with gummy bread. In addition, the only topping on the burger was tomato - even though I asked for some lettuce for balance, I didn't get it. Just a meat patty and a tomato slice between two incredibly awkward grilled cheeses.So I gave it a third shot as a rubber match. I went solo and sat at the bar and left Kickstand completely frustrated. I happened to be there at the same time as another customer that came separately and sat down shortly after. The entire time I was there, the bartender never addressed us individually - he took our orders together, brought our food together, checked in on us at the same time, and brought our checks together. He spent the rest of the time leaning against the bar watching the news. In a complete class-act moment while watching a report about Obama in Indonesia, he remarked that Obama said "It's great to be back in my birth country of Indonesia once again." I'm not a political person, I don't care what your side is, but if you're going to make completely idiotic and aggressive statements then we're done. I've got better things to do with my time than eat a mediocre burger served by a mediocre staff.Planned and hosted many an event here. Must say that this is our go-to spot in Plaza. You really can't go wrong with $1 PBR every night of the week. (Hipsters UNITE!)The staff has always been so kind and willing to get to know us as regulars. Derek, Justin, Telley, Jenny, Sunny and Jessica are always smiling and busting to make sure everything is running shipshape. My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here and Bryson did an amazing job serving our group of close to 50 people. One server, one room. He conquered it. I've had my last two birthday parties here. Flawless as well. The private dining room is awesome. You can shut the doors and make it more intimate for your group. Great option. Been to many a catered event here as well. They have a great system down. The Food: You can't really find a burger on the menu that you won't like. (I recommend the cuban, running machine or the pocket press) Recently tried the sliders and they are rockin'. Wings are awesome. Head over on Wednesdays for $.50 wings. Great flavors. Especially crazy about Barbalo (Buffalo/BBQ)Definitely one of our staples in the QC. Can't believe I'm just now writing this review.We came to kickstand for a Wednesday night because we heard it was trivia night. We arrived around 7:30 to get a good seat and boy, did it pack up quick. We ordered a really delicious bbq chicken flatbread and a bottle of wine to keep us company while we took a stab at the trivia questions.I have to say this is the best trivia night at any restaurant around the area that I have been to. What is great about the trivia here is that they had a mix of questions that anyone could answer (e.g Candy Slogans). I actually left trivia night not feeling like the dumbest human being in Charlotte. The only recommendation I would suggest is that they read off the top ten names for every round, since we spend so time marinating on a humorous name.Definitely need to come back here again for trivia night and a delicious meal.
Yolis Caf√©=This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.  Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs. They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers. Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually. Had about 10 different choices... I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough. Very good no complaints at all. It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had.They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware. OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit. Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.I say get down here and try it out.Mom and Pop place a little off the beaten path in downtown Chandler. That really sums it up. The restaurant is located in an old house so you really do feel like you are sitting at someone's kitchen table having coffee. We went in for a late breakfast on Saturday am. I had a Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and the hubby had the steak skillet. Food was A-ok. Good coffee and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper since they were not busy at all. The server was a little awkward but his mom explained that it was his first day working the front of the house. Remember what I said about Mom and Pop? I can't say this was the best meal I've had but it was pretty good and we will definitely be back simply because all the other breakfast places we like just have such a long wait on the weekends. Also was an interesting visit since I never knew this shopping plaza existed even though we come to the main part of downtown Chandler regularly. Two of the shops were out of business so I guess I am not alone. I am going to write some reviews of the stores that are still open so stay tuned for that.... ;0)Yoli's is easily in my top favorite breakfast restaurants. I usually go with my gf Saturday or Sunday mornings and get the mix and match. You can pick from several items and I usually get the standard egg, sausage, has browns with one pancake. And, this pancake is just about perfect. It's big, fluffy and cooked to a light and slightly crispy golden brown. You don't even have to use syrup. Recently, I tried the Morning Monte which I am definitely getting next time. The flavor is exquisite. Just about everything on the menu is worth ordering.The restaurant is tucked away in a garden oasis in downtown Chandler. We wouldn't have found it except for all the popular Yelp reviews. They have a good amount of outdoor seating nearby a quaint arrangement of flowers, plants and birdcages that house several exotic and colorful birds. It's worth going just to check out those lil guys. The only downside is that the kitchen is small, so when the brunch rush hits, it can take a while. But Yoli and her staff are so friendly and pretty honest about the wait. We grab coffee and sit it out. Trust me, it's worth it!I must confess that I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I haven't sat down to a real breakfast in approximately eleven years.  I have never been one to just roll out of bed and go, "Pancakes sound amazebeans!"  Had I been served some Yoli's Hawaiian french toast in my younger years, that might have changed my mindset in my adulthood.A few days ago, that pesky rascal named Brett B. texted me to rally up the Lunch Bunch for some Yoli's Cafe.  I must live in a cave because I never heard of the place.  After some strategic texting back-and-forth where a group-text probably would have been a wiser choice, it was set that we were going to meet up for brunch.  Being the OCD individual I am, I spent the next few days scouting the online menu and creeping on Yelper pictures of the joint.  Time-jump to yesterday, Friday at 11:30am.  Finding this place was slightly tricky and locating a parking spot was even trickier!  Nonetheless, we all arrived on time and sat down to be served by the most amusing and friendly waitress ever.  She's so friendly, outgoing, and personable.  I wanted to put her in my pocket!  This lady's a hoot!  I ordered a Mornin' Monte after being told the difference between that and the Monte Cristo [one has egg whites in place of ham].  Best decision ever.  There was turkey, crispy bacon, egg whites, and Havarti cheese sandwiched in between the most perfectly grilled Hawaiian french toast with spicy orange marmalade and syrup on the side.  Although it's french toast, I opted not drowning my french toast with the syrup.  It would be much too sweet and strong on top of all that powdered sugar goodness.  Instead, I had spread a modest layer of spicy orange marmalade onto every bite.  It was bliss.  The lovely Ms. Yoli saw me sharing with my lunch companions and gave me an extra marmalade.  Totally sweet of her!  I ended up taking half my sandwich home which I tucked away a few hours later straight out of the fridge.  Still delicious, still amazing.So now I sit here daydreaming of a delicious Mornin' Monte for breakfast and wishing I could eat it every day.  Of course, I'd probably end up packing on the pounds but hey, who needs vanity when you can have Monte?*** Featured in The Weekly Yelp, December 17, 2014 - The Breakfast Club
Royal Buffet=Went for lunch today with Rand H and Mike C just as they were opening for the very first time.  I am far from being a buffet expert, but this was nothing like the Chinese buffets I had been to back in Chicago.  As Rand said, there were over 130 items, including a Mongolian BBQ, a sushi bar, as well as a good variety of Chinese and American foods.  Everything I tasted was excellent with good flavor and high quality.  There is something for everyone here and at 7.95 for a lunch time buffet, it's definitely a bargain.  I will be back!
Shan Dong Chinese Restaurant=I was starving and sick from a bad sinus infection... My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.
Yard House Red Rock Resort=We went on a nice drive out to Red Rock Casino and decided to hit up the HH at the Yard House.  I started off with a Victory IPA and the buffalo chicken wings.  We then proceeded to try some lettuce wraps, chicken pizza, poke stack, spinach dip and the seared ahi.  Everything was excellent, especially the lettuce wraps and the poke stack.  Next beer on the list was a Boulder Beer chocolate porter on nitro.  Smooth, delicious and very creamy.  I remember drinking Boulder Beer way back when and I always thought their beers were very tasty, and this was no exception.  The service at the bar was excellent and our bartender was on her game (I believe her name was Aimee) and very attentive to our needs. We will definitely stop back in to try a few more beers and try some of the tasty appetizers that we missed.
786 Halal Restaurant=Most people just lump Indian food into one group and think it represents the entire subcontinent as a whole.Folks, it's a subcontinent. Like Europe or South America, just as there are huge regional differences in the cuisine of even smaller countries like France or Italy, there are just as wide and divergent diffrences in food from Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Goan, Punjabi, Bengali, Assamese, Keralese, Tamil, Pakistani, Lahori, Nepalese, Tibetan, Sri Lankan, Bhutanese, Old Delhi, Karachi, Marathi, and Baluchi areas reflecting the history, ethnicity and geography of these places and peoples. Perhaps restauranteurs from these countries are also partially to blame for not offering the richness of their cuisine on a wider scale when instead they just dumb down and offer the "generic" Indian restaurant menu, but I digress.786 Halal Restaurant is located at 768 Jean Talon West. No, the owners and sign makers weren't dyslexic. 786 is the numerological value for the opening verses of the Koran. And Halal obviously means they serve only Halal meat here, meat which has been properly (ahem) killed, blessed and prepared, much like kosher meat in the Jewish tradition. They do not serve alcohol here since it's an establishment that likes to keep it close to it's Islamic roots, as evidenced by the donation box by the cash register for the local mosque as well as the family tables set aside near the front. Hindus are vegetarians but Muslims eat meat, so vegetarians, beware, go to Pushap instead. 786 Halal does have a pretty large vegetable menu so no worries if you do find yourself here with omnivorous  friends.Simply put, the food here is amazing!No wonder they opened a second franchise in Toronto which apparently has line-ups around the block. Lahori food is known for it's marinated, spiced up grilled meats. (think of it as BBQ Pakistani style) and the specialty here is definitely the Lahori Deep Fried fish and BBQ Chicken. Come here on a Friday (The Islamic holy day of the week) and you can order the Haleem, a mish mash of meat, lentils and wheat which is like a thick stew.The desserts are alright, not the best, but passable. The one dessert I do recommend is the Gajar ka halwa, which is a carrot pudding, sounds strange, but trust me, it's great!I came here for lunch today and it was a packed house, so I ordered to go and went to a local park and enjoyed lunch out in the sun, but I'm definitely coming back when it's quieter.
Crepe Shack & Waffles=REALLLLLLY!!!! Finally!  Japanese style crepes in Vegas?!?!?For those of you who are so loveable that you have read my reviews in other states, you know I have a thing for hand held crepes.  My favorite place is Sophie's in San Francisco's Japantown, a place I went daily on my most recent Bay Area vacation (I posted a pic with my review of my eating the coveted green tea ice cream red bean paste matcha sauce crepe).  Then last summer in Seattle, I made my co-vacationers go to a mall just so I could try Unicone.Needless to say, I had no idea based on the picture on yelp that the crepes would be hand held.  I just went because I knew it would at least smell good in a place that makes crepes and waffles!  Heading in there today, I learned that Crepe Shack opened 3 days ago.  Owner Li is a young entrepreneur with a big colorful space and lots of restaurant experience.  We talked at length about the business idea, his support of other new businesses and food trucks, and sushi (because we all love it mmm).He is working out supplier issues so more toppings and ice cream flavors are to come, but for now, there is still a great selection.  I enjoyed a crepe with fresh strawberries and kiwi, shredded coconut, and almonds.  It was a really good treat, sweet and tasted healthy.  Li told me the batter is meant to taste fortune-cookie-esque, and it did.  This is a really fun place for a "healthy sweet tooth" craving.  If you track me down at the Yelp Seats kickoff on Tuesday, Li gave me a stack of 15% off cards that I can hand out!  Bon appetit!I've wanted to try Japanese-style crepes for a while after learning about their existence through reviews on Yelp LA (Yes, I like to peruse the eats of other cities...). Sadly, Vegas is slow on food trends...forcing me to look at pictures (like this http://bit.ly/h42u9L and this http://bit.ly/ftAs5D) of these crepes to satisfy my craving. Just in the nick of time before I was about to attempt to create my own Japanese crepe in my kitchen, Crepe Shack & Waffles popped up in my neighborhood next to my beloved Trader Joe's. And reading all the fabulous reviews, I knew I had to make a visit to this shop ASAP. With friend by my side, I visited Crepe Shack & Waffles for a sweet dinner treat. The place is super clean and roomy with high ceilings, colorful walls & a minimalist feel. Perfectly designed to cater to the rush of high school students who come by this place after school and during the night to hang out. Plus 1 for free wi-fi! Upon walking in, we were greeted by one of the workers who explained how the menu and ordering process worked. My friend and I both decided to order from the Specialty menu rather than the DIY menu, as the Specialty Crepes are a much better deal in terms of price. I chose the Tickle Me Berry (Strawberry, Raspberry & Blueberry) Specialty Crepe w/ Green Tea ice cream and no whipped cream, and w/ my Yelp discount I paid less than $5 for this wonderful cone of yumminess. Owner Li and I started talking about his business, Yelp & such, while he was making my crepe. He told me that he wanted to make his crepe batter reminiscent in flavor to a fortune cookie with the addition of more vanilla,  compared to regular crepes which are more eggy in taste. Great decision! I'd much rather taste more vanilla than more egg. Anyways, after Li added fresh strawberries, blueberries & YELLOW raspberries (!) and a scoop of ice cream into my crepe, he rolled it up in a cone and handed me this piece of food art. Being a Japanese-crepe newbie, I thought the crepe was meant to be eaten w/ a fork at first, but then I realized "utensils not required" as it's meant to be eaten like how you would eat an ice cream cone. I took my first bite and was impressed. The crepe itself was thin, soft, airy & slightly chewy all at the same time. The flavor of the crepe was sweet but not too sweet, the berries were fresh (I wanted more berries...) & the ice cream was just the right amount of sweetness. All these elements harmonized well with each other, resulting in a concoction that left my sweet tooth satisfied and not aching. I felt less guilty about eating this somehow. My favorite part of the crepe was the last bites before it disappeared, as the slightly melted ice cream combined w/ the remaining fruit and the crepe made for the last perfect bites. I'll be back again with friends in the near future. Not just for the yummy crepes but for the friendly service as well. I hope this place sticks around for a while.We were in the area and I was feeling on a snack and saw some of my Yelp friends check into the Crepe Shack so I decided to get crepe-y and be creepy. I didn't find my friends, but I found some treats to fill in the need for a afternoon snack. I got the East Meets West: red bean, mochi bits, condensed milk and green tea ice cream. I forgot how messy Japanese crepes was, but it was fun eating it. The flavors all went really well together and the crepe was good. It's a little less crisp than some of the crepe places I like (like Sophies in SFO), but good flavor and chewy.The BF is more of a waffle person so he got a Bananas Foster: bananas, cinnamon powder, caramel, whip cream, ice cream. It was good toppings, but since they are using the crepe batter the texture is less than ideal. It was dense and wasn't crispy enough. The BF thinks next time he will order a crepe instead since that wasn't what he looks for in a waffle. The staff is really friendly. The owner was the one who rang us up and saw my Yelp check-in offer and asked about how often I used it, asked what I thought of the crepe, etc. Seems like the type of owner who is responsive to customers feedback. They're fairly new, but it seems they are getting into a groove.We live way across town, but definitely a place I can see myself stopping by again when we're in the area.Holy crepe! I love this place. So much so that I went two days in a row. The crepes are delicious, the people are cool, and the crepes are delicious!I didn't really know what "Japanese Crepe" meant, but I am all in. They explained that the batter is less eggy and this results in a crepe that kind of tastes like a fortune cookie. I'd have to agree. On my first visit, I went with the Strawberry Sensation (strawberries/cheesecake/strawberry syrup) with strawberry ice cream. Yum! The next day, I went with the Rebel Special (strawberry/banana/nutella) with green tea ice cream. This combination didn't match the previous day, but it was still good. The crepe is rolled into what resembles an ice cream cone. So with the scoop of ice cream in there, it basically feels like you are eating an ice cream cone.Make sure you check in on your Yelp app to get 10% off your crepe. Make sure to also get your punch card to get your tenth one free. I usually don't fill up punch cards, but I can see this place getting repeat visits from me, despite how far south it is located.I haven't tried their waffles and I probably never will. But for a delicious crepe snack/dessert, five stars all the way!Dear Lord...I was lost and then I was found after having the Camp Out S'more Japanese Crepe. The marshmallows, graham cracker crumbs, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream were like a dessert nirvana. It was quite crowded when we went at 1:30pm....the local school was getting out. I was impressed how quickly the staff worked and we had our crepes within 7 min...which is a perfectly acceptable wait time in my mind. Also...I must commend the kids...they were all well behaved and very respectful...nice to see. Will be back VERY soon for the Camp Out S'more.So, after a very large meal at Monstah Lobstah, I felt like my sweet to savory ratio was a little off. I remembered that this place was in the area and I've been dying to try it, so we stopped in for a little dessert.My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert. About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry. All in all, great little dessert spot. I'd come back if I'm in the area.I picked this place for one of my last hurrah treats before summer dieting begins. Oh to be a naturally thin person so I could eat here every day (ok I'd settle for once a week!). We tried a waffle and a crepe. Both were wonderful. We customized them to our own tastes (I got bananas, oreos, caramel and vanilla ice cream in a crepe and the husband got birthday cake ice cream and brownies on a waffle). Both were cooked to order and utterly delicious. Yay for birthday cake ice cream, tons of beautiful fresh fruit, and a nice mixture of conventional and creative toppings. The owners were friendly and service was quick. I will be back once my bikini days are behind me !Crepes.....I LOVE crepes. Now this is a different kind of crepe that I've never had before. Japanese style crepes are a "fortune cookie" flavored crepe. We came here on a Sunday and it was pouring! Rain won't stop us foodies! Since we were full from a 4th of July party we decided to share one crepe which proved to be more than enough for the two of us. I ordered the Rebel Special without ice cream, which meant that I got more fruit. I really liked the crepe itself without all the filling.....which you can actually order! Next time I'll order my own crepe with the fillings that I want. A pretty cool concept and pretty good dessert.Excellent batter makes excellent crepes. These guys really do a great job of making crispy crepes and filling them with fresh fruit and other goodness. I really enjoyed the Bananas Foster and the East Meets West. Definitely add strawberries to the East Meets West. It's so yummy! Definitely will be back for more... too bad I don't live on this side of town... sigh...This place was just OK.  My Japanese wife and I would've preferred our crepes a little more on the well done side.  No burn marks or toastiness at all, too soft and spongey.  Japanese crepe places also offer more than just desserts too.  Maybe a BLT crepe to pump up the business around dinner time?  Great selection of dessert choices as it is essentially the Yogurtland of creperies but the taste just isn't worth schlepping it over to Henderson for.After having a savory crepe at Suzuya, when I got home, my tummy was telling me "Mike, it's time.. for a sweet one". I thought to myself, "Where is a place close to my house that sells crepes?" And I remembered, CS&W. I jumped in my car, and went here ASAP!!CS&W is located on Eastern, past Horizon Ridge, in the same complex as Trader Joe's and Sears. It's a new place that has been opened for less than 2 years and has been getting rave reviews on yelp.Inside, the store is clean, really clean. It has a modern vibe, furthermore, it is bright and airy. The staff is very friendly, professional, but very approachable. After ordering, I sat down and waited. After about a few minutes, they brought my order to me.Rebel Special Crepe - Strawberries, Nutella, Bananas. I added the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The crepe is more chewier than the ones at Suzuya or Crepe Expectations. It tasted O.K., just o.k. The nutella sauce they used was amazing. The bananas tasted good too. The whipped cream and Thrifty brand ice cream were very good. But, I do have a couple gripes. Now, I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts. But, IMO, this could have used some more sweetness. Also, the strawberries had little flavor. Maybe if they used Harry's berries, it could have been better. The crepe was a 3.Classic Waffle - Nutella, Bananas, Toasted Almonds. This time I added whipped cream and Thrifty's Cookies and Cream Ice cream. They also put a side of pancake syrup in a small container for me. For my personal preference, I'm not really into soft waffles. But, even though it was soft, the waffle had really good flavor. The nutella sauce, bananas, ice cream, almonds, and whipped cream were very good. What really elevated the waffle was the pancake syrup. It provided the right amount of sweetness for this dish, and it tied all the flavors together. Without the syrup, like the crepe, it wouldn't have been sweet enough. A big 4 to 4.5 for this one.I spent about 5 to 6 dollars for each item, it's a very good deal. I would recommend the waffle over the crepe, and I do urge you to get the pancake syrup and pour it on top before you eat it. That's my story and i'm sticking to it. Good day, sir.I rarely get cravings for sweets, but when I do this is the place to go to fulfill them.Who doesn't love crepes? The softness of the pancake in relation with the ice cream, whip cream and fruits is enough to make me die and go to heaven. They have so many toppings and flavors! Not to mention, if you're a fan of Thrifty's Ice Cream - that's the type they serve here. My go to is ALWAYS the rebel special which consist of strawberry, banana, and nutella. I opt for vanilla flavor though since I don't want anything to overpower the deliciousness that nutella has to offer. PLUS! Nutella and vanilla is a classic pairing that you can't go wrong with.The place itself is very modern, clean, and spacious. There's even some board games customers can play to kill time while hanging out. If I was still in high school and lived in this area.. I would use this place as a meet-up spot or something.As long as I continue to work in Henderson or whenever I'm in the area and craving something sweet (which like I stated is rare) - Crepe Shack here I come!After looking at the pictures of their delicious creations, I had to check it out for myself.  Before this, I've only had the traditional crepes that are rolled with sauce and toppings drizzled over it.   Here they have Japanese crepes.   It is filled with the dessert toppings and scoop of ice cream of your choice.  They have many options with pre-determined filling.  It's great for people like me who can't make a decision.   The crepes and waffles are made there when you order.  I chose the banana cheese pie crepe filled with cheesecake, white chocolate sauce, bananas, graham crackers and whipped cream.  Can I get a hell yeah?! I went with vanilla ice cream so it wouldn't take away from the others toppings.  The crepe itself is formed into a waffle cone shape to hold all of the goodness.  I loved it! It's different and fulfills my sugar craving.  A friend of mine ordered a dessert waffle.  Honestly it was just ok.  I'd choose the crepe over that.   Service was great.  Both gentlemen were very helpful and friendly.  They made our first visit a delight! I am happy to add this to my dessert list!Waffles, waffles, waffles! Absolutely addictive! My family and I were only staying in the area for a couple of weeks and we were here almost every day. Every time we visited, the place was very clean and the staff- very friendly. Whether it was crepes and ice cream, waffles and ice cream, scoops of ice cream, or a yogurt parfait, there was satisfaction in every bite! I first had the East Meets West waffle which came with red bean paste, mochi bites, condensed milk, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of green tea ice cream. First of all, it looked incredible, then it tasted so dreamy. Another time, I had the Rebel Special waffle with bananas, strawberries, Nutella, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of black cherry ice cream. This was a real classic, on steroids!!! Their yogurt parfaits have just the right balance of sweet and sour with a whole lotta freshness while their cone crepes are made super thin as the perfect vessel for ice cream and other heavenly goodness.
Hayashi Japanese Steakhouse=I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege.So my best friend in the whole world (and another Yelper) was born on New Year's Day, and her daughter was also born the same day.  (What are the odds??)   They wanted an intimate get together to celebrate both of their recent birthdays and this restaurant was their choice.   Okay, no point in beating around the bush...I'll just come right out and say it; our waitress was friggen awful.  She left us high and dry for several minutes at a time and she completely forgot to bring me a high chair.  Finally after waiting for about 30 minutes for her to remember to bring me a high chair, another diner at our table went and found one since I was having trouble keeping my wiggly daughter sitting on my lap.  And I could make a big deal about the fact that we were seated for probably 30 minutes before she even took our orders, and probably about 25 more minutes before they brought us our appetizers, and that she never even once asked if we wanted to see a drink menu and I finally had to ask if they even offered cocktails and that finally prompted her to produce a drink menu about 20 minutes and another request later (20 minutes, I'm not kidding).  Since my husband doesn't drink and is my permanent designated driver, and we were celebrating, I got a pineapple mojito, minus the pineapple.  No, I didn't order my pineapple mojito without the pineapple, it just came that way.  So it was just a mojito flavored mojito.  Now, to be fair it was still a damn tasty mojito, but I don't think it had passed within 22' feet of a pineapple, EVER.  I'm just saying.'  Our waitress obviously didn't notice that when she got our order from the bartender either.  I just have to repeat it; she really isn't very good at what she does.  I'm sorry, I know that is harsh.  And despite the fact that I was in a party of three (yes, I knew the other diners, but we were all on separate checks) I still got hit with an automatic 18% gratuity for a large party.  WTF?  Really?! Ugh...   But then let's talk about the food.  When they finally decided to serve us food it was a mixed experience.  My baby daughter got a tempura plate and I think she really enjoyed it.  She ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed dipping her fried shrimp and veggies in the dipping sauce.  I tasted her food and it wasn't bad at all.  And the mushroom soup that comes as an appetizer with the teppan entrees is delicious.  I mean really, really good.  I don't know how they prepare it, but it was staggeringly good and I would've consumed a gallon of that stuff.  Also, the salad with orange ginger dressing was very cold and crisp and delicious too.  For dinner my husband ordered the vegetarian teppan and I ordered the combo teppan dinner with scallops and sirloin steak.  (Side note: I love scallops, but the last 3 times I had them prepared in a restaurant I had gotten violently ill.  I knew I was taking my chances with getting another bad batch, but I wanted scallops again so bad I decided to roll the dice.)  The good news?  I didn't get sick afterwards, these scallops were very fresh.  The bad news?  They were so fresh that they still had fresh little pieces of sand embedded all throughout them.  You never want to bite into a scallop and hear a crunch:  EVER.   Also my food was horribly over salted, and I do mean horribly.   I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to salt, but this was too much salt, even for me.Also, my scallops were done cooking a full 15 minutes before my medium rare steak was done.  That kinda sucked as they could have easily been timed better by the chef.  Our chef was very friendly.  The fried rice that comes as a side with the teppan dinner was pretty good, but nowhere near as garlic-buttery-tastic and delicious as the chicken fried rice served at another unnamed teppan place that I routinely go to in Tempe...The damage for our whole dinner and my drink was about $70, so it wasn't too bad in the grand scheme of fresh prepared teppan dinners.  I just wish the service had been better and the scallops hadn't been full of sand. But you know what's most important? That my best friend and niece had a great birthday party.  And at the end of the night, despite the hiccups with the food and service, I think they did have a good time.  And THAT is *still* what matters most to me.PS:  Sandy scallops=YUCK!Terrible experience. Horrible service. I know it's New Years Eve, and we had a reservation for 8:00pm. We were sat at 8:05. It's now 9:35 and we have only received our drinks. Other tables that were seated after us are eating. The manager came over and said there was a miscommunication between the hostess and the server and then he walked away. Bullshit! I'll never return here again. If I knew we could eat at another restaurant this evening, I'd walk out. POOR MANAGEMENT.UPDATE: After 2 hours, and not even a second round of drinks, we DID walk out. Now eating at Chili's. Great service here.
Brentwood Cafe & Tavern=Hidden Gem.She's an awesome spot to watch a game and throw back a few drinks. Decor is modernized.We came in here during the football season and they had an awesome special, 24oz (or more, can't remember) beer, chicken pesto sandwich & fries for $10!!! Sandwich is full of flavor and the beer is served in a goblet so the price is well worth it.Our bartender was great! Service was awesome, love this place!Had to update, since I actually tried some of the food on Saturday night!Tamara and Brian were great all night. I ordered with Tamara, and I got the seared ahi salad, with the sesame dressing on the side, and no wasabi aoli. (I'm watching my weight)It was really good.  The tuna could have been seasoned a bit...because it was rather bland, but...it satisfied my fish craving.  The dressing complemented everything really well, too. Also, I was drinking ice water, and after I downed my first class, Tamara gave me my own pitcher of ice water!  Perfect!They also offer $15 bottomless mimosas on Saturdays and Sundays.  SCORE!As a note to the service side too, some friends met me up there, and ordered a couple food items.  My girl friend got hers right away, but her husbands was nowhere to be found. He asked Tamara, and apparently the cook hadn't read the ticket correctly.  They rushed his order out, and took it off the bill, no questions asked.  That's pretty awesome, to make up for the mistake.  I'm really liking Brentwood more, every time I come out.  :)This place is in the middle of nowhere. Well actually I only say that because this side of town is pretty foreign to me. It's a pretty cool spot if you live in the area. My friend had a birthday party here and she got to rent out the whole outside patio. It was a cool night so it wasn't too hot. Everyone that was there for her got a stamp so you can get half off appetizers, well drinks, and beer on tap. The beers on tap was pretty good. They have karaoke and the DJ was awesome. He seemed like an aspiring rapper. The prices for the the food and drinks were pretty reasonable not too pricey. This place is pretty cool we had a good time. I probably won't be coming here too often considering is pretty far from me but if I was in the area I wouldn't count this place out.
Spoon House Korean Kitchen=I was hoping to be the first to review but oh well :)Spoon House Korean Kitchen just opened on Green Street this week. I was pretty excited to go sometime this week. From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi)  which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but  it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck.
Vatra=We were eager to visit and try the "new place" in the 'hood.  Especially because it appeared to be a sophisticated environment considering the location on Indian School & 56th, just south of Arcadia.  I met my friend at the bar, waited 10 minutes or so for a table and enjoyed a glass of wine.  There was a nice selection and the majority of it priced under $10 a glass.The design is simple and unassuming, which led me to believe in the service and food being of higher importance ( both great aspects of a successful restaurant.)  We were promptly escorted to one of the best  seats in the place for people-watching and great one-on-one conversation.  The settings were in the way, we pushed them aside and continued in conversation.  The service was just ok, same with the food.  We had a chicken and fish entree, not sure which ones though.  An odd part of the evening happened every time that the server would come to our table, he addressed us as "Kids".  Apparently, sitting in the best seat and conversing, on a Friday night & drinking wine by the glass, is not the best way to get respect or attention.  We were only a "deuce" or a 2-top.  We weren't there to be sold.  We didn't ordered a bottle.  We were occupying his "money table" during the 7pm slot.  We weren't interested in small talk with him.The server sized us up immediately and figured that either we were on a date, or that we didn't truly "get" what good service truly is at a restaurant.  He rarely checked on our glasses of wine.  My friend actually had to ask for a second glass while her empty wine glass sat there, mortified.  I've opened restuarants, hotels, spas, coffee shops and done more in the "service industry" than most my age.  My friend's background as a Stylist is also about catering to a client, being friendly, confident and comfortable.The finishing touch to the incompetence of the server?  Walking over to the table, check in hand, shaking his head "no", and saying, " You're probably not going to have anything else, are you?" while setting it on the edge of the table.I value my time enough to know when the staff needs some assistance with the finer points of service: Engage with your clients, offer suggestions / don't sell, be courteous, don't judge and always be authentic.I'll be back in a few weeks to see if they value constructive criticism.Have you ever been excited because you want something to be great...and then it's...very disappointing:(  This is how the story went at Vatra!  It's almost like the owner is a home cook trying to go "pro".  We went for lunch and all signs started well...we were greeted upon entering the place, it was clean and nicely designed and decorated.  The menu had many items that were appealing.  The waitress took our order and the ice tea was well brewed and fresh, some absolutely freshly baked bread with some designer butter came out and we were thinking things were going well...until the steak chimichurri arrived!  What cut of meat it was ...i have no idea but it was under seasoned, undercooked and super chewy!  The chimichurri sauce lacked any flavor and this plate had some boring flavorless potato wedges.  Paella...I have no idea why they think this is anything like Paella...it was 6 pieces of overcooked seafood on a bed of dry yellow rice.  How the chef could taste this and think wow this is great is beyond me.   The deserts were boring and we were afraid to order them and have more mediocre fare.  I fear that there is no hope for Vatra and it is going to go down in flames.
Beaver Choice=Beaver Choice.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I don't know what the name means, I have no idea why it's named that, I don't know why the logo is a beaver (the animal kind - get your heads out of the gutter people) in a Swedish triple crown shirt holding a fork.  With all that said, what I do know is this place is definitely worth a try.  I had never heard of the place until my girlfriend fianc√©e sent me a link saying we should check it out sometime.  I checked out the menu online, it looked good, so rather than wait several weeks for my fianc√©e to have a free lunch period, I decided to investigate for myself that very same day.  Good move on my part.  It's a great little Scandinavian restaurant that's only been open for a couple of weeks in a pretty non-descript suite in the strip mall behind Ted's Hot Dogs at McClintock & Broadway.  It's a very clean place with about 6 or 7 four tops, furnished from top to bottom by...you guessed it...Ikea.  It's a family owned and operated spot and they are some of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  They are very proud of their little piece of Scandinavia in the desert and it shows in their service and their food.  They are well aware of the fact that with the exception of Swedish meatballs, most people aren't really familiar with Scandinavian food so when you approach the counter, right off the bat they ask if you would like to try a little sample platter free of charge.  Who's going to turn that down?  I had a little piece of Gravlax (raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill), some potato salad and some pink lunch salad thing the name of which I forget.  I really enjoyed the Gravlax and potato salad but the pink one was made with sour cream and since I've never been a fan of sour cream I only had a bite of that one.  They have two menus. One could best be described as a lunch/to-go menu and one that they call the bistro menu which is essentially akin to a dinner menu except that you can get anything on it all day.  They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups, entrees, etc. with all kinds of different varieties of meats to choose from.  They even had two that they say on the menu are recommended for hangovers.  My kind of place! It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get.  I decided to try the schnitzel.  It comes with a decent little side salad with your choice of either a honey mustard or garlic vinaigrette, a little citrusy red cabbage slaw both of which were good but were primarily there to compliment the main event which was the schnitzel.  It's an enormous breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and brie cheese, cooked to perfection and topped with an amazing mushroom gravy and on the side were dill mashed potatoes also topped with the gravy.  Both of them were in a word, delicious.  It was about $11 for the whole entr√©e and it was worth every penny.  I wasn't able to finish the whole thing but I can tell you that it keeps really well because I had it for breakfast this morning.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if any of it is even half as a great as the schnitzel, it's gotta be pretty damn good.  You know how every now and then you go to a place that's just starting out and you get great service and great food and you just hope that they make it?  Well this is one of those places.  I strongly suggest that you go check it out.Beaver Choice?Uh...Yes, Please!I thought it was a question...a natural mistake.You see, I love Beavers...after all, I come from Oregon, the Beaver State (state motto - "M'mmmmm, that's some mighty tasty Beaver") and I have spent so many years pursuing Beavers, frolicking with Beavers, really, just delighting in Beavers in all their many guises!I have stalked, trapped and released back into the wild...(I'm a conservationist) more Beavers than I can count...from adorable Golden Beavers and the elusive California Shaved Beaver to the wild and wily Crimson "Fire" Beaver...I guess you could say that I am Beaver enthusiast!The Beautiful Carin put an end to my halcyon days of hunting wild Beavers...really, I'm much happier for it...and calmer.That said, I was going to drop by Ted's for a wiener at lunch and saw the sign for this adorable little place (I personally think that it's no coincidence that Beaver Choice occupies a cozy little spot very near Ted's Wiener Emporium), and I thought, "Donald, let's go get us some Beaver".Well, it turns out that Beaver Choice is a terrific little Scandinavian restaurant...for Scandinavians...like me!As I looked over the menu, I saw things I hadn't seen since I was a kid...things I hadn't seen since I was last at that great Smorgasbord place back in Portland that I can't remember the name of...the stuff that Nordic dreams are made of!Gravlax, K√•ldolmar, Laxpudding, Fylld L√∂vbiff...and fries!I had a smoked salmon sandwich that was well made, tasty and filling (oh, don't worry...I didn't upset the subtle forces of nature by eating too healthily...I had fries, too!).While they do have several vegetarian options on the lunch menu, I would remind you that the sweet little family that owns and operates Beaver Choice is Swedish (by way of Poland)...Scandahoovian...like me...and we never met a vegetable or fruit that we didn't think was better boiled, fried, baked, distilled or fermented...just sayin.But I am going back...the only thing better would be if these guys would open up a smorgasbord place...but then they would have to contend with me pretty much wallowing in the buffet tables...and nobody wants to see that.Drop by Beaver Choice the next time you are in that part of the world!Even if you're not a Beaver Enthusiast (like I am), I'm sure you'll find something to eat.What a great little spot! I don't often eat Scandinavian food, but that might all change after today. The family that runs Beaver Choice has charmed me with their delicious food and friendly spirits. I can agree with some other reviews and say that the food did take a good amount of time to get served, but Beaver Choice has heard that cry and they are trying to work on it (Also, when I ordered off of the Grab & Go menu, I got my sandwich very quickly). The lady and I ordered a Swedish Meatball Pita and the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu to share. The food knocked the socks off anything IKEA had to offer in it's cafeteria! The pita was loaded, and I mean loaded with fresh veggies and about three meatballs per half. For a mere $5, that's a steal for a sandwich that doesn't make you feel like you just ate a grease-soaked sponge. Now, make sure you go before 6pm if that sparked you're interest because they switch to the dinner-only menu after that. What about the schnitzel, you ask? Yum! It was basically a flattened cordon bleu covered in a very nice mushroom sauce. Every bite was very tasty, but there is a pork variation that I wish we would have gotten. Apparently the owners put the chicken version on the menu to appease non-pork eating individuals, so the pork is the original for them. Along with the schnitzel there were a few different salads (all of which were fresh loaded with crisp red onion) and a side of pan-fried thyme potatoes. I want to just eat a big bowl of those because they were that good to me. They were simple, light and flavorful.Beaver Choice. Remember that name and go check it out! It was good, but be patient. They are new and they'll get their groove thang going soon enough. Lastly, make sure you write them a review! I know I can't be the only one to be excited about multiple "schnitzel" references in a single review!Sometimes, it is just wonderful to be alive.  Actually, all the time it's wonderful to be alive.  Life is amazing, the weather is gorgeous outside, I am or think I am getting better at tennis, my girlfriend loves her job and I love that she is bringing in money for the first time in 5 years, 3 years later I can finally convince myself that bright red is not too girly a color for the car I drive, and I found a restaurant that serves food so good that I want to photoshop some incriminating photos of the husband so that I can court the owner-chef Hanna, marry her, and keep all her food to myself.  As that would be a terrible thing to do and that I don't think I'm really spouse material and that I have no game whatsoever, instead I will eat here whenever I think I deserve an amazing meal and spread the word on how awesome Beaver Choice is!On to my actual experience, I start with a phone call asking general questions about their restaurant, and engage in a nearly 8 minute dialogue analyzing what I like and ordering based upon their recommendation.  This also creates a 10% discount by ordering over the phone for pick up off their bistro menu, which is nice for my lunch hour.  I wound up picking the Chicken with Cardamomsauce, perfectly seared slices of chicken then simmeredin cardamom accented, heavy creme sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, with the seared outside giving a pleasant mouthfeel, yielding to the moist and tender inner portion, all swimming in that wonderful sauce.  You can choose a side dish and 3 portions of salad to go with your entree.  Couscous was heavenly, absorbing all the juices of the chicken and mopping up the sauce in its fluffy goodness.  Tomato-basil salad was fine, but too peppery.  The spinach salad was straightforward and competent, and home-made coleslaw was tastier than most I've had.  Very filling and extremely satisfying, I would bathe in that cardamom sauce if I could.  One note I need to make, a previous review had slammed Hanna for tasting something she was making, and using the same spoon for tasting something else.  When I arrived I mentioned I heard about them on Yelp and mentioned this review, which prompted resulted in me being ushered into her kitchen to proudly display a set of about a dozen spoons at the ready for tasting.  Also of note there are no microwaves!  The pride in their food is entirely justified, yelpers.  The only thing to be aware of is the time involved to prepare your food, but ordering in will alleviate that, or simply set aside plenty of time.  Choose Beaver Choice.  You won't regret it.Don't let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience. My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendre's on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter's advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate. I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon. We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all. Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you won't come away disappointed!So um we really, really wanted some Swedish meatballs one day. Then low and behold we landed at Beaver Choice. Best. Accident. Ever.This is a family owned business. We were the only guests. The Scandianvian son fawned on us. We had to sample EVERYTHING. I mean we had two heaping full plates of samples, before we were allowed to order. He insisted! It was so amazingly awkward. Truly though, very gracious people. It's a gem of a place.Worth the drive to Tempe! NOT fancy but totally comfortable thanks to the wonderful, gracious family owners/operators.Do NOT miss the dill mashed potatoes! Also, I LOVED the tomato sauce that came with the cabbage rolls. Was dipping everything I possibly could in it!! I ordered both of the beet options but, if forced to choose, liked the beet salad best... wound up "cleaning" the dish by wiping it down with the remaining pickled beets! I liked the cabbage rolls but I LOVED the hash one of my dining companions had ordered. This is likely what I will get on my next visit.The pierogi were boiled but didn't seem to spend any time in a frying pan. I love pierogi but I prefer them to have a little more of a crunch -- the firmness you get from a quick pan fry.It's a tiny, casual place. Order at the counter, they bring you your food and you pay at the counter when you're done.A BYO, if you also bring your own glasses they waive the corking fee!Seriously cannot wait to go back!! :9To set the record straight for all the pervs out there who thought I was checking in at a strip club tonight (it's Wednesday night for God's sake and I have to work in the morning!!!!), Beaver Choice is a tiny, VERY unassuming Scandinavian/ Canadian restaurant in a strip mall in Tempe.Check out all of the awesome reviews to get an idea of how great this place is and then get in here. They serve a nice selection of Scandinavian fish, meat and pork dishes.I started out with Quebec-style poutine which was delicious (the Canadians weren't pulling my leg on this). The only thing that was missing was beer (they are BYO FYI, so I'll bring beer next time). I'm telling you folks, our evil socialist neighbors to the north know how to whip out some great comfort food!!!!!For my main I enjoyed some hearty Swedish meatballs bathed in a hearty cream sauce and accompanied with tomato basil, spinach salad and sauteed green beans. You get a LOT of food because your main comes with a side(choice of potato) and three types of salad. The salads are small but throw in three choices, your side and your main and you wind up with a lot of food.They have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you'll want to get your dessert to go.The family that run the place are so warm, hospitable, kind and welcoming and I'm thrilled that they're moving to a bigger location. This is a hidden gem in the valley and really and great option when you're sick of all the usual choices to eat.Totally unpretentious, small, very casual, interestingly-named, family-operated, and offering good values on large portions of delicious food. Thus: A keeper!Two things to note before you go: There are only 6 4-top tables so reservations are recommended. Also, no liquor license, so it's BYOB with a $5-per-bottle corking fee. The side-salad options on the menu are kinda confusing at first. Keep in mind that they don't combine the separate items in a bowl: You are essentially ordering three separate small side dishes served on the same plate as the main course. Business is good enough that they're talking about expanding to a larger location, which would be nice. I hope they can keep the same qualities that make their place a must-visit today.Still get 5 stars. Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine. Glllrrrbbbl. Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating. Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed. We love this place. They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa. Fortunately, they will be even closer to us :)We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant?).Beaver Balls are next on my list to try.
Las Pupusas Restaurant=I noticed how close I was to a milestone 600th review a few days ago. Since then, I've actually been stressing about it somewhat. Should it be another cool non-food destination like #500 (well, actually #499 after a stub-like review removal)? Should it be a hot new restaurant? Should it be a high-end restaurant that I haven't been to?I guess Yelp may have spoiled the reveal by now... it was none of the above. Instead, I went to an oft-overlooked restaurant in my own neighborhood. Although I have seldom heard about friends' experiences with this restaurant or with pupusas in general, they have all been positive. I decided to act today for lunch.Las Pupusas is located in the gigantic plaza on Stephanie and Sunset. It is one of several businesses between Hobby Lobby and Ross, and it could qualify as a hole in the wall. It's a little dim inside and the decor seems to try to bring back the feel of El Salvador. The facade-of-sorts over the back area is Mission-style, there are paintings about the old country, and the TV was broadcasting CentroamericaTV. I can make an educated guess that a lot of the patrons are from that part of the world too.Before I get into the food, I should state that this isn't a place for a quick lunch. It was still slammed after 1pm, with dirty dishes on tables owing to the lack of a busboy. That's right, there was only one employee running the whole front of house. This helps me somewhat mitigate the regret over the missed opportunities for lunch with friends, although we perhaps could have still ordered to-go to fit a visit here into the constraints of a lunch hour.I'd already browsed the menu, which is available in PDF with prices on their web site, but I had plenty of time to go through it again anyway. To get a feel for the variety of the restaurant, I decided to get a bunch of smaller items. Each of which was conveniently $1.95, which was generally a bargain for what I got. You can build a solid lunch out of 3-4 of these, but I ordered 5.First, the pupusas. Move over, arepas. While these bad boys aren't as big and there are significant differences, I'll take two of them over one of the arepas from most or all local restaurants when I'm craving something with a thick corn-based container and hot meat and cheese. These pupusas are sealed then cooked, and they have a disc-like shape, resembling a smashed sphere of dough or a flattened hockey puck. They're served with a refreshing, mild slaw on the side, but they don't have any plantains, and the mild tomato sauce is much less interesting than the green sauce that's served with arepas. Regardless, they're delicious.The revuelta was filled with refried beans, cheese, and "chicharron," a pork that is not at all the same as the fried pork rinds of Mexican cuisine. I actually couldn't decide whether I preferred this to the second pupusa, which was simply chicken with cheese (note: my order could have been less than absolutely specific, but I guess they don't offer a "revuelta" with chicken substitution). The corn flavor shined a bit more on the latter, and I couldn't really get much out of the refried beans anyway.I also tried their take on a pork tamale. Stop me if you know what I'm talking about when I say it bears a small resemblance to a Vietnamese food known as banh chung. While the fluffy corn masa is a far cry from the somewhat sticky rice and mung bean, the chunks of pork and the flavor from the banana leaf wrapping are definitely similar. I'm not sure whether dousing a tamale in that same tomato sauce is typical, and I didn't need more moisture, but an elderly woman who arrived later did just that. Be forewarned that the pork is concentrated in the middle half, so the edges are just corn dough if you decide to eat directionally instead of cutting it apart and evening out the meat and masa.Finally, I got to the two tacos that I'd ordered. They're not exactly the same fare that you'll get from most popular taco joints. They do start off with two corn tortillas per taco, but the diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce (with traces of onion) are a far cry from the typical cilantro and onion topping. They also lack a variety of salsas, instead providing a side of some ridiculously hot concoction that I'm sure would challenge even the spicy-tolerant.They're not bad for what they are though. The meat portions are huge, with cube-shaped pieces spilling out when I tried to eat them by hand instead of utensil. Both the carne asada and the al pastor are seasoned well and flavorful. Unfortunately, the carne asada was overcooked and dry (albeit not inedibly chewy), and the al pastor can't compare to some local taquerias. But that's because the latter are marvelous, not because the meat is bad here.Phew! I'm glad #600 was an overall success. I'll definitely come back to Las Pupusas for their namesake food and perhaps a tamale. I would even consider the entrees, burritos, or tortas, but I just won't expect a fast dine-in meal.
Culver's=Custard style ice cream? I am now completely spoiled and no trip to DQ will cut it. The husband keeps telling me we need to have some of their ice cream shipped up here-I keep explaining that it won't happen. The food is take it or leave it IMO, but even I was a fan of the bits of ice cream I had on my two visits here and definitely a super fan of their banana milkshake which could indeed bring all the boys to the yard. Damn right.
PT's=I actually just left there and couldn't wait to write a review.  I am so pissed off for the underhanded up charges.  Beer and bites my ass!I have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.I stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  Now here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  A basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? NOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why.
Saffron Flavors of India=The best Indian food I've had yet!! Hidden in a little corner on Craig and Tenaya... My boyfriend always told me about this place, but it had temporarily closed down due to the cook having to go back to India. I saw the reviews on here yesterday that it had reopened and I called to confirm. We went last night.  They are only open for dinner hours until they get their clientele back up.Soooo, for dinner we had the following -Shrimp KormaRogan Ghoshtand the mixed Tikka PlatterWe had everything on a 7 spice level, and it was perfect. Everything was delicious and I cannot wait to go back again.The Skinny: came in for their $12 lunch buffet and was greatly disappointed with the lack of selection and the quality of some of the items... for f*(k's sake they f^&ked up kheer (2) service was good - nothing special though (3) value: given the plethora of Indian restaurants offering buffets in the valley, this one ranks poorly with regards to price, selection and quality (2).Came in because we'd heard they were starting to do lunch buffets. Add the recent promotion of $2 off, we were psyched to try it out especially when it's a lot closer to our neck of the woods.I was really surprised by the lack of selection available considering the price. For $12, there were 8 hot items (including rice) with a small salad/fruit bar and kheer.But this would be okay if the food was fantastic across the board. However it missed the mark. Of all of the dishes, the standout was the Goan Fish Curry. The fish had a lovely texture while the curry was wonderfully mellow. However, you were pretty much dumpster diving to look for pieces of fish in the curry. Other than that, everything else was okay (lamb masala, chana masala, paneer masala) to not-so-great.Of the not so great items was the dal (bland), the orange chicken (soggy, overly sweet --- I'm not sure how this fits in with everything else - this s*(t is about as American as apple pie), and the kheer. I have to take a minute about how they messed up the kheer. Not only did they cheap out on the rice (they used some sort of long grain instead of basmati), they may have used leftover rice to make it with the rather large clumps of rice emerging from the pudding. If you stirred the rice while you were cooking it, this doesn't happen. In addition, the rice was undercooked and hard. Plus you don't even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all.  Bleh. Major turn off. The garlic naan came to the table nice and hot and flavourful. However texturally, it was a little too hard, a little too doughy and not enough flakiness. Sporting a tomato chutney, an unpleasantly weak mint chutney (where's the mango chutney?) and a rather watery raita, I was disappointed by the lack of pickles and other condiments normally seen at other places.Given the plehtora of places available in the valley that offer better selection, better quality and overall better prices, I'd skip this place for the lunch buffet. 2 starred review.
Fuego Tacos=I really have to gush about this place!I had a business meeting, and we were supposed to meet at the Merc. Their signage was completely wrong and they never opened when they said they were going to. So, we walked around the corner and saw Fuego Tacos.I've been to the Bistro once, so I knew it was a safe place to go. It was just after 5 and the place was about half-full downstairs. I noticed the upstairs was empty. I asked if we could sit up there and we were given our choice of tables.Our server was amazing! He immediately brought us chips and salsa and took our drink orders. He brought me two drinks! I'm ok with that, because usually I'm used to having servers who don't keep up with my drinks. (Diet Coke, FYI)The chips were freshly made, and the salsa was good. We ordered a plate of nachos to share with pork on top. It's one of the best plates of nachos I've had in a very long time. We all devoured them.As I was getting up to leave, our server brought me a Diet Coke in a to-go cup. I didn't even ask for it but wow! I'm going back, most definitely. The prices were reasonable and there was a good crowd in there. Oh, and they were playing 80s music. That pretty much gives the place 500 cool points.Finally decided to try out Fuego tacos and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.... that I didn't come sooner. First I have to say that Matt (our waiter) was awesome. Attentive, nice, accommodating, and friendly. I say this because it is just about opposite of my experience everywhere else I go. I just assumed that it's normal for your waiter to be snarky and ignore their customers. He seems to prove that theory wrong. I'm usually cheap and give out only a 10-12% tip for the usual lack of service I receive, but Matt earned the full 20.Awesome just doesn't come close to describing the meal. It started with the salsa and chips and kept going all the way through dessert. I know it's usually chips an salsa, but the real star there is the salsa, so you have to say it first. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce, the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip. Wife and I shared both the pernil (pork) and shirt rib barbacoa (beef) tacos, either way you choose it, it's a great dish. Although I did like the short rib tacos slightly better than the pork. The tacos come with sides of both rice and black beans. I've made black beans before, and they don't even compare. Like trying to compare a huffy bicycle to a Ducati motorcycle - they just don't. Our meal was followed up with a slice of cake covered with a mango and pineapple reduction. I will definitely be back sooner rather than later.Expect to pay about $12 - $14 per plate after tax / tip, a few more if you order drinks, apps, and / or dessert.If you've read any of my other reviews, you might just know that I'm driven by good food with a great value, and as such. You can find usually grab a deal on (choose one) $5for$10 on yelp / groupon, or $25off$35 from restaurant-com; yes I did use a deal for myself. While normally you can feel the glares of the wait staff whenever you pull out your coupon, Matt made us feel like it was no big thing and was happy to serve us! I had such a good experience, that I might even consider **gasp** coming without a coupon **/gasp*
Amaro Italiano Ristorante=Stop on in for a glass of glass.  Pass on by for sass with class.I've been to places I wasn't thrilled with, but have never felt such a need to vent on Yelp.First, the backstory.  I used to live in Tempe and frequent Kazimierz in Old Town Scottsdale.  Memories of that place hold a dear place in my heart.  My family, and now some of my boyfriend's family, live near Amaro.  With the association, they thought it would be cool to check it out.And now, the rest of the story.  The two former Kazimierz employees learned nothing from their time there.  The first tastes of a place are the service and atmosphere.  Strike one and two.  We were greeted by sloppy dress and served by a brat.  At Kazimierz, if you wanted a cozy nook for 8 on an early Saturday evening, you'd need a reservation.  At Amaro, don't bother... there's no need.  Also, nooks?  Yes.  Cozy?  No.The last straw.  My dad found a large piece of glass in his drink.  With the attitude of the server, he brought it to the attention of the owner... who really could not have given a damn, though he finally halfassedly offered to buy my parents a round upon their next visit.  At this point, we were just trying to get a human reaction to such poor service.The food and drinks (other than them not being able to make a Bloody Mary) were great, really.  What brings me here, and gives Amaro their third strike, is the snide way in which our complaint was met.  Upon waving a white flag at forcing reason, our usually laid back party was making our way outta there.  I'd gone to the restroom, and ducked into where we'd been sitting to grab my purse.  As I joined the others, I overheard the owner laugh and say, "And don't come back."If I treated my customers with such unwarranted disdain from the get go, I'd be told to start finessing my resume.  Maybe that's just what Kazimierz did.
Good Food=Everything they make is incredible. I've been consuming gallons of their soup. Seriously, some of the best soup around. Last week I tried the Chicken Tortilla soup, and it blew my mind. Plus, the people who work that cart are super friendly. I've only been to the cart near the Walgreen's on Cap Square, but I reckon the food is equally delicious at their other location.Worth the praise. Top-notch, y'all.
Someburros=Dropped by for lunch recently.  The restaurant is one of those 'Tweener' places that's not quite fast food, not quite sit down.  You order at a counter and they bring the food out to you.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=DfsU-CsIddif5KvRj2aeQAAfter browsing the menu, decided to go with the Carne Asada Burro (Steak, Beans, Rice and Pico de Avocado, $4.95).  It comes with complimentary Chips & Salsa and you can refill your Chips.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=NHAjUA3KMYUy-V8y5i1myAThey have a bottle of Hot Salsa on the table for you to use.  It's not too Spicy, but better than Mild Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=vDjj2E6e0LU0j7BHBI9PYQThe Burro was just OK, nothing special.  The food was fresh but just lacked that extra special flavor to make it great.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=nl6zwg9DykIVa0VqehHnYQOverall, it was a A-OK experience.Return Factor - 30%
Pho MaiLan=I drove by Pho MaiLan all the time going home. This is located on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. And finally i just decided to give this place a try.I give it a thumbs up!This is a Vietnamese noodle house.I ordered the pork with vermicelli and it came with the noodles. The portions are pretty big it filled me up pretty quickly.  The pork and the noodles were awesome! The pork was marinated to perfection and it was not chewy or tough. It was just perfect along with the vermicelli. The noodles were nice and fresh along with the veggies that came with it. You can tell everything was just cooked and not sitting in the fridge for a long time.I also ordered the fresh Vietnamese roll. That too was really good. Inside the fresh wrapped were veggies and vermicelli. You dip the rolls into this peanut butter base type sauce, which is mmmm mmmmm gooood!Overall:The service is great they filled your water up and did not have to be told.They have free Wifi so if you wanted to get some work done you can.This place is nice and quiet , really relaxing, different from those loud Pho places.I highly recommend this place. This is a must try. This goes on my top list of Vietnamese places to eat.Talk about some real vietnamese food being delivered right to your door step ( 3 mile radius, I am 7 miles away almost got turned down but talked him out of it, yessir!) Thanks to the pictures of food and the menus on yelp which helped out awhole lot. The phone order was easy and smooth. It took about an hour due to 2 deliveries before mine but well worth the wait. We ordered the crispy fried spring rolls, Pho Tai Bo Vien, Combo vermincelli, vietnamese sausage and marinated slice pork vermincelli, and kalbi ribs with rice. The food was very fresh and really flavorful, everything was really tasty especially the broth of my pho, the kalbi ribs was the best, tender and packed with flavor.My family and I loved every bite. We will be ordering more to come.I really like this Vietnamese restaurant. The food is always good, service is always friendly and the place is always clean...and doesn't smell funky. I used to come here a lot when my office was still in Anthem. I would always get a bowl of pho or grilled pork chop.Pho:I normally get a bowl of pho with any of the following: brisket, flank, and steak. The broth is excellent. They have different combinations including one with salmon. 5/5Summer Rolls:Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper. The 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. 5/5Roasted Pork Spring Rolls:Roasted pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper.  Again, the 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. The pork slices have that grilled taste to them. 5/5Bun Dac Biet:Fried egg rolls, grilled pork, pork sausage, grilled shrimp, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and peanuts on top of vermicelli. You get that vinegar + fish sauce on the side. My friend who absolutely hates egg rolls loved it. 5/5The service here is always great. I joke around with the employees. In general, the place is clean but sometimes it takes them a while to clear out tables."Please Review Us On www.yelp.com" is what it reads from the bottom of last night's dinner receipt. OK, you talked me into it. Here's the review you requested...Thanks to fellow Yelpers for some wonderful reviews and photos, I decided to try this place last night for dinner, and am very glad I did.Located on Eastern, north of Sunridge Heights en route toward Anthem in a small strip center next to Lee's Liquors.1st things 1st...Clark County Health District issued this restaurant an A Rating, as of last night 13 August 2015. So any reviews you may read prior to this date regarding anything other than an A Rating does not pertain to the current status of excellence. See photo below.The service was exceptional...friendly, fast, and accurate.The ambience was very pleasant to dine with a contemporary interior design of walls/ceiling, open floor plan, nice use of soft colors, plenty of modern lighting, low volume background music from the radio station 106.5FM, and two TVs; football and CNBC w/ subtitles.It took less than 10 minutes for my food to arrive. My Jasmine iced tea was served within 1 minute of my asking. From 7pm to 8pm, the place was almost packed with over 50 tables/booths + handling take-out patrons and I had exceptional service. Needless to say, they were well staffed. Pho MaiLan last night was clean reasonably priced for a better than average Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas.Food...ordered too much but managed to devour it all, thanks to wonderful chefs in the back.Started w/ an appetizer of A4. Nem Nuon Cuon, which are roasted pork spring rolls. The roasted pork is wrapped in rice paper w/ crispy rolls & fresh herbs, served w/ the chef's special sauce. Very good! $6 See photo below.P1. Pho Dac Biet - MaiLan Combo Special. This is a better than average tasting beef noodle soup w/ sliced round-eyed steak, brisket, marble brisket, flank, tendon, tripe, and meatballs. I thought the meatballs were the best of all the meats in this large Pho bowl. I added the fresh basil, bean sprouts, and squeezed a couple wedges of lime for extra flavor. I love to dress up my Pho w/ Sriracha & Hoisin sauces, w/ a few small scoops of chili sauce. I really liked their fancy wood chopstix, instead of the cheap kind that you typically break apart often w/ splinters. Very classy touch! It's a good thing I am ambidextrous as I was able to scoop the broth w/ the spoon in my left hand, while utilizing the chopstix w/ my right. Too bad I got splashed. I have yet to master the art of eating Pho w/o getting my clothing splashed, Mouthwatering good! $8.50 See before/after photos below.Lastly, I tried their BM2. Banh Mi Thit Nuong sandwich, includes grilled marinated pork. Delectable. $5.Pho MaiLan was the recipient of 2015 Best of Las Vegas Review Journal Poll. I can now understand why. In the famous words of Arnold, "i'll be back!"
Brit & Chips=Do one thing, do it well - This is what Brit and Chips was born for!I was here around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening, it's a small joint and it was getting full quickly but they do have a take out counter. Seating is a mix of bar stools and tables. Brit atmosphere is complete with Beatles music in the background.Nice menu variety, was surprised to see tandoori popcorn shrimps so I wanted to try that immediately and it was delicious. I ordered sour cream and onion batter sole and my friend got the maple syrup haddock - both were very tasty and cooked well, however the batter was thicker on mine. Crispy on the outside, moist inside.Fries were thick cut, not too soggy. Simple ingredients that turn into savoury satisfaction! If you're still feeling for some greasy goodness, I dare you to try their deep fried dessert ;)I'm also digging their British Ben Shaws soda, I drank up the "cloudy lemonade" which is a perfect balance of sweet and sour that got my taste buds tingling.  I'll be back for more and I'm making sure to tell everyone!My last meal in Montreal did not rhyme with wooteen sadly, but it did feature a firey fish and chips number from this fine establishment. This part of town looks as if it recently came into some money, so it has a more posh exterior than the rest of Montreal, and while it lacks that North American Euro anytown look and feel so pervasive in the rest of the city, I kind of like it. It's clean, well maintained, and pretty quiet.But, enough about that...onto the food! The fish was fried expertly, with a crisp finish and flaky interior. The chips were fat, plump and greased up just so to give off that perfect glisten. I had the poisson du mois, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. This particular mois featured a sole with jerk batter that gave the fish a wee bit of kick.I also love the origin story of the place that is on the menu, on the wall, and even on the paper in the basket, below the fish and chips.
Mr. Sandwich=Looking for good banh mi? How about fresh, flavorful spring rolls? Or maybe you're in the mood for boba? Well, you don't have to search any longer because Mr. Sandwich delivers on all these levels and more! Not only is Mr. Sandwich convenient and wallet/credit card friendly (no minimum purchase required here!), they also have Free Wifi! Yes! So you can nibble on Vietnamese eats while surfing the web- a perfect match. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi- flavorful pieces of chicken and pickled veggies sandwiched between a buttery, crispy baguette. Quite delicious. I also ordered Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls ($3)- Two nicely sized spring rolls packed with lettuce, green onion, cilantro, shrimp and pork, with a side of sweet, slightly spicy peanut dipping sauce. Fresh and healthy. The place is clean and the workers are friendly- extra points. I think I found my new hangout in Chinatown when I'm in need of Internet and tasty treats.Mr. Sandwich is  little strip mall place in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain near Valley View. It specializes in Banh Mi, the Vietnamese sandwich with the French heritage and bun. They have about 30 different varieties, and they all cost $3.24! They also have the drinks popularized in Taiwan and now ubiquitous in Asian establishments, MIlk Teas and Boba. Slushies with Boba (Tapioca balls) too. They are also $3.24! There are a handful of tables, some candy machines, and a few odds and ends variety store items to increase the store's total revenue potential. The sandwiches are ok. Pretty decent size. Not the best Banh Mi, but it is hard to beat their price/taste ratio.BANH MI BATTLE: HUE THAI vs MR. SANDWICHMr. Sandwich is the satellite restaurant to Hue Thai. Its a seemingly 'new'--but not really--banh mi place that's smack-dab in the middle of prime-time Chinatown. I am a lover of Hue Thai. But while they're sister restaurants, Mr. Sandwich knows his banh mi just a little bit better.I was bored one day and worked up a big appetite. I decided to run a side-by-side comparison: Mr. Sandwich vs Hue Thai. It was the only way to really know who served up a better banh mi. I ordered a House Special or (b√°nh m√¨ c bit) at both locations. While the veggie and meat comparison yielded the sandwiches as equals. The bread is why Mr. Sandwich cuisine reigned Supreme (ha). The Hue Thai baguette didn't compare to the buttery-deliciousness of Mr. Sandwich. And texturally, it was a little tough and a tad bit too crispy. I'm a die hard Dakao fan. But Mr. Sandwich is a few blocks closer to the strip and just  a few minutes off I-15. Every time I go, there's never a line and my order is served up quick and ready to-go. I'm never in there longer than 7 minutes. So Mr. Sandwich--essentially 'Hue Thai Express'--and his good and quick food has made his way into my regular quick-bite stops. CREDIT CARDS: SUPER+, they don't have a problem with me using my credit card on a $4 sandwich. **I also work the Phan Xiu Mai, or Viet meatballs, into my order. Just as good as Hue Thai, served with a better baguette.
Growlers Pourhouse=In the ever evolving NoDa neighborhood, the space that used to be Niche and was Mamalu's before that, Jeff and Paul bring you Growlers Pourhouse.  On the corner and next to their other incarnation, the Crepe Cellar, GPH is a guy's bar that is girl friendly.The old world charm starts as soon as you walk through the huge antique Chinese estate door and it continues as you belly up to the bar next to the 1936 beer engine tapping cellar temperature craft beers.The chalkboard menu next to the bar lists the craft drafts by genre and it is hard to ignore the local staple, Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Especially with it being $1 on weekdays and $2 on Friday and Saturday.  That beer special alone should keep the lights on.The other chalkboard on the wall boasts the origin of their oysters on the half shell.  When you order food, they bring you an old spice (not the afters shave) box that houses your hot sauces, napkins, and crackers.The menu starts with the lighter fare such as chips and dips, truffle popcorn, and a few salads and then takes a turn with the oysters and peel and eat PBR shrimp.  The meat of the business seems to be the sausages and brats though.  From the potentially gut ripping chili cheese dog with peppers and onions to the Veganator option there is something for everyone.  I had the turkey apple sausage with the house mustard and it was quite tasty.The dessert portion of the menu is just as fun with marshmallows made in house for smores and nanner puddin'.The place is peppered with flat panel televisions and has the potential to be the place in NoDa to watch football on Sundays.  If only Jeff weren't a Cleveland Browns fan...Cask beer, you say? Indeed I'll have a pint! While I'm no ale aficionado, I was really excited to hear about this sweet new pourhouse (with cask beers and 1930s growlers) in NoDa. Naturally, hubs and I dropped in for a quick pint and bite to check out Growlers. I love love love the feel of Growlers, with the exposed brick on one side, cask ales, laid back approach and teeny space, it's definitely a place you want to keep coming back to. Service was friendly and knowledgeable and the bartender helped me choose my ale of the day - the Orange Blossom Pilsner. As previously mentioned, I'm not a big beer drinker but I really enjoyed my pint. I dug the orange essence and the smooth finish. As for the food, I only tried the beer cheese dip - which had great flavor, I just wish it was a bit thicker. Being that I went to school in Madison, WI I'm pretty picky about my cheese...especially beer cheese!Overall, I'm really excited to come back to Growlers. It's a great neighborhood bar with a super cool concept and interesting menu. Looking forward to my next trip...word on the street is that the bread pudding is amazing!Those craftbeer signs had my curiosity piqued for a while and I was beginning to wonder when they'd reopen this space in NoDa. I'm very glad for this addition to the area! Growlers has a great atmosphere that just engulfs you right when you walk in through those awesome wooden doors. From the exposed brick walls, to the beer tap lined bar, to the cool tables in the middle, Growlers is a great place to hang out with a pint of good beer. Place was packed on a Saturday night, but service was still prompt and friendly. Only got to enjoy a few beers, but will def be back to try some of the food. And by food I mean cheese. I love cheese and beer.i absolutely love the feel of this place. It's not all that big unless i missed a section hiding in back, but everything just felt right. It's the kind of place that i would almost like to see without any televisions and totally embrace an old school whistle-wetting, watering hole feel with the sole mission to drink and socialize. That being said, the tvs seemed to be nicely situated throughout.   i was very pleased to see their beer list had a nice little variety (like 14 on tap and the cask selection). They had a choice for brown, belgian, IPA, stout, pilsner, seasonal, etc. but also included a single representative from the basic American beer family. A go-to cheap beer choice in the PBR ($1 weekdays, $2 on the weekends) It's nice to have that option in case you drink beyond the need for a good tasting beer (no offense, i am old friends with PBR) or are just in one of those moods where it seems downright foolish to pass up any beer that could literally be found on a dollar menu! As Mrs. P. stated,  the toppings on the sausages were very tasty and were in fact better than the Italian sausage itself. The mustard was pretty good also.Our server who we will call Bethany (not her real name) was fantastic and we shall return.I was expecting more testosterone, for some reason - maybe ze German influences had clouded my hopes. But the massive door giving way to raw materials and polished concrete, the sausage party menu, the pulls meant to be grasped by some village-conquering Viking with a serious thirst, it all blended into comfy, impressive, trust us to serve you top notch beer-chic. Oh, you wanted a nibble too? Have a (CLT's first!!!) beer/cheese pairing party. We have 5 varieties to sample, a beer for each delicious slice. Served with crackers, honey and a comb, this could be din-din if you lean more toward a liquid diet.Yeah, we have pretzels and mustard. The 'zel isn't homemade, and you need to order it salt-light, but tastes straight off a best-case-scenario corner cart in NYC, slightly sweet, charred, soft and chewy. The mustard, ground in back, impressive.It's a bummer they felt a lack of confidence in the crowd this place is built to serve - we don't need the thrill of a game to coax us into dropping cashwads on really good beer. But there they are, the bet-hedgers - TVs every 5 feet. Beer cheese needed a kick of mustard, tabasco, something. Chips came out a tad cold.Who cares. Prost!We came here just because we were waiting on a table at Crepe Cellar and then we ended up getting full on bar snacks! We tried the fries, the wings, the pretzel, the fried chicken taco, a portobello sandwich and the chicken skins. I would recommend getting two tacos and a beer to anyone coming here for a quick bite to eat. The fried chicken taco was the best thing I tried. The wings were ok, I like wings fried hard and these weren't. The fries were good but not a must. The chicken skins I would skip - kind of gimmicky and $7. Our friend had the sandwich and the pretzel and he didn't say anything bad about them and finished both. I didn't expect to like this place because it was dark and packed. They've got booths but you kind of seat yourself? The waitresses were all "in a mood" like they were mad they had to be there. Not really a welcoming vibe.As for drinks, funny to see a shandy on the menu out of season but I would recommend the Shandy the Elder. Really refreshing and light - I'd drink another anytime!
Mood Restaurant=First off, this place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Worst service I've ever had.It was my friends birthday, and his girlfriend planned everything. There was 14 of us, and she made reservations. Everyone was so upset over the awful service and food, I felt bad. It wasn't her fault it was so horrible. Most people at the table complained. I didn't want to add to that and make her feel worse, so I promised I would write about it on Yelp.The waiters were awful. Horrible attitude, didn't refill drinks, pretty much demanded we hand them things instead of getting it themselves. The portions were small, and not worth the price. Everyone but one person was missing a dish/drink or more. When people politely asked about their dishes/drinks, the waiters said, "Oh.". Not, "I'm sorry" "I will check on that"... Nothing. It seemed like we were inconveniencing them. The food was missing things, not cooked properly or enough and very small. The crab cake appetizer was small, and not flavored well at all. The lamb dinner was not good either...we asked for medium. It was barely pan seared, and it was practically pink on the outside. It didn't even come with the green sauce promised. The lobster Mac and cheese - the waiter, " It's amazing, I highly recommend it, we're known for it." It was extremely salty and tasted like boxed Mac and powdery cheese with two small pieces of lobster. Cesar salad - don't know. We never got it and were never asked if we still wanted it. They charged us $140 for 3 drinks, lobster Mac and cheese, small lamb chops and two crab cakes. They charged everyone 20% gratuity. It's usually 18%, but the waiter didn't even deserve that. He didn't even care to serve us much less care if we were even there. Do not eat here. Save your money and eat somewhere else before going to the Artisan. The hotel itself is awesome for the ambiance. But the restaurant...I promise, you are missing nothing.
SC Prime Steakhouse=On my last trip to Vegas we dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  When we lived in Vegas, we would dine here 2 or 3 times a year.  It was nice to come back to experience it again.  We love the views here and got lucky with a table next to the window.  Situated in Summerlin, which is about 10 miles NW of the Strip, you have a great view of the city from here.I couldn't wait to order my favorite items on the menu...which they still had:Wedge Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing, Bacon, Cherry Tomatoes), $812 oz Filet, $38Side of Potatoes Au Gratin, $7The Lettuce on the Salad was nice and fresh...very crisp and juicy, just the way I like it.  I like my Filet cooked between Medium and Medium Well...not too well done....they hit the mark, it was perfect.  The side of Potatoes Au Gratin was good, very large portion though....enough for 2 people.We had a great server who took very good care of us.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty....that's the way it should be.Overall, it's a nice place to have a good Steak with friends.Return Factor - 95%
Addiction Restaurant=This place could easily be a 4 or 4.5 star restaurant but it was an accumulation of little things that made me subtract the star and a half.  First, when I got to the podium, there was no one around.  Immediately behind me at the bar were 3 employees.  They all saw me, yet not one said a word--not so much as a "someone will be right there" or "let me go get someone."  Nothing, nada!  Several minutes went by and a woman appeared from a door which turned out to be the kitchen.  She then seated me.  Little thing #1.I had a Groupon and she asked to see it.  When I loaded it on my iPhone she stated she wasn't sure they were doing it that way.  They wanted a paper printout.  At that point I was ready to leave so she said she'd talk to the manager.  He agreed to take the Groupon number if they could copy my ID.  What?  Little thing #2.There are 6 entrees on the dinner menu and 6 items on the dessert menu.  They forgot one item from my steak and they were out of bananas for the dessert.  Their banana supplier had not yet been there.  Little thing getting bigger #3.Charge for a second iced tea at $3.  It was a partial refill. I had 1/3 left when she asked if I wanted more.  Bigger little thing #4.Now for the meal--it was superb!  I got the 8 ounce filet which was on a bed of garlic-onion mashed potatoes (the menu says puree, but it isn't).  There were 5 stalks of grilled asparagus for the seasonal vegetable (they were perfect!), and the drizzled Port syrup was very tasty.  The crispy tater strings were forgotten or maybe they hadn't been delivered yet, either.For dessert, I had the Gossip Sundae--green tea ice cream on powdered crispy wontons with butter rum caramel sauce, caramelized bananas, and walnuts.  Of course, the bananas were missing.Plating for the entree and dessert were nicely done.  I looked at some of the photos for the restaurant to see what I should have gotten.  I sure wish they had gotten their delivery!I'm not sure if I'll give Addiction another chance.  It is good, but there are too many little things that just add up to a subtraction in the enjoyment of the meal.The ambiance and decor of Addiction matches perfectly with my birthday dinner dress-- that's honestly probably the only reason why I chose to go to eat at Addiction for my 25th celebration. On that note, physically,Addiction lived up to all my expectations. Someone even said it looked like a rockstar's girlfriend's room, and quite frankly, I would love to be a rockstar's girlfriend if I get to live in a place like Addiction. Unfortunately, plans changed and instead of sticking to my 6PM reservations, the gang and I decided to opt for brunch so we can make it to Marquee to see Kaskade. Bust on both parts. While the food itself delivered quite well, nobody at the table had anything to complain about, it was so painfully slow service that earned them just two stars. We awkwardly walked into the dining area, with not a soul there to greet us. When the host/waiter seated us and took our order, we seriously had our suspicions that he was the host/waiter/chef. Not even joking. It took our salads and sandwiches a whopping 45minutes to come out-- and we were the only table there! Luckily, I purchased a restaurant.com voucher for $50 and our bill came out to about $12/person. Not too shabby for a meal in Vegas at all.The whole setting of the restaurant and hotel is quite interesting.. it almost looks like an upscale motel. Am I addicted to Addiction? Nope. Won't be back again unless someone else wants to do their birthday there!
Rancho De Tia Rosa=Love this place! Every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They have great prices on food and great drinks! My favorite is the 3 tacos appetizer. You get a chicken, steak and pork taco wrapped in corn tortillas. A lot of Mexican food places in AZ are hit and miss, this place has great tasting everything, down to the beans and chips and salsa. Each Mexican food places I like, I like for different reasons, because of a certain dish, or what I am in the mood for. I wish I could combine 3 different Mexican food places around the valley to make 1 delicious one haha. This place has always grabbed my attention because of their tacos and tequila specials! I also have a friend who loves this place too, so its our little spot to have a great meal, great conversation and surrounded by fun people for a good night.I am certain when you come here you wont be disappointed! Check out their happy hour when you can. Keep it up Tia Rosa!
Vegas Express Sushi=Vegas Express Sushi (VES) can be found all over Vegas.  They are usually the supplier for premade sushi at supermarkets and the like.However, there are a handful of locations that will make some basic sushi items for you on the spot.  Mind you, this isn't a place to sit and dine, but rather to order and go.  They don't offer anything fancy in terms of a sushi bar to view the goods either.  Their menu is simple and to the point.At this particular location, they also sell alkaline water and Filipino goods.  Yes, their specialty is water and Filipino items from the dried, canned or frozen.  We were pleasantly surprised with all the different items that had stocked in this little market.  I'm sure there's a markup versus visiting Seafood City, but it saves you the gas money in this case.Nonetheless, it's your local water source, Filipino grocery store, and take out sushi joint.
Q to U BBQ=Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt.Second visit and I see what I was missing.... It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. $10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation.One of Kiddo's friends had a birthday party up in Anthem, which is very far from where we live.  So rather than drive back home and come back to get him, we decided to make a night out of it.  After we dropped him off at the party, we drove around and spotted this place using the Yelp app.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:Brisket, Ribs combo platter w/Slaw & Fries, $13.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQ#0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmw#bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmwPork, Ribs combo platter w/Beans & Slaw, $13.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUw#ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Q#MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4w#bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4wThe joint is pretty small and we were there during the peak dinner hour, so it got packed.  Luckily we found a table.  After a little while the food came out.  We were starving, so it had no chance to last very long.  I had the Brisket & Ribs.  The Brisket was very good....juicy and full of smokey flavor.  The Ribs were ok, not the best I've ever had, but good.I sampled some of The Better Half's Pork....that was very good too.  The Slaw is outstanding.I think this place is family owned....everyone there was nice and accommodating.  Too bad it's in BFE, otherwise I'd eat here more often.Return Factor - 95%
Weera Thai=I am usually not a big Thai food gal.I will say it: I take Vietnamese over Thai any day of the week. Not even looking back, asking questions or wondering what I missed.Because in my experience - I never really missed much.Don't get me wrong; I enjoy pads, tom kah kai, curries and papaya salad once in a while, and really, nothing is wrong with them. They are even quite good, most of the time. But what makes me really sad is that I KNOW that they are only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many, many other treasures to be found. Well, eaten. But most places don't bother, or choose to "hide" these culinary pearls in secret menus that I am too scared to request upon ordering after being told once that they don't exist.Bummer.Now you can lure me in anyway. And Weera Thai did just that, with the promise of Issan food. Northern Thai Issan cuisine is more sour and spicy than Central Thai food and is cooked in hot chili peppers, rice powder, served with sticky rice. The result? My nom tok which was thinly sliced grilled beef with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili. Just to die for, and accompanied by the best tamarind-based sauce ever. There are a whole variety of similar dishes using beef, pork, duck and fish.Not in the mood for Issan?What about crispy pilot fish stir fried with Thai holy basil? Or ground pork stir fried with Thai holy basil & preserved duck egg? Or squid sauteed in a garlic, cilantro and pepper sauce?And for the least adventurous, Weeara does classics as well, and perfectly so. The simple spring rolls and the crab sticks we ordered were by far the best I have ever had. Fresh and vibrant - they redefined what they could be in the best of worlds. Wide rice noodles had just the right bite, and the green curry of my friend was outstanding.Skip Lotus of Siam, and come here. To top it all, service is absolutely darling!I'm a fan. Lunch specials every day -- that includes weekends -- are from 11am - 3pm. Each item includes soup, egg roll, salad, and rice. And they don't skimp on portion size. Chance are you'll leave satisfied. The yellow curry was awesome, although could have had a little more chicken. Pad Thai and the cashew nut chicken were excellent too. Service was friendly and quick and prices are inexpensive.I love Thai food. I know it is not the healthiest type of food out there nor is it doing me any favors in my quest to lose the rest of the baby weight, but I love it nevertheless. We have been here on a number of occasions for lunch and I have been pleased with my dish and service on all of those occasions.From the exterior it looks like a dumpy place next to a massage parlor on Sahara, but as usual the interior tells a different story. It is warm and inviting with elegant decor on the inside. The service has always been friendly and to the point.We tried their special which was Red Snapper in Panang sauce, and wow! It was such a flavorful dish masterfully prepared. Beware though, it is a large portion and enough for both my husband and I to share. We have also tried their appetizer sampler and absolutely loved it. It is rare to order a sampler and love everything on the plate, but I did. It consisted of cream cheese ragoons, stuffed chicken wings, spring rolls with several types of sauce including peanut, and sweet and sour type varying in intensity. I also enjoyed their combination drunken noodles with a generous portion of meats and shrimp. I intend on sampling more of their menu, but it is also hard not to stick to the dishes I've already tried since they are so good!I highly recommend this place!I was looking for a good Thai restaurant here in Vegas. We found this restaurant using the reviews and Yelp and other internet options. This is pretty much a locals place, as it's far away from the touristy areas. Entering we are greeted right away and seated. I notice most of the crowd was Asian of various flavors. Me and one or two others were the only white folks in here. I guess that's a good sign of good food! We start with Thai Iced Teas as we look over the extensive menu. The tea was just the right strength and not over loaded with ice. One of the things that made me choose Weera Thai Restaurant was they featured Issan regional Thai food selections. I have never heard of this before so it seems like a good time to give it a try as I've had most of all the standard dishes served in the US. Our first selection was the Thai Stuffed Chicken wings. ($9.95) The wings were a good version, not too heavy on the glass noodles and good tasting ground chicken and pork inside. Next we tried the soup, Tom Yum Kung. I've had this soup at various Thai places and this was one of the better ones. Just ordering the smaller size was enough for 2 people. ($8.95) Following the soup, we had from the Issan section , Larb with chicken. ($9.95) Another dish I've had, so I could compare. Very good version with the limey flavor coming through. Then to start our entrees we had the Nom Tok Moo, from the Issan section. ($10.95) This was thin slices of grilled pork with rice powder, spices, lime juice & chili. This was not one of the better dishes. The pork was a bit dry and tough. The taste was very similar to Chinese BBQ pork. I wouldn't get this dish again. Following the pork, we had the Panang Curry ($10.95). The rice was extra ($2.00). Charging for rice when you already order curry? I thought that was a bit nickle and diming the customer. The Panang Curry was flavored well and was not too spicy. You can order all spiciness levels for most of the dishes here. As you can see we ordered way more food than we could eat, so I was glad our hotel had a full kitchen and fridge to bring all our leftovers to. The food really adds up when you go a bit wild, our bill was around $70.00 bucks including tax and tip. A bit high for a Thai dinner for two, but what the hell, I'm on vacation!I think if I lived here in Vegas, this would be one of my Thai restaurants I might come back to maybe to try some other things. I was looking for some things that I don't find at every other Thai restaurant in the US. The Issan selection wasn't impressing me as any ultimately tasty treat at all. Most of the dishes here I've seen or had before, so no impressive innovations going on here.The service was very cordial and professional, not really friendly in a chit chatty way, but they get the job done. Most Asian restaurants, the servers are there to get the job done and not be your friend. The prices here are pretty much in line with most Thai places with entrees averaging $11 each.
Off the Strip Just Real Food=The "Off the Strip" location in Southern Highlands has gotten some great reviews not just from Yelp but from almost every other review site out there. So, when I found out that they have a new location close to my house I decided to finally check them out. It's located on Tropicana a few blocks west of Fort Apache in a small strip mall. When you first walk in, the bar will be straight ahead, the dining area to the right, and a lounge area with pool tables and dart boards to the left. This is a gaming establishment so they've got all the usual bar-side games as well. I'm not sure how much redecorating they've done since they took over this space from the previous gaming tavern because there are some design elements that don't exactly fit the Italian/New American cuisine they serve. The bar is covered with a tin roof and there's a lot of fake wood lining the top sections of the walls (a la crown molding).The customer service was fabulous. The second we walked in the bartender and manager (I think ?) welcomed us and acted like we were regulars there. We were seated in the dining area, where there was only one other party. Throughout our dinner we were served by the manager and a waiter. Drinks were brought out quickly, orders taken soon after, water was refilled often, and we didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. The manager stopped by a few times to check if we liked the food and chatted a bit. He talked about everything from  the fresh ingredients they use to wine in Germany compared to wine from California to being retired from the military and taking this job to help out his friends. Our 2-year old son was with us and a few seconds after we sat down the waiter brought over a couple coloring books and crayons for him to play with. Very nice touch. They don't have a kids menu but the manager offered to make him some boneless wings and fries after asking us what he likes/doesn't like. Their menu isn't very large and they said they don't have everything that the Southern Highlands location offers. But, based on the items we tried the quality and execution of the dishes are excellent.We started off with the NY Asparagus ($12.00) -- thin slices of NY strip wrapped around asparagus and grilled. There are two per order and they come out in a mushroom sauce that is delicious. What a great concept -- wrapping asparagus in meat. That's a sure way to get me to eat vegetables. For entrees, we ordered the Rigatoni alla Vodka ($17.00) and the Lobster Ravioli ($22.00). The sauces for both looked and tasted the same which, according to their menu, consists of a vodka cream sauce with tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, and shallots. Both dishes were very good, although I thought the lobster dish was too heavily sauced and took away from the flavor of the lobster and ricotta filling of the ravioli. The chunks of lobster could have been larger in my opinion, as well.The entrees came with a side salad (choice of house or caesar). We tried both and enjoyed them. It was nice to see the salad served as small portions, like they should be, and NOT ridiculously huge Cheesecake Factory-sized portions. The entrees, however, were big. But, I'm not complaining because now we have dinner for the next night since we each only had half of our entree.Even though we were stuffed, they brought out a complimentary slice of cheesecake. It was rich, creamy and smooth New York Style cheesecake with a few strawberries and a little whipped cream on the side. Between the three of us it didn't last long.I don't think the food was perfect and the dishes we had probably rate closer to 4-star quality. But the service was so friendly, so excellent that I have to round up and give them 5-stars. It's a great neighborhood hangout and a cheaper alternative to other Italian/American places on the strip.They have $2 domestic drafts for happy hour and, from what we were told, on Mondays and Tuesdays the food is 25% off.Was invited to a friend's Birthday party here the other night.  They reserved an area to the left side of the bar.  I loved this place as soon as I walked in.....2 Pool Tables, 2 Dart Boards, and a full sized Shuffleboard game, plus comfy chairs and a wall of big screen TVs.....perfect!They ordered tons of food for the party....Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fingers, and several Pizzas.  With over 40 people coming, they needed to load up.I tried the Mozzarella Sticks & Meat Lover's Pizza.....they were both very good.  The Mozzarella Sticks were cooked just right....the Breading was crispy and not too greasy and the Cheese was melted and gooey.....it had a nice flavor to it and went well with the Marinara Sauce.The Meat Lover's Pizza was awesome too.....from what I could tell, it had Canadian Bacon, Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni loaded on top of the Pie.  It was very flavorful, but with all of that Meat, the crust was a bit soft, very difficult to eat the first few bites of the slice without a fork.....which is not good for Pizza traditionalists.  Other than that, it was spectacular Pizza....full of flavor and I thought the Cheese to Meat ratio was good.To wash all of that down, I had a Hoptoberfest Beer made by Fat Tire.....very tasty, not as Hoppy as other Beers I've had recently, but very good.  It went well with the food.Overall, I had a blast here and so did the rest of the party.  People were playing pool and darts....it was too packed to play shuffleboard as the party goers were too close to the table to play a game.Will I return?  I'm considering having my Birthday Party here.
Spoon=Like many think of their loved ones, I think of the love I have for the biscuits I had here.  The true love I experienced is like none other.  Do you love that I've started with the bread options here?? So seriously, this buttermilk biscuit is just beyond! It's made with chives and has little cream cheese surprise inside.  Served warm. Are you dying just by the description?!  Anything with cream cheese in it is divine if you ask me....I shoved in four.  No lie.I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant.  It's funny because when you think of American food, what do you think of?  I think burgers and fries.  But make a food presentation fancy looking and you've got a fancy restaurant.  We tried the swordfish appetizers, which came out split between two plates.  I actually liked that because I can get greedy with my appetizer and not share, so it made things equal!  The app was good, but it wasn't amazing.  My scale goes from gross, ok, good and amazing.  This place was definitely not gross or just ok.   My main dish was very good.  I got the day boat scallops + pork two ways.  The scallops were nice and crispy, just the way I like them.  I was not thrilled with the risotto.  Granted, there was no false advertisement that it  was pearl barley and not a creamy based risotto I usually enjoy.  It just didn't have any taste, it was just....there. The pork belly, which was described as the part of the pig that bacon comes from, was amazing!  I mean, bacon, hello!!  The homemade sausage was also really good.  The cabbage underneath both meat options was very very tasty.  I was much more into that than the risotto. Remember that you MUST have a reservation!  It's very tiny inside, so I'd doubt you'd be able to walk in and get sat within 2 hours.  The place itself is very cool.  It was very cozy inside and had a nice intimate feel.  Great for a first date or romantical dinner out.The service was definitely 5 star.  Our service was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when selecting the food options.  For how hip it felt inside I was surprised to see an over 60 plus crowd on a Saturday night.  But maybe I just went too early for all the cool kids. So did this place live up the the hype?  Not necessarily.  But would I come back?  Definitely.  I'd be interested to try some of the other unique food options they have on the menu.  Maybe in a few months I can rate this as amazing!  I'm fearless and I like food, so who am I kidding, I'll be back!!Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.D√©cor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entr√©e, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) saut√©ed spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.I can't believe we waited so long! Really! It is a as close to 5 star as you can get. I will explain further. We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess in a cool, trendy little restaurant.  The vibe is cool and chic. We were immediately tended to by our wonderful waitress. She was attentive and super nice. She immediately brought us water and the superb wondrous bread basket. Oh the delight in the basket of' bread. Ours included the corn muffins that were little but oh the flavor. If you read any of the other reviews then you will have noticed the mention of the muffin with chives and the wonderful cream cheese delight in the middle, wow! And we also had a baguette with the amazing honey butter with sea salt. We decided on the chicken meatball appetizer. The meatball was smaller but you get three and on the side - a grilled sourdough with what I can best describe as a hummus type topping. I loved the grilled sourdough however the hubby did not and this is where the 4 star comes into play( from the hubby). I chose the seared fluke as my entree. It is a seared fish with a lobster and artichoke saute. The fish atop an amazing , tasty English pea and goat cheese ravioli. I have to say the ravioli made this dish. It made a ho hum piece of fish phenomenal! The hubby chose the duo of beef which is grilled rib eye and braised cheek on loaded smashed potatoes with baby veggies, natural reduction and  bacon and arugula salad. The rib eye was so tender and juicy. The hubby did not like the cheek noting it tasted too much like a roast than a steak. He was not keen on the cheek. I got a side of roasted fingerling potatoes which were done to perfection. The hubby chose a side of roasted baby veggies- yum! And for dessert...I chose the s'mores. I love bacon but candied bacon is on a whole other level. The bacon coupled with the dark chocolate terrine (it was like a little dark chocolate cake) and the little puffs of marshmallow goodness and the cumin Graham cracker and the rice crispie treat, amazing! The hubby chose the Spoon bar which was what can best be described as one terrific chocolate piece of cake ( some of the best I have ever had). If you are looking for a wonderful place that is a little pricier I would recommend Spoon. We will go back again! It was a terrific dinner from start to finish!Spoon, one of the better restaurants in the Burgh.  The decor is nice and tables are far enough apart to make it intimate.  Service was outstanding from our waiter, to the other servers that assisted, to John the Sommelier.  John spent a little time with us with several recommendations that would go with our mix of dinner orders.  He actually highly recommended a bottle that was one of the least expensive on the wine list.  He got it right, too, very nice cabaret franc.The bread basket was very good, probably could have eaten bread all night.Interesting menu with many fresh items.  We shared a grilled avocado that came with a charred tomato vinaigrette, oven roasted tomato and some creamy burrito.  We also had the bleu cheese souffle that had french peaches, nectarines, plums and a nice arugula with a sweet and sharp vinaigrette. I had a pork and shrimp dinner that was very good, the pork was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was good but maybe a tad over cooked but still tasty and good. All of the meals had some interesting ingredients that introduced some very tasty meals.  The preparation and presentation was top notch.
Chopstix=Today, we ordered takeout from chopstix as we frequently have in the past, but this experience was so bad that I doubt we will return, and I encourage you to BE CAREFUL if you order from this restaurant. As we began eating, my friend took a bit of general tso's chicken with a STAPLE in it. After spitting out the staple and experiencing quite a bit of confusion we called chopstix to complain. They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number.  We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest.  The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was "curved" differently.  My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife.  The owner then told her that she would get "IN TROUBLE" if she reported this.  We are taking our chances and calling our local chapter of the Illinois Department of Public Health tomorrow morning.
Faberg√©=Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal!! Came here with friends for brunch and everything we ordered was spot on!! The wait wasn't that bad for us at all considering this place was packed. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good experience in food, service and atmosphere!
Elixir Organic Cafe & Lounge=slooooowwww awfully slooooow to the point of behind hysterical laughter, like we were laughing at first, then it became downright retarded.We ordered smoothies, after about 40 mins we cancelled our smoothie order, and just ordered some waters...the smoothies never showed up.  We sat without a drink for 40 mins prior to that, not even a water, or being asked if we'd like something else to drink. no attempt at all and probably no notice at all that we had nothing to drink.There was 7 of us, they messed up all of our orders, AND we were supposed to get chips with our sandwiches.  After an hour & a half of being there we *finally*  got our food. No chips. After inquiring about the chips, the waiter did agree we were supposed to have chips on the side somehow he had missed this when he was bringing us the food. Then  we were told they were totally  out of chips.  Instead we got 7 grapes in a cup. No attempt to ask us what we'd like instead, fries, salad something.  It was awful.Unfortunately this place has good food. It's poorly managed and the waitstaff is horrible.  I'll never go back. I'd suggest unless you have 2 spare hours you skip it as well. They also have no music on or TV on in this place at all. IT was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.I bought a groupon for elixir back in April. I usually always yelp before I groupon but of course this time I didn't. Lesson learned! When I finally did my research & saw all the negative reviews, I chalked it up to them being a newer business & figured I would wait a while for them to work out the kinks out before giving them a shot. Silly me, thinking that this business owner might pay attention to yelp & surely the types of issues people were talking about would be dealt with. Well, fast forward 4 months to this past Thursday when the hubby & I finally got a chance to give this place a try. We walked in a little after 5pm to a completely empty restaurant. I tried to push aside any lingering doubts & keep an optimistic attitude. The sign said please wait to be seated but the lady behind the juice bar didn't so much as glance our way or acknowledge that we had even walked in. We started walking towards a table while asking if it would be ok to sit down. I think she grunted or something but definitely did not give a clear answer. We sat down & waited for her to bring over a menu, say hi, smile, something!! Nothing. She continued to clean or do whatever it was she was doing behind the counter & then finally brought over some menus after close to 5 minutes. Sorry to put you out! She took our drink orders, water with lemon for me & a sugar cane soda for hubby which she said they were out of b/c Whole Foods was out of it. Um, ok. He asked for just water with lemon too. We also ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls as a starter. I noticed that it came with a choice of dipping sauces but she never asked which one we wanted & hurried away before we could tell her. She came back with the 2 waters, no lemon. I asked for some lemon again & she came back with a tiny wedge of lemon in a filthy little bowl (pic attached) which I unfortunately didn't notice until after I had squeezed the lemon into my water :/ Then I realized we had no place settings therefore no napkins to wipe my lemon-juice covered hands on. I got her attention & asked for some napkins which she brought over, but again like I was putting her out.A couple minutes later, she came back to take our dinner order. I asked if I could have my chicken sandwich on a multi-grain bun to which she replied "that's what it comes on" The menu has several different bun options listed, so I'm not sure why that is the default bun for that sandwich. I guess if I had wanted another type of bun, they would have been out of it. Another 10 minutes or so & she brought out the spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce. Still no silverware so I guess it was good it was finger-food. We asked if we could get some of the peanut sauce instead & she informed us that they don't have peanut sauce. I mentioned that I had noticed it on the menu & she said "oh yeah, the manager is really bad about updating the menu" Way to call out your manager! O.OWe finally got our dinners after another 20 minutes or so. Cobb salad wrap for hubby, Mediterranean grilled chicken sandwich for me. Hubby's came with 4 grapes, a tiny pickle & a pepperoncini pepper. Mine came with some mango salsa &, no joke-I counted, 7 blue corn tortilla chips. The food itself was pretty good, albeit a little pricey for what you get. I'm glad we had the groupon! I wouldn't mind going back to try other things on the menu but you could not pay me to go back there & sit through another dinner that was as awkward, uncomfortable & slow as that was. I usually don't discount a place on service alone & always understand that people can have bad days. Yes, even a waiter/waitress!  But when I see yelp review after yelp review stating pretty much the same thing, I get a little ticked off. If some business owners took the time to read through reviews & fix the problems that are glaringly staring back at them, more businesses would succeed!
Monta Ramen=I went asap after reading Mike C's review!  This is by far the best ramen I've had in Vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in Japan. Its certainly a 4+ star place in LV.  We both got the tonkotsu ramen which was pretty good although more miso-y than I expected.  I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.  This certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.  I'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time."Got Ramen?"My life has never been the same ever since I became lactose-intolerant. I've tried to substitute with soy milk to no avail. Now thanks to Monta, I can drink Tonkatsu broth all-day to get my nutrients! Yes, Tonkatsu broth, rich, creamy pork marrow. Served with slow roasted pork in pork fat. Topped with green onions. I wish I drank this growing up, I would have been 6 foot-tall and playing in the NBA. Instead, I'm short and pull people's teeth for a living. My one complaint, turn up the AC yo! It is HOT! I was sweating more than the pig I just ate. I was sweating like a hooker in church. Like junkie in withdrawal. Like Clinton next to an intern. Like a blonde reading a math book. Seriously Chuck Norris would complain that it's hot in there..Before everyone gets carried away this started off as a strong 4 star review because I was stoked that we finally had decent ramen in Vegas. That other place Togoshi that closed down was not even remotely worth mentioning. I apologize but you people are really reaching. I'm not going to name drop, but there are GREAT ramen-ya in California and New York as well as some not so good ones in the mix. Monta....I was willing to over look a few things. Like the fact that it's 103 degrees outside at night and you have no working A/C. Also the faint smell of sewage doesn't really get your appetite going as you walk through the door. Let's serve a steaming hot bowl of ramen in the middle of the Las Vegas summer with no adequate ventilation except for some ceiling fans. Let's pretend I'm part Asian even part Japanese and I know something about food. Yes the food is decent and the ramen, pork belly and boiled egg, noodles are decent. Not the greatest but good enough that I would have returned. Prices are reasonable until you start getting extras. Our bill was $44.00 for the 2 of us. Pretty respectable check average for a small establishment. This is where I am not understanding how you could overlook simple customer service. I have reasonable expectations of decent food and decent service.... Whoever the arrogant F**K is that owns Monta: 1. This is not Japan 2. We live in the year 2010. 3. There are not enough Japanese here in Las Vegas a town dominated by the Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and every other nationality that you can afford to lose business. 4. Treat your customers better. 5. You might as well save some money and switch to walk-up counter service because that's about how useful your waitress was. It was not so much a lack of experience or lack of training issue, but more an arrogant I don't care it's not my job mentality and attitude. What? You don't think I saw this in Japanese restaurants 20 years ago? Even the Chinese have changed Mr. Bakatari and deliver with much more friendly and caring service. Is it that hard?? I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with tamago, extra pork and extra noodles. They serve the extra noodles on the side in a bowl and later I find out why. YES YES YES I know broth is costly, labor intensive and time consuming to make. But if you order XTRA noodles then the ration of broth to noodles should be proportional. It was not even close. I asked the waitress, Miss Personality very politely if I could have a little extra broth as I had a ton of extra noodles and no broth left. I'm not complaining, there wasn't that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodles I was served. Answer was "no". No big deal I will pay for extra broth just a tiny bit, whatever you guys want to charge....fat sumo kitchen lackey is like f'****n way and again "no" then a half ass sorry as she is walking away. Honestly this is such a joke I've been to restaurants in LA and again NY that have the name and ability to be arrogant and pretentious yet the service is warm and hospitable. You can go to Naked Fish, owned and operated by Japanese, yet the service is outstanding.This noodle-house is one of the hottest businesses in Las Vegas. (Yeah, like LV is not hot enough!)But the thing is, "I'm definitely not a Ramen-guy!" Because I'm not contented with just noodles, flavored broth, diced meat and/or vegetables in a bowl. It's been a LONG while since I've had a bowl of Ramen....even before 9/11 to be exact (yeah, that long).  I met up with a bunch of friends in Las Vegas and each of us ordered one of the restaurant's tasty Ramen Noodle. I ordered the Chashu and Tonkatsu Ramen Noodle Bowl. For $6.95, it's not a bad price and had slices of Chashu and noodles in a flavorful Miso soup. The soup/meal was actually pretty good and comforting. This bowl of soup would definitely warm me up in a cold winter night in San Francisco. I got my ramen soup very fast and the service was also good.Friends used credit cards for their meals. But I paid my meal in cash.The 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. My mom in law doesn't like Asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in Indonesia. BF and I are food adventurous- them not so much. It's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. We like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. They shared a tonkatsu ramen and a pork belly bowl. They said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. BF tried the Miso ramen- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. It's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. They are very similar though. I went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as "cold noodle salad". The cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. It has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). I also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some green onion and nori. The service is friendly and attentive. I always appreciate places that have very nice servers. I have a habit of talking about the service and I think maybe I should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. Miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)Update 9/13Brought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. They didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the pork belly bowl. I got hiyashi chuka again since I love that dish and they do it well here. I also got a mini mentaiko bowl. Not for everyone, but I like spicy roe and rice.Update 10/26Nothing better than soup on a crappy day. Shoyu Ramen this time. It's good. I think Tonkatsu is my favorite, but I'll order this again. Sometimes I feel a bit of variety. I always get a belly bowl though :-) It's noms.Update 11/07 Tried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. You can now order it as such. Keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. I think this is my favorite broth. Tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. Shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than I want. Marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. This is what I'll be ordering from now on. I will try to ask if I can do a shoyu miso as well since I think that would be a good, more delicate balance. Update 11/16Got a belly bowl, but also tried their gyoza. It's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. I was in the mood for them, but not something I'd get often I think.Finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in Vegas - Monta Noodle House.  Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)This place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)I went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.The Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.We also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.  A side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.There's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for "Kaedama."  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).Service was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.Update!  I returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.Very good ramen.  I've been here about five times and I like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  But it is very filling.  Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.I highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.If the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.It's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.Strange - i thought for sure i wrote a review on Monta.I have to rate their Tonkatsu Ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me, considering i eat out at least 7 meals/ week, it takes a lot to rate so high.  It ain't the fanciest , it ain't the cheapest but it's simply, just right.  Add the roast pork, the egg and corn to the ramen and it's ALL GOOD  !!!Base price is $7 but adding the extras puts it over $10.  I always share the bowl with the gf, along with either get the pork belly bowl or the gyoza but  the star of the show is the ramen.  Raku and Monta in the same shopping center ...nice !My first experience with authentic Japanese ramen, and I was not disappointed. Prior to Monta, the only types of ramen I ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually Korean in descent and instant in nature. So I was surprised, in a good way, when I discovered that Japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen I've eaten before. My boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so I immediately suggested Monta Noodle House after remembering all the positive reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. The restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in Japan (at least in my mind). Service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. After reading over the menu, he ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu and a Mini Mentaiko while I ordered the Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen and an order of Gyoza. Here is the breakdown of the food:Gyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory. Miso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. Mini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted. Overall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom.Wanting a light lunch, we headed on over to Chinatown to get our Ramen on. This place is located not far from the Vegas strip in a little shopping center. The restaurant is on the smaller side, yet has a comfey vibe. Our waitress was friendly and gave us a moment to look over the simple menu they have. I ordered:Shoyu Ramen- Brown and clear color broth, based on a chicken and vegetable stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that's tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. Added a seasoned hard boiled egg to the soup.For $6.95 they hook it up with a large bowl filled with equal amounts of broth and noodles. The seasoned hard boiled egg was delish and not dry or rubbery. Added some garlic paste and that soup was the biznass!! Friendly service + great prices = One happy full customer!!!YUM YUM YUM...YUMMY Alert!!!  Me and my fiance finally checked this place out and have eaten there two more times. When you finally find it in this strip mall the whole in the wall is a treasure. You can tell you are there because there is always people waiting out side and cars all around the one door.This place is SMALL and HOT! There is a little wrap around bar that holds about 6-8 people and then maybe 5 tables. It is warm in there but no one seems to care. Everyone just eats there hot ramen noodles in the hot restaurant.The ramen is so yummy! Get the egg added to your soup. That is the only add on I would recommend. I have had two of the broths and they are so rich and yummy.  You really cannot go wrong. This place is NOODLEISH!Monta neighbors Nakamura-Ya, & Raku. With an authentic sushi place to join the strip mall, this is the spot to get some kick-butt Japanese food. Monta is a ramen-specialty restaurant that is not to be skipped!RAMEN: Their menu is small but mighty. What kind of ramen you like? Miso, Shoyu, or Tonkatsu? They come with thin slices of char-siu pork. Ichiza actually has my favorite char-siu.... but Monta's is a solid second. Overall, the ramen here is far superior anyway. There's also a variety of toppings you can add for an additional cost. Generally, I order the same thing every time: Miso Ramen w/ Egg & Nori. YUM! I've sampled every type of soup but Miso is my favorite. The broth is rich & flavorful and I can't find it as good anywhere else.APPETIZERS: If fish eggs are your thing, Monta has the freshest Mentaiko in Las Vegas. Order a Mini Mentaiko Bowl (Rice, Mentaiko, Scallion)--throw some soy sauce & togarashi on it as a delicious starter. Gyoza here are good too but nothing to get excited over.OTHER: There's a board on the wall that has the other entree items. On different occasions I've seen some type of cold noodles, rice bowls, and fried rice. My memory fails to remember the rest but so far none of them interested me enough to try. A client of mine recommended to try the cold noodles.... maybe next time.Come for the Ramen, Stay for the Ramen, Come Back for the Ramen--good eats.I gotta agree 100% with respected Yelper: Tien N's review. He was the only guy brave enough to leave a low rating for Monta. Personally, I think that most people are riding the bandwagon and just rating this place up because everyone else is. I came again today, and just couldn't enjoy the Ramen here like I used to. Like most of my Yelp friends already know, I am somewhat an expert at Ramen. During my college years, my friend Takeichi and I went on a bizarre and pointless quest across the West Coast in order to eat Miso Ramen at every single famous Ramen house in America. 30 days and over 50 Ramen houses later, we declared ourselves Ramen Masters.Ramen has a lot of historical and cultural significance to the Japanese people. After the defeat of the Imperial forces in WW2, Japan had practically become a poverty stricken 3rd world country. It was around then that Ramen became extremely popular due to how cheap the ingredients were. There was one Ramen house in San Diego which I visited years ago, that had the exact variation of post WW2 Ramen. The Ramen itself was practically a less salty version of Shio. It had absolutely nothing in it besides for noodles and salt water. That means, you get no charsiu, egg, or vegetables. Personally, I thought it was the worst bowl of Ramen I have ever had. The owner of the Ramen house told me that the only reason she serves this depressing version of Ramen is because of it's cultural significance. At least Monta doesn't have anything that bad...    I guess the reason I originally liked Monta was because I was so used to eating the extremely spicy style of Ramen from California, so when I first had Monta's Miso Ramen it was so different that I actually thought it was good. I can't identify which regional variation of Ramen is served at Monta. Me and Takeichi think that it might be a specific Shibuya variation, but we just can't come to a positive conclusion. But, we do believe though that it definitely is some kind of Tokyo variation.I myself have begun to believe that the Miso Ramen at Monta is actually a combination of Toyko style and a random American style. In the 1960s, Ichiro Mashita created the "California Roll" because Americans kept complaining to him that his rolls that had Otoro in it tasted like garbage.  I kind of think that Monta's recipe is the "California Roll" of the Ramen world. And that's why it's rare to find a full-blooded Japanese person eating here.Weird observation:The Tonkatsu and the Miso Ramen here at Monta taste almost identical. This is very unusual. Those two should never taste that  similar.One of my friends who is full-blooded Korean always refused to come here with us. When I asked him why, he said it was because Koreans believe that Ramen is "the food of the Rats". I don't know what that's supposed to mean....It is just so difficult to move around here. The seats are designed for people who are less than 5'5" and weight around 120lbs. The stools at the bar area are very uncomfortable. Walking to the bathroom is difficult because you keep having to bump into other customers and the girls at the cash register. It's common for Ramen houses to be small, even the most popular Ramen house in America(Orochon) only seats like 20 people and the chairs are very uncomfortable. But, somehow Monta is far worse. Like 90% of the customers here are yelpers. Every time I come here I recognize someone from their Yelp picture. When I was here today, I overheard a person talking about how Monta is "the greatest" and Anime Ramen is "fake ramen". To me, Anime Ramen is far better than Monta. Anime actually gives you gigantic portions of bamboo, mushrooms, corn, eggs, and charsiu for free, while Monta charges extra and only gives about 1 tbsp of micro-sized diced bamboo. Today, I ordered extra butter and I got a teaspoon. At Sora or Anime, they would have loaded my bowl with butter. Also, at Sora and Anime, the bowls are at least 30% larger.  But, the best thing about Anime is that they give you 3 slices of Narutomaki for free.  Also, the guy who runs Anime Ramen is a guy named Ryosuke and his dad is one of the most  famous traditional Japanese sushi chefs in America, so I don't understand where this "non-japanese" rumor is coming from.   I still believe that Monta has the best Shoyu Ramen, but out of the 3 major Ramen houses in LV(Monta,Anime,Sora), I gotta say that Monta has the worst Miso Ramen. Maybe the reason why Monta has bad Miso Ramen is because it is a Toyko style Ramen house. And Toyko style Ramen houses always specialize in Shoyu. While, it is the Sapporo style Ramen houses that always specifically specialize in Miso Ramen(Miso Ramen was invented in the city of Sapporo).  But, I still love the excellent customer service here, so I'll give Monta 3-stars.Ode to Monta's Pork Belly Bowlcue violinHey, I just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   All of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  Yeah this will probably be out of date by the time I hit submit review, but I'll deal with it.   I've been to Monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times I stuck with getting various ramen.  Of those my favorite quickly became the Tonkotsu as I really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  I did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to Tonkotsu.  As a quick aside, I actually found the Tonkotsu-Shoyu to be my least favorite.  The pork was always tender and tasty, and I would almost always get an egg added and I tried most of the other additions as well.   I personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though I did like the Mustard Leaf on occasion.  For an appetizer I had the Gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   Then one day I decided to split a pork belly bowl with a friend as an appetizer.  Game change.   It's seriously all I think about when I think of Monta now.  As much as I enjoyed the Ramen whenever I'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  Currently saving up for an engagement ring.  Pork Belly Bowl will make a lovely bride.Service is always friendly if a little rushed, and I always thought the overall price was decent.Still need to try Anime and Sora so no comparison on Ramens unfortunately, but unless they have Pork Belly Bowl on their menu, it might not matter.Monta Ramen: The 411 and maybe something different than the 559 other Monta reviews...Location: 1 block West of Decatur on Spring Mountain Road. It's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the North side of Spring Mountain. Signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.  Parking: Limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. Can be tight to park if crowded. Monta is small. Square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. Don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door. Seating. They have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. If you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you. Food: I walked in here skeptical. 559 Yelp reviews. Lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about Monta. I came to try it, and I came in a bad mood to boot. I ordered Miso Ramen with extra slices of charziu. And I had an OMG moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and I left the bowl totally empty. I will say that Ramen Sora has better charziu, hands down. But the overall experience I had at Monta was superior in every other aspect.  Special Notes: Monta's Miso Ramen has a bit more oil in the broth. It's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. But it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. If you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some Shout wipes on hand is essential. Overall Impression? I loved it. From the wide range of people I ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the Miso Ramen to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why Monta inspires such a range of emotion. For me, this was an experience I won't soon forget, and I can't wait to go back and have more of it.YES PLEASE, MORE PLEASE.Loved this cute little place. And it's CHEAP!  under $8 for a huge bowl of wholesome goodness.  It is a really small place, so keep that in mind, people were definitely waiting outside to get in.  But the food comes out fast, in fact, our dinner came out before our appetizer, which wasn't optimal but was OK.Service was meh in my opinion which is why it was 4 stars instead of 5.  It was FREEZING in here, they have the fans on blast, way too cold for both of us.  But once they serve you the steaming goodness in a bowl it does warm up a bit, but not that much. Tip-move the fans to the kitchen to help the workers out but it was too cold for us.I ordered my Pork Ramen w/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg. It's worth the other $1.50 or whatever it is they charge you, it was delicious.Great for a cold day too!During my last 3 visits here to MONTA I did not see even one Japanese person eating or waiting in the 2 hour long line. Do you know why it is that the Japanese community in LV has turned their back on MONTA? There are many reasons.....I was confused. I was really confused. Why was I not a fan of MONTA? Every Chinese person kept telling me that MONTA was "the best". Every Korean woman kept telling me that it was "the best". Even their white husbands kept telling me that MONTA is "the best". My Mexican-American and Black foster kids kept telling me that Monta was "the best". Why is it that I didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? Am I just not Japanese enough to enjoy MONTA? My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese-American and he did marry a Korean woman, so maybe that Korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. But then I started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in Japan kept insisting that MONTA was NOT "the best", In fact they thought it was "the worst". So I came to the conclusion that Japanese people just don't like MONTA like everyone else does. Personally, I think MONTA is  the California Roll of Ramen. It's a slightly Americanized variation, just like how the California Roll is an Americanized variation of traditional Maki. MONTA's ramen belongs to no true Japanese region.  It's made in America like Burgers and Fries. No one eats comfortably at MONTA. The place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. The counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on Maryland and Flamingo.  The bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. There is never any parking in the lot. Frequently, I just drive across the street to Shuseki(A Chinese-Japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  MONTA is the most popular ramen-ya in Vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? One of the wealthy Korean business owners who is a member of my Asian-American Activism agency informed me that Seoul Plaza(where Monta is located) has the cheapest rent in Chinatown.  The owner of MONTA is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave Seoul Plaza.  Cheapness is the main reason! And Cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at MONTA is only half the size of the other 4 major Ramen-Ya's in LV. And Cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. You gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! How cheap is that!!! If you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. You can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at Fukumimi. The Deluxe Ramen at Sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.The f*cking hipsters! This is a major reason why the Japanese have left MONTA.  Hipsters are usually White people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or Chinatowns. I don't know why, but hipsters think it's "lame" being around other Whites. Unfortunately, they have chosen MONTA as their "COOL MINORITY HANGOUT SPOT!". As a Japanese-American, do I wanna sit with a bunch of guys with " David Lynch Eraserhead" haircuts who wear Geek-Sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? Do I wanna sit with a 6 foot 4" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: Indie Rock, Indie Flicks,  Jesus(aka Obama), Apple Products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  My response= THAT'S IT! NO MORE!  I'M F*CKING OUT OF HERE! I'M GOING TO FUKUMIMI!By the way... How f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? While I'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, I always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. This is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat. MONTA has the worst Gyoza in LV. It tastes like the Chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). And they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. That's like a dollar a piece!! Walk 2 minutes to Shuseki for a much better gyoza.Why did my egg come from the Alley? They ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? Are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?A Japanese restaurant is supposed to have Kim-Uchi, not Kimchi. I saw with my own eyes, the cook here at MONTA going to Greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of Korean Kimchi. At Fukumimi, Katsu-San makes his own Kim-Uchi which is slightly sweeter than Korean Kimchi. It's a true Japanese variation of a classic Korean dish.  #$@!*$#%$ *%#!  F*CK I JUST HIT THAT 5001 WORD LIMITI still think Monta is tasty, but it's just not as tasty as I used to think it was.While Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.The Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.A couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.And of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles.On my last trip to Vegas, I finally got to eat at the legendary Monta Ramen.  This place has been on my "to do" list since I lived here 3 yrs ago.  I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.I ordered:Small Fried Rice, $3.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTawTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGgMiso Ramen (no meat), $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQThe portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.Other notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.Did it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.Return Factor - 80%When I think of Ramen, I think of Instant Cup O Noodles or the Pre Packaged ones that you pay like 5 bucks for a big bulk box at Wal Mart.Not until a friend of my wife mentioned this place that we stopped by to check it out. That's when I found out that this is not your ordinary dollar store ramen. Their menu is pretty simple. You pick which noodle bowl you want, choose whatever you want to add to it (like a hard boiled egg for example) for an extra charge of course.They also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.Service is above average and it should be because you can only fit so many people in this tiny place. So slow service with an excuse of "Sorry, we are really busy today"  will not fly with me. Memo to those that eat here: Once you're done eating, please pay and move on with your life! I have seen people finish their meal and proceed to just shoot the breeze for another 15 to 20 minutes while you have 6 to 10 people waiting for a spot.Some random info. Make sure to sign in to your right as soon as you come in so they know who got next. Don't just stand there and expect for them to remember if you came in before somebody else. If you see lots of people outside just standing there, chances are you will be waiting for a bit before getting a table. For those that are chopstick challenged like me, they will not give you a fork unless you ask because you are already given chopsticks by default. All the condiments you need like sesame seeds, soy sauce, etc are right there on your table.So you see their operation is simple. It's just that their space might seem constricting especially if you have claustrophobia.What can I say about Monta. I used to like it. Unfortunately, "used to," is the key word. Today, I keep coming back expecting their classic ramen, best broth, and perfected simplicity. But I now must admit all I have come to expect is disappointment. I have been coming here for about 2-3 years. But now I can't help but second guess my decisions. The service here has seemed to have gone down the drain. They give so much attitude and don't really care about the customers. You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. I'm not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key. Now to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didn't seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? To this I'm sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this "new" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past.I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!Nose ~ Smells good!.Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!Tummy ~ Satisfied.3 1/2 stars. Came in for lunch during the week. I sat at the counter due to the full house and went with the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg and extra chashu.Sitting at the counter I was able to watch them prepare the ramen and noticed there was a chef in training. When I received my bowl all looked decent and tasted good with the exception that the ramen was overcooked and soggy. The patron next to me received his bowl and he ordered double meat and they only give him a single serving also which wasn't cool either. Service was decent, but lets get it together in the kitchen!After having ramen from the restaurant down the road,  I was quite disappointed in Monte Ramen.  It was relatively easy to find...on the right side of Spring Mountain Road as you drive east. The parking lot is shared with other busy restaurants.  I could feel a slight breeze from the air conditioning which was really helpful since it was 100 degrees outside! The interior was small and dark. There were 5 tables and 9 counter seats. There were a few chairs for customers to wait for a table. Make sure you get your name on the clipboard! The gyoza was shocking. ..it looked pale and undercooked,  like it was just fried on one of its 3 sides.  The inside was bland and flat tasting. On the other hand,  the miso broth was really salty and the noodles were too soft. I didn't finish it.  The toppings of green onion, bamboo shoots & black fungus were room temperature as if they were hastily thrown on the top. I would only go back if the competition down the road was full and if there was no line.  If there was a line,  go to the other restaurants right next door!  Sorry...Monta Ramen, a top ramen restaurant in Vegas, provides good food, but it is not worth the long wait. Although the nitamago (soft boiled egg) had a great texture, it was bland and lacked the distant soy sauce flavor. My friend's spicy tonkotsu ramen had pork with great proportion of fat and meat; yet, the soup was not spicy by all means. I recommend going to Monta Ramen at 11:30 a.m., its opening time, in order to avoid the wait.First off, I'm a huge ramen eater.I came on a Saturday with two other people for dinner at around 6pm.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  Once seated, I went for their Miso based ramen with added garlic oil, chili, egg, and corn.  It was delicious!  My only complaint was it was very salty.  Not overwhelmingly salty, but salty.  The ramen was the perfect texture.  The meat was good and everything went together really well.  My sister went for their Shoyu ramen, which is soy sauce based.  I had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  If you want a healthier choice, the Shoyu would be the one to go with.  We also ordered one Mini Mentaiko bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  But later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.  For 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  It was very reasonable.  The service was very fast.  Our food came out super fast.  The inside of this place is teeny tiny.  There's about 5 small tables and the bar that's it.  Prepare to wait on the weekends.PS... if you have a crying baby/child, this is not the place to bring him or her.Yes, yes, and yes.This is definitely the best ramen I've had in Vegas, though it's still at an average quality compared to many places here in LA. It's a small restaurant so there is definitely waiting involved but luckily some of my friends went earlier and put our party down on the list so I myself did not have to wait too long.I tried the tonkatsu shoyu ramen, but asked them to switch to thick chewy noodles since that's the way I like it. Hungover Aileen enjoyed the broth very much and it wasn't too salty, which is much appreciated. The noodles were the perfect texture. The chasu was also incredibly tender and just the right portion for me since I was able to get some in every bite of noodles.The service by the older woman was so attentive and kind, while the younger waitress gave off the vibe that she was too cool for school. Regardless, the food was quick and good so I have no complaints.Monta Ramen serves "KURUME" style Tonkotsu Ramen from Fukuoka. It's a broth made from selected pork bones and special soy sauce imported from Japan. Nice!!Small but clean ramen spot, Monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door. The Kuro Ramen was black & impressive, the Tokotsu Ramen was creamy and deep. Both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. The fried rice was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Service was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. The whole time, i felt rushed. The glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting. Other than that, yes! i'm a fan!!Good For Kids: YesHighchair: YesAsked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. It was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. Wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. Ordered the Special on the Spicy Ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the fried rice was really good. Would come here again if they didnt have the wait.
Carnitas Guanajuato=Carnitas Guanajuato is located in the old Knife and Fork building on Sharon Amity. When you get our of your car, it smells like roasted meat, rotisserie chicken or grilling pork, it smells delicious. The menu has the mandatory, basic Mexican restaurant items, but where they differ, they offer all kinds of meat, kind of reminded me of a Peruvian restaurant. By the looks of the photos on the menu, they pile the plates high. One item caught my eye, a pound of pulled pork, yes please. I would like a large plate of pork, enough to feed four. I decided on ordering queso, guacamole and an al pastor taco. So when the server came around, I ordered, refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, and guacamole. There were so many little dishes on the table,  they also greet you with three salsas, pico and lemons. (LOVE) Every little dish on the table was delicious, you wanted to keep putting different salsas on bites, each bite would be a blast of comfort and heat! What a rush!We never made it to round two for the tacos. Maybe a reason to return today!Sad to report it looked like beer only. No tequila. Gasp.
Asian BBQ & Noodles=Coming here twice in the last week just for their pork must make it 5 stars!  I took Janel's advice in her review and went with the double order of the pork for the BBQ combo the second time around.  The crispy juiciness of the meat mixed with the fat was phenomenal.  I've neglected Chinese spots with hanging meat for too long.  I used to eat this stuff at least once a week.    The duck is also tasty but I recommend asking for a breast cut.  Some pieces of the thigh were straight up skin and fat.  While some people appreciate it, I am not one of them.  I also had their chicken chow fun which is something I'll certainly order again.  The service is also pretty friendly compared to most Chinese places around but it's all about the pork!Wanted something cheap, good and quick so we stopped in for lunch. I've heard so much about their BBQ so we ordered up a 2 BBQ combination rice plate. The roast pork has a awesome crunchy skin and the bbq pork is juicy and succulent. Definitely good for the price and I would order BBQ from here again. They also give you a bowl of soup, this was beef broth with potato and carrots. We also got shrimp wonton soup with thin egg noodles. The wontons were quality with shrimp, black mushroom and pork. I realized the more I have simple Chinese broth soups the more I feel they're sort've one noted. Just a personal preference, but I think anyone who wants a good wonton noodle soup with some greens will be satisfied.They serve complimentary tea, which was sort've odd tasting. It tasted like moth balls to me and the BF said it was like spinach water.  Servers was friendly when we were ordering, but I wouldn't say there was much service at all. We weren't ever checked on or refilled, we went to the counter to pay. BBQ definitely quality and I would order some to-go of this sometime. It's just one of those places that isn't bad, but didn't impress either. It's good for all the things they do and makes for a good cheap work option.Best chinese BBQ place in town. I guarantee it! Do not go anywhere else. instead of a long paragraph I'm just going to tell you what to orderDO ORDER: - 3 meat combo (crispy pork, roast duck, BBQ pork) over rice *** THE BEST***- won ton noodles (you can choose type of noodle and if you want meat in it)- fried noodles with vegetables on top- chow fun (beef, pork etc)- porridge (w/ thousand yr old egg is my favorite)NOW GOGOGOGOGO!Picture it, three Asian dudes and one Midwest white dude who never acquired a taste for "Asian" food."I'll order for everyone OK?" says my bud, fluent in Cantonese.  Mutterings of indifference. A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims "why couldn't we eat that", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.The waitress answers for us "You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish".  To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pur√©ed innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.Good eats for sure.300th review for Yelp! Crazy how time flies...So I am a little late to the game, just finding out about Asian BBQ and Noodles recently...but better late than never!Came here with Grandpa, so I decided it would be a great time to try a BBQ combination platter! We chose the Roasted Pork Belly, Roasted Duck, and BBQ Pork. Pork Belly was good, tender and flavorful with a very crispy skin. The Roast Duck was outstanding! Very juicy, flavorful and not gamey at all. The BBQ Pork was the highlight for me...great smokey BBQ taste, beautiful smoke rings and lots and lots of flavor! I'd say the Roasted Duck and the BBQ Pork are the best I've ran into so far!Also tried the Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce. Good stuff! Came out piping hot, fresh, and yummy...good distraction from all the meat and rice This was too much food for two people! And the prices are very reasonable, with rice bowls starting at $6.50 with choice of BBQ meat!  All of this cost less than a $20 bill for two people.  Just remember, cash only!I love finding new places I can get excited about...a very worthy #300 in my book!I arrived to Las Vegas mid afternoon since my flight was delayed several hours. Once picking up my rental car I headed over asap to Asian BBQ & noodles. Located in a strip center parking was no issue,  possibly BC it was hot.I ordered won ton soup and the combo roast pork & roast duck over rice. The won ton soup was decent but not as bomb as Noodle boy in Rosemead Cali. What was outstanding was the roast pork which was tender, moist, crunchy skin and yummy. The duck was pretty good and of course the duck sauce on the rice made the entree.Service is prompt but the help is your typical Asian joint - to the point and without a smile. Cash only :+(I agree with the consensus here. The roast pork is phenomenal. The perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy meat. It is little angels dancing in your mouth when you eat it. The BBQ pork and duck are alright in my opinion, good but nothing to go crazy over.If you order a two meat combo with rice, you get your money's worth. No question. I have only ordered off the menu and not off their a la carte buffet. I want to but with the language barrier I am sure it would be too difficult.However, as much as I love this place I haven't been as much as I would like because sometimes ordering can be very frustrating here. I swear I think they understand me but choose not to. Last visit, I wanted to scream. I was that frustrated. Because of the ordering I have to give this place a 3 star. I feel that if I walk away from an experience more annoyed, then something is wrong.GETTING MY ASIAN BBQ FIXIt's been at least three years since we had last visited this Hong Kong style deli noodle house. As the Las Vegas Asian community has grown exponentially during the past two decades, this sort of restaurant fulfills a most important culinary appetite for rice plates and noodles with barbeque deli meats. In Chinese communities throughout the world it is an essential food business on every block. Breakfast is the rice porridge or congee while afternoon and evenings are rice plates and bowls of noodles of all  varieties. Here at Asian BBQ & Noodles it's no different.It's the Asian version of McDonalds...with one exception, it's better and never boring.Best spot for Chinese noodles in Las Vegas! The wait can be insane on weekends during lunch time. I've waited 30 min to an hour on Sundays for a table...usually if this is the case I'd just leave but my grandma absolutely loves this place. This is not the nicest chinese restaurant that you'll find in Las Vegas but the food is great! They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees. My go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.Most of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.4 1/2 stars. Arrived for dinner In the early evening during the week. I definitely  prefer this place over the local Sam Woo due to far better quality and service. I came in earlier for lunch but it was so crowded I departed.We started off with a won ton soup noodles to share and followed with a entr√©e of double meat delicacy - pork belly roast pork and soy sauce chicken. Both meats were cooked perfectly - pork belly crispy on the exterior with just the right amount of fat for flavor and the chicken was fresh and you could taste the freshness. Chow fun was just as solid as the other entrees and was a generous serving. Service by the older waitresses was solid and one of them spoke Vietnamese and Cantonese. Impressive food and service so I'm upping my average rating here.If you're looking for the best Asian roast pork belly in Vegas - look no further. In addition to the bomb Asian BBQ here the wonton noodle soup and seafood chow mein Hong Kong style are a few of my faves.Service is decent, but you'll want to arrive early for the lunch and or dinner hour since the place is popular and gets busy.  Bring your Jackson bills because plastic is unacceptable and you'll be washing dishes to settle your bill otherwise. Waitresses here aren't out of your way friendly but cordial and get the requests filled when made - pretty typical of most Asian establishments. Come here for the solid food you won't be disappointed.Items Selected:Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork, Roasted Belly Pork ComboRoasted Duck Shrimp Dumpling Noodle SoupRoasted Pork and Preserved Egg Congee Seafood Dry NoodleLocated in the same plaza as Chada Thai as well as China Mama, and on my 'to-do' list since a few days after relocating to Sin City, it was finally on a Saturday evening that I met a friend at Asian BBQ & Noodle - the only two Caucasians to set foot in the place between the hours of 6:30 and 7:45pm proving to be a very good thing.Tight yet tidy, with a Cash-Only policy that proves no issue as items trend far cheaper than one might expect when considering the quality and quantity of the food, it was at the last remaining table that the two of us squeezed in and navigating the concise menu it was to the amusement of us both that the waitress' eyebrows raised as preserved egg porridge was ordered, not to mention three additional plates.Waiting mere moments for orders to be prepared, several to-go customers popping in and out as my friend sipped potent iced tea while I opted for water, it was first the aforementioned cauldron of congee that arrived and almost as if to award our "adventurous" order the creamy bowl of rice was absolutely chock-a-block full of both crispy pork and blackened egg, each bite a new adventure with baby bok choy, chives, scallions, and mushrooms also joining the mix.Next brought the barbeque plate, a bountiful trio of meats with crispy belly pork outperforming supple flesh of barbeque and excessively bony duck, it was an interesting contrast to see the same fowl deboned in a steaming bowl of soup fare much better, the skin softened only slightly by broth while long-style noodles were springy and plethoric, a half-dozen tender dumplings fully packed with nicely seasoned shrimp.Well aware that we had over-ordered, but happy that my friend would have a couple meals the following day at a grand tally of $60 inclusive of tax and tip, it was with a substantial plate of dry noodles that the meal would end, and although the seafood was undoubtedly frozen and rather par for the course, it was the melange of mushrooms that helped to prop up the plate, each featuring a distinct earthy flavor that worked in concert with the vegetables and gravy to offer a flavor both savory and a touch sweet, a nice compliment to the otherwise rich dishes more rich with fatty cuts of meat.A bit disappointed by the duck and seafood, though universally impressed by the pork, portions, and price there is little question as  to why Asian BBQ & Noodles remains a local favorite, the frequency of return limited only by a somewhat limited menu and several more Chinatown spots to explore.
Four Seasons Buffet=-A nice, variety of Chinese food, plus some salad bar fixins, jello, desserts, and some American food.-Seven buffet islands, plus the Sushi area = eight total areas of food to choose from.-Clean restaurant. Pleasant decor.-VERY friendly, coridial staff.-Food was really good & fresh for a Chinese buffet. Tasty & delicious!-Drinking water did not taste filtered (usually from the soda machine), it tasted like Phoenix tap.-Convenient parking.-The ladies restroom smelled like sewer (not like someone who just made a stinky in the stall, but the foul aroma of a sewage drain)...-Despite the smelly restroom, I would definately eat here again!
Hue Gourmet=I really love Vietnamese Food and this little restaurant is easily a favorite of mine. Cuisine from the Hue region of Vietnam is a little different than your typical soup places. No Pho here ... so get ready.The owner is really cool and extremely helpful. It was fun on my first visit. She wanted to make sure I understood this type of cuisine and how it should be eaten. They take great effort to make sure the food is packed full of flavor and beautifully presented at the same time. Nice!So far I have tried several of the soups and a good sampling of their tasty bite sized appetizers. Bun Bo Hue - Spicy Beef SOUP is a good place to start. The Crab and Shrimp versions are also excellent as well as the Duck. They have some really good specials during the week that will fill you up cheap. Just ask her and she will tell you what is good.Located in the Mekong Plaza Food Court. The eating area here is pretty basic with a dozen or so community tables and chairs. Just kick back and enjoy yourself and pretend you are on a vacation adventure. It usually works for me. DID I HEAR SOUP?4.75 STARSThis place has some fantastic food.  No MSG, no corn starch, just simply the food with no fillers to bolster the flavors.  Just enter Mekong Plaza through the northern most doors and walk directly back to the food court.  You practically walk right to Hue Gourmet.  Don't let the food court atmosphere fool you.  The food here is quite tasty and the owner is happy to tell you all about the food and how they prepare it.I have been here on several occasions for foodie lunches (got to try a lot of different things) and lunch with friends.   I've gone here for lunch most days and I'm partial to the Banh kahn cua.  I recommend this place for folks who enjoy food!Return Potential:  90%
Paradise=I'm so glad there is finally a place to go in the East Valley that has the energy and vibe of a downtown Phoenix club. The best part is, it is literally steps away from the Sycamore lightrail stop (last stop on the line).They just started 2-4-1 on Thursdays and considering my summer work hours are Mon-Thu, this is going to be my Thursday night spot.The Happy Hours prices are fantastic. Heck, their normal hour prices are fantastic! Happy Hour is everyday from 3 - 7PM and again Sun - Wed 10PM to Close. Most places have cut their happy hours from 4 - 6PM so how refreshing that I can still make it to a happy hour after work. They offer $2 small plates, which is the perfect size for me (I have a Lap-Band), but also gives customers the chance to taste a variety of the menu. Drinks specials range from $1 off drafts and bottles (reg $3-$4), $1 off wells, $2 off wine (reg $5-$8) and $8 off bottled wine (reg $18-$30). Plus they have all day weekly specials. Everything can be found on their website.Food is great and kitchen is open until 10PM on weekdays. I had the roasted poblano hummus and their green garlic fries. Very addictive! My friends sampled the wrap, chicken avocado club sandwich, and the blackened ahi burger.The bar has almost every vodka and flavor imaginable, thus their extensive and unique martini selection. The staff is personable and by the second time you visit, they will probably remember your name and anything you talked about at your last visit.The interior is modern with touches of leather and steel. The colors are my personal favorite: black, red, and white. There are 3 VIP/loung areas, a dance floor, and DJ booth. The bar is this incredible layered and intricute colors of biege, black and silver granite. The place is just stunning and you feel like you're in Scottsdale or Phoenix.The Grand Opening last weekend was packed and I truly hope every person returns. I am elated that this establishment has chosen my neighborhood and my type of friends to be of service to. Stop in, introduce yourself to the staff, and make this place your regular.
Coriander India Grill=EPIC FAILURE! I am BOYCOTTING Coriander India Grill for life! I used to be a huge fan (See my previous review), but I had a horrible experience there on Christmas Day 2012, which has TURNED ME OFF FOR LIFE! I'm an event planner for Meetup.com. In 2012, I planned a Holiday Dinner at Coriander India Grill for December 25, 2012. I CALLED & CONFIRMED a reservation with the owner 3 weeks in advance, and had his assurance that his kitchen could handle taking individual dinner orders and writing separate checks for an estimated group of 20 people. I even asked if he would have enough kitchen and wait staff to handle our group and was ASSURED that they would be well-staffed, and it wouldn't be a problem.On Dec. 25, 2012, 18 people from Meetup attended the All-Holidays Dinner at Coriander. Soon after my arrival, I got into a 10-minute heated debate with one of the waiters, as I tried to confirm that each person would receive a separate check. The owner/manager, Victor, had COMPLETELY FAILED to communicate this information to his wait staff, and the waiter was refusing (at first) to write separate checks. THIS IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME AS AN EVENT PLANNER! It's a nightmare to try and split a check with 18 people! It took a while, but the waiter finally agreed to my request--after I asked to speak to the owner. But, I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO DEBATE this in the first place--when the owner had confirmed with me over the phone 3 weeks earlier that this would not be a problem! That argument took time away from my friends, and away from my enjoyment of this event.After that issue was resolved, and we had all ordered our food, one of my members got up, put on his coat, and started to leave--before his food had even arrived! I asked him why he was leaving so soon, and he informed me that his WATER GLASS HAD LIPSTICK ON THE RIM, and he had to ask for a new glass! Then, when he took his silverware out of his napkin, THE NAPKIN HAD LIPSTICK ON IT, TOO! And, the butter knife was dirty. This person had planned on enjoying a meal with friends, but was so disgusted that he got up and left. I was horrified, and now embarrassed that I had even recommended this restaurant. I apologized to the group and convinced them to stay! (We had already ordered, and where else could we go--last minute--on Christmas Day?)I'm still not sure how someone FAILS to notice lipstick on the rim of a water glass while setting a table. It was not that dark in the restaurant. After that person left, things got even worse!!!I don't know if it the staff was intentionally punishing us for "daring" to ask for separate checks or complaining about lipstick on a glass and napkin. I don't know if the owner had deceived me on the phone weeks earlier when he assured me there would be enough kitchen staff to accommodate our group. What I DO KNOW IS THAT IT TOOK OVER 90 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD!!! I suspect this was a PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE MOVE on their part meant to punish us--because--many people who got seated AFTER US at nearby tables, got served their food BEFORE US!The final insult for me came when I spoke to the owner/manager, Victor, at the end of the night, and he REFUSED TO APOLOGIZE for anything! I can understand having a bad night. We're all human. But, apparently the words, "I'm sorry" don't exist in his vocabulary. He was completely UNAPOLOGETIC. He acted like these things were perfectly normal and acceptable, and there was no apology whatsoever, and no assurance that these things wouldn't happen again. It was his attitude, as much as the problems, which made me decide to never set food inside that restaurant ever again Lipstick on a glass of water and napkin is NOT NORMAL! Failing to convey important information to your staff after CONFIRMING SEPARATE CHECKS with a customer by phone is unacceptable. And not apologizing for your mistakes is also UNACCEPTABLE.Also worth noting:  the restaurant was not that busy when our group first arrived, and only about half the tables were full at that point. Victor used the excuse that they were very busy that night, and that it's "normal" to wait 90 minutes for food to be served in a busy restaurant. I disagree. That was one of the longest waits for dinner I have EVER experienced in my LIFE! And, I had specifically asked him if it would be a problem--if he would have enough kitchen staff to handle it--and he had assured me it would not be a problem. Obviously, he was wrong.What a TERRIBLE WAY to run a business when you alienate one of your very best customers who happens to be the MAIN ORGANIZER of a Dining Group! His refusal to apologize when clearly he and his staff made a SERIES of mistakes was infuriating! I have brought many people there in the past, but after this TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE, I will never return, and I will be telling my friends the story of their EPIC FAILURE and BAD SERVICE for years to come.
Hong Kong Asian Diner=I would have never known about this Hong Kong Chinese restaurant unless the waitress at Saigon Pho ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-pho-chandler#hrid:K7dcALr_WARav3-SqLC4LA ) hadn't recommended it! Kudos to her! We discovered that the waitress had virtually the same taste in Chinese cooking as my sister and myself! She even liked Wong's  Place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/wongs-place-tempe#hrid:r9k_c5ki5lhCkm9wOsj8Hg ) on Baseline in Tempe. Tonight we decided on her recommendation of Hong Kong Asian Diner.Stuffed Meat To-Fu (*** 1/2 $5.95) The most subtle tasting entree that we had this evening. We probably should not have ordered it along with the Fish Ball entree, Salty Fish Fried Rice or Singapore Vermecelli. Our fault, not the restaurant's! The flavor was very subtle. You will see a slab of Tofu cut into eight thick squares... each Tofu square is topped with a piece of Shrimp and liberally sprinkled with small Peanut chunks. Chinese Broccoli flanked the sides of the Tofu, which was immersed in a White Gravy. Nice looking presentation.Sizzling Black Bean Sauce Fish Balls (***** $7.95) There is some problem in translation with this entree. The "Fish Balls" are actually Filet of Fish... not the Fish Balls you'd associate with Pho! The problem is the absolute direct translation from the Chinese lettering on the menu. The Filets are sauteed in a Black Bean Brown Gravy along with Green and Red Peppers and big chunks of Onions. We enjoyed this a lot!Salty Fish / Chicken Fried Rice (***** $7.95) Unlike other traditional Cantonese restaurants, the Chicken is fried golden brown (before being added to the Fried Rice), along with bigger chunks of Salty Fish to create this Fried RIce! This was one of the dishes unanimously voted best of the evening! Proviso - I hesitate in recommending this Fried Rice to non-Asians, as Salty Fish is an acquired taste.Singapore Vermecelli (***** $7.95) Hong Kong Asian Diner's innovation in this staple Egg Noodle dish is the addition of a lot of Ground Black Pepper, sprinkled profusely on top of the prepared Noodles! It seems like, even though I order this all the time, this was the first time my sister and my friend ever had Singapore Vermecelli. Singapore Vermecelli is a Egg Noodle dish fried with Barbeque Pork and Shrimp and bits of Chicken, also with Green Pepper, Eggs, and Onions, spiced with Curry. Because of the use of Curry, Singapore Vermecelli has been confused as a tropical item from the island of Singapore... when in actuality it's strictly of Chinese origin. Delicious!Pot of Hot TeaSliced Valencia Oranges afterwards.Nice presentation of each entree, especially the Salty Fish Fried Rice and Singapore Vermecelli. You might have a problem with communication... as there is a definite lack of knowledge of English in this restaurant... from the translation in the menus to the wait-staff.There are many Lunch Specials under $6... but you will be disappointed if you don't order off the strictly Chinese Menu even with the bad English translation! Attempts at being a little bit more upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant. Demographics at 9pm: 40% of capacity, 90% Oriental customers.A definite 5-star Chinese restaurant in the Valley! Not just a Cantonese restaurant... but a Hong Kong Cantonese restaurant. Perform some research on the Internet before coming through the door.I use to be a huge fan of this place when I was still a Sun Devil over at ASU.  Prices were good, portions were decent, and the atmosphere was lacking but oh well.  The boss lady is loud and speaks Cantonese and talking with her was always fun.  After moving away from the area, I had stopped coming here.  It was by whim that a group of us stopped in today for a late-lunch/early-dinner.It's the same boss lady, same husband-chef, the same bland decor, and the same food.  The thing that has changed is me.  What I use to rave and crave over no longer seemed as amazing.  We got the sizzling fish fillet with black bean sauce, salt & pepper pork chops, and the seafood & tofu hot pot.  As always, the food came with a complimentary soup.  It was a bone marrow kind of soup with orange peel and beans.  In 106¬∞F weather, I'm not sure if I should be thankful or cursing them.  The restaurant was kept warm as well so it didn't help things.  Oh well, it was free and it was tasty.  Then came a parade of food.  It was all served hot, still a decent size portion for the price, and the flavor was good.  Will my skirt flip for this place?  Probably not.  I wouldn't mind coming back but I won't be going out of my way to come here. 3.5 stars!
DC Steak House=The dining room was at capacity when we arrived.  Thankfully, I had the foresight to make reservations, as we were seated within 10 minutes of our target time.  The hostess was fantastic, wish I could say the same about our waiter, who was as elusive as the mythical nessie.  Granted, the place was packed, so I gotta cut him some slack, however, I really cant extend the same graces to his lack of personality and charm.An onion ring appetizer kicked off the culinary cornucopia.  There were about 8 decent sized beer-battered rings, somewhat overcooked, served with a ranch dipping sauce.We both ordered rib-eyes, one bone-in.  Each came with a house salad, and a choice of frys or baked potato.  We opted for the 'loaded' option, sacrificing a pair of Washington's in the process.  The house salad was a standard iceberg mix accompanied with a single slice of cuke, three black olives and a trio of commissary croutons.  It was standard fare.Milady had to ask for bread.  It was ok, slightly warm, paired with cold butter.  We both got to try our hand at "maim the french loaf".The water and arnold had a hint of chlorine, so either they don't filter their water/ice, or they're trying to battle green algae.Now, all previous grievances can be overlooked, based on the performance from the star of the show.  The rib-eye was pretty good.  Not $38 good, but it was tasty.  Great char marks, and cooked to order.  It came with 3 delicious mushrooms.  I'd suggest popping the additional $3 to secure a side of them.The baked potato was medium size, served in tin foil.  It wasn't piping hot, so it took a little longer to melt the butter.  The loaded option included crumbled bacon, sour cream, chives and shredded cheddar, well worth the up-charge.For a high-end steak house, I wouldn't rate it in the same class as Fleming's, Morton's or Houston's, and for the price, your money would be better spent at those places.Understand, I'm not trying to slam DC... it was good.  But for the money, if DC wants to compete with the big boys, they need to visit their competition and take some notes.With that said, I'd rather not see any patronizing responses from the establishment's representatives thanking me for my comments and stating that they strive to create an environment and product pleasing to everyone.  Replied like that are worthless, and show the disregard the author has for the customer's constructive criticism.Went to DC Steak House for dinner with my family on a Sunday night.  This place was packed!  I am glad that I had a reservation as people were being turned away.  Getting seated was a bit of an issue.  Two parties that came in after us were seated before us.  I had to speak to the hostess to ensure we got seated.  The food was great we all enjoyed our meals.  What I did not enjoy was a lot of additional charges.  I did not find out the "small charge" until the bill arrived and no substitutions are allowed.  So if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable.  Even though they are the same price on the menu  These extra charges increased my daughters meal almost 50% and this is not acceptable.The food was good but the service issues may prevent me from returning.Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.This last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!Bottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said "the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out". Cool. No problem, things happen.Out comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.Bill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak! Told the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us "I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.Owner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening! I just said "look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.They literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.Tip for the owner: Look up "cost of doing business" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.Will be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was.
JJ's Delicattesen=After my first visit, I fell in love with JJ's Delicatessen.  Everything is made-to-order with quality ingredients.  My boyfriend and I stopped by one Sunday morning for some breakfast.  Everything on the expansive menu sounded delicious.  JJ's serves breakfast  (skillets, eggs, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, pastries, etc), lunch and other savory deli items (knish, challah...). Place your order at the counter, grab some coffee and find a seat inside or on the patio.  I ordered an egg white Greek omelette with fresh fruit and a whole wheat bagel (the options included potatoes or fruit and bagel or toast).  My honey had two eggs with fruit and a side of buttermilk pancakes. Our food arrived within minutes of finding a spot on the patio.  What impressed me most about JJ's is the quality of the food.  When ordering an egg white omelette you'd expect less eggs and more veggies than your typical "whole-egg" omelette.  Not so at JJ's.  The veggies were fresh and the egg whites were plentiful.  I finally found a place that caters to my health-nut tendencies without skimping on quantity or flavor.  Did I mention the buttermilk pancakes are phenomenal?JJ himself was helping customers, busing tables and even moving in heating lamps for the chilly patron.  It was nice to have our needs met by the owner himself.  Amazing food, service and down-to-earth atmosphere.  I will be back!
Shawarma Vegas=There are few things in life that make me happier than falafel and shawarma.  These guys deliver above average quality for both and I already know I'll be a return customer.The falafel plate was around $11 and it was huge.  The balls themselves were smaller than usual but that was made up for in quantity as you can see from the photo I took.  An overall 3.5 star falafel in the world is pretty much a 5 star falafel in Las Vegas.  The plate also came with my choice of 4 sides to make up my salad side of it.  I went with babaganoush, hummus, a red cabbage salad and their Israeli salad.  It also came with a big side of rice and beans so I pretty much had lunch for the next day.I just HAD to sample the shawarma so being the pig that I am, I got a shawarma sandwich to go too.  The quality of their pita was very good and although I prefer lamb shawarma, their chicken was still great.  They allow to put in whatever you'd like in the sandwich and as much as the pita can fit so I went wild with every little thing.  You should too.  The dining area is OK and teetering on hole in the wall status.  I see myself doing takeout orders for the most part.
The Old Spaghetti Factory=First time ever at this location. Nicely decorated all remake stuff of the old time stuff.Clean restaraunt, including the bathrooms.We came really early for dinner. We were running errands and wanted to eat early and get home.They were serving all day,which is a major plus. The hostess gave us lunch menus along with our dinner menu. However, lunch had been over for 25 min.Anyway, our waiter was nice. He bought our drinks and bread quickly.The food is very cheap (price wise) . So for the $$ you cannot complain.But, it really has no flavor, it is very plain.We both chose the soup. Which was really good, Minestrone.Food was good , just not a lot of flavor.Of course it is an Italian place owned by Greeks so they will have things a little differant.After we got our food we sat for a very long time with no drink. Our waiter seemed to of disappered for 20 min. Maybe they have things to do in the back before their shift ends. but, the hostess walked by us several times. I think she should of asked us if we wanted refills.Not a bad place, just not a great place. It served the purpose of a quick , fairly good dinner. They are doing something right, they have been around for years.My 2nd oldest turned 21 baby!! She wanted a dinner party with family and friends and she picked the place, after all it was her night her party!  The place picked for the event was The Old Spaghetti Factory.  The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a place my family has enjoyed going to, from my grandparents to my grandkids, we have all had a nice time, the family use to go to the one out by Newport Beach, then when we moved to Phoenix, we went to the downtown location. So it was no surprise she picked this place.We were a party of 20, when we went to the room were the tables were setup my son in law didn't like the flow of it because it had  1/2 the party on one side and other  1/2 away from them, so we moved some tables around and made a upside down L shapped table, which worked and we all got to interact with everyone.We got there about 7pm, around 7:25  servers asked for our drink orders, around 7:45 they started asking us for our orders, but none of us had any menus but we were never able to tell anyone we didn't have menus because there was no one around, we ordered our food around 8pm.  By this time most of everyone's drinks needed to refilled, the bread that was out is now gone and there are no servers to be found.  I had to ask for tea 3 times.The food wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even that great, I did ignore the reviews other Yelpers wrote because this was what my daughter wanted and I wasn't going to be all Oh other Yelpers said this wasn't that great. No I wanted her to have what she wanted.    I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was bland, no flavor, but I did eat it, I was starving. By now its after 9pm everyone was done with their meal and ready to get on the 2nd  1/2 of the party, but again no servers and no checks, people starting standing up and then out of magical air our checks showed up, everyone was not happy with the service they got, had to ask many times for refills, cheese, napkins, plates, other random things one asks for.  85% of the party skipped the free ice cream SKIPPED THE FREE ICE CREAM, the kids were the only ones who went for it, everyone else just wanted to leave.  Fortunately even with the bland food & missing servers my daughters night was not ruined. Oh I also should point out, I told the server that it was my daughter's 21st birthday and I wanted to buy her 1st legal drink and she took the drink order, but NEVER ID my daughter. What if I was lying about her age??   smh
Peter Piper Pizza=Oy vey! This Peter Piper has been the worst I have been to. We had to wait 15 minutes standing in the front waiting for someone to take our order and there was no one in front of us. I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.Dont think ill be making a trip here again
Jamile's Cuisine International=First of all I'm shocked that no one has written a review yet as it was part of the Crossroads Charlotte Taste of the World bus tour. The location is near Ben Thanh on Central between Kilborne and Sharon Amity, so it's not a stretch I frequent. Anyway I was a little nervous as I walked up and the sign above the door is in corrugated plastic.As I entered, the place has tables with glass tops over the tablecloths and basic chairs that were comfortable enough. It's a no nonsense interior - think Meskerem Ethiopian but less homey and less interesting.  You don't come here for the ambiance.However their menu has about 30 options on it luckily with photos for each item in a grid. While the owners are from Somalia, not all of the food is Somali. There is a selection of dishes primarily $8-10 mostly chicken, beef or goat. Jamile prefers chicken, and I have a thing against eating animals my family has kept as pets, so I won't eat goat.  (RIP our beloved nubian goats, Bravo and Symphony) I got something Jamile recommended that is of course not on the menu, but basically it's the Chicken with canjeera (Sp?) which is really similar to the Ethiopian injera flat pancake bread but less zingy. It came with spinach and potato (room temp but very good) and a side salad that was nice. It also came with water and mango juice all for $8. I told her it wasn't enough. So what the heck was Somali food like you ask? It wasn't nearly as unusual as I expected. The chicken which was spiced, yet not spicy was pleasant and mild. I couldn't identify any of the spices but it definitely wasn't overtly curry yet it was orange- possibly turmeric and some berbere?  It wasn't as similar to Ethiopian food as I had thought it might be except the bread.  Most of the dishes came with rice (which I heard was nice and moist), pasta (spaghetti) or a combo of both, or another bread called chapatti that was kind of like somewhat crunchy pita bread. I recommend the rice or my canjeera bread. It was a great value, and something out of your comfort zone yet not weird from a culinary perspective. Why not try it? The service was friendly and Jamile was lovely and was amused by our fun loving group. She even agreed to take a picture with us!  I will go back.Jamile's, a Somali restaurant, prepares their goat according to East African tastes. It comes in both soup and suqar. A crystal chalice of goat broth soup precedes every meal, and is served with a wedge of lime on the side. It's very fragrant and light, with a distinctive meaty flavor, though no discernible goat or vegetables float in the broth. It's the perfect dish to rev up your appetite. The suqar, on the other hand, is a hefty portion of goat that has been chopped and saut√©ed. It's not overly spicy, allowing the almost delicate flavor of the goat to come through, and very tender, owing to having been first boiled, then marinated before finally hitting the pan. All the meat is halal, or prepared according to Islamic law, which stipulates a humane and hygienic method of slaughter.Jamile's owners are from Mogadishu, and they cook according to Southern Somali tradition, which is less fiery than the in the north. But the house-made hot sauce on the side can fool you. It's cucumber green, cool, creamy-looking and hotter than the devil's daughter. Made of cilantro, onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic and vinegar, if you can handle the heat the symphony of flavors will set your mouth abuzz.The federation is also good; a split plate of spaghetti--left over from Somalia's 19th century Italian colonization--and fluffy, jasmine-like rice dotted with raisins and carrot shavings. This fantastic dish, and nearly everything else on the menu, rings up around $10.
Otto Enoteca Pizzeria=Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.The pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).Otto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.The complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.We ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust. The flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.We also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.In addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.Before ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).The flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.For dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.Despite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.Service was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.After having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.Complimentary parking (including valet) is available at the Venetian Hotel.I wish I could give 2.5 stars.  Jim G. and I frequented this place when it was Enoteca San Marco.  Even when we previously enjoyed this place, we recognized that this was a snacks, wine, dessert kind of place.  We were never blown away by the dinner plates.  Now, with the change, things seem to have gotten worse.We started with a salad we had loved before, the Buratta Pesto Caprese.  The cheese is excellent, as are the pine nuts.  The pesto was lacking and the tomatoes were stewed instead of fresh! What?!?! Weird.We also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.We shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.  Waste of time.I did not expect fine dining here, but damn, this was disappointing.  Usually Batali places offer a minimum of quality.  Otto is sad. Too pricey for such mediocre food and service.I was impressed with this place. The wait was not very long even though it looked like every table was completely packed.We decided to hit the bar for a few beers. I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!We were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!I made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!Here is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, "can we get grated cheese?". The food runner then said, "I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!" I looked right at this girl and said,"Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!". I then looked at the food runner and said,"Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!I had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!We also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again. You gotta love Vegas!!!Decided to drop by & grab a pie (pizza). I love Joe Bastianich, but haven't tried his restaurants so when in vegas why not? This is a restaurant partnership w/ him & Mario Batali so I thought the food would be great, but was disappointed. We got the Proscuitto Arugula pizza as recommended by the waitress. I LOVE proscuitto and the ingredients for the pizza sounded simple yet delicious especially w/ fresh mozarella.Took about 20 mins for the pizza. I liked the crust, it was thin and crispy. The ratio of ingredients to sauce was on spot. However, I felt the pizza was way too oily. Proscuitto was drenched in oil and very salty. The arugula was good and didn't have that bitterness to it. There also weren't too much mozzarella :( Overall I don't think I'd come here again to pay $20 for the exact same pizza I could get at pieology. Well you can't get proscuitto at pieology, but the crust and everything else tasted the same.The summer I lived in New York, I visited Otto as often as possible, taking advantage of the $4 vegetable pots that combined to make excellent light take-out dinners. I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.Otto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.We drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.Dinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile. The food, service, and atmosphere were all on point, and I'd recommend Otto to anyone looking to sit down to a good Italian meal.It was time for a happy hour snack which starts at 3. We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few small plates. They have a sampler that is 3 for $5, so we had a little bit of everything.  Tasty Salami, Mortadella, Olives, Bruschetta, deep fried bread balls stuff with cheese and roasted beets with Saba. After the small plates it was some some deep fried squash blossoms filled with delicious ricotta cheese.  Excellent choice I must say. We wanted to try something a bit heartier, so it was the short rib ravioli up next. Very tasty and a generous portion. The only drawback is the ravioli could of had more short rib meat inside, but still flavor tasty. The final course was some tasty cheese with cherries, apricot and black truffle honey. An enjoyable afternoon and tasty snack at this Batali restaurant.
Poke Express=This is definitely a hidden gem not only in Henderson but within the actual building itself since all you can see on the outside is the signage for "Island Sushi" and there is a door to the right and a door to the left which has a screen on it which gives the appearance that they are perpetually closed.  Choose door on the left and from here, you will first see a counter up front with desserts and a menu above you. To access Poke Express, you must go further down the hall where there is a counter with various poke priced around 10 dollars/lb and one has the option for sampling their bounty of poke in a variety of flavors.  Whoever came up with the term "food porn" probably envisioned poke as its monthly centerfold.  I mean seriously, it's pretty much glistening flesh that is scantily "dressed" with options including but not limited to wasabi, spicy mayo, limu (hawaiian seaweed), and shoyu (soy sauce)...quite a thing of beauty I must say.   Since I biked as a marshall for the Rock and Roll Marathon, I was feeling particularly hungry and needed a carbo-boost post-ride, so I went with one of their Poke bowls, which has a substantial bed of sushi rice underneath the poke, but unless you're one of those folks from an Asian background where your parents threatened that if you didn't clean your rice bowl since the residual pieces of rice would pretty much resemble the pock-marked face of your future spouse, feel free to leave some of that rice behind.  Options for Poke rice bowl include the regular, with avocado (add 1 dollar), and DO NOT confuse the spicy ahi tuna bowl as poke....it is pretty much mushed up tuna mixed with spicy mayo that would likely get a 5 star yelp review if yelp existed for cats rating their food.  I went with the regular Poke bowl and requested they add some chili sauce (the one with the green cap and rooster on the bottle, much more intense than Sriacha), since I was concerned the spicy mayo would overpower the natural flavors of the poke.  The bowl is served along with fresh sliced cucumbers, some marinated onions, and a few fried taro chips.   The poke had a very pleasing texture (chewy but not gummy), not overly seasoned, and tasted very fresh (may not be as good right off the island since the tuna was obviously frozen en route to Vegas).   My advice would be to stop poking your friends on facebook with flying sheep or watching that episode of Pokemon which induced epileptic seizures in young Japanese kids, go poke the person sitting beside you and come down here for some high quality poke.One final note: for Spam Musubi fans, theirs is loaded with way too much rice much like their Poke bowls."I want to try poke (as in to jab or prod, pronounced p, long o, k)" my Chi town poker bud tells on the way to the cashier holding racks of checks that once belonged to me."Huh?" I reply"Yeah, you know, poke, the raw fish stuff you guys from Hawaii eat" he attempts to clarify."I don't get it.  The hell you saying?" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side."Poke made with fish, you know poke, poke, poke" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side.Yes, were talking ahi limu poke, wasabi shoyu poke, etc. Is it as good as back home?  No.  But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste.  Cultural sharing through food is a good thing.The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish.  The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated, the flavor does not permeate it, just coats the outside.  Limu (fresh, raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect.  Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion, green onion, soy, sesame oil and sesame seeds) and  ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it's name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good.Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12.50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected.  It's a poke shop in the desert after all.Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home.As for my bud, I never corrected his mispronunciation.  Payback for poking me in the side and bluffing me out of a huge pot.So I was feeling blue one day and if you knew me (which most of you don't on a deep personal level...so take notes!), then you'd know that on my darkest, gloomiest days, the only thing that could lift my spirits is SALMON SASHIMI! And I definitely needed a good cheer-er upper. I decided to try Poke Express with the help of a friend referral (thanks Helen W!). First off, it is **LOCATED INSIDE ISLAND SUSHI** which is perfect because another friend of mine mentioned that Island Sushi was her favorite hole-in-the-wall sushi joint, and I've been wanting to check it out. So I went straight to the Poke bar and was seriously spell-bounded by this amazing concoction of chopped up sashimi. We don't have many Hawaiians in TX so this was pretty magical in my opinion. So many variations I had no clue what to do! Well I'm assuming I met the owner since he was referred to as 'Papa'. Let me just say, I might just repeatedly come back just to visit Papa. He was the sweetest man ever! He let me sample pretty much everything and got me full before I could even get to my order! If you're new to Poke like I am, it's basically chopped up cube-sized sashimi marinated in different variation of sauces. I saw a lot of variations of tuna, but also squid and shrimp choices. You order it by 1/2 lb, 1lb , and so on.Of course I went for the salmon. I asked him to do whatever he wanted to it since I wasn't sure which sauce I would really prefer. Well easy enough the salmon already has it's own special sauce. I wanna say it's the Shoyu but not sure. He mixed it with green and yellow onions and sprinkled it with sesame seeds. LOVED IT. And the most important factor.. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRESH.1/2 lb cost me about $7.55 & it was definitely a good portion for just one person.LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I FOUND MY FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS! *crowd roaring*Really like that place!!!Cheap, Healthy, Tasty, great variety (best in Vegas by far) and super conveniently located for Anthem/Green Valley locals. We REALLY need more good and Healthy Local spots like this in our neighborhood I am freakin tired of Wendy's and other chains...Very Friendly service.BUT Closing time is way too early around 6pm... Perfect for an healthy lunch but not recommended for dinner, too bad, I would love some Poki on my way back from workMy favorite: furikaki poki, kim Chi cucumbers, Salmon Poki with special sauce, Ocean (seaweed salad), Dried fish slices (can't remember the name)The pieces of Tuna are cut a little bit too big for my taste but nothing that a sharp knife cant fix.Also they mentioned that the Tuna is previously frozen unfortunately but it actually taste very very fresh. Extremely surprising.The prices are also surprisingly low for the quality of the food, you would pay 20 times more in any sushi/seafood restaurant by the Strip.Definitely a great value for what you get.There is a Hawaiian grill in the exact same location that stay open later (10pm I think)and I would highly recommend their stir fried saimin noodles and the oxtail soup with freshly grated ginger and cilantro.Their coconut flan is pretty good too, one of my fav dessert of all time but in my opinion you cannot go wrong with coconut anyway ;)Their assortment of cakes behind the window look Absolutely delish and beautiful, I have too look away every single time! I didnt like their homemade kim chi that much taught... Its not bad but I had better.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is not scared of raw fish and that is looking for a healthy yet tasty meal.Very close from the LVAC on eastern and 215 :)Super good and super fresh poke.  I like getting a 1/2 lb of the spicy combo poke (mayo, avocado, and other delicious goodness), a 1/2 lb of the poke w/shoyu (regular poke w/soy sauce dressing), and a 1/2 lb of their seaweed salad and I'm all set!The poke here is absolutely delicious and I will keep going back for each poke craving I get.  The staff are really friendly, they let you sample the stuff before you buy it, and the poke just really speaks for itself and delivers.Hawaii in Las Vegas, Aloha!!One of my yelp friend (Sandra S) raved about this place on her last visit to sin city. I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December. Fast forward a few months and I'm in Hawaiian Heaven. Here's the run down:Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter. It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside. It was cheap too. $2.45 for 4 big pieces. Delicious We came here for the Poke, we got:Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite, Delicious. Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen, but still good. Spicy Ahi Combo w/ Crabs, Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A. DeliciousTako poke w/ Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender.  The Ahi's were big chunks of raw tuna. So fresh, so good. You've got to try this place if you like poke. We also got some hot dishes.Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish. The best loco moco I've ever had. The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties. The gravy is just money. With two eggs & two scoops of rice. Oh man, this alone made the trip here so worth it. Delicious. Must order here. Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner. Authentic Hawaiian dish. No fake smoke, tender, juicy goodness. Yum yum yum. Kalbi - Delicious, fall off the bone tender and  the marinade was spot on. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything. A piece of spam, pork cutlet, pork teriyaki, beef short rib, noodles, pickled radish and all on a bed of rice. This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good. It's a special, so they might not have it everyday, but if they do, get it. You won't regret it. The service was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a lot of  food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us. The place is small. A few tables (for 2 only) line the wall. Get your food to go. I need a nap now after that luau we just had. Hawaiian food done right. Sandra, thank you for the recommendation!!I'll definitely be backIt's always hard to find a good poke place.  I know here in California I have to jump through hoops and drive distances away just for some good poke.While I was in Vegas, my friend suggested Poke Express.  They have a display full of several kinds of poke.  There's also a display of the different kinds of poke they offer, so if it's not on display, ask, and they may have it in the back.I tried the spicy ahi and wasabi poke.  The spicy ahi definitely has a kick.  But I don't like sauce on my poke, and this was my friend's choice.  What I did like was the wasabi poke.  Definitely has the potential to clear out your sinuses, so beware.  The wasabi is for sure in there.  I loved it.  The fish tasted pretty fresh, and the flavor was on point.  I will very likely be coming back here to get my poke fix again.I also tried their Saimin Deluxe.  It's a huge bowl with all the fixings.  So good on a colder day.  In addition, the spam and egg masubi was a great snack to take with me before I went clubbing that night.  Not too much rice or sauce, so I could actually taste the spam and egg.  Glad, because some places love to just pile that stuff on!!Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas.  Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away.Tip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties.If you're looking this place up, just go. But know that it's INSIDE of  Island Sushi. Don't spend ten minutes arguing with your GPS in their parking lot. There's a sticker on the door. Poke is delicious, and these guys do it right. My favorites are the ahi-avocado or the salmon poke, but they also have a spicy crab dish that is tasty too. They also offer "ocean salad" AKA seaweed salad, which is simpler but also one of my favorite things. I haven't worked up the courage to try the raw tako yet!Pricing is fair for the great quality. If you live on the other side of town like I do, buy twice as much as you think you want because driving across town is a pain in the butt but you'll do it for this poke. Speak up and ask to try before you buy, the guys are friendly and want to make sure you get something you'll love.As a big fan of Poke this is the best place in Vegas for Poke.  It is Hawaiian style and remind me of Ono Seafood in Waikiki.  They have several to chose from which can make it tough to choose.     I got the spicy Avocado Ahi which was fresh and delicious.  The spicy Ahi with masago and mayo was perfection.  The taste was to die for and the Ahi just melted in your mouth.  We got a 1/4 pound of the seasoned dry skipjack tuna which was also amazing.  We got the seasoned garlic bulbs which were not overpowering at all.  I really enjoyed their unique flavor.  We also got the Kimchee cucumbers and imitation crab which were both a tasty treat.   The staff is excellent and helpful.  They had run out of the spicy Ahi but they quickly made us a fresh batch.  This was my 2nd visit and I will definitely be back.  The quality of their Poke s truly amazing.  The freshness made me think I was in Hawaii!I wish this place was in Los Angeles!  Located in a strip mall, there's tons of easy parking.  Three restaurants in one place means you can get some sushi, poke, hawaiian, and yummy desserts too.  There are tables & chairs, and I think you can order grill items from the poke counter too.We had lunch here before we hit the road to drive back home, & I literally did not need to eat til the next day.  (Ok, well except some of the leftovers haha)Everything was GREAT:Poke - sold by the weight, they had like a dozen different choices, as well as kimchi cucumbers, seaweed salad, and whole garlic clovesLoco Moco - mmmm, fatty pork, short grain rice, runny eggs & a meaty gravyTres Leches cake with guavaGuava layer cakeMalasadas filled with custard, coconut or chocolate creamButter mochiThe sushi restaurant that's attached also does ayce.In LA, there are a lot of great poke places, but I don't know where to get loco moco with slices of fatty pork instead of the hamburger.  So the next time I come here, I'd get the poke again, but the loco moco would be what I'd make the special trip for!The fact that there are three restaurants under one roof is genius.  This place does some awesome fresh poke.  The Island plate counter has loco moco and other hawaiian goodies, and to the right there is a sushi restaurant that was popping.  Soooo Many options!I want it all and then some.  It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table.  Speaking of which this would be awesome to pick up stuff to make a picnic :)Why are there no good hawaiian places in LA?I want the whole combo of roasted pork loco moco and fresh poke...Soo good...If yall are going, bring me back some ya here.
Villa Peru Restaurant=I got asked on a Valentines day date (hold your awwws) but he refused to tell me where or what we were doing. Creepy. When we parked in front of Villa, I found out that were coming here. To my date's credit, I am Peruvian and moved to the US when I started college (errr 7 years ago). He picked a Peruvian restaurant on Valentines day- where they had a Peruvian traditional folk band playing (enter cue to Awwwww away).Now that you are done awww-ing, let me share with you that I kinda, sorta, maybe, definitely freaked out. First of all, authentic and decent Peruvian food is very hard to find in the US- different ingredients, imported stuff, not-equally-tasty substitutes, etc. Secondly- a Peruvian folk band? Dear god, this has the potential to be one incredibly embarrassingly cheesy night.So I sat my ass down and proceeded to explain to my date (basically) the entire menu. I ordered the Anticuchos (grilled beef heart on a stick), Ceviche and Lomo Saltado. I also ordered 2 Cuzque√±as beer and the Chicha morada- a juice made from boiling purple corn, fresh fruit and sugar.Food wise, Villa Peru is a decent 3.5 stars. The Chicha was made fresh and it tasted exactly like it is supposed to: fresh, sweet and refreshing. The Ceviche was a solid 4.5 stars as the fish was fresh, the corn was Peruvian (we have a different type of corn, people), the sweet potato was soft and it had tons of citrus and onions. It just lacked some spice, so I had to ask for some Rocoto (our spiciest pepper) to add to it.The less successful dishes were the Lomo Saltado and the Anticuchos. The sirloin was sauteed with soy sauce which is not how its supposed to be done, The fries were a bit soggy and there were no fresh peppers (aji and rocoto, traditionally) sliced thinly and sauteed with the meal. It was decent and tasty, but it lacked spice. The Anticuchos were grilled well, but the pieces were very thick as traditionally, it's supposed to be thinly sliced squares. This made the meat dry and harder to eat, but the sides (potato, onion salad and some fresh herbs) were very nicely done.I understand that the place was full on Valentine's day, but I hate to say that the service really sucked. I was constantly looking around to get the server's attention for more water, the rocoto sauce or even the check and receipt.  2 stars for service. boo.Now that the boring yet actually useful parts of the Yelp review are completed, let me get back to my super corny story. The band started setting up while we were eating, to which I thought "oh god maybe I can eat really fast and get the check before they start playing". Nope. No dice. They started and they kept it going for the duration of our stay. And they were... awesome. For real- great voice, traditional instruments (like the Cajon- a form of drums), all traditional songs I grew up with and mad Spanish guitar skills. It's as good as I would find at any creole bar in Lima and that was ratified by all the (Peruvian) guests that were loudly singing along (maybe it was the booze) and shaking side-to-side in their chairs. Adorable.I think at one point towards the end of the night, the date asked me if I wanted to dance. Dear date, don't push it, I'm too sober to go there. All in all, it was a decent Peruvian restaurant that with some service improvements (and spice enhancements) can be a great great spot. They definitely delivered on Valentines day, and I guess so did my date.  As I went home, my anti-romantic self stopped and thought "crap. I just ate a heart on Valentines day. I hope this wasn't on purpose". Shucks.
Gluten Free Creations=i went here for a friend's birthday brunch! it was located behind the denny's and in the same center as peter piper pizza. google maps takes you across the street just FYI :) everyone loved the monte carlo sandwich. it was a hit! our server was super friendly. they had a huge assortment of GF options and also listed other potential allergens in their food on the menu (egg, soy, etc) in addition to their menu, they had a bakery to take home some goodies as well as pre packed mixes to make the bread and I assume other GF baked goods yourself. they also sell their GF flour.apparently, if you have a gluten allergy...according my friend this is the best and most delicious option she's been able to find!
8 Seasons Grille=We really enjoyed our meal at 8 Seasons Grille! We just moved nearby and it was an easy place to meet a friend for lunch. I really didn't expect much since I don't see many people in here, but I think it's just a bad location and usually an afterthought -- I have been walking by for two years and would always think "Oh, I should go there!" but then it's never on my radar.The only bad thing to report was the coffee was burnt; it had this sour taste to it. It was also a little strange to be the only people in the restaurant, but it was also right during a Badger game.My friend ordered a side salad with the grits. She enjoyed both a lot. We were impressed with the dressing -- some sort of pistachio mixture. Yum! Derek got brisket with frites on a pretzel bun. He thoroughly enjoyed that, and it was good he was hungry. :) I had huevos rancheros, and UGH SO YUMMY. Everything was perfectly balanced and full of flavor.I'm excited to try something new, though pretty disappointed that their only vegetarian lunch entre√© was a grilled cheese sandwich. Hopefully they serve breakfast foods later in the day so I can choose from that menu, too.Last thing: I think they need to school their servers a little more on potential allergies or intolerances. My friend is severely gluten-intolerant and had a question about where a "GF" was positioned because it was hard to see, and the waitress really didn't know.
Tehran Restaurant=I have to boycott this place for ethical reasons. I've never been here before so I might be biased but past co-workers have said that the owners don't treat their staff very well and only pay them in tips under the table. I hate to be a bother but when I hear things like that I never want to go here.
ZK Grill=07/14/11Since I hadn't eaten here before, when the opportunity to buy a groupon to Zaytoon Kabob Bistro presented itself, I elected to purchase only one.  After experiencing a wonderful meal there, complete w/ terrific saffron-rosewater ice cream (with wafer cookies!!), Mom and I wished I'd bought three (the max offered)!  It's a a step or two up from being a dive, but I was completely ready to get an earful from Mom-- I DIDN'T, which still surprises me now just thinking about it.  I immediately looked up at the wall menus to see what Mom and I would like , while Mom sat at the table sulkily flipping over the paper menu.  I decided on trying the steak kabob wrap, while I chose the lamb kabob platter for Mom, especially when I saw that it included saffron rice.As we sat waiting for our food, we noticed that it was very cold in there due to all of the ceiling fans running on full blast.  I had to retrieve my sweater from the car so that Mom could stop shivering.  I didn't think it was necessary to have all the fans on, but I didn't complain.  We were ooh'ing and aah'ing from our first bites!  I haven't seen her so happy w/ a meal out for a long time...  I couldn't try the lamb (allergy), but her plate looked delicious, w/ a huge skewer of tender lamb cutlets, perfectly grilled, a generous serving of saffron-sprinkled basmati rice, a roasted tomato, and onions.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ#uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ  Adding more veggies would've made the platter better, but Mom really was happy w/ her meal.  I loved my steak kabob wrap-- the steak chunks could've been a little less fatty, but they were tender and juicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg#AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg  I wished there were more pieces...  I'd ordered the wrap instead of the platter, bec. I wanted the bread, but I kept wishing there were more veggies in my wrap, so I'll have to try the platter next time and just order a pita on the side.While the entrees were delicious, it was the homemade ice cream that stole the show!  It's listed as "Saffron ice cream," but it also contained rosewater, tiny chunky pieces of almond paste, and pistachios. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw#ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw  It was PERFECT!  I was very tempted to buy a pint to take home, but it's so delicious, I didn't want to binge on the stuff!  It's an excellent ending to a terrific meal.  (We would go back just to have this- it's that good!)Zaytoon was a bit price-y, especially w/ its cafeteria-style atmosphere- Z's certainly not a place you'd like to take a date to!  Spiffy up the place a bit, Z!!  However, we'll be back, w/ or w/o a groupon!p.s.  Mom's already told me twice after meals eaten after this date "We should've just gone to Zaytoon's!"This place is so fresh and so green green!!! :)   I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy John's and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!!  How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! I truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! Way to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!11/19/15Had a Groupon that was to expire last night, so took Mom for dinner.  I've been enticing her to go since buying the coupon in July, but she could not remember ever dining here, so she kept saying no.  She certainly remembered after taking one bite of her lamb entree!  All she kept saying was "Oh, wow" and "So good!," over and over, and soon I began to chime in canon.  But I am getting ahead of my updated review...When we entered the restaurant, I almost did not recognize the place, since the atmosphere has certainly changed.  The kitchen window is still there, but it's now fronted by two tables, in the shape of an L, upon which the register is on one end, and styrofoam food containers and baklava and other pastries in to-go containers are on the other end.  Three walls have pretty mural photo wallpapers of lush green scenery and ruins on them, and there are lovely new plum/burgundy cushioned booths installed.  Perhaps the owners will open up the kitchen a bit more, to let us see more of the kitchen action.  Being able to only see the kitchen staff's faces gives me the willies, for some reason... Hehe!  :)After Mom had a few bites of her lamb entree, with half-saffron rice and half-salad, she asked me to find more ZK Grill Groupons to use in the future. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=OKlzf5ZnGDgzy53noOlAzQ  I already knew that she loved the food here (so did I), so I am always looking out for ZK Grill deals.  Have I told you yet about the Chicken and Filet entree I ordered? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=XTjf8HfYHfWdU0OYLWBWhw  I also went with half-saffron rice (yes, I still am allergic to rice, but I can't say no to saffron rice, especially buttered saffron rice!) and half-salad-- you MUST try the champagne vinaigrette here, oh my goodness!  Great portions, and even better still, great flavors and textures (meat, salad, and rice).  I'll forgo the chicken next time (nice color and slight grill flavor, but the texture was ALMOST on the tad-dry side) and just go full-on filet, but now that I think about it, I don't think that's even an option here (??).  There's lamb, lamb with ground beef (a la koubideh style), chicken shawarma, chicken and filet, but I don't think there's lamb and filet nor just filet.  Hmm...We ended our meal with Saffron ice cream, but instead of a scoop of ice cream and a cookie wafer placed on top, it's now made into an ice cream sandwich between two wafers and pre-packaged. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=849LmOk-UwUvmTvx3is6jg  Same great ice cream flavors (rosewater, saffron, and pistachio) and little bits of pistachio bits for texture, but the wafers aren't crispy anymore-- the refrigeration has caused them to lose their crispiness.  I hope the owners/staff revert back to serving this dessert item like they used to, a scoop of ice cream with one wafer on top, and perhaps a second one upon request!
Super B Burrito=Finally, Henderson (or the border with Henderson) has a good taqueria. Super B Burrito brings the simple, fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the Vegas suburb.  The guacamole: fresh and oh so good.  The pinto beans: fresh and tasty.  The salsa and hot sauce: fresh and spicy.Super B Burrito does the classics right.  A carne asada super burrito (around $5 plus tax) comes with rice and beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream.  And it's good.  Real good.  Even the tortilla is well textured and chewy (i.e. not out of the freezer).  You may have noticed a repetition of the word "fresh".  It's a simple, but necessary concept for a great burrito.  Super B Burrito understands that and it's a solid taqueria because of it (and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1-2 day old tastes of Roberto's, it's revolutionary). But don't think that Super B Burrito only offers the classics.  If you're a meat eater, this is your place.  They prepare pork, steak and chicken in a variety of manners.  I had the coca-cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet, but not over-the-top sugary.  Here's how good that pork is: I always (always) order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria.  But when we stepped into the place, the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats.  The pork in green chile was spicy and delicious.  But there was no challenger to the coca-cola fried pork.  It's what will keep me going back again and again. Unfortunately, one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar.  Super B Burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option.  They do add in some lettuce, but it needs a little more oomph--either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely.  Without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition.  So four stars for the pork burrito, two stars for the vegetarian.  How did we get back to four stars overall?  The customer service is exemplary.  Friendly, quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria's specialties.  The guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito.  I will definitely be back as a repeat customer.  Hopefully, they'll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try.The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.
Caf√© Cantina=Definitly the best burrito in Montreal! My fave is the butternut squash burrito but Pulled pork is also amazing.Worth the detour, friendly service, great art on walls, food soo fresh.
Sunshine Moon Peking Pub=Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!"You are an artistic person - let your colors show."That's what my fortune cookie said during my first meal at Sunshine Moon Peking Pub the other night.  I say "first meal" because I  know there will be more... (and hopefully better fortunes than that one too!)Rich and his team did a great job renovating this restaurant where Bacon used to reside.  It's now got a cool Asian vibe while still casual and welcoming.  Service (from Kelly and James) was friendly and attentive.  We took their recommendations and ordered the following:*Veggie Spring Rolls*Chilled Cucumber Salad*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)*Mushroom Purse*Shrimp in Lobster SauceI know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!Well, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  I really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper "purse" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other "shrimp in lobster sauce" dish I've had in the past.The one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  SMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.Oh... and the point of me starting this review with my fortune? There was none; just wanted to share.  Feel free to share yours too!
Five Guys Burgers and Fries=It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a "fast food" spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I won't choose a "fast food" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time.I seriously cannot recommend the food served here. I was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because I had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south Phoenix restaurant.The fries served here were terrible. My dining partner commented on how soggy and unappetizing they were and took them back to only have them replaced with equally depressing pile of soggy, soft fries. His experience in fast food restaurant management told him all he needed to know by watching them cook the fries. They overload the fryer baskets and never account for time required to bring the oil back up to the proper heat. The result is a soggy fry that tastes more boiled than fried.A real disappointment and an expensive one at that. Most of my fries remained uneaten and the burger was greasy and flavorless. Quality control is not a priority here, but they are quite efficient at taking your hard-earned cash.
Streets of New York=Dropped in for a lunch one day and decided to order a #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Dressing) w/Pasta Salad and a Coors Light.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=gI5V2uJFJoVdCc6CMlojqAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=MyzQ7VsZ8W4vxMXJxyyERwoUB0n2Jl76BxGXDUpj3BgQSince I was dining alone, I sat at the counter.  The food was prepared pretty fast.  I only had a few sips of my Beer before the waitress came out with the Sandwich.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is soft and crunchy....the crunch comes from the toaster.  The Sandwich is served hot from a toaster....which makes the flavor of the Meats come out.  The only complaint I have about the Sandwich is that the Dressing makes the Bread too soggy....if you don't eat it fast, it will fall apart on you.The Pasta Salad is OK....too much Cheese and Dressing on it...I would have preferred it with a little less.Overall, it was a nice lunch experience.Return Factor - 84%
Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill=I have always been a big fan of all things teriyaki. Unfortunately, im not a fan of this place. Let me explain.Any time I go to a teriyaki place, I always get the chicken n beef combo because come on, you get two kinds of meat and you cant really mess that up right? Here they kind of did ok. You have two choices of sizes. Regular and Large. The large is only 50 cents more so might as well right? So here's why im not too fond of this place. The chicken was dry. I had to douse it with teriyaki sauce and sriracha just to make it edible. I wanted brown rice instead of white. They charge you 40 cents for that while some other places don't. The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.So I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.  I have actually been here twice. Once with company that wanted to go here and this second time around because I thought the first time was a fluke. Unfortunately, this second visit verified what I thought all along.Get your $2.99 bowls on tuesdays and thursdays. I defintely take advantage of that deal on a weekly basis. hehe overall experience with this place.. I can't complain. I normally get the all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl. it's about 8 bucks for a bowl and it comes with veggies and rice you have the option to choose brown rice. Customer service is great everyone is greeted and they are polite. I am a regular at this place if im craving for something healthy and quick.
Omnivore=4.5Happiness. Pure happiness. On my plate and in my mouth. From the outside, Omnivore's not much to look at... but this is a good thing. It means that rather than concentrating its efforts to look hip and cool, tptb behind Omnivore concentrate on good food, nice service and an authentic experience. This is not to say, however, that Omnivore looks shabby. It doesn't. It's comfy, welcoming and fits the neighborhood nicely. I was particularly enamored with the mosaic tables.In the proper frame of mind, I looked over the menu and made my selection. A chilly day in a chill restaurant demands tea. Fresh tea. Fresh mint tea... as in, mint leaves, simple syrup, water, and a cup. Boisson (much like poisson, one of my favorite French words) out of the way, I was ready to order the rest of my combo. Yes, combo. For $10, you get a kafta sandwich, soup and drink. For my soup, the green garlic-type soup was filling, deeply-flavored and wonderfully-made. Eating it was like eating warm joy. The garlic wasn't overpowering but it was, certainly, the star of the show. I decided on the Bombay kafta: chicken, sumac onions, cabbage, and pineapple chutney. Tell me that doesn't sound incredible. You can't. You can't tell me that. Because it *was* incredible. The sandwich was generously-portioned, spicy and textured so that every bite had a nice crunch as well as plenty of meat & seasoning. Although I was tasked with working after lunch, I much rather have found a nice corner in which to curl up with a book and take a nap. Omnivore serves comfort food from a Mid-East perspective that's sure to delight. It made me fall even more in love with Montreal.
Wicked Spoon=So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!Wickedly Awesome!There are a lot of cool things about this buffet that no other place has but most of it was pretty average or subpar.  Having shawarma on a spit is an awesome idea but it wasn't that good.  Risotto is something different but it was pretty meh.  Crab stir fried in some kinda butter sauce might sound appetizing but I would rather just have a plate full of cold crab legs and crack them myself.  They had the most lamb I'd ever seen in a Vegas buffet including ribs, leg and mini chops (prob my favorite thing in the whole place).  I also enjoyed the different individualized portions of pasta.  Wish I had more room for dessert.   And what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.  So the servers can deal with other stuff...like taking finished plates off the table.  Some of our plates sat there for a pretty long time before they got picked up.  We also had to repeatedly ask for more water and coffee before they actually brought it.  I can think of at least 5 buffets in town I would rather go to than this one for the price though.  Might be a one and done for me.I went into Cosmo hotel to grab an early dinner after CES and was blown away by the decor and ambiance of Wicked Spoon Buffet. We got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. Affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.I loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. Definitely an A+ for looks. Too bad the taste fell way short.At first, I though that it was pretty tasty, but alas I was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. But after my first plate, I noticed that nothing really stood out. I had no favorites to go back to...and I just ended up trying a little bit of everything. Which is almost IMPOSSIBLE to do.Remember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes I would only want a bite or two, but because I had to take the entire serving, I ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. I felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because I didn't like it all that much. Plus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. By then, you just end up getting full before you can get your money's worth. Boo!The meats were a little dry, and WHAT...no crab legs?? Instead they had some kinda peeled crab (I THINK) in some butter sauce. Of course I wouldn't really know because nothing is LABELED. But regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. My favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\ Whyyyyyyyyy is life so difficult??My favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. Again, everything here looks stunning. Miniature works of art. Although looking individual and unique, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. Nothing spectacular. They also have chocolate covered strawberries which I liked, but my favorite was the gelato. The salted peanut flavor was my top pick.Service was also on the slow side. It took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out. By then I already fell asleep from the mediocre food -_-Pretty face, but lacking in quality substance.Why must I "rate" this place, damn it. The idea is so original, new, trendy, and seemingly THE dream buffet of a gourmand. Unfortunately, I guess the common phrase is true, "looks aren't everything."Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's a long, weird and windy walk. You will be easily distracted by odd objects: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=q-Ckm0qluUvbReCUhCWYrwThe buffet has different selections of dishes served in buffet style trays and some items were presented in mini pots, pans, and your own mini deep-fryer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=g0AI7zRDTe5M-Oac7z4wbQ).  The dishes were labeled with detailed descriptions; instead of your typical "arugula salad" sign, it was "arugula and candied cashews with blackberry vinaigrette salad." It kinda gives you a clear idea of what you're eating, sans playing the guessing game.Although the dishes were attractive, I've had better buffets on the strip. I can think of maybe 1 or 2 memorable dishes, and the rest were just passable. Hm, I guess that's what you would generally expect at a buffet..I was a little disappointed in the dessert section. The colors and presentation of the desserts selection made me so excited. Come on, dessert cups topped with edible silver flakes?! Unfortunately, the only thing I really enjoyed were the mini apple pops and gelato. Everything, all in all, was sort of a hit or miss. (a "miss," as in, hell to the NO)This place has so much potential! I have mixed feelings about this buffet, so I don't know how to accurately rate it. So, why is this so hard? Well, that's what she said.I had to try it.  We were tired of the M (except I really like their cider, and when they serve it to me in a wine glass) so we wanted my brother to be the first in the family to try the Cosmo buffet (since my parents already hit up the M years before he could visit me again).We went on a Sunday night - line was nonexistent, price reasonable, ambiance great.  Our server Will was fantabulous - attentive, sense of humor, super fast on drink requests and refills.  He gave Eric R. three sprite refills at one time since he was unusually thirsty for soda, something he never drinks.  The iced tea was good - definitely brewed and not Lipton.  It was sort of oolong ish.  Will was the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.Yes, the plates are awkward.  You can fit like 3 or 4 items at a time, they are clunky and sliding everywhere.  Will told us he can only clear one person's mess at a time, which slows down his progress.  The worst for me was the lack of signage.  Personally, I don't like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguishing characteristics.  What the heck were in half the dishes?!  I honestly have no idea.  I wasn't in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.The shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn't enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.The desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn't know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn't get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn't labeled.  He said lots of people ask him that, that the management is aware, but that the "signage is delayed on order."  I would hope the Cosmo has its own printer.  Oh well.  Not coming back here.there's a saying in korea, "10 years can move mountains and rivers", but it seems like 1 year is enough to change vegas. since my last visit back in late 2009, many new hotels have been recently added to the city's directory, and one is always trying to outdo another. the hubby and i were informed of these hip, ritzy and stylish new additions, and how they were now "must's" in vegas, cosmopolitan being one of them. in fact, on our way to vegas, my sis (on her way back from vegas!) told me about her new fascination with wicked spoon buffet at cosmopolitan. i normally despise buffet, but the moment my sister said "ice cream station", i knew i was sold. after a good night sleep, we woke up at 8am and mapped out our itinerary for the day that evolved around two feasts. we exercised vigorously (see the review of encore's fitness center below) and walked about a mile in cosmopolitan hotel before we reached the buffet. at 10:30am on saturday morning, there was no line and the dining hall was not too crowded. there were the standard breakfast items (hard as brick waffles, soggy pancakes, made to order omelets, fresh fruits, miniature boxed cereals, assortment of breads and edible yogurt) along with carving station (ny steak, some sausage, some pork part and other protein thing), cold seafood section (smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail), italian food (pizza, pasta and ravioli stuff) and asian food section (sushi, dumplings and korean kalbi). obviously, i didn't bother to inspect the meat station too much, but i sure frequented the seafood and asian food stations multiple times. the smoked salmon was surprisingly fresh and tasty. we also liked the shrimp dumplings although the skin was a bit dried. however, their kalbi was the worse i had in a while with overly sweet and burnt flavors. the show stopper of wicked spoon buffet was the dessert station, specifically the ice cream bar with 14-16 different flavors. i tackled small scoops of pistachio, strawberry, amaretto, oreo cookie and tiramisu, and they all seemed decent, although a little too sweet for me. there were decadent dessert offerings such as mini madeline cookies and french macarons which sadly did not live up to my expectations. the usuals such as chocolate covered strawberries and apples were good, but again, not great. many of the food were served in individual sized pots, cups and dishes (probably will reduce waste and keep the food fresh) so lines moved really fast and the stations were kept clean. the overall look of the dining space is modern and comfortable with some big tables to accommodate large parties. the waitresses wear some gloomy, tacky brown plaid shirt dresses which literally made me feel depressed to look at them, but they were some of the hardest working bunch. the hubby felt bad how other tables left no tip, so we went the other route and left them a generous amount. by now, you should know what to expect from a buffet...mediocre food, high price tag and looking like 5 month pregnant! as long as you don't compare the food to your "favorite" sushi, steak, pizza joint or authentic home cooked meal, wicked spoon buffet might satisfy your edacious nature. actually, $25 brunch buffet in vegas is not a bad deal at all.I love this place! AYCE brunch for just $23 at the Cosmopolitan! Nice. It's cheap. It's good. It's artistic.Dishes are small and dainty, beautifully arranged tapa style dishes. I think you either like it or you don't. And I really liked it...it was different and fun! Little saucepans and individual dishes, it was just too cute to pass up. See for yourself:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=XpWiM7EYchGqenNiq1c2vQPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=aX2HFOd1sQa3v4UAUftTYQPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=uTxWe05t_qtnpIxVwPmErQIn the meat section they had your usual, chicken, beef and slab of bacon!! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=7GAJvXufLfnCjIXK-avn7wI loved everything! Except the eggs benedict, which looked good but didn't taste good. But please please please save room for dessert! I think the dessert section was by far my favorite part! Everything was yummy. The ice cream choices were awesome, I tried the mango and the salted peanut! Both were delish...if my tummy could have handled more, I would have tried more flavors. But I had to save room for the chocolate covered strawberries and the small chocolate covered crab apples!! They were so cute. Definitely give Wicked Spoon a try if your in Vegas!I don't think this buffet is for everyone, but it's definitely for ME!!!  Oh how I dream of going back... and going back OFTEN!I would say if you are the kind of person that likes to go to a buffet to load your plate up with a mountain of fried shrimp or other standard buffet items, you won't like this place.Buf if you are the kind of person who likes to try all kinds of different foods, made in all kinds of different ways... this will be your kind of place!  Nothing here is just "plain."  The polenta isn't just polenta.  It's "creamy mushroom and marscapone polenta."   The stromboli isn't just stromboli.  It's "pulled pork stromboli with roasted red peppers." The scalloped potatoes are "scalloped potatoes baked in a rich truffle sauce."   You get the idea.So if those kinds of things intimidate you, rather than excite you.... The Wicked Spoon isn't for you.  The last time my husband and I were there, as we were walking out, a couple who was also leaving turned to us with disgusted looks on their faces and said "Did you like that?"  We responded "yes" and they shook their heads and said "yuck.  We didn't."  So it's obviously not for everyone, but I can tell you that if you have adventurous taste buds and like to try a little bit of everything.... you won't be disappointed.So when two Filipinos end up near the strip deciding on lunch, it almost feels natural we'd end up at a buffet to nosh, sit and kill time. I think I will get to the strongpoints first:MEAT, especially pork dishes. Seriously, the steamship pork they were carving, miso glazed pork loin, char siu, pork belly steam buns were all tasty and perfectly cooked. Pork is usually a buffet fail, but these are juicy and perfectly cooked. The steamship with a bit of the onion marmalade and chimichurri was worth a 2nd carving. The other meats like the turkey, kalbi ribs and linguica was good too. If I just want to sit and gorge on meat, I would consider going here for $22 than go to a Brazilian rodizio for $40. Salad- I know, it's just an effing salad but buratta cheese with crushed pistachio served with frisee in red wine raspberry vinaigrette is a winner.Gelato- plenty flavors and well madeDecent- cured pepper salmon, cheeses, farro tabuleh, goat cheese roasted tomato salad, creamy polenta with mushrooms, pizza, clams in a stew (but they really should have just left them plain in butter since the clams were fresh but the sauce isn't good), already peeled shrimp cocktail. Now onto the fails- The concept of little serving plates seem cute and different, but it simply doesn't work especially on the items they are doing. Covered or not, these are items that shouldn't sit so they really need to consider thats in them. They also seriously need to give you like a cafeteria tray. Two of them fill a plate. Risotto- seriously? Rice seizes into itself and gets mushy. Gnochi turns into a gummy mess like a mochi. Cappelli pasta looked mushy so I didn't even try. Mac n cheese got hard on the top. Seafood like poached cod was gross. Desserts were very pretty but some were spit out worthy. Gelato was the best thing there with plenty of flavors and good consistency. This little mousse chocolate cup was decent, the strawberries dipped in chocolate were sweet. I saw macarons with fruit and I was expecting them to not be great, but they were inedible. It tasted like the purple food coloring and rusted chlorinated water. Some desserts didn't even make fucking sense like a very tart mango puree with chocolate mouse and pearls and fruit jelly on top. This was where the majority of food wastage was since a lot of it wasn't any good. I rather have a big bowl of ugly looking bread pudding from Sams Town buffet than aesthetically pleasing but palette scaring desserts. Service was alright. Plates didn't sit so long, but we didn't get many plates for the time we sat around. I like that they do give you water for the table since sometimes you just need something to drink and don't have anything. They weren't bad on the refills of my tea though. It's not a buffet I would recommend for that pricepoint, but I suppose it wasn't terrible. I'm a pork meat person so the large amount of pork cooked right was a definite win. Maybe if I had tourist friends going there anyways, I wouldn't mind going, but I do not think it's a place I'd seek out.BONE MARROW!!! Need I say more???Thank goodness a friend told us about this place otherwise we would have just continued to go to disappointing buffets. The cost, about $31 after tax (not bad at all). Came here for dinner with friends and thankfully it wasn't packed (because the Lord knows I don't like people getting in the way of me and my food). Decor was beautiful and like "Liza T." said, very modern and contemporary. This is one of the very few buffets where I was actually excited about the food. Why? Because the first thing I saw and grabbed was the huge slab of bone marrow sliced in half and cooked to perfection, I swear it called out to me and I answered!! *Yummm* Great selection of foods, I wish I could remember everything they served but I totally blacked out and grabbed anything and everything and by the time I sat down I had a mountain of food sitting on top of my plate! The desserts were VERY cute and not only appealed to the eyes but appealed to the taste buds as well. =D Definitely will be coming back to this buffet when in town again. 5 STARS!!!Ever since the Bellagio opened up on the Strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.Now, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!What's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).12:11..err, 12:14 am.. i think.. to be honest, im not sure.i just stumbled my way back into my apartment after a 7 hour drive, From Las Vegas, back to Whittier. A victim of my own gluttony, and self-torturing habits. head still buzzing from the effects of No-Doz, chased with tiny "5 hour Energy" bottles. i find myself awake, and, yet dead on my feet. with really only one thing lingering in my mind. i write these lines with hope, that by purging my experience, i might actually get some sleep tonight..ah, my friends.. a circle of people that can only be described as "Family" When i learned that two of my friends(who's pending nuptials will not be recognized in CA.) decided to have their Bachelorette party in Vegas, i knew what to expect. our group Vegas trips were legendary. Fast-Forward to late morning, Sunday. The hazy fog is just starting to lift. i sit there, blinking into oblivion, trying to figure out what the heck transpired in the past 44 hours. surveying my surroundings, i gather that i am in some type of restaurant, a Buffet! but which one? speaking slowly, i am able to obtain that we are sitting around a table at the Wicked Spoon Buffet, inside the new Cosmopolitan hotel. little by little, my head is clearing. i am sipping at some really tasty water, decanted out of the coolest glass bottles. then, a smiling waiter slides a large glass in front of me. wait..i know what that is! its a bloody mary!! thank god! not wasting any time, i toss back the delicious concoction, and begin to gather my wits. food is what i need, and i am in the right place. being somewhat of a Vegas Buffet Veteran, i decide to take a surveying lap, before committing to selections. the spread seems well organized and very extensive. i grab a plate and begin my systematic buffet destruction. first round: Korean-style grilled short rib, Pork belly slider with cilantro salad, Fresh orecchiette with crimini mushrooms and braised short ribs. the Korean rib was excellent! perfectly grilled, and oh so tasty! the Pork belly slider was a fresh boa bun stuffed with tender pork, cilantro, and a tangy vinaigrette. it was so good, i had two more after. the mushroom and short rib pasta was served in a quaint little saute pan, and was absolutely amazing! each one of these dishes was of top-restaurant quality. this couldn't be mass-produced buffet-fare. it tasted like a well trained chef prepared these dishes just for me. The things i found here, were not the types of food often found at your run-of-the-mill Vegas buffet. Mascarpone Polenta(omg!), Dashi broth, Roasted curry cauliflower, Cypress Grove "Drunken Goat" cheese, Red Velvet Pancakes, and heirloom tomato salad. in the 48 hours i was a temporary resident of Las Vegas, NV. i slept not a single wink. okay, maybe a cat nap here or there. i drank, i gambled, i drank, i danced, i drank and drank some more. there are many of those 48 hours that are lost to my mind. from witness reports given to me by my good pals, maybe its better that way. but thankfully, the memories i have from the Wicked Spoon are fresh and vivid. This place will perpetually be on my list, every time i choose to destroy myself a little bit, just across the state line.Been to the Wicked Spoon Buffet a few times since they opened.  First time I went was during lunch during their first or second week of opening, where there were many kinks still needed to be worked out (lack of labels for the food served, bussers/waiters having a hard time clearing plates, etc.).  But I am glad to say that since my first visit, all of these issues have been addressed, and the experience of dining here has vastly improved.The selection of food served have also undergone a lot of changes, with items that are not popular or not being executed well being removed and replaced (crab apples is no more and replaced by chocolate covered marshmallows, dim sum items are gone - I wish they were still able to make the xiao long baos, some desserts are changed or simplified).The wait is a complaint for some visitors, but it hasn't been an issue for me during the times I have dined at the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  With the most recent visit being at 7pm during the weekday.  Price for lunch is $19 and $27 for dinner, which is pretty fair for the quality and selection of food served.  There is also a bar where you can order alcoholic beverages for an additional charge.The buffet itself is pretty organized and traffic for the most part flows smoothly.  The salads and appetizers station is located on the left side (facing the buffet) and entrees in the middle, Asian section on the right side near the dessert station.  The dining area is decorated nicely, although it is not that large.  Finding the buffet can be a A lot of comments have already been posted about the food, so I am not going to bore you with my thoughts and preferences, as we all have different tastes, likes and dislikes.  But I will say that occasionally they serve whole suckling pigs (each weighing about 100 pounds and feeds about 30 people) so if you do see it on the buffet consider yourself lucky and enjoy the special treat.From very reliable sources, the Asian station is one of the most popular station at the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  The Chefs there have plans to roll out a seasonal menu starting Easter, while continuing to serve the some core items throughout the year, so guests can experience the food at Wicked Spoon without getting bored of the same menu.About the service, I think it is excellent.  The waiters/waitresses are all doing their best to offer a great service to the guest.  And if you have special dietary needs, you can ask the cooks and they will do their best to accommodate you.  If you have other special requests (i.e., craving for a specialty cheese that may not be on displayed at the buffet, wanting to have your prime rib grilled), from personal experience I know they will accommodate you.  Which is major kudos in my book.Anyway, for the price of admission, I think you are getting a pretty decent value and food here.  4 stars!And if you have the Cosmopolitan IDENTITY card, present it to the cashier to accumulate points towards the rewards program.---Promotions---On "Plateau" Mondays, guests can upgrade their dinner with a Fruits de Mer Seafood Plateau served directly at your table for only $10 per person. Minimum of 2 people.This is probably one of the best buffets in Vegas!We got there just in time before the crazy line started.  Lucky us!As I started down the line, there were so many choices!  Loved the grilled asparagus salad, mini pot of creamed corn (its really cream & corn, delish!!), fresh fruits, & dessert island with a gelato case (MMMMMM).The atmosphere is great, very open seating and serving stations.  I didnt get to try the carving station as there was so much to try!  They had a sushi section too.  I loved that lots of items were served in individual pots/plates/cups, they have great presentation!!  I wanted everything!!Can't wait to come back!  We even thought about going back to brunch the next day!!  YUMS!!!!!!!I AM HUGE!  This would be another great opening for a "that's what she said" zinger. But, at this buffet there is no denying that my stature was indeed grandiose.  Everything's served in miniature crockery, pans, fryers, cones, and cups.  I truly felt like the jolly yellow giant in jack's miniature string bean kitchen. This however is where the rubber meets the road and smaller in this case is not necessarily a good thing.  Because the portions are served in smaller individual servings, they tend to dry out pretty fast if you fail to get things as soon as they're put out.  While there were numerous items to choose from, over half of them were just too dried out or hard, which included:- The pork belly sliders.- The mac 'n cheese was too dried out and not cheesy enough.- The al pastor tacos were quite disappointing and also very dried out (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=bTym4e_dO56vo_I-X0jVSw).- The Prime Rib was a bit rubbery.- The Korean short ribs were chewy and in par with the quality of a young dong tofu house.- The salads a bit wilted and torn.The miniature dishes that were really good:- The miniature fryers of sweet tater fires (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=jeUB9sk3TPj5gLBViw6WFw).- The creamed corn and red wine braised mushrooms were surprisingly tasty.- The Pot Roast served in a miniature Dutch oven (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gQSN3CUgWdMXuDi814bwRA).I think the highlight were the desserts. And they were numerous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gYly1GSdQl1ivFLbLUS2FQ).- Metallic-colored egg shells that were filled with egg cr√®me and topped with miniature macarons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=F4Tl5-voNvQV2OnOP_m1Vg).  - Gelato, gelato, gelato - so many flavors to choose from and taste.- Hundreds of cups of filled purees, creams, and genache of vibrant colors and tastes.  Some good, and some bad (almost like what were you thinking kinda bad).- Chocolate covered strawberries were great.I think we caught the dessert guy in his off day; very grumpy and stern.  However the help switches out often and you'll probably never see this guy anyways. So it was great to finally experience this miniature world and truly feel like a giant.  The prices are actually quite reasonable; $21 for Lunch and $29 for Dinner.  Food wise, this was a solid 2.5, but given the price, it's a 3.  But this is Vegas and Buffets are numerous.  So on to the next one!In competition for the 2nd or 3rd spot of the "best buffets in town" list!The first and last time I hit this place up was on my birthday! I was getting so many referrals about this place, that I had to try it with my friends and family (who've all been dying to try the spot out as well).This buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino!! Dinner was $22 if I can recall? It was 18% more for each of us because of the larger party (they charge gratuity with a party of 6 or more fyi)So, one of the cool things I loved & learned was that they have their own water well, so their water comes in this beautiful glass bottle, and you serve yourself (which is convenient for me because I absolutely love H2O!) I asked the beverage server what was so great about the water, and he said that the water is purified 3 times! No wonder it felt like the best water I've ever tasted!Another part to this experience was the beauty of it all.  The food looked like the type of food you'd find on the food channel. It was more of the gourmet-type dishes, and the presentation of it all was an A-plus! I loved how the dishes were served in little pots =). The chandeliers & paintings on the walls were creative too!There were a variety of good dishes, but only some Great dishes. One of the best parts of the buffet was the mac&cheese bar, where you were to choose the ingredients, type of cheese, and macaroni shells.  The chef was absolutely hilarious & made my mac&cheese just the way I liked, which was also a good thing.And so the desserts... there were plenty of tarts, and cups of many pleasant sweets, but the best in the dessert-end (if I had to choose) would be the white chocolate covered strawberries, even though it wasn't so original. However... try this place out if you're curious, be prepared to eat your money's worth, and bring friends =DI've been going to Vegas buffets since I've been five years old and I haven't seen anything quite like Wicked Spoon.  It's a special buffet with inspired entrees and I hope that they will be able to maintain their creativity as time passes.What I love about this place is that they had entrees like skirt steak w/ apple fennel salad and chimichurri sauce.  They had Bone Marrow, Pork Loin, and Korean short ribs.  They had a mac and cheese bar.  They offered Louisiana grits with shrimp and braised short ribs.  I loved that they put out entrees that you'd find on the menus of legit restaurants.  I love that they plate those dishes on individual sized plates.  I love that I was able to get these dishes seconds after they were on the grill.  I thought that the entrees were really good and enjoyed them a lot.Unfortunately, seafood wasn't on the same level as the meats and their desserts are a little overrated.  The desserts were lacking a little in the flavor department.  They did have chocolate covered strawberries and gelato and chocolate covered marshmallows, but I was a little underwhelmed with them.Also...if you're the type of person that likes to load up on crab legs and shrimp when you go to buffets, then this place isn't for you either.  These items are plated on individually sized portions, so that's how they handle portion control.  I definitely would come back because I loved the entrees I had.  I really enjoyed this buffet and I think it's worth trying, especially since it's $10 cheaper than Bellagio and Wynn on the weekends.Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling... I had been drooling over the pics posted by friends weeks in advance and I found myself enjoying it, but 5 days later, i can't really think of too many dishes i would go back for... But no surprise to SY, i would still give this place 4 stars. Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!Things i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkASalad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDAThat they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Qand surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. Loved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTgCrunchy tacos were good.Sad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. The desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBwand i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEwBut the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. I did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)A little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!On the way back stateside, while somewhere over the Atlantic, I had an epiphany. I was tired of eating bangers and mash. I asked the pilot to drop me off in Vegas. I was heading back home from Jolly Old England where I was invited to some Royal Wedding. Other than the fact that I was indiscriminately throwing up dubs in the air through out the procession, shit was mind numbingly boring. I think I developed restless leg syndrome because of it. Talking mad shit to Oprah, who I guess snuck in, was fun too. That Kate girl is pretty. The prince, though, homeboy isn't aging very well. He did real good in locking that chick up. Kudos. Game respects game. I give it 3 years. I'm an optimist. It's fancy inside. Tap water served in fancy glass bottles. Very Chic.Some of the nice looking  individually served tapas style dishes at Wicked Spoon were like the wedding....bland and a pain in the ass to sit through. But, some of the other things, were so good, that I forgot about the wedding.The selection did seem somewhat limited, however.   That's just a heads up for you Vegas buffet fanatics that like to sneak out food from.  I'm looking in your direction, Filipinos.  I got eyes on you.I was really happy to finally be able to get to try this place, but only to be a little disappointed. Their pricing is pretty good compared to most of the other buffets. ( 25 for lunch, 35 for dinner ) Most of their food is whatever, it's basically alot of exotic food  with weird names I never heard of.I saw some different food such as the lamb and pork meatball ( which was the most horrendous meatball that has ever touched my tongue), cauliflower puree ( sounds pretty gross so my friend and I didnt even look twice on it) and those were the only exotic things I remember. There was also prime rib, fried rice, many asian cuisines that i'm just totally sick of. Their sushi tempura one was pretty good though. I hate the fact that they tried to decorate some food by putting it in those silver cups because I only get one spoonful servings of each food just to try every food and if a food is bad, I wouldnt have to worry about wasting food which me and my friend did on every of those silver cans we got. Their mac n cheese bar is a cool setting where they make it in front of you, but the mac n cheese wasnt even that great.Desserts was the one thing I was looking forward to for this place, but they didnt have macaroons that I was informed of. Most of their desserts are not even that great. The best one would have to be their dark chocolate covered strawberries. I tried many of the little ones and none of it really stood out to me.overall, it was okay. I would rather pay 10 more dollars to hit up the bellagio buffet.2 of the best things that could possibly happen when you have dinner is that its a buffet (lots of choices) and its free.  Well not exactly free but it was a celebration of my niece's graduation from HS (Congrats Megan - Valedictoria and future Hoya alumni).  The location for this buffet is inside the Cosmopolitan (a James Bond glossy new casino in the strip).  this is my second visit to the Cosmpolitan but it was not a destination for me for gambling (too pricey) or partying (bit old for that),  Back to the buffet,  Our group was seated in a section separate from the rest of the Buffeteers(?) but we still had to go to each station like a normal customer.  The choices were varied like most buffets. I often stay away from the more common items I can get anywhere else so I tried mostly stuff I normally would not find on a my daily fast food meal hunt.  There were a lot of choices that I would enjoy and also was good for my partner who is a pescaterian (he eats dairy, seafood but no red or white meat).  I agree with the other comments on the little pots for some of the dishes.  It really is designed to share and takes up most of the space of your plate.  I found the Gen Tso's chicken good and crunchy.  The ratatatouille was pleasantly steamed without being overcooked but needed a base sauce.  The shrimp miso salad was fine.  The ceviche passable.  The gazpachos bearable.  The prime rib was great with a little salt and the bone marrow as the sauce (yes bone marrow).  I am not a big buffet eater but thoroughly enjoyed the availability of many choices.  Truly the dessert choices was really good but too much sugar for someone who has to watch his sugar level.  The gelatos (esp pistachio and mango) tasted great.  The custard/flan was fine.    Overall the service and food deserves 4 stars.  The best part was that the place was not overcrowded.  I think the pricing is higher than most buffets but if the selection is good then its worth it.The Wicked Spoon was Wickedly Good for the Stomach!No buffet is going to be able to keep the quality as high as a sit down restaurant. Trying feed that many people at one time is difficult and you are going to loose a little bit of  intimacy and personal attention. That being said, Wicked Spoon was delicious! I loved the little individual servings of pasta, desserts, etc. They had innovative food in a buffet.  Dishes that the average joe might be afraid of and yet they had them out like "try it, you'll like me!" :) I would definitely go back. The only thing I kept thinking was "I feel bad for whoever has to wash each one of these little sauce pans and dishes." :P haha!I'm kind of torn between this buffet. We came in for lunch and the price included a free glass of champagne of Mimosa for a little less than the Wynn or Bellagio which was nice. The buffet itself wasn't overly packed and the ambiance was surprisingly very nice inside. Now onto the food..The buffet was not really large or anything and it offered a good variety of asian inspired dishes, though unfortunately, I can't say any of them tasted right or were made right...The Kalbi (Korean spare ribs) were just too tough to eat and way to chewy/thick, while the little Vietnamese sandwiches made in steamed buns with pork belly and pickled veggies seemed a bit bland and had more peppers in them than actual meat or veggies. The rest of the dishes looked good but were very dry for example, the fish entrees were rather bland and dry. They offered a soup station with Vietnamese vermicelli noodles but what was odd was that there were two pots of broth but it was only Miso and not "pho" broth which completely beat the purpose of having noodles there at all. What I must note about this place was that everything was already portioned for you into little cast iron skillets. The general taos chicken, fish, vegetables and mac & cheese for instance. Now, after having only "nibbled" on most of what was on my plate, I was excited about the dessert options as they still had a decent amount and most of it was very well made. Here were some of the stand outs in my opinion.Gelato:They even had the option of tiny cones and as with most gelato you just can't go wrong with this dessert. I especially loved the chocolate and pistachio flavors.Macaroons:Only go for the mango macaroon which has a nice mango/passion fruit puree and fresh berries inside. This was the first to go and was very delicious. There's a raspberry one but seemed to have a funny after taste.Chocolate covered strawberries:These were by NO means those tiny ones but the large long stemmed variety that Godiva often charges up to $11 per berry for, while here you can have as many as you want included in the price. They had two kind, one with chocolate dipped orea and the other chocolate dipped with peanuts. I am not a fan of peanuts so I stuck with the oreo cookie dipped one.Scones:The lemon scone was perfectly soft, moist and delicious.Molten lava cake:This was served in a mini cast iron pan and although it was not bad, it would have tasted better if it were warmer.And last but NOT least my FAVORITE dessert here:The strawberry shortcake station. You basically get to build your own little shortcake with however many pieces of pound cake, whipped cream and fresh strawberries. As simple as this was, the cake was amazingly moist and the berries and whipped cream were very fresh.For our one glass of alcohol, we both went with a Mimosa which wasn't bad, luckily it wasn't too strong since I don't care for alcohol that much.Overall, I liked the dessert options here better than the Wynne or Bellagio but the food selection kind of disappointed me in that anything Asian did not taste the way it was supposed to and this is coming from a girl raised on the stuff here in SF. However, if you just want to stick to a few of the better dishes, I would recommend filling up on salmon, any vegetable dish and the red velvet pancakes (if you come earlier during breakfast) which unfortunately, I missed but heard were all the rage,  the Mini steamed pork belly sandwiches and the on things like Mac & Cheese were not bad at all.Just be sure to save most of your appetite for the dessert selections, which even beat out the Wynn and Belaggio by far as they definitely were not cheap tasting by any means.I think I will have to come back for those red velvet pancakes next time!Oh Wicked Spoon, you are so wickedly delicious. Why did I decide to stuff myself at Wicked Spoon before hitting the pool? Who knows... but I definitely don't regret any bite of it! Located in the gorgeous Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon gets my vote on best buffet in Vegas! What sets Wicked Spoon apart is the quality and taste of their food. Not the widest selection offered but everything tasted fresh and gourmet. Yums! Best dessert section I've ever seen! Gelato! Cakes! Cookies! Scones! The list goes on. I wish I came for dinner instead of brunch.. that way, I could've stuffed my belly more! If you're looking for a buffet with good food, look no further!I'll be honest, this place scares me.It scares me enough to be reluctant to return to Vegas, a city that I love.It scares me because if I return I'll probably eat til I burst...or literally die.I haven't eaten at a buffet, much less a Vegas buffet in years and after a while, no matter how much you dress or class them up, they all seem the same; mass produced, cookie cutter-food meant to feed the gluttonies of an overweight, diabetes-ridden America.  So when friends of mine who i consider to have serious culinary tastes started to rave about this new buffet in Vegas' Cosmopoliton resort, I had to be skeptical.I mean, c'mon, can any buffet really be that good?So on my recent trip to Vegas I went with a large group for dinner and with all the hype, I went in with a pretty open mind.  Yes the entrance and decor is flashy and fancy as fitting for the new flagship casino/resort on the Vegas strip.  Ok cool, but what about the food?It only took me a few minutes of browsing the buffet aisles to realize what the noise was all about.  While some dishes are still served in large 'serve yourself' dishes and pans, the majority of the buffet items are presented in a tapas, small-plates style.  Everything from the salad bar, to seafood, to asian dishes were presented in individual dishes and tins which one, looks better and two, encourages portion control so you can avoid overloading on one dish and finding yourself running out of space for others.  I was like a kid in a Toys R us store at christmas holding a blank check given by my parents.  Basically I was paralyzed with endless choice and didn't know where to start.Some highlights:The Mac & Cheese station - Like an omelette station, you pick your noodles, cheese and fillings and the cook will make your own custom style mac & cheese with results for better or worse and I tried a swiss-gruyere combo with vegetables thrown in for color.Carvery - aside from the usual roast chicken and prime rib, they also had roast lamb and *gasp* beef bone marrow!  Dessert - full gelato bar and and array of colorful and cool looking premade desserts.Best of all, this buffet ran $40 for dinner, no more expensive than any of the other top level buffets on the vegas strip.  $12 all-you-can-eat sirloin dinner at the Golden Nugget this is not, but I wouldn't even compare the two.I may or may not be back depending how much I want to punish my stomach again.SO disappointed by Wicked Spoon!  I was reading all the raving reviews and drooling over the pictures for weeks before my trip to LV.  Boy, was I in for a sad surprise when I came here on Friday.  My friends and I each paid nearly $40 for dinner and were promptly seated at a booth.  I would recommend that you sit at a table instead for easy in-and-out privileges.  Ugh, we had quite a time getting up and scooting around for each other.Anyway, the food was OLD.  Seriously, a majority of the dishes that had sauce on them already had an ugly, old, crusty or filmy look and texture around 6:30PM.  That should be like the prime time for dinner, but they didn't put out fresh food for the longest time.  I get that sometimes business is slow, but if you keep leaving gross looking food out, who will want to eat it?  It's just a never-ending cycle, you know?I was super unimpressed with the variety of the evening.  A lot of the good food I saw on the Yelp albums were not available and nearly everything I ate was super buttery.  I like butter as much as the next person, but shouldn't there be a variety!?Also, for some reason the food made 3/4 of my girlfriends ill for the rest of the night.  NOT.  COOL.  We came to Vegas to stuff our faces, not to cleanse our colons!In terms of parking, try to park on the WEST side of the lot.  We parked on the EAST side and had to walk about 5 minutes to the buffet.  This is not an issue for me, but it's fair warning for those who are lazy or are with people with mobility issues.Still hung over from a night of drinking we strolled into the Wicked Spoon with one idea in mind, stuffing our faces. I hadn't really slept much and still had a headache but I figured that an all you can eat paradise would get me back on track.  That and maybe a couple more drinks...Now while waiting in line to gain entry into the promised land, I did what every bored fat kid does when waiting in line at a buffet.  I left my friends to sneak a peak at the goods (and maybe have a taste or two).  Best idea ever!As I walked around I noticed that they had a dope carving station with my all time favorite item...ding ding ding PORK BELLY, which was resting beside a giant leg of lamb and a perfectly cooked tri-tip. I began to drool...Honestly at this point I didn't care for much else.  I was planning on eating my weight in pork fat and slabs of rare beef and lab.  I was sold. I then grabbed a few pieces of humbolt fog and headed out to meet my friends and pay.Once in I b-lined straight to the carving station and filled my plate up like I hadn't eaten in days.  Heck after leaving the carving station I didn't have much room for anything else, which worked out well because I had gotten what I came for. MEAT MEAT and more MEAT!And we lived happily ever after...Other notable items were the salads, cheeses, and mini appetizers.  I wasn't a big fan of the pastas, or fish item I tried.  Wood fired pizza was good, and I loved pureed potatoes. The Asian section kinda sucked, but the Asian section at most buffets usually suck so lets call that a wash.  The desserts are kinda wack, minus the gelato and the tiny dessert thing with the mini macaron on top (so cute).Overall I just wasn't that impressed with anything except the carving station, but like I said above it was love at first bite. In fact I'm still dreaming about that succulent pork belly and perfectly cooked beef.  #beingfatrulesbeing a  Cosmo hotel guest, it was annoying having to wait in a long ass line for the brunch. we were HUNGRY!even  Marquee had a separate line for hotel patrons. ugh. anyhow,...they served a complimentary champagne/mimosa for brunch.=) we definitely stuffed our faces!the ham was good, eggs benedict, gnocchi, ribs ...geez i can't remember what all I ate! I ate 5 full plates. desert bar was heaven for me.         SUPER HEAVEN! chocolate covered strawberries, mango gellato, chocolate covered marshmallows,..all my faves!  I ate until I was no longer able to breathe, for my stomach had expanded and almost raptured my lungs. next I will try their dinner. I read something about bone marrow spread. I like bone marrow =)i usually am NOT a fan of buffets.. but this place really puts other buffets to SHAME!they have a lot of individually-sized portion items & some not.. if you want to try everything.. your table should just get one of each & then decide what you want 2nds of!AMAZING DESSERT SELECTION.. especially the humungo chocolate covered strawberries!!!WAY BETTER than the wynn buffet & cheaper too!!!Thank you vegas for having a buffet FINALLY worthwhile!! Okay people!!! For those of you who said the M buffet was the "best" you guys NEED to get here asap! Everything in this place made my mouth water. I went here for the brunch buffet and oh man, my breath was seriously taken away right when I stepped in. The presentation first of all is great. Everything looked as good as it tasted and they came in organized little containers as well so it was so much easier to get what you wanted. There were a lot of good selections of foods here. There might not have been a TON LOAD of food choices like some other places but they had a decent amount and they ALL were worth tasting. And this place actually gives you the OPTION of paying more if you want free alcoholic drinks (more than just beer and wine too) unlike the M which just automatically charges you for the alcohol even if you don't drink. But enough of  the comparisons, this place is just overall the best buffet I've been to in vegas and I feel like I need to inform everyone that if they're really hungry and want a buffet that won't let you down then COME HERE!I'm not a huge fan of buffet's in general, but this one stood out for me. It was pretty, and their presentation, at least for me, was a first.At $35 a person, it's not cheap, but their quality and selection, was pretty impressive. They portion out a lot of their food here, in small, personal sized sauce pans. They're freakin adorable! Also what's nice, is that, every portion looks perfect.The dessert section was good too. Try their bread pudding, I don't even really like bread pudding, but their's is great!Food: 4Ambience: 5Service: 4Value: 2This is not your standard buffet. Located in the Cosmopolitan, the interior design and the food match the rest of the casino -- modern and sophisticated. The vibe was really chic and service was quick. The dishes came in little silver pots that allowed the food to be sizzling hot. For $35 I ate $350 worth of food:* Beef Ribs - Seasoned perfectly and very juicy. * Prime Rib - A perfect medium rare. Meat was tender and juicy. * Breaded Mac & Cheese - Nice cheesy taste but the breading was just too much. * Cheese Spinach Dip - had a very nice flavor.* Mashed Potatoes - Creamy and properly seasoned mashed potatoes.* Truffle Potatoes - This has a great truffle flavor to them. * Salmon - Nice and tender and not overcooked.  * Pad Thai - Noodles were mushy and the flavors did not work.* Shrimp Grits - Very flavorful Cajun flavored shrimp with grits.* Skirt Steak - Nice medium rare, but was under seasoned.* Shumai - Tasty but lukewarm. * Yellowtail sushi - The sushi was acceptable for all you can eat.* Tuna Sashimi - On par to the other all you can eat sushi places.* Braised Beef - Very moist and flavorful that just fell apart nicely.* Tri Tip - Perfectly cooked! Hands down, the carving stations were my favorite. While I still think the Bellagio and Wynn buffets have much higher quality food, the Wicked Spoon Buffet  isn't far behind.Hanging out in our hotel room bf asked what would I like to eat, looking through my yelp app, trying to figure out what to have I came across this gem of a buffet and remembered Michelle T's review on this place plus all the delish looking photos. Well since it was way past closing time for this buffet, we decided to hit it up for brunch before we left town to go back home (le sigh).Here are some very helpful hints to getting ready for the massacre at the buffet! *A good brisk walk before is recommend to fully wake your stomach up and you as well. *Yes, wear your most loose fitting shirts and comfortable eating pants because unlike any other buffet in Vegas you stuff yourself silly and then go straight into a dessert coma after eating everything that you see. * Wicked Spoon is not location anywhere close to the main entrance; rather you have to zigzag to get here. Located past the two famous high-heeled shoes (yes I wanted to take the black one) you finally stumble upon this awesome place. * People it's a popular buffet in Vegas, so don't complain or whine that you have to stand in line, if it means that much to you then get up early and get your booty there.* And don't complain about the prices, would you rather have them charge you $10.00 for the buffet? At least paying a little more you know you get better quality food. However, if you want to spend less then I can suggest some rad buffets on Fremont Street (warning they are sketchy and I would not eat there unless you have a stomach made of steel).* After you devour everything in sight, dont go back to your hotel room to sleep it off, rather walk around the hotel. We did that and found The Kidrobot store and another store that was selling The Hundreds. We arrived about an hour and a half before they stopped serving brunch (eek) no worried they told us, they do not start cleaning up until 2:15-2:30pm. Brunch is served from 8:00am-2:00pm (Monday-Friday) Their weekend hours are a wee more different. $ 22.00 gets you AYCE plus one Mimosa or Bloody Mary. Our hostess was nice as she took us to our table; this dining room was beautiful. In addition, keeping with the Cosmopolitan theme, they had chandeliers in the dining room as well swoon!Bf and I looked at each other and I knew what he was thinking (let's get it on.... Food people, food!!)He went in one direction and I went in another!!I made a totally of 2 trips back for more (I tried to force myself to keep eating but I wanted to save room for dessert since our table was within step to that station and I kept eye balling everything.)-Breaded Mac & Cheese -Pork Buns -Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese-Kimchee-Grilled Korean short ribs-Bacon!-Garlic BreadDessert:-Chocolate covered strawberries-White chocolate covered marshmallows-Macaron with assorted berries -Fudge (it was on the dry side)What I really liked about this buffet is that they had smaller portions, so you are able to sample almost everything they have to offer including desserts.Our waiter was okay, he came by to take our drink orders we opted to have ice tea instead. Plates were taken away pretty much as soon as you set them aside. I was hoping from the photos that I saw there would be more macarons but sadly the only ones I found were the sugar free with berries. I hope that they have them when we come back for dinner soon!With that being said, This is my new favorite buffet!!Wicked Spoon, like the Cosmopolitan Hotel it is housed in, is a welcome breath of fresh air in the culinary buffet scene.  While buffets like Wynn and Bellagio have long dominated, Wicked Spoon does things entirely differently....and succeeds.  It is easily the best new buffet in years.For $29 ($37 with unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne), the weekend brunch presents the following:- selection of cooked items across more ethnic cuisines than any other buffet can match.  Fried chicken, korean short ribs, Vietnamese Shaking Beef, Thai curry, and dim sum to name a few.- excellent presentation and an attention to flavorful and delicious food, not just quantity- the best dessert selection of any buffet.  Rather than soft serve ice cream like many places, they have a full on gelato bar here.  Wow.- Prime Rib, slab bacon, linguica, Rack of Lamb, and Prime Rib Bone are just a sampling of the excellent carving station- more high-end pasta dishes and artfully presented in small metal pots than I've seen anywhere.  If you like pasta or carbs, Wicked Spoon will clearly win you over.  Gnocci, butternut squash ravioli, Smoked Mac and Cheese and Cavatelli are among the top choices.  - great salad and fruit bar, again with innovative and new items like gazpacho puree, blt salads, endive salads, and dipped strawberries that look more like a high end restaurant than a buffetThe only thing keeping Wicked Spoon from 5 stars and possibly not clearly being the top buffet in Vegas is the following:Sushi - California and spicy tuna rolls.  No nigiri, no other rolls, and no sashimiSeafood - they had cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon, but no crab legs, jumbo prawns (Aria, Bellagio), or lobster claws or any other notable seafoodSoups - could only find a miso soup.  Missed the rice porridge from Bellagio (for the Asian high rollers) and other soup options.  Overall, I was thrilled with the value and the variety of Wicked Spoon.  I will clearly be coming here again, but for true seafood lovers, I can see them liking Bellagio, Wynn, or Sterling more.  Nonetheless, while not every item was great, so many things were done right and so differently that Wicked Spoon will be one to bookmark for a long time.Wicked Spoon accepts credit cards, including American Express.My Buffet Rankings:1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  2) Hakone, Oahu - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.  3) Sushi House Goyemon, Las Vegas - great nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked appetizer and dessert selection for an unbelievable $26/pp.4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.  5) Wicked Spoon, Las Vegas - great cooked selection, variety, and high end presentation.  Unmatched desserts and gelato. $29/pp6) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab, sushi $35/ppMy NEW favourite buffet!I KEEP telling myself I have sworn off buffet. i am a picky eater and I am SO OVER buffet. HOWEVER, I will come back to you wicked spoon! Listen up!! I have tried all the ones worth trying and here are the rest of the list in order:Wynn (my old favourite) 2XAria (when it first opened)M ResortBellagio (brunch)Mandalay Bay 2X (brunch and dinner)Paris (brunch)RioNew Orleans (brunch, cheap for the price)The following are disgusting, i would not go again even if it were free:Monte CarloMGMPlanet Hollywood (brunch)Harrah's (brunch)Excalibre (brunch)SO i consider myself making a pretty darn informed decision when i am saying this is THE best buffet.I went for dinner and at $35 a pop, the price was just right. The decor is classy and modern with a vintage twist. All the food I had was pretty well made. Everything actually looked appetising. and i LOVED the fact everything was single serving, making everything look more appetising. Plus less wasteful! If you want more, just get your butt off the seat and grab more!!!Shots of WATERMELON Refreshing, basically like thick watermelon juiceShot of AVOCADO/CUCUMBER/ETC was interesting...I felt healthy drinking it!COCKTAIL SHRIMPS were alright. a little small and lemon was sliced too thinlyCOD Not bad at all. Tender. NOT OVERCOOKED!!! even has asparagus in it.CEVICHE, well made but I am not a fanSNOW CRAB LEGS kinda meh...didn't feel too fresh, there's melted butter too.PRIME RIB Best prime rib I've had at a buffet. medium rare. DONE RIGHT!LEG OF LAMB tasted kind of funky. Do not like. BONE MARROW first time seeing this in a vegas buffet! It's alright...it's a buffet so i didn't expect much...but i would pay for a better bone marrow.TRI TIP It was medium rare, more on the rare side. It was a little salty. but not bad at all. I just prefer prime ribMUSSELS best ones I've had at a buffetCRAWFISH yummy!!!! CREAM PUFF it was ok. Tasted a bit like these asian buns I ate as a kidLEMON TART, it was ok, not too sour like most lemon tart. But i don't like lemon tarts in generalCHOCOLATE COVERED YUMMY!!!! even has oreos on themSLICES OF WATERMELON my favourite to end a buffet!CHOCOLATE CONE yummy but the cone could be crunchierThere's a ton of salad to choose from, some sushi rolls (no nigiri), mac and cheese bar, truffle mashed potatoes, gelato station, fudge, OK I NEED TO GO BACK SO I can eat that stuff. They might have more over the weekend too!***Tips: get the crawfish, load up on seafood, do the meat station but skip the leg of lamb. or ask for a small piece.Favourites: wide variety, GOOD quality for buffetDo not want: It is actually the same price as wynn buffet.... I feel bad taking so many individual servings of cocktail shrimps. Bone marrow was staleLast words: zee best!Normally during Thanksgiving my mom and I go over to my sister and Tom's place to have dinner.  This year my sister wanted to mix it up a bit.  They really wanted to go to Mexico, but it's peak season there so cost was an issue and the whole beheading tourist thing was not optimal.  Viva Las Vegas!!!Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - $40.00/person for dinner.Seafood - Yes, mussels, shrimp, crab, fishMeats - Yes, chicken, pork, beef, turkeyVegetables - Yes, salads.Dessert - Pastries, gelato, cookies, etc.Fruits - YesOther - (1) Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Be prepared to wait so I recommend coming early.Buffet Summary:The Meats - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - I tried the lamb, prime rib, turkey, and bone marrow.  The lamb was excellent--very moist, tender, and flavorful.  The prime rib was really good too--perfectly cooked.  I really liked that they liberally let you have as much horseradish as you want since I love to slather my meat with the stuff.  The turkey is pretty standard and is good with cranberry sauce.  The unfortunate thing is that is cranberry sauce was extremely light and did not add much sweet & tangy to the white meat.  The bone marrow was the least to be desired--extremely oily and felt I was eating fat leftovers.The Seafood - A-Okay (3 Stars) - I had cod, shrimp cocktails, Cajun shrimp, crab legs, mussels, and sushi.  My favorite is the shrimp cocktail and mussels.  The shrimp were all a nicely sized even though there was only 2 per cup.  Shrimp tasted perfectly with the cocktail sauce--perfect amount of sauce per shrimp as well.  It is the morning afterwards and I wish I had another plate of mussels.  What is great about this dish?  It's all about bacon bits.  I'm not talking about bacon bits from the bottle.  I'm talking about bits that you could fling and take out somebody's eye.  Every bit of the mussels were tender and the pairing with the fatty and moist bacon got me all shooked up.  FYI - the sushi section is quite embarrassing.The Dessert - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My soon to be brother in law said "The dessert section looks dangerous."  If most of you know me, I do not have a sweet tooth--sweets ARE dangerous to me.  However, maybe it was the desert (or dessert) air that made me want some sweets.  Amongst the cheesecakes, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, and pastries ... I chose the gelato.  I chose mango, biscotti, tiramisu gelato.  The server gave me three medium jawbreaker sized scoops per flavor.  The biscotti and tiramisu were good.  The mango had the taste and consistency of mango.  The sweet fix was over.I'm a season veteran to the buffet league and after a while everything seems homogenous.  Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions.  The un-appeal is the wait--it took us +1 hour to get in.  Whichevers, it was Thanksgiving Day so I guess that is expected.  Wicked Spoon is A-Okay.  Happy Thanksgiving Yelpers!!  I've finally made it to 100 reviews.I'm not a buffet person but when it's complimentary why not? I ate here twice once for lunch and once for BF.  What a decent spread for brunch during the week! Started off with a Bloody Mary which was included on the brunch. Some of the items in the buffet - Korean short ribs, Dim Sum, Sushi, slab bacon, shrimp cocktails, mac and cheese, Ham, turkey, fried chicken, cooked to order omelets, pizza, salads and yummy Tri Tip just to name a few. My favs in the dessert area the peanut butter cookie and Gelato. I did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing. The waiter we had was friendly and really accommodating.Only con here I felt was that the brunch buffet should open earlier for the working people like myself. Hours are from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm Monday - Friday.Wicked Spoon is indeed Wicked! She pulled us in with her outstanding, beyond delicious, out of the world dinner, only to crush our spirits, abuse us, and kick us out the door with her Brunch. Dinner Saturday night was AMAZING! Our server was so attentive, the food was delicious and we couldn't get enough! The stars of the show were the Prime Rib sandwich, the mac & cheese bar and the gingerbread gelato. 5 STARS! On our way out of the Cosmopolitan I was awarded a free brunch for the next day, which I considered a tremendous blessing. We returned for brunch only to find an hour long line, followed by another hour long line, followed by the WORST service in the world and food that we swear had been sitting in the bins since we had left the night before! The star of that show was the gelato scooper from the night before and his winning smile. Our server was so rude and  he completely ruined our experience. The only advice I can offer is that if you go and there is a long line for brunch, to have half your party wait in the paying line and the other half wait in the "waiting to get a table" line. It will cut your time in half, and you will look incredibly rude. Welcome to Vegas. Enjoy your spaghetti.Just like every restaurant, bar & bathroom housed in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, the Wicked Spoon Buffet is decorated so avant-garde, so posh that you forget your own name just looking at its chandeliers. I LOVE that food is pre-portioned in its own single-serve bowls & dishes. This eliminates my biggest fears about buffets: contamination from multiple hands touching ONE serving spoon & piling on portions I'll either waste (boooo!) or eat with reckless abandon (boooo x2!) Wicked Spoon keeps me in check! My favorite eats were: * crispy chicken with cabbage kim chee * fried chicken * shrimp & grits (I got two portions!)* chocolate-covered strawberries * pulled pork tostada* red wine cheddar cheeseOther grub that I probably wouldn't repeat:* short ribs: too fatty* maple glazed pork loin* macarons: tasted like meringue w/ jam inside. Not chewy enough. * beignets w/ chocolate & raspberry sauces (cute presentation sitting in its own tiny deep fryer!) * mushroom risotto* all their desserts: gorgeous to look at (see pic), but taste was not worth ALL them calories.The guys loved the hot crab legs & carved meats. $35 per person for dinner (no matter what day of the week.) The wait to be seated that Thursday night was no more than 10 minutes. Probably the only buffet I look forward to eating at again!Me: Are we going to a buffet later?Her: "We could" spoon later.Me: ummmm, ok! (amazed and happy)Her: Yeah, it's at the Cosmo....Me: Oh shucks, you meant "WICKED" Spoon buffetHer: Yeah, what buffet were you thinking of?Me: ummm....yeah, wicked spoon (frown, walks away quickly) I don't go to buffets often...due to control issues.  I have been to several and usually get disappointed because they don't meet certain criteria that I look for in buffets....cleanliness, selection, and quality of food.  WSB excels in all areas. Personal servings are great and presentation adds a wonderful touch.  You can tell they take extra care in preparing their food.  I was a major fan of their carving station and impressed with all-you-can-eat bone marrow and fresh beignets in little deep-fry baskets.  I did expect more dessert items, but they did have a good assortment of gelato flavors.  WSB is one of the hottest buffets in town.  And their reputation precedes them.  For someone who normally hates buffets, this place is so worth the experience.  We went early on a Sunday evening and there was no line.  I also wanted to get back to the room early. wink wink.I love you Wicked Spoon! ugh...they are my favorite buffet of all buffets! My sister got to experience it for the first time, for her birthday. That girl can eat so this place was perfect for her! The set is so upscale. At least to me. Pretty upscale for a buffet. Upscale buffet? Nice...We also got a nice bottle of red wine as well for $20. We just had to celebrate that way. I tried their mushroom truffle, their lobster pasta, and I freaked when I found out they had a mac and cheese station! Yes, i went a little crazy at the mac and cheese station. This time, I was able to REALLY try the dessert table. The ice cream and pastry chef was so friendly, fun, and enthusiastic! He helped us pick an ice cream and suggested some great things. So here's the scoop on the ice cream flavors (haha! scoop! pun was intended):blood orange-if you like grapefruit it tastes like grapefruit. Not strong grapefruit. a mild grapefruit.biscotti-tastes like a biscotti and is super delish! it goes GREAT with their molten lava cake.almond joy-need i say more? i thought so..that's it! get crazy here guys! it's well worth it!Came here for brunch on a weekend and surprisingly not that long of a wait. Unfortunately the food was disappointing. LOTS of options from pho to omelets, but the saying "less is more" definitely applies to this situation. Instead of offering a ridiculous amount of flavorless food, the kitchen should eliminate some dishes and focus on making the food taste better. I literally had a bite of everything and the only things I enjoyed were the lox bagels (unless the salmon is bad you really can't go wrong with this) and a few desserts.wow. the coveted 5 star review. i dont give out these willy nilly....especially for a buffet. i mean i think maybe outside of the M, the highest a vegas buffet would get from me was 4 stars... (and thats even after living in hednerson/green valley/silverado ranch/las vegas for 7 years before moving back to san diego)here's why the wicked spoon stands out IMO - the GRUB:- tapas style portions! genius concept IMO - because you wont have those peeps at the buffet shoveling mounds of shrimp cocktail and mac n cheese like its going out of style - the portions are reasonably prepared, presented and tastefully done in deliciously satisfying tapas dishes. if you want more, you would need to get up and get another serving.... imagine that, an all you can eat buffet without peeps thinking that they should get it all on just one run...- highlights: herb crusted tri tip, blackened cod fillets, korean bbq short ribs, angry mac n cheese, grilled corn cobettes, sushi, and shrimp cocktail shots- desserts were awesome - my faves: chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato from the case, and petite dessert cups- bottles spring water table side was a nice touchthe JOINT:- clean and very modern art decor- plenty of friendly staff to seat and serve you- open kitchensthe SQUEEZE:- $22 p/person on a saturday lunch. not bad at all! actually it pretty much is a steal for a vegas buffet of this caliber.- cash and card accepted- love its location at the cosmopolitanFINAL SAY:the very low price, the flavorful food, and the tapas concept and presentation are all ingredients IMO for a stellar vegas buffet experience - 5 stars!The Wicked Spoon Buffet is located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  Just take the escalators nearest the check-in desk to the second floor and follow the signs......or the aroma of food, I'm sure either one will lead you to this food mecca.My friend and I decided to to skip any breakfast completely and went to directly to Wicked Spoon for their brunch buffet.  Priced at $22.00, the brunch buffet is available Monday thru Friday from 8am till 2pm.The selections for brunch were quite diverse, and I truly appreciated that since it was 10am....a little too late for breakfast, but perhaps for some, still early for lunch.  Breakfast foods included sausages, fruits, cheeses, breads, bagels, and parfait.  Other standouts and favorites included the sushi, pizzas, ravioli, and fried chicken.  The food was very satisfactory, but for me in particular there wasn't that "wow" factor that took my breath away.  However, I think Wicked Spoon makes an impression with their presentation, such as the fried chicken served in miniature deep fryer basket, whilst the ravioli was served in tiny fry pans.  BEST:  The most memorable part about brunch:  dessert, of course.  I wish I had saved more room for dessert because the choices and selection would have satisfied any and all sweet tooth cravings.  Not wanting to over indulge, I made sure I chose only what I knew I would finish.  I ended up with 2 raspberry macaroons, 1 cheesecake, and 1 pecan pie.  Loved dessert.SERVICE:  Good.  Not excellent....but good and satisfactory.  The server was friendly enough, but we had to wait for what seemed like a century before we got refills for our soda.Bottom Line:  I thought the price for brunch was reasonable and the selection was satisfactory.  I wouldn't rule out another visit to Wicked Spoon, but perhaps for dinner next time.This is a really nice place! The Wicked Spoon Buffet has got my vote as one of the better buffets in Vegas. I was really impressed by the entrance to the buffet. It is really modern and the decor impressive. If you get there around 6ish, you should be able to get in without an extra long wait. Our group of ten waited maybe 15 minutes. Once seated, you are immediately met by the server who will take care of you during your dinner.  We sat at a long table with high bar chairs which I really lThey bring you flasks of water so no need to keep asking for refills. Once you decide to get started you are literally met by a barrage of different stations offering up so many different delectable food selections! I especially enjoyed the salad bar and the BLT salad, it was really good. The shrimp cocktail was refreshing. On to the meat! You have a selection of prime rib, lamb, bone with the marrow in it, yes, seriously. They also have BBQ ribs, fish, chicken, the crispy baked chicken was tasty. As for us crab leg lovers, well, I wasn't overly impressed, it was standard buffet fare and if it were true Alaskan King Crab Legs, I'm sure the price of the buffet would have been stiffer! They didn't have that natural saltiness to it, maybe they were boiled? There is a sushi section where you can have custom rolls made or just sample the different varieties. There is an extensive selection of desserts, from pies to cakes, gelato, ice cream, chocolate bars... Would I go back next time? You bet!Yelp Challenge 365 # 174/365On the reviews of Dave F, Michael C, Chau V and last but not least Kevin P, I decided to give this place a try. Let me preface my review by saying I am not much of a buffet person... okay, call me a buffet snob and based on my being a buffet snob, I am compelled to write a review of what I found to be1) a new concept of buffet. Why? because each course is served in its individual dishes; portioned just right for the tasting2) a beautiful place in a sassy hotel and casino3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it. The 2nd floor is designed such that you can simply follow the signs and you will find it.4) reasonable in cost; the dinner buffet is $355) a great place to taste wines you can pair with your selections of food. You would have to purhcase a wine card for $25. Take the card to the wine chill, select your variety of wine with a 1 ounce minimum.... and you're good to go. You will be able to pair your food with the wineAnd the list goes on. For the most part, if I had to do a buffet in Las Vegas, I would definitely go back to the Wicked Spoon.By the way, my favorite course was the lobster mac n cheese, veal sliders, followed by their fresh seafood bar and then.... deserts!Finally after a few trips to Vegas, I got to try out Wicked Spoon!  I already had a pretty good idea what to expect from this buffet since all my friends have been here already and posted positive reviews and delicious food pics.  My first foray with WS was for Friday Brunch.I liked how everything was served in small portions so you could try things without picking up too much.  The best things I had for brunch were the Kalbi Ribs, The Smoked Salmon, Beet Salad, Eggs Benedict, their Mac N Cheese and a good amount of stuff from the Dessert Station.  I wasn't too fond of the meat selection from their Carving Station though.  The Bacon Slab was pretty bland and the Tri-Tip was tough even though I had a medium rare piece.I'm not a big buffet person, but Wicked Spoon was a really fun buffet.  I can't say it edges out the Wynn, but they're both pretty close overall.  I wouldn't mind going back again to see what they have for dinner.Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!Wicked Spoon is simply over-rated. The desserts are the best part and do leave a good last impression, but compared to the elite buffets of Vegas, Wicked Spoon doesn't have the quality, service, freshness, or variety to be considered 5-star. It's a-ok which is totally a-ok.Sunday night dinner: 3 - 3.5/5 starsThere were no stations for fresh, made to order items like pasta, crepes, salads, etc. Instead portions are placed into small bowls like a cafeteria. There were no fresh sashimi or sushi offerings except two California rolls. The Snow Crab was average frozen fare. Salmon was meh. No XLB. Asian food looked like Panda Express.On the positive side, Bone Marrow was cool (though not spectacular). By far the most spectacular section is the desserts. 2 flavors of macarons were chewy fun and Red Velvet Cookies were worth a try. Save room for the Gelato and get a couple of the huge Chocolate-covered Strawberries.Service was fine. Our waitress brought drink (Mojito) re-orders and cleared plates as expected. She earned her tip.If you are at the Cosmopolitan or nearby hotel then the Wicked Spoon is an a-ok option when in the mood for an AYCE BuffetSorry Wynn, but I have a new fave buffet! I first attempt to eat here for lunch was thwarted by the fact that on weekends it only runs til 3PM. I got there at 2:30 so I didn't think it was worth it. The people who stayed in line begged to differ though and now I can see why. This time I got in line a little before 12 on a Sunday and the line moved pretty quickly. It only took about 10 minutes for my group of 3 to get a table and start doing some damage.Ribs - Fatty, meaty, and 100% delicious!! I would have gotten another if it weren't for the fact that I had so many other things to try.Korean BBQ Ribs - Too tough. Took a bite and gave up on the rest. Can't waste precious stomach space on food that isn't bomb. Chicken Wings- These come in an adorable mini-fryer. Honestly I got it for the presentation, but the wings themselves were crispy and amazing all on their own!Gnocchi - Good, but wasting stomach space on carbs at a buffet is an amateur move.Salmon - A nice and strong lemon flavor that accented the fish very well. Corn on a Cob - With one bite I felt like no corn I will have from now til my next Wicked  Spoon trip will ever measure up.**Crispy Pork** - DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS DISH ALBEIT IT'S UNAPPEALING APPEARANCE, FELLOW YELPERS!!!! It was hands down the most amazing dish I've ever had in Vegas. I originally got it for the single fried plantain chip because the dish hardly looked appetizing. The pork itself is dry and I'm not a fan of black beans. I was about to cast it in the rejection pile but for some reason I dug past the beans and came upon rice. THE RICE WAS SO DELICIOUS THAT I FINISHED THE ENTIRE DISH minus the dry pork. It soaked up all the fat from the pork and sent me straight to fatty heaven. Macarons - There were 2 different flavors: berry and mango, both of which were good.Chocolate Dipped Chocolate Cake Pop - Thick and moist and a lot better than it looks.We left in solid food comas a little past 1 and the line was pretty bad. Come before 12 to avoid the madness! Don't sleep in! Vegas isn't a place to sleep anyway!Wicked Spoon, at $31 for Sunday brunch, was well worth my money. I look forward to my return. GET THE CRISPY PORK!!!!!!!So good that we had to come back 2 days in a row.  True testament to how awesome this buffet place is.  It really does stand out from other buffets on the strip, which is a herculean task since Vegas is THE mecca of buffets and since everything in Vegas is so over the top extra, just like this sentence.Food: Most of it was good, some not so much.  But you're at a buffet - if you don't like it, keep it moving, there's more food around the corner. Notable mentions and nods to the following: -Yogurt parfait with blueberries and walnut granola crumble: easy to pass this one by and you would think, why would you fill up on this but I'm glad I did. - Angry Mac & Cheese: angry because this mac & cheese has got both bark and bite.  They use sharp cheddar (yum) so you definitely get a kick of flavor unlike most mac & cheese served anywhere else which is boring, lacking flavor and suffocating in cream.  The best mac & cheese I've had.  Nothing else is needed to make this dish better.-Eggs Benedict: filling yet still light enough because they used shaved ham and not canadian bacon.  -Coffee: yes, I said coffee.  I was prepared to drink coffee flavored water because I thought they wouldn't pay much thought or attention to their beverages, but they do!  Piping hot, which I could just hug them for, and actually good.  -Desserts: the island is mesmerizing and a feast for the eyes.  Don't get too excited though...only some of the desserts are good.  The chocolate covered strawberries dipped in toffee and nuts are serious.  Literally, the only bad thing I really can complain about is the gelato.  We tried 2 different flavors and both made me want to gag.  Thinned out gelato that has the consistency and taste of sweet mucous.-Complimentary mimosa or bloody marys - the blood mary is mean.  Super stiff drink and generous pour of alcohol in this drink.  Prepared to be lit beyond measure if you actually can finish it. Presentation: This is what truly won me over.  Most, not all, of the dishes are in individual portions.  Such thoughtful execution that brings sophistication to a buffet.  Service is stellar.  Seriously, how is everyone so cheerful and helpful?  I appreciated this so much because it really is such a nice accent.  And because of this customer service, I felt like I was at a restaurant, not at a buffet. We encountered several different employees here from the register lady to the hostess that seats you to the server who brings you your drinks to the line cooks serving you the meat of your choice.  The service is seamless and smooth.Overall, it's a great buffet that indeed offers less variety than other buffets but there's no way you will leave feeling jipped. Location: a walk to get to because they tuck this in the far back in the corner on the 2nd floor of CosmopolitanPrice: $22+tax  from 8am-3pmMy new favorite buffet in Vegas!  Here's the thing, I've kind of burned myself out on buffets, especially after once doing all of the buffets on the Buffet of Buffets in 24 hours once, but my tried and true, hands down best has been The M... until now.  Don't get me wrong, I still think The M is awesome, but Wicked Spoon upped the ante.I'd heard the lines can be crazy so I made my husband check in on Foursquare for three days in a row at Cosmopolitan hot spots so that he would have the badge that gets you VIP line access.  No worries there, since we went early... they open at 5pm and we were there at, um, 5:10, there was NO line.  I was surprised since it was Labor Day, but yea for us!  No wait to pay, no wait to be seated and quick access to the AMAZING food.I was a little exhausted after the five mile hike to back of the Cosmo property to FIND Wicked Spoon, but luckily sustenance was mine.  What impressed me the most was that the food was presented beautifully AND it was very good.  A lot of times buffet food is just cafeteria food, but I did not get that at all from this one.  I liked that they had your staples, prime rib, pork roast, etc at the carving station and crab legs and asian fare, BUT that they also had unusual items as well, like the General Tso pigs feet and I'm still kicking myself for getting too full before I tried the roasted marrow!  The selection is just a huge wow.  But, I noticed some things would run out quickly and I'd miss out... I never got to try the roasted beet salad, which is a favorite of mine.  My favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!), and this one strange little chocolate shot dessert thing that I can't describe for the life of me except to say, YUM.  I really enjoyed the "salad/appetizer" section because they had so many little interesting crostinis, cheeses, salads, etc.  I could graze there all night... oh wait, I did.  Oddly, my husband LOVED the dessert bar.  He seriously had three helping and this man does NOT have a sweet tooth.  STRANGE!I feel like I missed out on a lot because I just get full too fast!  What I didn't care for was the chocolate lava cake - um, no lava, and the gnocchi I had was okay, but too soft for my taste.  Surprisingly, the angry mac and cheese did not wow me.  The flavor was good, but the one I got was super dry.  Darn it.The staff was all very friendly and attentive.  It was $41 per person on Labor Day evening 2012.  I think that is pricey, but we all felt it was an acceptable price to pay to splurge for a buffet of this caliber. I'm guessing we'll be back.WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?~the food, which I loved, was a little inconsistent - not everything was cooked correctly and that dropped them a half star.~removal of used dishes more quickly would be a plus.  We found it odd that they would come by and remove plates, but never took our glasses away when a new one was brought so we had quite a collection of glasses - another minus half star.This place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies that I follow. And there are PLENTY of damn good reasons why it's hyped up. For one, it's the best damn buffet I've ever eaten at! We literally had less than 40 minutes to grab a quick bite to eat before heading over to The Orleans to watch the prejudging show for The 2012 Mr. Olympia. So me, being stubborn about the main places I wanted to hit up while we were in Vegas, still wanted us to dine here even though we wouldn't have enough time to even enjoy all the wonderful food they offer here...I paid about $82 for the both of us. Yep, the dinner price here is quite high but here's why I feel it was still worth it. 1) The seating arrangements are super fancy schmancy including the silverware, glass water bottle and cloth napkins on your table. 2) The waiter service is exactly like the service you would receive at a Michelin starred restaurant. 3) The FOOD! Delicious and quite fancy too.I really enjoyed the seafood selection they had here. Some of the items that I devoured that stood out to me was the bone marrow, yes! bone effing marrow at a buffet, the duck confit ravioli, the seared raw fish plates, the fried oysters, the shrimp ceviche...and oh gosh, so much more...but I can't seem to remember much because I literally devoured 7 full plates in 30 minutes. I'm a binge eater, and effin proud of it!The best station hands down here would have to be their dessert station. OMFG! Macarons, freshly baked red velvet white chocolate chip cookies, chocolate dipped waffle cones, fruit tarts with chocolate mousse, cheesecake, gelato, pecan pie and so so much more! I had 2 full plates of desserts. If we seriously had at least an hour or 2 to dine here, I would have ended up eating 10 plates of desserts alone. Amaze balls!I really really love how most of the food items here are portioned out into "spoons". Even though I have no portion control, I like the fact that I don't have to wait in a line to scoop any food out of a tray.Wicked Spoon, you won me over with your wicked wicked sweets! :DOne time I read a review that said, "You know you're a glutton when you're reading reviews of buffets." Yeah, pretty much. We went here for the weekday brunch and definitely ate our way through $22/ea. Mmmmm okay, I guess you can twist my arm into a free mimosa. After that, $9 per person for unlimited! That sounds like a belly and a head ache to me, but I'm sure many take advantage of it.I'm not sure which I like better--the newly redone Bacchanal Buffet or the Wicked Spoon. Both had exceptional quality, and I suppose I can't adequately compare the two since I have only had dinner at Caesars' and only brunch at Cosmopolitan. The brunch at Wicked Spoon was a lot more lunch than it was breakfast, though both meal offerings were delicious. I caught the tail end of biscuits and gravy in its own little bowl with onion strings on top. It was fantastic with its house-made sausage. Probably my favorite breakfast item--though like I said there weren't as many breakfast items to choose from. I missed out on the famed red velvet pancakes! It was sad, but I got over it pretty quickly with all the rest of the things I had to choose from.Lunch was awesome--sushi, angry mac and cheese (so good, SO GOOD), duck confit ravioli, pizza, carving stations. I will say that there aren't as many made-to-order stations here than at Caesars. No matter, though, I usually like to see what creations the chef has come up with with unlimited resources.And then, of course, are the desserts. I need to just start here next time. There were also breakfast pastries here, and I'm sure they get sad that they often get overlooked because everyone is busy with savory breakfast fare. I made up for whatever slight they feel by having two croissants, in addition to macarons, chocolate mousse cones, cookies, cakes, and my personal favorite of the day, a pumpkin cheesecake. Give me anything pumpkin or anything cheesecake in general--but when you combine the two, it's pure magic.I always feel like a bad person when I eat at a buffet, mostly because of all that food waste. I guess it's just something you have to accept (especially living in Vegas). However, I will say that Wicked Spoon, among others, has tried to curb food waste by serving the small individual portions, making me feel slightly less horrible about my first world existence. I would definitely recommend Wicked Spoon for its value only--still a week or so later I'm comparing the price of other meals I eat out to the $22 brunch. ("What? I paid $9 for this crappy mall Chinese food? That's half a buffet!") I want to try the dinner next!This is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas! It is why the line is so long for Wicked Spoon!A lot of the dishes are portioned in a small bowl or plate. I feel really bad for all the dishes that the dishwashers have to deal with everyday! The appetizers and main dishes are really good and there is a wide variety to choose from. So everyone can find a favorite dish here. Another thing I like about Wicked Spoon is the decor of this place. It is romantic with dim lighting. It feels like you are dining in a restaurant rather than at a buffet. The best part about Wicked Spoon is the dessert selection! I made sure I saved enough room in my stomach for it! I love the gelato, raspberry cheesecake, apple cobbler, and the chocolate dipped strawberries. The only thing I did not like were the macarons. But overall I think Wicked Spoon is really good!I definitely have mixed feelings about this buffet after coming here for lunch with the lady.WICKED DISLIKES:I found the carving station...seriously LACKING for a carnivore. Marrow...and bacon...and sausages...with a "chef" that tells people to wait all the time to the point that people grab stuff themselves? What a joke. [Look, I'm not complaining that there is no prime rib or slow cooked ribs or a rack of awesome hotness being unavailable...it's pretty sad for a meat carving section when I pass by more than 10 times to find the "chef" cleaning his area like he has OCD because he has nothing to serve]Salad and greens...where are thee? You are missing just like the meat in the meat section! Little-overkill-on-the-dressing-Caesars-salad-in-a-bowl is the only leafy green available?Chinese food...OMFG...you fall under the definition of CRAP. The packaging, which used mini-Chinese-paper-take-out-little-boxes was freaking awesome though.Korean BBQ [their version of galbi]...easily has the highest turnover for any meat at the buffet since I'm sure people are trying to get their meat fix one way or the other and have been clearing this mound of meat within 1 min after the "chef" piles it on...well, tastes NASTY [overmarinated, 50-60% fat...just saying]WICKEDLY AWESOME:Steamed clams. You'll find these beauties in a bowl...lusciously presenting the inner-selves to you with hints of tomatoes and garlic. This became my staple dish during lunch here...and I RAIDED that section (with the assistance of the lady as well)...they put 20 out, we grab 5 bowls...GANGNAM STYLE. It wasn't long before the "chefs" got the hint that their clams were a hit at 2 pm and replenished it repeatedly all the way to closing time.Now here's the thing that prevented me from DINGING the crap out of this place when it's priced on average higher than most other buffets...It seems like Wicked Spoon Buffet forgot to add one word to their name and that is DESSERTS.I don't even eat DESSERTS. I remind most people that I don't care about DESSERTS. But I found myself eating a LOT of DESSERT here.WICKING VERDICT:Definitely not a meat-eaters paradise...as this place was created for you freaking SUGAR ADDICTS.I'm doubling down on this hands down!! One of THE best buffets I've been to thus far in life. I'm not one for buffets either so this actually coming out of my fingertips is definitely something to pay attention to!Real.Talk.There is food of all kinds, textures, colors...it's blatantly amazing.  There's a breakfast/omelette station, carving station, sushi station, etcetera etcetera...Plus a full blown dessert galore station including Gelato...Oh Man!  I had to pace myself and count out my bites just so I didn't get too full too fast.  I wanted to try everything!  We topped off our brunch with some bottomless mimosas - like the food, the servers kept them mimosas comin'!  Good job!The restaurant is fabulously decorated, spacious and clean.  There was adequate seating and space for large parties.  Be sure to make this a restaurant to experience before leaving Las Vegas.  You will regret not going here, and I'm so not even playing...This is probably the most creative of all the buffets, but dishes are hit or miss.  There are two main things that differentiate this buffet from most of the other "nice" buffets in Vegas.   1. Exotic Ingredients/Creative Pairings2. Portioned ServingsIf you consider yourself a foodie or an adventurous eater, you'll want to give Wicked Spoon a try.  Where else can you get Sweetbread Dirty Rice (not bad), Fried Oysters (pretty good), Crab Legs, Braised Short Rib over Creamy Polenta (very good), Wild Mushroom Risotto (tasted great, but they need to cook the rice an extra 15 minutes, a few grains were still gritty), Butternut Squash Raviolis with Duck Confit (surprisingly too doughy, not enough butternut squash taste, and not good), and Bone Marrow?  I went for dinner.  The day you go they'll probably have totally different dishes.  They have your standards, like a well seasoned tender prime rib.  They have a build your own mac 'n' cheese station.  The Asian foods, like the sushi look unappealing.  They have quality cheeses, like St Agur Blue Cheese (Or was it Stilton? I forget), really good shrimp ceviche.  The night I went they did not have the sweet potato fry station up and running.  The food variety is all over the place, just stay away from the Asian foods.  I'm a fan of their portioned servings.  No, they aren't trying to restrict how much us piggies want to eat, because really, how much food can one piggy eat?  Things like risotto get served in their own cute little stainless steel cooking pot.  If you love the dish, sure you can grab two or three pots for your plate, but if you just want to taste some, the portioned servings are perfect.  How I see it is... it saves you from over spooning and overeating, when your efforts can be better spent on other dishes.  Alcohol here is extra (not like the free beer and wine bar at the Studio B Buffet @ M Hotel). What you cannot pass up is the dessert bar.  Want to make a girl happy?  Bring her here!  Vegas has stepped up the dessert bars over the years with Wynn, M Hotel, and now the Cosmopolitan.  They have macarons!  The French kind!  Like salted caramel and passionfruit macarons!  There's an expansive gelato bar (looked like maybe 16 flavors?) that is a must sample.  Jumbo chocolate dipped strawberries, covered in nuts.  Mini tiramisus.  Red velvet cookies.  The dessert bar is probably the most impressive part of the overall buffet... there's no better way to tap out!  Best buffet?  It's pretty close.  I still think I like Wynn's buffet the best, with Studio B and Wicked Spoon running neck and neck depending on what you prefer that day.  All of those are way ahead of Bellagio's buffet.  I have not tried the new Caesars' buffet, so I can't compare it to that.For $40 I thought this was a pretty darn good deal. Nice ambiance, service, and best of all, really good and interesting food. You won't find any gross giant chafing dishes of buffet food here; instead, most items come on their own individual serving plates/dishes, which contributes to the high-end feel of this place. While they have your prime rib (excellent), pasta, and all the other usual dishes you expect at a buffet, they also offered some some out-of-ordinary fare which I greatly enjoyed, like the roast bone marrow (accompanied by toast and sea salt, yum!), sauteed calves liver, and beef tongue shepherd's pie. They had a kale salad that was divine, and there was very little to fault with any other offerings I tried. I thought the Korean BBQ galbi was a little on the fatty side, but not bad. Their dessert selection was pretty outstanding as well, with a Thai Iced Tea ice cream that was out of this world! My friends and I had a great time and was appropriately stuffed by the time we waddled out of there. This changed my idea of a buffet forever, and I am looking forward to my next visit.I have never wanted to try a Las Vegas buffet as much as I wanted to go to Wicked Spoon.  The concept of individualized containers and high-end items really appealed to me. After a couple of failed attempts and massively long lines, I got my chance.  The individualized containers were all that I could have ever hoped for.  Little ramekins, bowls, and cups of pasta, meats, and salads were so cute and portioned for grazing.  Those containers also made handling a plate really difficult since you could never put more than 2-3 containers on a plate at any one time. A major disappointment was how quickly Wicked Spoon ran out of "the good stuff."  Someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.  When I returned for the first seating of dinner, they were still out of bone marrow.  I managed to try the salmon and beluga lentil dish, which was delicious.  They one measly plate of macarons which I later discovered they had no intent of refilling.  They udon noodle bar never seemed to have any noodles.  I enjoyed the prime rib, fried oysters, gelato bar, marshallows, kale salad, and variety.  It was very heavy in carbs - lots and lots of pizzas and filling pastas as per buffet usual but they were well-done too.  My major gripe was that it didn't seem luxurious or interesting enough.  No bone-marrow, sweetbreads, lamb chops, macarons, rilletes, pork belly, xiao lung bao, all of which I saw in other yelp photos.  One of the more unique items on our visit was the calves liver and onions.  Just because it's offal doesn't make liver and onions a desirable dish! It's still up there as an interesting and delicious buffet but at $42 dinner and $37 lunch plus the long lines...just know what you're getting yourself into.If you are looking for a midweek discount to do buffets this is the place to go.Located at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Wicked Spoon offers small scrumptious servings - a shot of ceviche, a creme brulee - in cute mini pots and baskets.Pass on the sushi - meh. The prime rib was juicy and tender, the raw salmon is delish yet not fishy, and the best part of all are the desserts, the ice cream was fab!plus a complimentary drink of your choice - besides coffee, soda and juice you could also have either champagne, mimosa or a bloody Mary.The weekend brunch costs $30, but weekdays it's a steal at $22.***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.Not many places are worth an hour and a half wait (in line), but Wicked Spoon is.Yeah there will be a ridiculous wait. First you'll have to wait in line to pay (about 45 minutes) and then when you're all stoked that you get to eat....there's another line to be seated (another 45 minutes). And the entire time you see people rolling out of the restaurant. Too stuffed to walk. The price was just under $40, not cheap, but well worth it. You can also upgrade to bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's for a few extra bucks.   So this isn't your run of the mill buffet. This buffet is whats up! It is a perfect hangover cure because it has got everything you could imagine. All sorts of brunch items (my personal favorites were the french toast and eggs Benedict). There were also vast quantities of bomb meats, chicken. pasta (the gnocchi was just wow), sea food, ...everything damnit! The service was a bit slow the day I went, but apparently they had understaffed that day. The waitress was also super nice and really apologetic. The weakest link were the desserts. The assortment wasn't great. The best part was probably the thai tea gelato. Which was crazy good.As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: Standard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. ::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::Due to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: Perfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.::: [ SERVICE ] ::: Only experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.::: [ DRINKS ] ::: Wine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don't forget to ask for coffee when you're ready to move on to dessert!::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: I've dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.____________________________KEY:(-) Skip This(+) Try This(++) Love ThisI have either 1.) never tried or 2.) feel indifferent towards the ones that have no symbol next to them. ____________________________DATE/TIME: MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 // 7:30PM::: [ SAMPLE OF THE SPREAD AT DINNER ] :::[ ASIAN ]Egg Drop SoupCabbage SaladWok Tossed UdonHar GauBeef Stir FryCompart Duroc Pork Ribs (+)Korean Kalbi Short RibsSushi[ ITALIAN ] Duck Ravioli (++)Italian Sausage Pappardelle (++)Spaghetti w/Smothered Cherry TomatoesAsiago Gnocchi w/Lamb Ragu (++) / sometimes chewy, good flavorBraised Beef Short Rib w/Polenta (+)Margherita PizzaChicken Garlic PizzaSausage and Roasted TomatoProsciutto Stromboli (+)Prime Rib Pannini w/Truffle AioliBroccoli Rabe w/Pine Nuts & Garlic Roasted Red PeppersCrispy Chicken Thighs w/Pancetta and Romanesco[ MEAT ETC ]Shepherd's Pie (+) / too much potatoTruffle PotatoPotatoes au Gratin (++) / not there yest but usuallyCreamed Spinach (+)Roasted Sweet Potato w/House-Made MarshmallowCarnitas w/Black Bean & Salsa FrescaGreen Garlic Roasted TomatoesPotatoes O'BrienVeal Sweetbreads "Dirty Rice" (-) / missing sweetbreadsWicked Fried Chicken (-)Roasted ChickenPrime Rib (+) / good quality & textureLeg of LambBone Marrow (++)SAUCES: Au Jus, Chimichurri, Horseradish Cream, Red Onion Marmalade[ RANDOM ]Wild Boar Sloppy Joe's (+)Citrus Glazed SalmonBBQ Shrimp & White Cheddar Grits (+)Crab Legs (+)Crispy Corn Tacos[ MAC AND CHEESE ]* This station is always either a Design-Your-Own Mac & Cheese or Shrimp Station.[ COLD FOODS ]FRUITS: Bananas, Apples, MandarinSquid Chili Gochuchang (+)Egg and Candied Bacon SaladChopped SaladBlistered Vegetable PanzanellaSmoked Trout Salad w/Frisee (++)Marinated Mushrooms w/Burrata & FoccaciaShrimp Ceviche (+)Shrimp CocktailDeviled EggsWhite Bean and Tuna Crostini w/Truffle Oil & ParsleyRoasted Beet Salad w/Arugula, Goat Cheese, & Sherry VinaigretteKale Salad (++)Bocconcini SaladRoasted Garlic SoupSoup Du JourOlivesCold CutsSmoked Salmon (+)Pickled Cornichons (+)Maytag Bleu Cheese, Brie, Manchego, etc (+)Crunchy Pita BreadHummusTomato and Chickpea SaladBaba GannoushTabbouleh (+)Tzatziki (+)[ DESSERT ]Molten Chocolate Cake w/Caramel Sauce (+)Peach Cobbler (+)Chocolate MarshmallowFudgeCarrot Cake (+)Opera Cake (+)Cheesecake (+)Godiva Lolli CakesFreshly Baked Cookies: 4 TypesSweet Potato Flan w/Toasted Marshmallow & Rosemary Shortbread (+)Gingerbread Shortcake w/Eggnog Whip Cream & Milk Chocolate SauceChocolate Covered StrawberriesSmores Chocolate Pudding w/Graham Crackers & Melted Marshmallow (+)Caramel Apple Streusel Tart (+)Tiramisu Chocolate Cup (+)Chocolate Mousse BerriesSugar Free Chocolate Custard w/Raspberry Compote (+)Low Sugar Vanilla Cream w/Blueberry CompoteStrawberry Gazpacho (+)[ DESSERT: GELATO + SORBET ]Mint Chocolate CrunchSalted Peanut CaramelVanillaCoffee White Chocolate (++) PistachioCaramel Candy BarAlmond JoyOreoThai Tea (++) Nutella (++) TiramisuStraciatellaStrawberry BalsamicRaspberry SorbetMango Passion SorbetBlood Orange SorbetLemon Sorbet (+)Sugar Free Chocolate____________________________3/27/13: Tried Bacchanal - amazing selection. Will still be returning to Wicked Spoon for my fave dishes, Bone Marrow, & better gelato. Crepes at Bacchanal, tho!There are some things that are worth waiting in line for ... like Niners Super Bowl tickets, tickets to la Galleria Borghese, or an Adriana Lima kissing booth ... but Wicked Spoon Buffet is NOT one of them. The line here is depressing. Not only is it long, it moves slower than a TSA security check point. Worst of all is the mirage ending, once you think you've finally come to the end you realize that was just the line to pay. Wait ... there is a.. a ... second line?!?!?.... just kill me now.Once you finally get inside the food is disappointing at best. The only real highlight was the bone marrow. If you decide to come here make sure you upgrade to the bottomless drinks ($9 for bloody mary's mimosas which can be mixed and matched). They are the perfect way to fight back a hangover while also creating your next one ... Cheers!To be entirely honest, I'm not really seeing the hype. While the concept of a tapas style buffet sounds amazing, my excitement towards eating here didn't quite equate to a superb dining experience.My group and I arrived around 1PM and although the line didn't look super long, the wait seemed agonizingly slow. We didn't get seated until around 2:30PM. After we were shown to our table, my group dashed to the food to check out the selection. While there were many chic and modern dishes that you would find at a hip, fancy restaurant, there wasn't really that large of a selection. Compared to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, the choices seemed barren. Oh well, I told myself. Hopefully the quality of the food will make up for the lack of selection. From the meat section, I tried the bone marrow, kalbi (Korean beef short rib), five spice pork belly and ham. Now I was ecstatic to try the bone marrow and I've never tried it before. However, it just tasted really...weird? I don't know how to quite describe it, except for the fact that I'm not convinced that the flavor was what people usually went gaga over. The five spice pork belly was AMAZING though! Layers and layers of greasy, fatty, pork goodness will lead to feelings of immense satisfaction. And perhaps a little guilt afterwards. Wicked Spoon had some of your standard buffet finds such as a meat carving station, crab legs, salad bar and pizza station. The Chinese station had a pretty cool concept, with some items stuffed inside a little Chinese takeout box or a dim sum basket. There was also a mac and cheese section that I didn't get to try because I thought it was an omelette station. For that, I want to cry a little. Dessert was definitely the best part of the experience, since I ended up stacking my plate full of macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, small slices of cake and double scoops of gelato. Everything was quite tasty and sort of made up for the rest of the food. In fact, the macarons were so delicious that the Asian in me compelled me to hoard a few macarons into a Chinese takeout box. Shhh. Overall, I'd give this place more of a 3.5. This wouldn't be my first choice upon returning to Vegas for buffets since I've been to places that had both great food and dessert. But the rest of the girls in my group loved this place, so whether or not you like it is pretty much based on your own experience. As for me, I kind of wish Wicked Spoon was a little more wicked so that it could've really unleashed the glutton in me.For someone like me, a foodie with absolutely ZERO self-control, this buffet is PERFECT. High-quality, fancy-schmancy foodie-food...served for the most part in little individual containers....so you don't take too much!!!You know how it is: when faced with a vat of buttery whipped sweet potatoes and a ladle, the urge is overwhelming to pile it onto your plate a la "Close Encounters." Here, the potatoes are pre-portioned into precious little stainless steel mini-saucepans. Sure, you can still take too much...but you'll feel like a total ASS with all those saucepans clanking around on your plate!!!The deal is the same with many of the offerings here: pre-portioned, in cute little Chinese takeout boxes, pots and ramekins. Awww, Cosmo -- always thinking of your customers' waistlines! I found the spread here to be among the best in Vegas. Decent Mediterranean selection, great salads (kale with cranberries & pumpkin seeds...YUM!!), and all the rest of the usual lardass buffet staples: glistening slabs of quivering meat, mac & cheese, tacos, pizza, sushi, etc. The ambiance is upscale and chic, and like everywhere else in the Cosmo, the staff is great. And wine is available for purchase at a very chi-chi little wine vending machine. (I must get one of those vending machines for my kitchen!!!)Overall, I found this buffet to be right up there with the M Resort and Caesars Palace -- best in town!After hearing so much about the Wicked Spoon buffet, I FINALLY got to try it on my most recent trip to Las Vegas....and the verdict is: 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best buffet I have ever been to!  The most impressive thing about the Wicket Spoon buffet is the presentation.  Everything was exquisitely prepared and presented.  My mouth was salivating walking past all of the counters and looking at the many different, exotic things they had.It is not the biggest buffet, but they did offer several types of ethnic foods to choose from.  They had Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, and American selections.  Everything was tasty, and I greatly enjoyed my dining experience here.Wicked Spoon was fairly pricey, but well worth it.  No buffet can compare to a great restaurant dining experience in my opinion, but Wicked Spoon is about as close as I have had.  I look forward to coming back the next time that I visit Las Vegas.This is officially my favorite Vegas buffet!Wicked Spoon is also wicked expensive so major thanks to the sugar daddy BF for the multiple trips to this yummy buffet :)Even though we dined for both lunch and dinner, we were lucky enough to show up during non-busy times. No line to wait in, no crowd to compete against for food, and plenty of empty tables around us so the wait staff paid plenty attention to us.My biggest gripe about many buffets are the lack of creativity and taste for the dishes that don't contain animal products. As a vegan, I'm often stuck with something boring. But in my first plate alone, I was wowed by three specific items: Kale Salad, Green Papaya Salad, and Sweet Potato Pur√©e.The Kale Salad had this citrus-y sweet vinaigrette mixed with pepitas and dried cranberries. Very bright in colors and taste! I could eat a full plate of the Kale Salad and be so happy :) http://su.pr/1lzRQBThe Green Papaya Salad was perfectly al dente in texture and mixed with green beans, green onion, tomatoes, and peanuts. The dressing had a hint of sweet and a bit tart which marinaded well with all the ingredients. I even opted to add tofu to soak up some of that delicious flavor. http://su.pr/3imgLqThe Sweet Potato Pur√©e was like candy! Smooth and vanilla-y, I definitely went back for seconds on this one. http://su.pr/2qgxuvThe only less than great items were the avocado rolls and the veggie rolls offered at the sushi area. It wasn't bad, it just was the standard mediocre buffet-style sushi.I really appreciated that the dessert area contained non-dairy options. The Mango Sorbet and Raspberry Sorbet were super delicious! http://su.pr/2C6VL6During our dinner visit, many of the lunch items were still available but I was happy to see that they added more vegan friendly things including:- A garbanzo bean, tomato, and cucumber salad- An Israeli couscous salad- An artichoke and hearts of palm salad- Hummus, baba ganush, and pita chipshttp://su.pr/290JjfAll items were good but I might note that the hummus and baba ganush was a bit on the thin side. But I do wanna point out the olive bar which had these amazing tasty olives. Specifically, the bright green ones which were more sweet than tart. There was also these super large red olives that tasted like they have been smoked...almost like salami. Yum!So the price is kinda up there, especially for someone who doesn't take take advantage of all the meat and seafood offerings. But out of all the Vegas buffets that I've been too, Wicked Spoon is definitely at the top of my list!Also, beware of the mimosas. One sip and it's like "geez, would you like any orange juice with that champagne?" Still good though. You just gotta be prepared for it :)I was so excited to try this place because of all the press and photos I'd seen. Sadly, I ended up being a tad underwhelmed. I love the individual servings as opposed to big messy trays where people duel to the death for certain items or use whatever tongs they can get a hold of. However, there just wasn't enough variety to make everyone happy.Meat lovers have tons of enticing options, such as duck ravioli, bone marrow, and braised boar ragout. Seafood lovers have less to choose from. The menu was very shrimp-heavy-shrimp cocktail, shrimp ceviche, Spanish-style garlic shrimp...Maybe this is the Asian lady in me, but I was wondering the whole time, "Where are the clams? Mussels? Calamari? Fish?" There were one or two fish dishes, which were rather cookie cutter and nothing exciting. Crab legs were offered, so you might be happy if that's your thing. I never cared much for crab legs, so I was left wanting more.Vegetarians are even less well-represented, unless you count the salad bar. And vegans? Forget about it.This all-you-can-eat is pretty awesome for people who have a sweet tooth; I'll give it that. Desserts range from macarons to strawberry cream puffs to a dense chocolate cake. For me, the desserts were the highlight of my dining experience here.We came at dinnertime, supposedly when buffets put out the best of the best. And we were in Vegas, known to be a buffet heaven. Despite all that, I failed to be impressed by this newer restaurant. The Wicked Spoon, though it serves some decent (not great) meat dishes with decadent ingredients, didn't meet my definition of a great buffet.This buffet is GOOD and I still want to show them some love but after I found a SPIDER crawling in their beloved chocolate-covered strawberries (you know, the ones everyone writes about), it completely put me off and ruined my meal. Imagine taking a bite out of your strawberry, and then look down to see a spider drop down onto your plate from the strawberry you're holding. Pretty much a sure fire way to completely lose your appetite for the rest of the day.But I think I was more put off by the way the manager handled the situation. The server sends over the manager who just stands there as I explain (I wasn't that annoyed, I was just trying to make them aware because no one wants to eat a damn spider). But then he just stands there, doesn't really say anything and makes it really awkward. Like....was I supposed to make a bigger fuss so I can get something comped? I think it was his really quiet demeanor and just standing there that made me think "okay so....really, you don't know how to handle it". You could have just confidently told me you're sorry and will inform the staff about the issue. I think I was more put off by the clueless manager who didn't really know how to handle the situation. The other staff is great though.Hopefully this was just a one-time occurrence but pretty sure I won't be going back for a long time. Bleh.It's funny. I had breakfast here a few months ago. The food was fine, but I walked out thinking that the staff just seemed....well, dickish. My server brought me one water and I never saw him again. I stopped a different server to ask if perhaps my guy was on break. He said, "no," and walked away. Not, "I'll get him for you" or even the ideal answer: "How may *I* help?" But Wicked Spoon has a bunch of solid reviews, so I held off on writing mine until I could go back for a second opinion.Today was that day.I walked in with three friends and approached the cashier shortly after 2pm. Her greeting to us? "Did you hear what she told those people?" Huh? Did we hear what who told whom?Rolling her eyes to the next cashier, the bundle of hospitality sneered, "she SAID we're closed. We close at two." Well excuse the flying fock out of us. Maybe someone could post a sign to that effect at the entrance? Maybe you could get off your lazy ass and click the velvet rope thingy across the entrance to the zig-zag waiting line chute? Either of those would work since you clearly do not have the personality necessary to communicate the information verbally.I hadn't told my buddies about my first impression of the service here. But every one of us left with a lasting impression this time. The cashier could have used fewer words and, frankly, done her JOB by simply being, oh, I dunno...polite. She could have said, "I am so sorry, gentlemen. Buffet seating ends at 2pm daily so we can begin setting up for dinner service. Please come back and see us." But she'd rather be a bitch. No, not just a bitch. A bitch who was so goddamn lazy, she tried to get us out of there by relying on the other cashier's verbiage to some other guests that we never saw.Cosmopolitan? My ass.Actually, I'm sorta happy things went down this way. The bitchy clerk managed to confirm everything I walked away feeling the first time. And I didn't have to blow $25 on the buffet this time.I looked at lots of reviews for various buffets in Vegas and determined that this was what most Yelpers had talked about and indeed they were right.  This buffet was in fact one of the best that I've been to anywhere.  It's like a high end restaurant and elegant dining experience, at least again as far as buffets are concerned.  The best part is the small plates and the individual servings to that you can sample lots of different foods, not feel guilty about wasting anything, and not have that buffet feel of scooping out of a big bowl or tray of food.  Lots of choices and everything tasted great.Best buffet in my entire life. The buffet is top tier. I give this a marvelous 5 stars rating from my personal experience. No bias and no gimmicks. There are lot of places you would have to wait about an hour or so, but WIcked Spoon is far the only place I could wait all day, because it is so simply worth dining here. Modern atmosphere to blend with the Cosmo hotel's ambiance. Process: -You wait in line, pay at the cashier then get seated. Price is about $35~, add $9 for unlimited champangne/mimosa/bloody mary.  Love the champange! I made myself drunk here to get my money's worth, haha. -Serve yourself with the best Las Vegas food on the strip.-They basically have everything, from Italian to Korean to Chinese to Mexican to American food. -The salad bar is amazing. Love the shrimp shooters. -Gelato........ so bomb. 'Nuff said! A lot of options here and it's pretty much no limits. My friend is a vegetarian and there are a lot of vegetarian options! Yup, we both stayed here for 3 hours.I was very VERY VERY underwhelmed by this place. Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.The Good: Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called itKalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portionsBACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.The OK:Prime Rib au jusBlue cheeseCream corn with red n green peppersMost of the desertsThe unimpressive:Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oilyLinked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interestFried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the pastThe asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one outThe five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derri√®re!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!The epitome of blind gluttony. There is something about being in Vegas that makes it justifiable to over indulge and shamelessly stuff your face. I arrived at Wicked Spoon at 11am and by the time 11pm rolls around I was still full. So maybe I over did it a little but I felt obligated to eat my money's worth since I already paid $42 and I also had practically starved myself for the previous 3 days in preparation.There was barely any wait when we arrived at 11am but by the time we left at almost 1pm, the line was quite significant. The service was good and they were fairly attentive. There were a lot of people working so you can easily find something to ask for things from. They also have optional bottomless champagne/mimosa for just $10 but we were sufficiently libated the night before and opted out of it.This is going to sound a little crazy but I was disappointed in the lack of selections. So they did have 5 stations of food but each station only contained 5-6 selections. I did enjoy the small plates they presented everything on because it's pretty but it's not all that practical. If it was in one large pile, I would have taken 1 piece of fried chicken and not the 3 that the basket contains. The same goes for the pasta dishes that came in a miniature pot. I ended up wasting a lot of food.The taste was just okay for most items. I really wasn't impressed in the dishes that the reviews and my friends hyped up like angry mac n cheese, fried chicken, and bone marrow. The salad bar was also salads in individual cups. I enjoyed the wedge salad but the caesar salad was quite disgusting.The best part has to be the dessert section. There is a large variety of desserts to pick from and a full gelato selection. I really enjoyed the dulce de leche cheesecake and the chocolate raspberry tart. The gelato was also amazing. I had the salted caramel and it was creamy and delicious with the right amount of saltiness. My friends had the Thai tea and that was great too. I'm a little sad they didn't have a hazelnut flavor.You can ask for coffee, juice, or gelato in a to go cup to walk out with. I asked for an orange juice with ice and the girl was extremely nice in saying that it's of course something that they do. Love the awesome service.I kept hearing great things about this place so I caved in and tried it. I actually enjoyed it and was quite impressed with the presentation, quality and variety of foods. The deserts and Asian food selection are probably the highlight of this place~! Some reviewers complained about the small portions due to the presentation of the food (i.e. coming in small plates and a basket for the chicken) but  I think it's fine because it let's you really try everything.I experienced the brunch menu only and haven't had a chance to try their dinner menu. My favorite entrees were the Pork Belly (very surprised to see that there but it was fantastic), Fried Chicken (very moist inside and crunchy skin), and sushi which was pretty fresh and tasty. In terms of desert, I was most impressed with the gelato bar which had a great variety of flavors.The environment is very modern and clean, and we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes when we got in around 2pm for lunch. The service was also fantastic and the bathrooms were spacious and clean.Overall, i would highly recommend this place even though it may be on the steeper side of prices. My only complaint would be that you pay for tip on the front end...which I've never seen before. What happens if you have crappy service?Price for Brunch on the weekends: $33Price for Dinner on the weekends:$41You know that annoyingly pretentious guy or girl who goes to Vegas and is all "I don't do buffets; that's for amateurs"?  He or she hasn't been to Wicked Spoon.  And don't tell him or her.  Let's try to keep this a secret for as long as possible ;)  Husband and I came here RIGHT when it opened for dinner on a Friday night and there was NO LINE.  We hear it gets pretty packed later on in the evening though so if you hate the waiting game, go early bird style like we did!  The location was a little hard to find... it's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but we had to wander around the shopping area for a bit before we spotted a sign that pointed us in the right direction.  It's a bit of a schlep from the main shopping area through the hotel to the buffet (a warning to ladies heading out in those sky-high stilettos!).The space itself is visually stunning and really does not look like the other buffets in LV.  Wicked Spoon has worked really really hard to distinguish itself from the other Vegas buffets and refers to itself as a "bustling culinary food hall."  Honestly, it can call itself whatever it wants.  It's awesome.  The quality of the food was excellent and about 70% is offered in individual tapas-size portions, which helps if you're the kind of person who typically overdoes it with the heaping spoonfuls of food at buffets.  For the Vegas buffet lovers (i.e., for that person in your party who really had their heart set on going to a traditional buffet), there's still the standard Vegas all-you-can-eat staples like crab legs and prime rib at Wicked Spoon.  Bone marrow?  At a buffet???  Yes, you read that right.  This is typically a $20-30 appetizer plate at some of the nicer restaurants I've been to, so after having a few bones to myself I knew I'd gotten my money's worth.  The salad and cold items section had some of the freshest offerings I've ever seen.  Octopus salad!  Shrimp ceviche!  Nom nom nom!Service was excellent.  Our servers were very attentive, and they refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly.  The dessert selection was impressive.  There were even some sugar-free options (that did NOT taste like your usual sugarless desserts!) and so many gelato flavors to choose from!  Too bad we were too full from sampling everything else at the buffet to really try much of the dessert.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  There's plenty of kid-friendly options to pick from too, so parents don't have to worry about it being too sophisticated for a young palate.  Can't wait to go back!When in Las Vegas, Vegas-sized buffets are never my food stop of first choice.  However, it was late-morning, the fianc√©e was hungry for breakfast and I was hungry for lunch.  Conveniently, the Wicked Spoon Buffet was serving up brunch.  The Wicked Spoon is tucked far away from the bustle of the casino floor in the Cosmo's West End Tower.  After doing a walkthrough past its assorted food stations, I came away impressed with the wide selection of freshly made breakfast items, lunch items, fresh salads, and delicious looking desserts.  Italian, Asian, and Mexican cuisines, as well as American comfort food staples, were represented at its buffet stations.  Perhaps, its most distinctive feature, though, is the Wicked Spoon's gelato bar.  While it may not have 31 flavors like Baskin Robbins, it's comprehensive with flavors ranging from plain vanilla and chocolate to salted caramel and tiramisu.  The Wicked Spoon may not compare with the 800 lb. gorilla that is Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it does the buffet thing quite well and is certainly in the discussion as Las Vegas' second best buffet.$54 for brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's! All 10 girls were GAME ON! We arrived on Saturday pretty late into brunch (it IS a bachelorette party, who gets up that early!!) but there was still a good amount of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks which arrived at the table strikingly fast. I was overwhelmed by the variety of food and how beautiful each dish was presented! I loved how each dish was portioned for one person to try. I tried the salads, muscles, chicken wings, cheese and bread, mac and cheese, while mushroom spaghetti, and a few other dishes. Every dish was delicious. There was not a dish that I tried that I did not like. The flavors were rich, so super rich.Our waiter was very nice and got all our drinks on our table in a timely manner. Those girls kept ordering the mimosas and the drinks kept on coming! The buffet area was super clean and everything was presented so neatly and pretty. Every dish sparkled. Not really but to me everything in Cosmo sparkles :)I wasn't feeling well the day I came here because I was running off a total of four hours of sleep in two days and I had nothing but Crown and greasy junk food in my system. After my second small plate at Wicked Spoon and only my third glass of mimosas, I threw down my napkin. I was really; really SAD I didn't get to try EVERYTHING. That's what happens when you play too hard, you miss out on GOOD food!! :(Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: Wicked Spoon - THE buffet of buffets.Let me first begin by stating: I am NOT a fan of the buffet.Well, I'm a fan of the IDEA of a buffet- endless food, endless desserts...mmmmmm.The problem? Well, take your average buffet - the food is plentiful, but the taste, quality, and presentation echo that of a prison scene from a movie, or from the hallowed past of your elementary school cafeteria days.Wicked Spoon takes those images, chews them up, and spits them out into something modern, very tasty, and quite enjoyable to look at. (How did I equate spitting with enjoyable??)If you've ever sat on the couch watching Food Network's Iron Chef, Chopped, or any other show on their lineup that uses verbiage like, "bla bla bla compote" "with a reduction sauce" "pared with a something or other" and your mouth just waters...wondering in your limited restaurant experience what any of those foreign terms taste like- then GO TO WICKED SPOON!!! They've got all kinds of bla bla bla compote reduced with a something or other sauce pared nicely with a snippet of something that is PRESENTED to you as if YOU were one of those celebrity judges on Iron Chef!!!I felt like a SUPERSTAH as I repeated MANY trips to the salad, desserts, main courses, and even to the MACARONI area where like many buffets with an omelet area, you can choose to have the chef add whatever ingredients in that you'd like (several cheese selections, crispy bacon, veggies, onions, sausage...so many choices) and then he cooks it all together right there. Macaroni with Cheddar, Parmesan, and bacon was my personal favorite.Their cheesecake was practically divine. The only thing to remember is that the portions are super tiny. Very elegant. Very fancy. That's a good thing though. If you get something you don't like (which is virtually impossible at Wicked Spoon), you can mix it around with your fork and it looks like you've eaten most of it. That way you don't have to feel like a wasteful pig when the server comes to clear your dirty dishes.I did think it was very expensive. It cost a little over $200 for me, my wife, and our 5 children (1 was under 3, so he was free). However, we have paid close to that in Vegas for other buffets and not been happy at all with the quality.On a side note- I finally got to try bone marrow! Completely nasty. I'll never eat it again. BUT, at least I got to try it!!! :-)I've been to Wicked Spoon a couple of times, and while the first visit was spectacular, my most recent visit left me unsatisfied.  Every Vegas trip, we choose one brunch buffet to visit on our last day.  Our last two trips, we chose the Wynn buffet, but since we were gambling at the Cosmopolitan, we decided to stay local.$25/person for a brunch on a Friday is totally sensible, especially for one of the more highly rated buffets.  The 15 minute wait was also very reasonable for a Friday at around 11:00AM.Wicked Spoon has a wide variety of foods separated by stations: breakfast (omelettes, biscuits and gravy, french toast, etc), meats (italian sausage, prime rib, bone marrow), spanish inspired, asian inspired, light appetizers, and desserts.  The variety plus the creativity offered in a lot of the dishes are much to be admired, however this visit, I felt like Wicked Spoon delivered more simplistic and stale foods.  The chocolate covered strawberries though, omg.  So delicious.  In my opinion, the desserts alone are worth the price of the buffet.I'll probably skip Wicked Spoon on my next Vegas trip, but will return soon after for a follow up.  Hopefully I just came on an "off day".I'm pretty sure that the Cosmopolitan realizes that it is losing too much money and thus has cut its budget on the already loss-leader known as the Wicked Spoon.From the previous reviews, it seems that the Wicked Spoon has come a long way from being a 5 star experience to a 2-3 star experience (for its price).The first problem encountered was at the entrance when we saw that a gold brick had fallen off and thus left a giant white hole on the wall where it was supposed to be. This means that they have reduced the amount of maintenance workers for the restaurant. This also should not happen in a five star resort partnered with the Ritz.The second problem was that there was almost no variety when we came this time. The worst part of it all was that the sushi was "FOR DISPLAY ONLY". REALLY? The third problem was that they started to clean up at around 7:45 PM (they close at 9 PM), meaning no more fresh food after that, save for a couple of dishes. NO MORE DESSERT TOO. Basically that means I was unable to eat any of the supposed good stuff.By the way, they I believe they save those desserts for the next morning. I'm serious, I saw them neatly stacking them on a tray obviously not intending to dispose of them.Some of the food was pretty good though, but this isn't close to being a value for its price. The gnocchi with a sweet corn emulsion was really good. I do believe that they purposely try to use sub-par ingredients.I happened to ask our waitress for her opinion and even she said that it isn't worth it for dinner, although breakfast seems to be a better value. She also happened to hint that chefs here are constantly replaced.Service is impeccable however. Our waitress was literally superwoman. The path for the waiters and waitresses to walk through was poorly designed. They are forced to walk through a maze.This place really is total hype. From a pure business standpoint, I would've cut the budget on this buffet too. $4 billion is a ton of money to repay to Deustche bank. Analysts have calculated that this hotel will not reach profitability in this decade. That means more cuts are expected.Living on lost reputation is okay, but you can definitely see that some people realize what has happened. There weren't as many low ratings (i'm not sure if they even had any!) in the first two years they opened but lately the low ratings have been increasing.The parking here sucks too!!!!!!111!!11!!1!1iPad review*Dear ladles and gentlespoons,My last biz trip to Vegas was my first trip to Wicked Spoon.  It was a treat that lived up to its hype -- a beautifully appointed setting, with a wide array of culinary offerings that were presented artfully and executed deliciously.The scoop on this year's return to the Spoon however deserves some dishing of the wicked (or at least not the most flattering) kind. To echo a few other reviewers: what happened, Spoon? You've raised your prices but have had a very noticeable drop in food quality and quantity from last year. A few service stations were completely closed. Much of what was left was hardly in the higher-range quality that was the resto's hallmark of the last visit. And, of the few higher-end items that remained, most seemed to fall a notch in quality, like with the skinny crab legs or overlooked shrimp. (I know ... not exactly third-world problems)Beyond this ... this trip's buffet offerings vs. last year's seemed to show a mere shadow of, what could best be described as, a loving attention to detail in presentation.  When my server came at meal's end to ask how my dinner was, I was earnest and said that the food offerings seemed better last year. They said they hear that a lot. Maybe lunch or brunch is a better value?Last year the rating danced between five and four stars; now it's between two and three. It's still a beautiful setting for a buffet, and the service is friendly and earnest, so rounding up to three stars. But I won't be making a third visit unless this Spoon gets a handle on its current tarnish. For over $50 before tip, don't we deserve a little more polish in our cosmopolitan buffeting?*  i.e., two-finger reviewing is better than none.Wicked spoon, yes. It's a pretty cool fusion-y buffet with a HUGE selection. Hmmm what can I say..It's honestly not mediocre. They have some FANCY stuff like shrimp ceviche, crab, etc. But if you're tryna OD on some fresh oyster, shrimp, SEAFOOD...not really the place. All the food doesn't seem like it's worth $50. I probably ate until I almost passed out, but I filled myself with maybe $20 worth of food. They got macarons though! My friends and I TOGO-ed hella haha...to use up the $30 I wasn't able to accomplish with all the chinese food and italian food, which isn't really worth that much money. I think the buffet at Caesar's palace is way better.They change up their menus and sometimes they don't have certain stuff so BE SURE TO CHECK.The second time I went, I REALLY didn't get my moneys worth. They kept running out of EVERYTHING. They had NO MACARONS, so goodbye $30! They seriously had nothing but King Crab legs, which became tiring after a while to crack open...I just don't think WICKED SPOON is worth the money. Its super fancy schmancy and pretty. High quality? yes. But they don't have the BIG stuff like OYSTERS, SHRIMP..etc. They had salmon, but it was danky and AITE... Dessert selection is AMAZINGGGGGG and super well presented in their decor, but taste wise it was aye-okayy. Good for the whole experience since it is in cosmopolitan hotel and it's super nice. Saw Matt Barnes DOEEE which was pretty cool ;DHands down the best buffet on the strip. We have eaten her so many times that it's become a tradition to visit every time we are in town. The ambiance is great with contemporary decor. The waiters and waitresses give top notch customer service. Great food selection no matter what you're in the mood for. They also get bonus points in my book for presentation. I love how they portion their food into little mini skillets and fry baskets, perfect so you don't overcommit to a single dish. They are reasonably priced for the vast selection of foods and desserts compared to other buffets in Vegas. And the icing on the cake, you can add $10 on top of the cost for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Here is a breakdown of the cost and hours: Daily Brunch: Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. ($26.00)Weekend Brunch: Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. ($34.00)Daily Dinner: Monday - Thursday, 5 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($38.00)Weekend Dinner: Friday, 5 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Saturday, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($41.00)They have a very good selection of goodies. I appreciate that most of their items are portioned out so not of lots of people going through the food like at other buffets - where serving spoons fall into the food in the trays yuck!It's one wicked buffet indeed! Hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic Cosmopolitan Hotel. I've frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. My last visit was over Thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up Bacchanal Buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the Caesars Palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2PM. Sorry, I'm not THAT crazy to stay in line that long. Wicked Spoon here we come! Ohhhh yeah!!45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! We paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in Bacchanal for their Thanksgiving rate. You have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. So among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why I love Wicked Spoon. FOR STARTERS, I WENT CRAZY OVER THESE:-Pumpkin Soup---Not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it's hearty and addicting! -King Crab Legs---Fresh and sweet! -Shrimp Cocktail---Succulent! FROM THE CARVING STATION:-Bone Marrow---I ate this like there was no tomorrow. I probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. "A moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!" -Roast Beef---Yummm...-Lamb---Cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...Need I say more!?-Turkey---Not a turkey fan but it was Thanksgiving so I had to eat some. It was great! SEAFOOD ENTREES:-Shrimps---Cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. I got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. Delicious!-Mussels Mariniere---I had 3 bowls of these. The sauce was fantastic! I was literally slurping it down. ASIAN CORNER:-Roasted Pork Belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful! The crispy skin was a nice added touch. CARBO LOADING:-Paella-Mushroom Risotto-Mac N Cheese---Dude!! They have a MADE-TO-ORDER STATION for this! It's amazing! You get to pick what you want in your Mac N Cheese. Sooooo goooood!DESSERT:-Chocolate Covered Strawberries---This is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. A must!-Gelato---A myriad of flavors to choose from...you'll go crazy! Thai Iced Tea and Nutella were my top two favorites! -Macarons---Last but not the least, these are not to be missed. They had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! Sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones I've had. All's well though because I may have had as much as my heart's content before the 2nd batch came out.   SERVING:Most of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. It's nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. I like their concept: unique and practical! SERVICE:-From the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. Our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. Top-notch service! For now, I think Wicked Spoon is the best buffet in Vegas. Quality food and service. Then again, I have yet to try what Bacchanal has to offer. Until then...After hearing all this hype on how amazing Wicked Spoon was, I was eager to try it out. And after trying it for myself, i think the consensus (not only mine, but the entire group I had gone with) was that wicked spoon was just A-OK. A buffet is a buffet and I maybe a had a one item that really stuck out. Everything else was pretty medicore and typical of a vegas buffet. Now the decor of the place is nice. You do absolutely get that fancy feel, like I am in a fancy place. Service is pretty good also (but is service really an area of focus when you're on at a buffet??).Price can get pretty heft during the holidays ($42.60 for LUNCH on holidays. not worth it) and for dinner (which is close to like $50 I think). ADVICE #1: IT IS NOT WORTH THE DINNER PRICE! (I capslocked so that it could catch your eye). Go for lunch/brunch for $27 bucks! They have breakfast items AND lunch items. They also have different stations, like a salad station, the breakfast station, the meats station, the asian section. ADVICE #2: If you want to save space in your stomach, skip the asian section. It's whatevers. My favorite item has got to be the short rib cavatelli. Holy crap it was good! The meats were also pretty delicious. Another plus, they have a gelato station in the desserts station which is pretty cool.Not worth it at all!Unless you have a half-off coupon, Wicked Spoon was barely par with the $20 buffets at the cheap hotels. Sure they have some fancy "looking" items, but they all fell flat. And at the premium price point, you'd expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQAIt was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I've been to.Let me just preface my review by saying that I don't like buffets. I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach. That being said, I was won over by Wicked Spoon. It featured food in new and creative ways while preserving quality over quantity. Needless to say, it wasn't the most remarkable dining experience you will ever have, however it will make you think "did I really just go to a buffet?"Set in the recesses of the Cosmopolitan resort, getting there can be a challenge in itself. Whoever designed Las Vegas resorts to get you to set destinations clearly set a slot machine or a poker table in your way. Be prepared with some comfortable shoes, because no matter where you park your car or if you valet, the trek is clearly enough to burn off your first plate of food (I'm exaggerating here for the record). Yet if that isn't enough to deter you, the line to pay followed up by the line to be seated might be. Don't give up. When you finally are seated, you are greeted by a diorama of epicurean treats that are hard to be rivaled. From the lighter fare to the more delectable treats, our brunch buffet was among the best I ever had. The smaller plates encourage variety and expanding your taste palate with bites uncommon to the normal buffet. Forget the mass produced scrambled eggs, the cold pancakes and such. Bring on the mushroom risotto with truffle oil, thick cut slow roasted bacon, or perhaps the desire for the gelato bar might arise. The smoked salmon mousse in a cone could be passed up, the watermelon with feta and balsamic reduction right next door shouldn't be passed up. While simple, the crisp flavor of the watermelon is complemented with the salty feta and the sweet tart of the vinegar. While it might be over in a bite, I guarantee you will be back for a couple more of them. The bacon was heaven. Not too fatty or oily, but still offering the silky saltiness to go with your made to order omelet. Be sure to save room for dessert because the gelato was extremely well done along with the other small morsels set away enough to avoid the drool that will escape your mouth. Service was good. Who would have thought I would be talking about service at a buffet!? Yet here I am including the fact that the staff quickly cleared plates, were incredibly pleasant, and never let the water glasses go full. Service usually is tolerable at a normal buffet, Wicked Spoon clearly takes it up a notch.While the buffet has become an integral part of Las Vegas cuisine, don't skimp on the $9.99 buffet that might dote the landscape. Let the wallet be a little loose and skip the slots for an hour and check out the Wicked Spoon. It is definitely worth the experience.What a cool place- and man do I wish I had taken a Grandma sized purse (with extra ziplocs) and a bigger appetite as neither the husband nor I had seen a buffet quite like this before. I have been out of the swing of life for a bit so I haven't done any entertaining for much longer than I would like to admit but this place got all of my little foodie serving gadgets and gizmos ideas working. I loved the concept of this place-and though there were plenty of things served "buffet style", most offerings came in individual serving sized containers or portions. Mini fryer baskets with fried chicken, mini take out Chinese containers with noodles or fried rice, cast iron skillets with mac and cheese, a risotto offering in a small cassoulet dish and the list goes on. The dessert area was one like I have never seen including a full gelato station with several flavors offered. The husband imbibed in the dessert offerings quite a bit but sadly, I was too full. Since we were in Vegas celebrating our 5th Anniversary, it didn't dawn on me that we would be in town for Chinese New Year AND the Super Bowl. Due to this, there were a lot of very pretty but not for me types of offerings either ingredient or textural wise. There were some hits and some definite misses on some of the "regular" items but this is the genius thing about a buffet though-lots of offerings for all different taste buds.I will try this place again in a heartbeat and hopefully will get to feel a bit more Wicked!3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris. However, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA - Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ - No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. You would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. The saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg  At least I can say I've dined here.

Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest "bangs for the buck" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  Unable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of "China Buffets" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.I finally tried the brunch here and it was delicious. The dinner was so so. At our last stay at the Cosmo, my gf really wanted to go to Wicked Spoon but we had to check out, so on our last day, we went to the Wicked Spoon for brunch.I was previously disappointed by the dinner here so I was hesitant to try out the brunch. So the selection here isn't as large as Bacchanal but it was great overall. Everything I tried was delicious minus the indian cuisines. Way too much spices for me. Some of the notable dishes for brunch included bone marrow, the Asian porridge, dubuki, and duck eggs benedict. Overall, the dishes were all pretty decent. The dessert here was really good as well, I liked the thai tea gelato, chocolate oreo strawberry and coffee cake. So why the 3 star review? It is an average between brunch and dinner, the brunch was 4 stars but the dinner was 2 stars for me.Overall, come here for brunch but go to bachannal for dinner.I wanted to love this place but we had a horrible experience last night. At first, I was impressed with the selection of food and the presentation. I took several pictures excited to share them with my social networks...But then things got ugly!We were a ladies group of 10 instead of 13, we thought they were kind enough to reserve the table of 13 for us because we were celebrating a bride-to-be, but really it wasn't out of kindness, it was a CONTRACT. This was thrown in our face several times by the server and the manager at the end of our meal demanding payment for the 3 extra heads. We tried to explain what happened with the extra people but they weren't hearing it, why? Because we signed a CONTRACT!Regardless of what we signed, we are not professional event planners and the CONTRACT wasn't explained to us properly to begin with. As we tried to straighten this out and explain things and ask for some understanding and flexibility, the manager became increasingly irritated and threatened to charge us several hundred dollars for being at the table for more than 2 hours..why? Because we signed a CONTRACT! And CONTRACT groups only get 2 hours at a table. So I asked him, "If we just waited in line, instead of reserved this table, would we be charged for 10 heads instead of 13 heads and be able to sit here as long as we wanted?" He said yes, but YOU have a CONTRACT!" So our beautiful bride-to-be who flew all the way from Italy for this special week said "Wow, you kind of have a bad attitude" then he got all worked up and threatened us and called security. And we were "escorted out". Even the security guards, while still doing their job, thought this was silly. Seriously, a bunch of 30-40 year old professional women including television producers, military women who serve this country, and hard working mothers, are THAT threatening. It was ridiculous, embarrassing, and unnecessary...But apparently, we signed a CONTRACT! I have dined at many many many fine restaurants in Las Vegas, with many groups of women, where I gladly paid $75, $100, even $150 for a nice dinner. The bride CHOSE to try the Wicked Spoon buffet so we went there instead of a normal restaurant, and she ends up getting booted?!?!?!?I have never ever dealt with such an unprofessional and inflexible establishment. The whole fiasco was utterly ridiculous.Summary: Attended Wick Spoon for a wedding so really I don't know how much it is per head and I don't intend to find out. The setting was dark which I don't understand why, do they not want us to see what we're eating? But after sampling majority of their food I assume the darkness is so other guest doesn't see me split out the food.Food: Their weekend dinner selection was below average. Nothing stand out or mind blowing. The only thing I can actually compliment on was their salmon which wasn't bland and their shrimp cocktail. The sauce was different. It was sweet and sour at the same time and the taste wasn't too strong on the palate. I would avoid the desert section, flavorless and full of sugar. Service: The staff was very friendly though. I don't know was it because we book a private room so we have personal server but they were very attentive and always on time to refill our beer and wine. The staff was very professional throughout our stay which I understand can be tough at times especially you know, asian and their endless alcohols. Overall: Of all the buffet I experience in Vegas, I think I'll stick with Bellagio for the time being until someone recommend we try a new place. But definitely Wick Spoon is off the table permanently.This buffet definitely deserves the accolades it's been getting over the years.In all my visits here the past few years, I've noticed that the quality has been maintained, which is good.  What's good about this place is that they offer a terrific variety of dishes and don't just rely on the old standards like crab legs and prime rib to keep customers happy.Some notable dishes - the tuna poke appetizer was great and the meat section (prime rib, sausages, pork etc.) was impressive.  I wasn't as thrilled about the Asian section as the food there didn't taste as good as the other selections.I am a huge fan of the dessert section here and would argue that it was the best among all the buffets I visited on this particular trip (compared to the Caesars and Wynn buffets).  The Thai iced tea ice cream was pretty awesome, and the white chocolate mousse was excellent as well.  I ended up enjoying dessert more than any part of my meal which is unusual for me in a buffet.If you only have time to hit up one buffet, this isn't a bad choice.  The ambiance here is also more like a restaurant than a buffet, which is nice.Our server pissed me off.  I ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  It came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a Moscow mule. We asked to have it changed on the bill, since I ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  Rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim I've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! As for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  The mashed potatoes were good, I'll give 'em that. A couple of the pastas were serviceable.  Everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  And a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  Not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  Hmmmm.  Overall, pretty disappointing.  You think you're paying more for unique menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish.Let's just sum it up pretty quick all you can eat.Pork Belly Bone Marrow, and all the great flavor selections of gelato. I'm happy with that ,but they do have other great gourmet food selections.For 20 something dollars, I could understand some of the 4/5-star reviews detailing brunch. But for $50 at dinner, it fell short.  I'm certain I didn't eat $50 worth of food, my fault for not eating everything!!!  If I tried a bite of everything they had, I would totally pass out from a food coma without really savoring and enjoying (that's why I'm a bad candidate for buffets).  Plus, we had seafood on our brains, wanting everything under sea, especially a variety of crab.  Failed!  All they had were snow crabs. I suppose AYCE lobster is out of the question for $50.  Stop being so unrealistic, Gigi!!!I did like the shrimp cocktail shot glasses!  Very convenient, tasty and cool spin to a just pile of shrimp as I've seen at other buffets.  Bone marrow was another yummy treat, haven't seen that anywhere else.  I love bone marrow (and clogging my arteries)!! Gelato station was a nice touch.  No white chocolate covered strawberries, only dark chocolate!  Booo!!!  Prime rib was just ok.  Nothing else really caught my attention.  A few other complaints from my table were, not a wide variety and items like bread/pastry were stale and even hard.Our server was friendly and attentive, I appreciated that.  Didn't appreciate the attitude from a worker at one of the stations. Too long to detail the incident, but I wasn't being out of line.Will definitely opt for Bacchanal instead next time.If all buffets were like Wicked Spoon, I might become a buffet guy.  The thing about me is that I don't like to gorge.  Eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money's worth doesn't appeal to me.  I prefer to taste, not gorge.  I like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.And if you're a taster like me, Wicked Spoon is heaven.Wicked Spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  This made me a very happy boy.Aside from this unique quirk, Wicked Spoon is a fairly conventional Las Vegas buffet.  On the other hand, it's quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  There's typically a line to enter, but I managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  (Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  But expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.)The foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  The strengths lie in the desserts, I think.  I loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  Every single cake and tart was perfect.The savory foods were a little more mixed.  The vaguely "Asian" foods like the General Tso's chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (Also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  Same with the Mexican foods.On the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  The various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.I could spend hours detailing every dish I tasted, but that would be pointless, since Wicked Spoon's selection of foods changes on the reg.  You'll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!  Just be sure to bring your appetite.I've eaten at most of the better buffets in Las Vegas over the years (Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Rio, Caesars, Mirage, Wynn, Paris and others) and I would rate the Wicked Spoon very highly. The main difference between the Wicked Spoon and other high-end buffets is the way they present the food. For the most part, each entree is prepared tapas style and served on a small plate or pan. You won't find the mountains of food on display like other buffets. Personally I liked this method and found that each entree was better prepared than at most other buffets where the entree is typically served in a large pan and you scoop up as much as you want.The downside of this method is that the large plate that they give you is not an even multiple of the smaller plate which means that it's fairly awkward to put a few small plates on the larger plate. Also, at some of the stations the small plates sit on a warming plate and they can get a bit hot to pick up.I thoroughly enjoyed the first dinner that I ate here, especially at the bargain price of $40. The entrees were very well prepared and I was very impressed with the quality and variety. A very nice selection of up-scale dishes were available. The salads and desserts were plentiful and beautiful as well. What you won't find is ordinary dishes which was fine with me but might be a problem if you bring your kids and they're looking for fried chicken or other basic dishes.I liked the place to much that I returned the next day for brunch for $23 and many of the dinner items were also available but several breakfast items were added. The brunch entrees were not prepared as well as the dinner items were, IMHO. I almost passed on the pancakes and french toast after a couple of disappointing entrees but found them to be some of the best I've ever had.Overall they seem to prepare dishes with rich and robust flavors which I really like. They are certainly not the largest buffet in Vegas but one of the best if you're more into quality than quantity. Worth a visit if you're looking for something different. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!So this is one of the better buffets in Vegas (Wynn's Jazz Brunch, Jasmine's Fountain Brunch).  But at the end of the day its a buffet and we all know that buffets involved inferior product.  Plus the food sits under heated lamps or on top of heating mechanisms.  So really how good can it be?Anyway this one was okay.  The decor is great and the space is very open and inviting.  There is ample room to move and it's not overly crowded.The dishes I enjoyed were the bone marrow, thick cut bacon, prime rib, and roast pork.  These dishes were pretty good.  If you want a solid buffet, then Wicked Spoon will do you right.  There are tons of choices.Wicked buffet selections!I was all over the seafood and meat delights!  Per say, the loads of shrimps and endless slices of prime rib!  Then, came the crab legs, but that took a bit of effort on digging.  Then, off to the lamb meat and other savory treats!To quench the thirst, I drank some homely bone marrow soup.  Do drink cups of lemon tea to quicken the metabolism and to make room for more munching!Service and decor went hand to hand!Bottoms up and eat up!This is one of my favorite buffets. My friends and I came at 5pm on a Saturday for dinner and we waited only 10-15 minutes in line. When we left around 7:30 the wait was still the same. We paid $41 plus tax per person. I love the seafood area and ate plates and plates of crab legs. These crab legs are better than the ones at Bacchanal which are known to be super salty. I would also recommend the custom-made seafood stew. You choose your seafood (salmon, scallops, shrimp etc) and they cooked it cajun style in front of you. One downside is that I wish they had oysters, oysters would've made this buffet alittle better. Their meat area is also good, they have juicy sausages and amazing medium rare steaks. I love that they have a sauce section for your meat, you can choose from sauces such as creamy horseradish to chimichurri.The dessert section was okay. I recommend that you try their gelatos, those were the best. I wish they had creme brulee or a custom crepe station like they do at the Wynn Buffet but alas, this buffet is cheaper than Bacchanal and Wynn and I was still super satisfied. This buffet was the highlight of my most recent trip to Vegas.This place is so wicked!! There are so many buffet places competing against one another, but this place wins for their originality! We had brunch for my cousins Bachelorette Party. There was a bit of a wait because since we partied the night before, we couldn't get up early enough to beat the lines. But it wasn't so bad.As we got seated in an oversized booth, the waitress walked up to our table right away and took our drink orders. I ordered a cold water and a pineapple juice, which was super delicious I might add! The we walked up to get food. This was my first time here and I was amazed how everything was set up. There were things on these cute little dishes and there were other things you put on a plate. I guess this way the restaurant can control people's portions so they end up not wasting any food. They had a variety of different types of food and stations which consist of a meat station, fried foods, comfort food, seafood, italian, pasta, asian, mexican, salads, and desserts. The quality of the food makes you feel you're getting value with your money. $38.00 a person for all you can eat high end food is pretty cheap! I was told that this place had bone marrow at the meat station. When we arrived they didn't have anymore. I thought the Mac and Cheese was incredible. The pork ribs and the short ribs had a lot of flavor. The desserts I chose was light and decadent. This place is great and I hope this place doesn't ever sabotage their reputation by taking short cuts. Buffet places in Vegas do that after 2 or 3 years being in business.It probably wasn't the best idea to come here a couple hours after leaving a day club and still pretty tipsy.  But it's Vegas.Someone suggested to go eat at a buffet and Wicked Spoon was an obvious choice for us since we were staying at Cosmo.  There was no line-up waiting to go in around 7pm on a Saturday which is always nice for a group of 5 people to eat anywhere at this time and day of the week.I started and finished with dessert, because hey I'm adult and can do what I want.  I was super happy to see all the delicious flavours of gelato they had in mini waffle bowls!  My obvious choice was thai tea flavoured and I feel in love.  It brought me straight back to my memories in Thailand last year where I always had a thai iced tea in my hand.  In between dessert, my husband told me I had to eat all the snow crab legs I could.  The seafood man was constantly filling up the snow crab leg container because people were going nuts for it.  I liked it - it was nice and sweet.The variety they have at this buffet is amazing.  All sorts of good stuff, including food that I don't eat too often like the southern food.  The little pot(s) I had of shrimp and grits were pretty god damn delicious.  I've never had it before, but that's probably what I'd request for in my last meal if it ever came to that.  Excited to come back in a more sober state and update this review.IMO, Wicked Spoon (Cosmo) and Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace) buffet are the best on the strip.  There's a hefty price tag attached per person ($41 pre tax/tip for dinner at Wicked Spoon), but if you wanna treat yourself and go to one buffet while you're in Vegas choose one of these.  Both are pretty excellent.$26 a person for unlimited brunch. Add $10 for bottomless mimosas/Bloody Marys. Done.It would take way too long to go into detail, but overall Wicked Spoon is one of the best buffets I have ever been to... and I normally don't even like buffets. Why? Because buffets usually mean quantity over quality. BUT at Wicked Spoon... mmm quality quality qua-li-tyyy!!!! While most buffets offer trays of food and serving spoons, a lot of the food at Wicked Spoon is pre-dished and portioned. I appreciate that.A few notable mentions are definitely the BONE MARROW (DUH, I must have had like 10 of these), the Asian section overall was just insanely good... nigiri quality on point!, and the gelato. MMM, the gelato.I usually don't leave buffets feeling great, but I actually felt satisfied without feeling overly stuffed when I left Wicked Spoon. Worth every penny.My sister suggested we try the very elite Wicked Spoon Buffet for dinner at the Cosmo in Vegas. I didn't really know what I was in for when I walked in - but it was immense! Even upon the waiting/payment area, this place just oozed with class. Classy buffet - kind of an oxy moron, I know.But it's so true. Wicked Spoon is seriously the king of all buffets on planet earth. I mean, theremight be a better one on Mars or something - but this one definitely wins the title for this planet.We were well aware that the food here is of top tier, and the selection mighty - so we wanted to arrive as hungry as possible. We ate nothing all day and came around 6 o'clock ready to devour. There is no way we weren't going to get our $44 worth. That is the most you will ever pay for a buffet, but at least it's actually worth every penny.After paying, we were guided to our booth by a pleasant hostess. We were glad we didn't have to wait in line to be seated (sometimes they do have a line, occasionally the length of a theme park ride line.) On the walk to the booth we passed SO MANY different types of mouth watering food. I had to take mental notes on what foods to get back to as soon as we got our drink orders out of the way.I first hit up the sushi bar. The sushi was of top quality! Nothing like your typical buffet "sushi." I even had to take a bite before I got back to my table. Then I hit up the American food selection and went for savory kalbassi sausage, delectable mashed potatoes and creamy mac n' cheese pasta.The salad bar was a whole buffet in itself, featuring an assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables, soup shooters, even a yummy caviar caprisse salad.These are really just a few personal highlights. The above doesn't even cover a tenth of the enormous A+ food selection they offer.Dare I even dive into the desert section? Talk about feeling like a kid in a candy shop! More like a fat ass in a gelato shop.Yes, they literally have an entire gelato selection and a chef there to serve you as many scoops as you desire. I went for the mango sorbet and split it with the blood orange gelato.I had no room left in my stomach to try the gold speckled sweet treats, the "brookie" (brownie cookie) or all the other savory looking pastries tempting me nearby. We spent 3 hours there and were sad to leave once we could physically no longer take another bite. It was our only meal of the day and definitely sufficed. I highly recommend trying this buffet next time you're in Vegas. It's not dinner. It's an experience.I don't know where I got the idea to eat at a buffet before I wore a fitted dress to a club. Well, good thing that dress is stretchy, and it still fit... fit right over a bump that looks like I've been cookin' a baby for four months.So chances are you are looking at reviews to pick which buffet(s) you want to eat at when in Vegas, and the answer sometimes just can't be "all of them."Some people say they are disappointed. Honestly, these buffets have lotsa food options, not necessarily anything super crazy! Just lotsa options, and some stuff is staler than other stuff. So now that you know what to expect...I'll compare Wicked Spoon to Bacchanal like this: Bacchanal has a million options. If you aren't a bottomless pit with eating powers equivalent to the Rock or Michael Phelps, Wicked Spoon might be a better choice since it's significantly cheaper. One edge Wicked Spoon does have is dessert- presentation is overall tighter with better flavor and precision than Bacchanal.Weekday dinner was $38 a person. (They do have military discount, btw!) As with any buffet, you can expect food to die under heat lamps, and some of it dies hard here. (Beef Au Poivre was more like Beef Au Jerky.) They have an all-you-can-enjoy mimosa dealio with brunch or red/white wine for dinner. Both are about $12 extra, which is pretty dang amaze if you can put some booze down! Non-alcoholic beverages are included into the price, including Cokes, juices, coffee, and tea! Wicked Spoon kinda does that weird thing where you pay up first and can include your tip on there before receiving service. I'm glad I left a tip on the table since the guy Bill was phenomenal and so kind, and that way I could leave my server extra! And last, my personal tip for being able to eat dessert like a champ: saving dessert for last is for rookies and grandmas. Eat one or two different desserts between plates so that you break up the sweetness and can eat WAY more of them!Enjoy!What a difference a year makes.  We headed back to the Wicked Spoon, anticipating the Dionysian food experience we had last time.  I thought that if we went a bit later, the midwest tourists accustomed to eating dinner at 6:00 p.m. would be tucked into their hotel beds or out getting drunk on the Strip.  So I figured that getting there about 7:45 would give us plenty of time to stuff our faces before the 9 o'clock closing.  Not so fast, cowgirl.The line to pay was long and slow; not as long as at Disney, but long enough.  And this was a Thursday night.  Still, if we'd been seated right away, or after a reasonable wait, we still wouldn't have to eat fast and run.  But the line to get seated was as long as the line to pay.  Why?  Because clean, empty tables stayed empty, and staff was not bothering to clear obviously vacated ones.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to determine that when all chairs are empty and napkins are atop dirty plates, those diners are dearly departed.While everyone was grumbling about the wait and the tables, no one, as usual, was speaking up except Ms. Bigmouth, yours truly.  But the manager gave me the usual song and dance and doubletalk. At last, we got to eat.  And the manager came to our table shortly after to say that she decided to keep the food out for an extra half hour.  Still not enough time for what should have been a rather leisurely meal.It turned out not to matter much.  The heretofore brilliant offerings were mostly pedestrian.  Oh, the usual crab legs and sushi were there.  Many of the dishes were still served on individual serving plates or bowls.  The lamb soup was excellent.  But beyond that, there was nothing outstanding to choose from.  We sampled enough of a variety of items to come to the sad conclusion that the food was basically tasteless.  Salmon was dry and way overcooked.  The Chinese dishes were among the most uninspired, ordinary food ever to grace a pair of chopsticks.  Even the gelato was missing flavor.The room itself is lacking atmosphere - not elegant, nor even hi-tech like Bacchanal.  It's just a room, not even as pretty as the one at the Red Rock Buffet.And speaking of Red Rock, the food's better, the service is better, and with a player's card it'll set you back only $14, instead of the outrageous $41 at Wicked Spoon.  Time to go home.Like the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino where it's situated, the Wicked Spoon is a hip, trendy buffet in classic Las Vegas style. It definitely has a high-end flair, all the way from the silverware and plates, to the food itself.We were here on a holiday weekend and it was quite pricey - $$$ - but the younger kids under 4 were free so it did have value.This buffet has a brilliant solution to portion control and avoiding food waste - virtually every food offering comes in its own small stainless steel or ceramic bowl.  Now, you might think this would be annoying but having experienced it myself, the bowls look really cool and the amounts in them do not really seem to small once you get them back to the table.  The food offerings here are mostly standard for Vegas buffets: salad bar, crab legs, sushi, dessert bar. Nothing to special or outstanding. However, there are a few brilliant standouts that bear mentioning here, which makes this place worth trying. First and foremost, and probably the best part of the whole buffet, is the fresh seafood you can get cooked to order.  It is set up similar to an omelette station at a brunch. They have fresh shrimp, scallops, red snapper, mussels, and various other things you can get custom made in a tomato or scampi broth (mixed is best), with a bit of spice.  And my god, is it good!  I'm tempted to go back there just for this.Secondly, they actually have RARE prime rib, which is a "rarity" in and of itself.  Ha! Virtually every place that serves prime rib has it medium or well done, so this was a pleasant change of pace. We likes it raw! (If you want it more well done, they will grill it up for you on the spot.)  For desert, beyond the standard carrot cake, chocolate-covered strawberry, and custard offerings, they also have fresh-scooped gelato of many different flavors. They again serve it up in relatively small cups, so if you want a lot, you need to order multiple scoops. But the bright side of this is that you can try many different kinds - and let me tell you from personal experience - they're all good!Overall this buffet was a slam dunk and really good in my opinion.  I was totally satisfied and would go back again. And again, and probably again after that.This is a great dining option if you don't want to wait in long lines for a good Vegas buffet. We came here last week for lunch and had terrific dining experience. The lunch buffet is modestly priced @ $35 (diiner - $50), outstanding selections and quality of the food made it a good value. It's located on 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. From the 1st floor, just take the escalator on the right of registration area, next to chandelier bar.We only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Dining area was spacious and atmosphere classy. Service was terrific too. Our server was very friendly, plates were removed and drinks refilled promptly.When dining, they say that you eat with your eyes first. This is definitely true when you eat at the Wicked Spoon. Food Presentation was immaculate and visually appealing. Though family style offerings were present, there main focus were on individual small plates and customized containers. All creatively presented, portioned to right size and ease to get to. Not only did they looked fantastic, they tasted great as well. I took a slight pause at my plate, then dove straight in for the assault. A bounty of deliciousness was at our disposable.My favorites includes -Bone marrow - was like butter, scoop it out with a spoon and spread it over crostini bread. So wicked good! After two bites in, I gave up on bread and went full assault eating it like ice cream. Oh Yum!Five spice pork belly - perfectly crispy skin, succulent meat and fatty goodness was all she wrote. Expect irregular heartbeats after devouring an entire plate. Roast chicken - cooked to perfection, juicy and very flavorful.Salads - Caesar and cobb salad - beautifully presented and on point.Honey and Sriracha chicken wings - sweets, spicy and amazing.Grilled Asparagus - great texture and delicious. Always good going in, going out is another problem. Hahaha!Eggs Benedict with shredded pork and a spicy hollandaise - excellent!.Fresh juice section - small bottle of fresh juices. The fresh squeeze orange, carrot and lime juice was refreshing,Sauteed vegetables (located in Chinese section) - fresh and delicious.Shrimp Cocktail served in shot glass - good size shrimp and not drowning in cocktail sauce...very yummy.All in all - Wicked Spoon did not disappoint. My only complaint was their limited seafood selection and there was no prime rib served during lunch. Instead, they had beef culottes (top sirloin roast). It was tasty, but the meat wasn't tender and slightly chewy. Not a show stopper, the beauty of a buffet is you can get other items if you don't like what you got. Great for picky eaters, especially kids. Bring your appetite and no diets allowed.Oh yes, make sure to save extra space for dessert. Chocolate covered strawberries are so, so good! Gelato section is a winner - pistachio, salted caramel and tiramisu were my favorite.We've been to a lot of buffets in Vegas and wanted to try this one out.  On a Sun brunch at about 1pm we waited 30mins in line before being seated.  There's a line to pay at the cashier.  Afterwards there's a line to the left to be seated.Food- Presentation is everything here.  The portion sizing is fantastic so you get to try a lot of things without wasting or overeating- Check out my pictures but in my opinion the best brunch items were:  watermelon sriracha, beet coconut salad, shrimp cocktails, spicy mac and cheese, chicken piccata, lamb bolongese rigatoni, prime rib- What to skip: fingerling potatoes were very sour, pho- Desserts were amazing.  Best is the full size gelato bar.  Notable flavors: nutella, pischachio, strawberry balsamic, thai ice tea.  They put it on a mini chocolate waffle yumm- Coffee/ice tea/coke etc is included in the buffet price.- For $12 extra can add unlimited mimosa/bloody marysService- fast service, attentivePros- Amazing presentation- Refreshing to see innovative offerings that you might not get elsewhere.- Good variety of American foods- Weekday brunch $27 and weekend at $35 is relatively good deal compared to other buffetsNegatives- selection of seafood surprisingly sparse.  Sushi meager options (only unagi, yellowtail, shrimp and california roll)  No oyster or crab.  Do not come here if you want a lot of seafood.- Asian food selection very small- Few soups (just pho and chicken vegetable soup)Overall this is a new fresh buffet and good addition to Vegas.  The chef put a lot of attention to presentation and providing innovative offerings.   Not a lot of seafood offered but good value.  I would definitely check this place out again.I have been back several times and I'm dropping my rating a star.  Some of the dishes I like a lot are still there.  The kale salad is always very good as is the pork belly.  One of the things I've noticed has been the lack of temperature heat to many of the dishes.  They are lukewarm at best.  This is especially true of the individual portions in small pans or other style holders.The dessert bar has suffered some and the selection of cheese has become almost dismal.  I'm still a fan but I'm sorry to see the downward trend in the pricey buffet.  Wicked Spoon is pricing itself too high and while it may have a good section, the quality has suffered.I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is the best. I guess we came on a weekday so the variety isn't as good as the weekend. The service was good and the food quality was definitely better than other Vegas buffets but I wasn't really sure if it was a 5-star worthy. I liked the dessert selection but I didn't love it. I liked the different stations they had but nothing I ate really stood out.Maybe I'll come back next time on a weekend?I planned a trip to Vegas with my husband last year purely to visit the Wicked Spoon. I bought a new pair of buffet pants for the occasion and booked our flights! :) I also wanted to see the Cat Circus perform while we were there, but they were out of town. We settled for Jersey Boys show, and that was good, but not as good as our dinner at this buffet.The buffet was seriously the highlight of our trip. We spent almost two hours eating our little hearts out. So, so good! I thought I was done eating at one point, but as my husband made round after round to the dessert table, I decided not to admit defeat and had to try a couple sweets of my own. It felt like an accomplishment to walk out of there without assistance when it was all over; fat and happy!For all the variety though, I felt like they didn't have very many seafood options. There was a delicious shot of ceviche that is very memorable, but I like seafood the most and I was surprised they didn't have more fish plates. All in all though, I'm a buffet person and this place is doing it right!I love this place.  The quality of food here is really so much better than any other place I've been to on the strip.  The portions are perfect, the selection is endless and you'll never be able to try everything.  The dining area is beautiful and clean and even the drinks are on another level.  Clean, clear awesome tasting water was probably the most surprising. I also ordered bottomless mimosas which was an extra $12 in addition to the $35 I paid to get in to brunch.  The food, like I said was above my expectations. There was croissant french toast which was the best thing I had there.  Just to name a few other things: cheese platter with dates, nuts, etc. fried chicken, pork belly, rich mac and cheese, omelette bar, piles of bacon, sushi bar, chocolate covered strawberry buffet and gelato.  This place gets busy so you need to be aware of the time that you go.  There is a line to pay and a line to be seated and if you go during the rush you may be waiting for two hours.  Here's the fastest way to get in:  If you are going Saturday or Sunday the lines will get long starting a 10am when the party crowd from last night starts getting up.  10am-1230 was the busiest.  You'll need to go earlier or later for the least wait.  If you are insistent about the 10-1230 time, split your group.  I waited in line to pay and I sent my sister to the line to be seated.  This way you are waiting in two lines at the same time.  I paid and she was next to be seated so we hacked the shit of the system, we saved an hour wait time and that made my food taste better.  Try it next time and you're welcome!Wicked Spoon is my go to buffet when I go to Vegas and is probably one of my favorite buffets of all times. When you think of buffets, you might think of piling a lot of food onto a plate and then all the flavors are mixed together so it really doesn't even taste all that great. At wicked spoon, everything is so beautifully presented in individual dishes. On top of that, everything comes in petite size which is perfect because it helps limit your intake so that you can try more foods. The quality of each dish is superb and there is a wide selection.Asian station: there is always an Asian station where you can find your typical foods like sushi rolls, chinese stir fry and fried rice. What's so special you ask? They pack the fried rice in these cute to go containers size of your palm. MIND BLOWN. IT'S SO CUTE! Not only that, but the rice is vegetarian and is delicious. Oh yeah this place is very good for vegetarians too!!! They also have bone marrow which is to die for. Also oxtail pho which was pretty decent. The kung pao chicken was actually quite good instead of your usual bland kinda soggy chinese food at buffets. Sushi rolls weren't too great though. Meat station: omg meat galore! There are huge pieces of ribeye that the chef will cut for you and you can put sauce on it. There are also sausages, fried chicken that come in this cute little basket.Breakfast station: there are pancakes, benedicts, omlete station that you can request the chef to make the omlete for you. Everything is individually presented as well. There is a whole bread and cheese and random stuff station that include fruits, yogurt parfait, shrimp cocktail, juices and salads. This once is esp. vegetarian friendly. I wish I had room to eat cheese and bread. Dessert Station: I DIE..... you basciallyhave to come here for dessert if nothing else. They have an extensive gelato station with very unique flavors like thai iced tea, blood orange and you can get however much you want. All their desserts are super beautifully made including gold flakes and everything is fresh. This is definitely one of my favorite stationsThe service here is also superb and they always check back to see if you need anything. They give you free beverages including tea, coffee, juice, and soda. Everything cost about 44 dolalrs for lunch including gratuity which is super worth it if you think about the amount of food you eat and the quality of it. I always stay for almost 3 hours and eat slowly and enjoy everything. Everytime I come to wicked spoon, I leave happy and very satisfied and wishing I had a second stomach.#400:"Don't expect life to serve you what you expect. Just enjoy the buffet." ‚Äï Manoj VazDedicating my 400th review to a buffet!?  Hardly!  Well, actually, it *is* what I'm doing but it's mainly because I just got back from an amazingly memorable trip out to Sin City!So, Wicked Spoon.  What can be said after 4,506 reviews?  For starters, I'm still full from Saturday's dinner here at Wicked Spoon.  I had eaten so much bone marrow, sans crostini because I'm a fattie, and dessert, I'm surprised I didn't throw up.  And this was before we hit the bar for some libations!  Matt C. was the best dinner companion for Wicked Spoon because he seemed to enjoy his food as much as I did.  I got to admit though that I thought there would be more variety.  They had a carving station for pork shoulder and prime rib, duck a l'orange, homemade Italian sausage, a fish cooking station, a tiny selection of sushi, a pasta station, some pizza, an impressive salad bar, an even more impressive dessert bar, et cetera.  They even had crab legs!  Yet I still wanted more variety.  #LifeAsAFattie  Dinner was $50/pp and it was definitely busy.  I was disappointed that they were out of pork belly but having some mac & cheese made the disappointment a little better.All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in again!  Decor is nice, service was speedy, and the food was hot.  Take me back to Vegas, please!
Merchant Madison=Best food you've ever had in Madison? Really?I wanted to like Merchant. I did. I dine on the square a fair bit and as far as I'm concerned, the more options the better!However, the space feels very much like the restaurants I took great pains to avoid when I lived in L.A. (because they were too much of a scene). It's smaller, but I get the same negative vibe.I've seen a large bar share space with a dining area and work very well (Bar La Grassa in Minneapolis, for instance), but Merchant just feels cold to me -- warehouse-like. Like a bar that serves some food, as opposed to a restaurant that encourages you to eat at the bar. The waitstaff seemed very aloof on both of my visits, and charging $9 for cocktails just tips the scales further towards pretension. Maybe hanging some art would soften it a bit? And hiring some nicer people?I sampled the craft cocktails and was left wanting. Same with the food. Maybe I'll try it again in a few moths and hope they're able to make some improvements, but they've quite honestly not given me much of a reason to give them another chance.*** This review has been edited from it's original content. After my initial (frustrating) experience with this establishment, I decided to give it another try and re-write the review with a clear mind. Unfortunately my second experience only echoed my initial let down.Note to other recent reviewers: PLEASE only leave a review if you've actually been to this establishment. The point of this site is to leave reviews based on your experience there, not based on your politics.Here's why I'm giving it 4 stars: Went there to "grab" a tasty treat with a limited time frame. Their sandwich area was closed, but the hostess immediately offered to go back and check to see if they could whip up a to-go sandwich order for me.  They even ushered me to a table and poured me a glass of water while I waited for my take-out order.I picked the procuitto and arugula sandwich - very good, yet light. Ambiance is classy/romantic: think dimly lit, dark but modern woodwork, and an underneath the radar bourbon tasting in the corner to boot. Staff was friendly and extremely accommodating, even though I was in such a hurry.I will definitely come back for a more substantial meal soon.Two months ago I would have given Merchant two stars. The menu read like a United Colors of Benetton billboard crammed with Thai, Mexican, Indian and good ole fashioned American. There was a note about chefs shopping the farmer's market for what was in season which apparently meant more flavors from across the globe than MJ's Heal the World video. A cornucopia of flavors that was really hard to read and make sense of. Bartenders were green and pulled out little black books to remember cocktails they themselves created. It was a mess.BUT, I'm happy to report the times they are a changing! Merchant was AB FAB tonight, so much so that I was crafting a review in my head while I was eating (rare that I mix work with pleasure). Get the mussels. TOMORROW. They're in a creamier broth than I typically prefer but tasty nonetheless. Served with a garlic rubbed bread it's a perfect way to start your evening, especially if you plan to share some stuff with friends and need a little nosh early on. I also recommend you get the patatas bravas, a more American take on a classic Spanish tapas, but flavorful for a potato. Hangar steak tonight was a little overcooked for my tastes, but it had great char and a nice flavor, albeit a little less pink than I prefer. We subbed the taters out for frites and couldn't believe how long they stayed warm in the middle. I hate... HAAAATE cold frites, even luke warm frites, so whatever these guys are doing to 'em rawks, they're magic frites. Super awesome. Any place that freshly squeezes their juice ranks high in my book, and these guys are doing it with grapefruits, even though it's 2 bucks a pop at the store right now. (Makes me think they won't cut corners when prices rise). Bar area was slammed so service was a little slower, but I didn't have anywhere to go so it didn't matter. Know that when they have music there are usually killer tap specials, so the place will fill up. Grab seats early like we did and don't be afraid to get all up in someone's face. I did at one point and at the end of the night the bartender helping us out said thanks for being patient and flagging him down when we wanted. All in all, this place is miles better than when I was there over the summer. If you haven't been recently give them another try, and as soon as I get back there and try more of their concise and easier to read menu, I'll let you know how it goes!Merchant is where I go to hobnob. The atmosphere is dark with a smidge of swank and the drinks are on point with a smidge of expensive. They often boast solid live music on Thursdays and DJs for grooving late nights Friday and Saturday.Do I giggle when bartenders refer to themselves as "mixologists"? Yes. Will I refer to them as such with a straight face in order to get my hands on a Jack Rose (aka my favorite cocktail in town)? Of course. And I knock off a star because the Jack Rose is only made available when their house-made grenadine is in stock. I'll bring in my own store-bought grenadine if I have to. Girl's not too proud to lug syrup around in her purse.Most recently ordered their brat sliders and get.outta.town. Delicious. Next up, I've got my eye on their late night brunch menu. Brunch...10PM-1:30AM...that's my kind of crazy.I've been back to Merchant more times than I can truly count, and it continues to impress.+ By far and above all others - the finest cocktails in Madison+ Always a solid selection of micro brews on tap+ Sit at the bar and engage the bartenders; they're fun, informative, and helpful- Yes, it's noisy at times, but it's a big, open space with lots of hard surfaces+ Cheese curds are awesome+ Brunch is amazing+ You can buy your favorite booze on-site and take it home with youMy husband and I were first timers at Merchant this past Saturday. Around 8 O'clock the bar and dining area were packed. I automatically fell in love with the design and d√©cor which was a combination of industrial rustic and prohibitionThe host politely greeted us and we were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait which was fine with us because after all it was a Saturday night. A few minutes later a server walked by and asked if we would like anything to drink while we were waiting. My husband order an Old Fashioned and I ordered a Side Car (at the servers recommendation). Five minutes later he came back with the best cocktails we have ever had in Madison. They were strong but not over powering. We found two lounge chairs in the back and relaxed until our table was ready. In the mean time the same server came back and checked on us and brought us water. After about a 20 minute wait we were seated in his section. He gave us a run down of the restaurant and it's history and recommended another round of superb drinks. He even went as far to explain exactly how the drinks were maid and gave us a recipe! Talk about going above and beyond! Fast forward to the food. We ordered the scallops and Olives as appetizers and they were at our table in less than 10 minutes. The scallops were perfectly cooked, crispy on the top and bottom and flaked easily with a fork. The sauce was mouth watering and the cabbage and bacon complimented the dish perfectly. The olives came in a huge portion with ricotta on top and warm bread and again were fabulous! Around 9 they started playing old school rap (Biggie, Tupac etc.) which is the way to my heart! The DJ was setting up around 9:30 just was we were leaving which is a major bummer because we probably would have stayed until closing if we hadn't had previous engagements. Overall I would have to say this is my new favorite bar in Madison! We will definitely be going back in the next few weeks!Headed back to Merchant with a crew of 7 lovely ladies. I have to tip my hat to the wait staff. They know their stuff! Ask them anything about their extensive drink menu or food menu and they know the answer! Seriously, they describe flavors, make recommendations, tell you where things are from etc. It's borderline insane! They are also all about the guest! They were happy to make me a custom mocktail, not on the menu, just something crafted just for me. Talk about feeling like a queen! They also let another in our group swap out a dessert special for an appetizer instead. Our server brought extra bread to dip into the sauce the mussels were steamed in. First class, 5 star service!The food is also amazing! I sampled the perfectly seasoned fries, ooey gooey cheese curds, and couldn't pass up the warm olives again. My steak frites entree was amazing and cooked to perfection. Perfect crust on the peppery steak. Served with amazingly seasoned fries and a bed of lightly dressed greens. I sampled the date night fish which was also delicious and the perfectly citrusy mussels. That sauce... Oh that sauce! I understand why my friend ordered extra bread, it's drinkable! Merchant is just one of those places that does everything right! Thank you to merchant and our stellar server for an exceptional meal!Can you give six stars? I'm giving six stars.If you ever meet me, you'll know within an hour that merchant is one of my favorite restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Everything about every meal and drink I've had here has only been positive. To start: service is always top notch. Chefs and cooks are competent and accommodating; if you have any questions about diet or ingredients, servers are always willing to find out for you. Speaking of servers, ask for Kristin if she's available. I wish I could give her a review too, but I'll just say, most honest, competent, and one of the best servers I've had the pleasure of being served by.In my last review, I went into deep detail of every meal I've had here. Overall, I love the mussels here. Decadent, creamy (no dairy!), almost tart perfection with mussels and onions cooked just right. Mussels weren't my favorite food until I came to Madison.Drinks; I've had many and let me say, they're all amazing. Go with your gut; if you think you'll like it, you'll most likely love it. My favorite is the sharknado, and pear's sake is a close second. Desserts; red beet chocolate cake, hand's down. It's a large dessert, so I definitely recommend sharing. Surprisingly, I've never had to wait for a table. Most of the time I have a reservation, but the few times I've come here without one, I've been seated within ten minutes. I can rave about this place all day, which i do to many of my out-of-town friends. Come here for a drink ($2 off for happy hour), or come here for the fun servers and the good food. You can bet you'll run into me here!Okay Merchant, you're up to bat. Several Yelpers highly recommend you so we showed up with high expectations. Specifically we heard a rumor that the buffalo style cheese curds were incredible. Were they?We showed up to Merchant around 8pm for a slightly later dinner than usual. It was quite packed and loud by the time we showed up. The host was sitting and disengaged, but he was able to have someone seat us immediately at a 2 person table wedged in the corner by the kitchen.The decor can be described as a pirate ship cabin that has been redecorated by a hipster. The walls have fleured wall paper and the light fixtures remind me of something out of Pirates of the Caribbean between the paper lanterns and the lamp covers made out of old carboys with the bottoms cut off. Even the drink menu had an old canvas map feel to it. The entire north wall is lined with craft liquor for sale, which is nice because sometimes you just need to run out and get a bottle of Pastis but can't find it in a liquor store. I'd describe the atmosphere as a very trendy, kind of hipster bar. Unfortunately, it is quite loud so don't expect to have a good conversation inside.During our visit I had the opportunity to order a fantastic porter that was on rotating tap, the buffalo style cheese curds, the Friday night special (fish fry), and a key lime pie.Let's start with the cheese curds; I was sorely disappointed. The cheese curds were fairly standard but when ordered buffalo style they come with buffalo sauce DUMPED all over them. The first one I put in my mouth honestly reminded me of a buffalo boneless chicken wing, not a cheese curd. The breading was mushy, and you couldn't really taste the cheese. We were so disappointed by the addition of this sauce that we ended up asking our server for a cheese curd without it on the side. The curd without the sauce was quite good. We're going to have to come back again to truly get a feel for the curds at Merchant because we cannot judge them on their buffalo style curds. If you really want to try the buffalo curds, ask for the buffalo sauce on the side.Merchant also offers a HUGE list of craft cocktails. My wife ordered the Lee Ralph, a rum and fruit based cocktail. It was quite smooth so much so that it didn't taste alcoholic. If you're a Yelper, make sure you check in to get $1 off the cocktails!The main course, my fish fry was very well done. It was fresh water perch, served with a house tartar sauce. I do not really like tartar sauce so I can't say much about the sauce, but my wife said it was really good. I ended up asking for a bottle of malt vinegar, which is the only way to truly eat fried fish, in my humble opinion. The fries that came with the meal were VERY salty, but the acid of the malt vinegar paired well, toning down the salt. I really liked the coleslaw, surprisingly. I'm not the biggest fan, but this slaw was very good. It entirely lacked balanced by having tons of vinegar on it, but it paired well with the salt from the fries. I actually liked the overpowering acid in this case.For dessert I ordered the key lime pie. I'm a bit of a key lime pie snob, and this pie has HUGE potential. The filling was incredible, and it had the right about of whipped cream on top. Sadly, there was way too much crust on the pie. The ratio of filling to crust was weighted toward the crust. There should always been more filling than crust. Either the crust needs to be thinner or the filling needs to be thicker. I don't want every bite to taste just like graham cracker.The service at Merchant was fantastic. Our server was very attentive in refilling water, asking how things were, and asking if we needed anything like more drinks. She even took care of my ridiculous requests for a single cheese curd and a bottle of malt vinegar. Merchant, kudos on quality service. We felt very taken care of, even when I was being slightly ridiculous.I also have to mention, Merchant, props on your wine list. It is rare to see such a diverse, interesting, and well put together wine list. It's even rarer to server so many of the wines by the glass. I appreciate this touch.Overall, I really liked Merchant. It had some short comings, but I think I will be a repeat customer. We need to give the cheese curds without sauce another try and explore more of the menu. It pains me a bit to only give Merchant 3 stars because I want to like it. I appreciate the atmosphere, menu diversity, drink quality, and the service. I cannot over look all of the small flaws in the food. The food left me wanting a little bit more.
Buffalo Wild Wings=I am going to start off by saying that I am a fan of BWW, but this location is lacking bigtime in the service department. I love the wings, and I always have...but the other food was bland.The service was HORRIBLE. The waitstaff were very unprofessional...even for a bar setting. The host, Craig...I think his name was...told us that if our server wasn't good that he would "Strip her and stretch her out"...how disgusting is that? Oh, and we didn't go at night...we went for a BUSINESS LUNCH.We weren't given menus.The people who brought our food carried on conversations with one another that were of the sexual nature that I really didn't want to hear...one server with blonde hair and too much eyemakeup was very vulgar and too PDA-y with her coworkers.There was also another server texting on her cell phone.I wish this place had better service, we will never be going here again!I normally only review businesses where I have positive statements to make.  I feel that my bad experience at a location does not necessarily mean that the restaurant should suffer for it, because your experience might be better than mine.  However, I am so put off by this place and multiple bad experiences that I truly feel the need to warn EVERYONE from going there.  There are LOTS of other choices in Charlotte, no need to support this business that treats customers so poorly.We had a reservation to start my Bachelor Party here, due to the convenient location of being next to our hotel (not due to positive experiences in the past, that's for sure).  The reservation was made weeks in advance & would have been between 10  - 14 adult males all drinking alcohol and devouring wings and appetizers, etc for a few hours before moving the party to a more adult-oriented location.. The tables were not ready on time.  Not really a problem, that's ok.  We can work with that.  The hostess showed us a small table (8 top) that was ready immediately, as well as the table(s) where we would prefer to be located, but we needed to wait 10 minutes.  We chose to wait for the larger table.  We stood at the front for over 30 minutes.  Those of us made to stand at the front and wait included my fiance's 75 year old father and my 65 year old father!  The hostess offered (again) to put us at the smaller table (8 top), or we could wait for the big table.. Again we chose to wait for the larger table, as we knew that the 8-top was too small. They told us our table was ready after 35 minutes of waiting, and the manager was there helping to set the table.  The problem was:  the table was the smaller table that we were offered over 30 minutes prior.  When I questioned the manager about it, and pointed to the tables behind us where we had been promised, he said that larger set was going to a party of 20 that was a WALK-IN behind us (a group of teenage volley ball players). I explained what we just went through, all the waiting, and the communication with the hostess, that we had a reservation for weeks - and they were not ready for us, and we had been waiting over 30 minutes for that particular table, and now he was suggesting he was going to give it to the party of 20 teenagers who cannot even order a drink from the bar?  He said, "no I am not planning on giving it to them, I AM giving it to them".We left, as I would not let any of my friends or family spend single dime in a location that would talk to us that way; and we spent over 3000 dollars in food and alcohol at the Wild Wing Cafe around the corner (located in the Epicenter).  I sure hope those teenagers were able to order a LOT of wings to make up for the loss of income to the bartenders!! Do yourself a favor.  Do not eat here & support businesses with poor customer service in today's economy!  There are plenty more deserving businesses in Charlotte that deserve the patronage, because they care!
South China BBQ Hong Kong Style=This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.
Hogs Heaven Barbecue=I love BBQ and this place is located near my good friend's house.  So when he suggested we try out the new BBQ place near his house, I jumped at the opportunity.They recently opened, so there isn't even a sign there yet....but they have a huge banner so we knew we were in the right place.  It's tucked in the corner of the shopping center, so you have to look for it.Looking at the menu, which has no beef, I was tempted by the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Hot Links sandwich.  I couldn't decide, so I ordered both!While we were waiting for our food, the owner/cook gave us samples of his Baby Back Ribs, Fries, and Hot Sauce.  What a  nice guy.....the samples he gave us were awesome too.The first dish to come out was the Pulled Pork Sandwich.....the thing is huge!  I was beginning to regret ordering 2 sandwiches...lol  Anyway, the Pork was tender and juicy and had the right amount of BBQ Sauce.  The sandwich is topped with Coleslaw, which added to the overall flavor....very good.A few minutes later came this huge Hot Links Sandwich.....I got in over my head this time....but I wasn't going to let that sandwich beat me.  The Hot Link was very good and again the right amount of BBQ Sauce was in the sandwich.  It is also topped with Grilled Onions & Cheddar Cheese.....yum.  The only thing that could have made it better was if it was spicier.....I like blazing hot Hot Links.The staff was very friendly and helpful too...and greeted us with smiles and when we left said goodbye....nice personal touch.  I took plenty of pics, so check them out.  They also deliver....Will I come back?  Absolutely.I've hungered and gone to Hog's Heaven! I can't believe I haven't reviewed this heavenly place yet! Silly of me! Thanks to my ever so lovely and tasteful girlfriend, I've had the pleasure of partaking of such delicious southern style grubbage! I should warn you that eating here more often will cause addiction and once addiction sets in, you will experience bad withdrawals from the overflowing BBQ sauce!The homestyle greetings from the front cashier, Marsha, already take you out of Las Vegas and into the flavorful and intriguing customs of the South! The walls are covered with components and shout-outs to Hog's Heaven for their return to the mountain side of Centennial Las Vegas. I called in the order one night and spoke extensively to Marsha about what I felt like sinking my teeth into and she suggested the full rack of ribs. I was a little apprehensive on $19.95 for a rack of ribs (12 bones) but the half rack was just a few dollars cheaper and I thought, "If we don't finish it, I'll eat it tomorrow anyway!" Can't have ribs with no sides so I went with Mac n Cheese! My girlfriend and I love their hot link sandwich so we decided to half that as our other side (hey! when we grub, we grub!) and she said their fries were pretty good so we got that with a side of hog sauce (YUM!). My girlfriend remembered that there was a discount for yelpers for 10% off so we smiled even bigger. We phoned in our order so we told them to start cooking 15 minutes after we hung up. Marsha asked about dessert but I politely declined because we had our own waiting. Marsha joked she wanted some of our homemade pumpkin gooey cake but we were serious about sharing :)When we picked the food up, we were kind of sad Marsha was out on a delivery because we wanted to share our cake with her. We also asked the cashier (forgot her name!) if Marsha included the 10% off and she said she wasn't sure and told us to wait for her to do that. That almost threw the positive experience out the door but when Marsha came back, her winning attitude and Southern hospitality totally kicked it back into positive! Not only did she give 10% off, she gave a little bit more for the wait. I hope she enjoys that cake cuz it is SO GOOD! We destroyed half the rack (saved the rest)! Enjoyed the hot link sandwich as always and discovered a new sauce I like: Hog Sauce.I will not only return here, but I will return with an appetite for the rest of their menu! Thanks again, Marsha!
HK Seafood Garden=Past 10pm?  Looking for some cheap food that isn't fast?  From 10pm - closing, you can order off of their lunch menu, where the most expensive item was only $7.50.  When we were initially seated, we were given the regular dinner menus and had to ask for the lunch menu, so be sure to do the same.Our group of five ordered six dishes, totaling $52, and we had left overs!  Salt and pepper shrimp, ribs, chicken wings, hot and sour soup, an eggplant tofu dish, and a noodle dish.  All were delicious and came in generous portions.  Be sure to have friends with you if you're ordering more than one dish!  For any late night dining needs, this is truly one of the better deals I've come across.Not that I hit the nightlife much nowadays, but if my partying cuts short before 3AM (when they close) then I'm for sure making my way to HK Seafood Garden!Nelson & Sylvia Q. tipped us in on the secret reverse happy hour. You won't see it advertised and they sure as heck won't tell you about it. But after 10pm, you can order off the lunch menu. When our group of 5 was seated, they handed us the dinner menus. After inquiring about the lunch menus, I discovered the lunch menu is the dinner menu at lunch prices. Specifically, cheap lunch prices. Dinner entrees wavered around $12-15 and nothing on the lunch menu was over $7.50. Step aside Pho Kim Long, HK Seafood is officially my new spot for post-drink eats.My Chinese of preference is Yunnan / Sichuan style but HK Seafood makes some of the Hong-Kong style classics amazingly. The salt & pepper shrimp, ribs, and chicken wings are awesome. The shrimp are pretty large and fried head-on. We also ordered a hot & sour soup, eggplant w/ tofu pot (my favorite!), and HK-style seafood chow mein. *yum*This is the spot for lunch specials and late night specials. I didn't catch until when is the lunch special offered, but at night they let you order the lunch specials after 10pm. The menu is quite large and all under $7.50. I've never been as it doesnt really stand out outside and is in a shopping center that's easy to drive by and not know what was in there. I came with a group of friends who have been here for late night eats after going to 2nd Chance Prom. We ordered family style - Crispy noodles with seafood - the noodles and veggies were good, but I found the calamari a bit fishy. Eggplant and tofu with garlic sauce hot pot - this had great flavor and liked how the tofu surface soaked up the sauce quite a bitGeneral Chicken - this was actually really tasty. It was prepared in a way that reminds me more of sweet and pungent than most places Tso's and has a nice light crisp to it. Salt and Pepper Shrimp - these were cooked to a crisp to where you can eat the shell and all. I can eat a lot of these. Greens steamed with garlic - simple but good. Gotta have some veggies. It fed 5 people well for under $50 - not bad! I did appreciate that items weren't as greasy as some other Chinese spots open late. It's no frills, quick and cheap food that's pretty decent. If you're looking for a cheap lunch or late night meal then try out this spot. I will be back!A friend told me to check out the Chinese restaurant in China Town.  You know, the one on Spring Mountain.  It's in that strip mall with the Vietnamese place--the one by the Asian Massage Parlor.   The white folks I know seem to be pretty divided on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing when the vast majority of the patrons of a restaurant order food in a language other than English.  One camp argues that the food is more authentic in these establishments.  The other group is downright scared.  With that in mind, some of my friends would be terrified...but don't worry... HK Seafood Garden has a welcoming staff, they serve several American friendly dishes such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, and they'll even offer you a fork if you seem out of place.I recently came in with a group that ordered entirely in Chinese.  That happens often with me these days...the best part was that one of individuals from our table took it upon themselves to walk back to the kitchen, check the cleanliness, and later returned after we ordered to let the chef know not to mess up our order.  If you ask for it, they will bring out house soup for your table.  HK has one of the better versions of this soup that I've tried.I've enjoyed most of what I've shared here a great deal.  Some of my favorites include:Scallops with string beans in spicy xo sauce!Ong Choy w/ Bean CurdHouse Special Stir Fried Thick NoodleChaoZhou ShrimpWhole Fried FishDried Scallop & Mushroom w/ Snow Pea LeafThe group agreed that this is one of the best places in Vegas
Cheffinis Hot Dogs=Cheffinis little hot dog cart is just past the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas. It is the perfect place for a late night rendezvous to stuff a hot weiner between your buns, get it all juiced up with extras, and then open your mouth wide and take as much as you can in to your oral orifice! You may briefly have a gag reflex, but after you relax those throat muscles, the hot splash of flavors in your mouth after a  night of imbibing in adult beverages at the several nearby saloons is like an orgasm in your mouth. You can ask for everything on it, and there is no extra charge, even for pineapples, to sweeten up the flavors gushing in your pie hole. Just a $3 hand job in the mouth. Hard to beat it!Four stars for flavor, two stars for service, averaging to three but they have the potential to improve. CLASSIC CHEFFINIS: Grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalape√±os, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. $6 for a gigantic dog overflowing with toppings that didn't sound like they'd work, but somehow harmonized. Didn't expect to like the pineapple sauce, but I did.MOSHI MOSHI: Grilled frank, caramelized onions, seaweed, jalape√±o, wine sauce, spicy mayo. I love a good Japanese dog, this one was simple. Asked for it sans jalapenos and received a rather sad-looking dog with very few onions, but flavor was good. $7 price tag seems appropriate for the area and toppings.Now for the service. Walked in to one person in line waiting for a drink refill. Through the kitchen window we could see the cook hard at work, but the cashier was nowhere to be found for a solid five minutes and the cook never acknowledged anyone waiting as the line grew to five more people.Eventually the cashier popped up and started handling the customers, but she seemed overwhelmed and flustered, forgetting to box takeout orders and other minor oversights.While walking around downtown, I decided to grab a hot dog from here for hubby and I to share. After placing my order I was told it would be just a few minutes. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for just 1 hot dog because 2 employees were making food for themselves first. El Mexicano ($6.99) - A bacon wrapped hot dog with avocado, tomato, onion, cherry pepper relish, green sauce, chipotle guava and garlic aioli. This hot dog just had way too much going on for me. Everything on it sounded good, but it didn't work all together. The bacon that was wrapped around the dog was very hard and dry. All I tasted once I was able to chew through the bacon was onions and plain mayo. Apparently sides of sauce are .25 cents each and after looking at my receipt I noticed that I was charged .50 cents for 2 sides of extra sauce. I didn't even ask for anything extra I just wanted the hot dog I ordered. Like the bacon, the bun was hard. My total with tax was $8.10 and that's too much for just one hot dog that didn't even taste good.After all the glowing reviews I figured this hot dog joint was going to be my new favorite place. I had a bacon wrapped hot dog and the bun and bacon were both hard. How in the heck can a hot dog alone with no drink or side cost over $8? I could see if it were a footlong hot dog but this was just an average size hot dog. The girls working were nice but I have definitely experienced better hot dogs other places for far less in price and much better in taste.Cheffinis is the stoner's answer to the Hot Dog. Located in Downtown Container Park, attached to the Black Cup Coffee shop. This tube steak eatery provides a different style of dog with available toppings like chorizo bits, pineapple sauce, chimichurri, crushed potato and chipotle guava. Now of course this isn't all on one dog, but a taste of the difference they offer. I ordered the "Grandfather" which is ridiculous. A grilled frank and pork belly, red bell peppers, caramelized onions, crushed potato chips, spicy mayo, basil aioli, pickle mango, topped with a fried quail egg. This was amazing, I loved the pork belly paired with a runny quail egg and the crunch from the potato chips was also nice touch. This was stacked with toppings and I do suggest trying to eat this classic way for at least for one bite, but then grab the fork and knife because it gets messy. The other dog I tried was the "Classic Cheffinis" with, onions, tomatoes, jalape√±os, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. A classic dog, but on steroids, there's no way really to eat this with your hands, there's just too many toppings, but they all taste great together. I really enjoyed the Pineapple sauce with the jalapenos and the fresh tomatoes. The one thing I didn't enjoy was the mozzarella, I usually love mozzarella on everything, but the cheese was cold and not close to being "melty" which would have been much better. Cold cheese and hot food, not a great mix. Good dogs and great area for seating and people watching. Also, the sweet potato fries and fry sauce are the business!
GreenMix=The Valley could use more fresh in and out options like this! While in Downtown Phoenix for a meeting this weekend, lunch hour hit and I needed a healthy meal on the run. Enter GreenMix! As I walked in, I experience a bit of menu anxiety since it was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, the staff was friendly and once they learned I was a first timer, the guy walked me through the steps. I decided to go with a salad, so I first choice the type of greens, followed by four additions from the bowls filled with veggies and cheese. This salad would be $5.99. They also had other bowls full of avocado, eggs, etc. However, those were 75 cents extra per topping. I'm a sucker for avocado so I decided it was work the three quarters. I also ended up adding chicken which was another $2. I ended up walking away with a hefty salad and soda for under $10. It's not cheap, but worth it for a fresh salad topped with added items! I will definitely visit again and keep my finger's crossed that they will open up more locations in the Valley.
In-N-Out Burger=Sometimes it is the simple things in life that are 4 stars. Take In N Out Burger. They have turned dining out into a simple experience. In N Out specializes in three sandwiches: a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheeseburger in addition to fries, Coke beverages, and shakes. It is simplicity in dining that is delicious. In N Out burgers taste freshly made. Missing from In N Out are microwaves and warmer lights.  This past Saturday after exploring Craig Ranch Regional Park and hanging out in The Cannery my brother and I were up for a simple 4 star meal. The Cannery failed at that. It was now 11 p.m. And so we decided to meet up at the In N Out Burger a couple of lights from the Cannery and off the Interstate 15 exit. The abundance of parking and lighting gave me a simple first impression. It was an impression that would develop into a 4 star rating. The restaurant met my standards in cleaniness. The cashier was welcoming. In back of the cashier, the people cooking the burgers were in plain view. I appreciate the fact that customers can see the food being prepared. The time between ordering and picking up the food was 8 minutes. Yeah it wasn't exactly fast food, however, the taste exceeded fast food. An In N Out cheeseburger and fries is worth waiting for. The cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was thick and tasty. I could believe that the burger was not frozen and microwaved. The fries were good, but in my opinion they cannot hold up to Chick Fil-A's or Nathan's.  When it comes to eating out, sometimes I am a fan of  simple dining. I will be checking into an In N Out Burger in the near future.Let me start by saying I love In-N-Out Burger it was love at first bite many years ago when I first discovered these guys. This location was a little disappointing but they still managed to put out a great product. The drive thru seemed to move at a steady pace but the inside was extremely slow compared to other locations I've frequented that were much busier. The inside of the restaurant was about 30% full so the wait time was ridiculous in my opinion I understand they make the burgers to order but 15 minutes for a double double was frustrating. The floors were in the process of being mopped by several employees and were slick and greasy the tables needed to be wiped down and the trash needed to be emptied after all it wasn't like they were trying to recover from the lunch crowd it was about 3:00 PM on a weekday.  No manager in sight so no one was directing the employees or managing the operation. My next trip I will stop at the one off the strip at the bottom of the I-15 ramp off of Tropicana Drive ( I think that's the correct location of the great In-N-Out Burger). I just hope this is not the trend of the In-N-Out Burger chain.
Pork On A Fork=These little piggies come from a small farm in Nebraska still run by the family of one of the co-founders of Pork on a Fork.  Of course, the prices are higher than that you would pay in the mega grocery stores today.  But for me, not only do I get better quality, I get peace of mind in knowing that the little piggies were raised humanely with fresh air and exercise, and they were not pumped full of growth hormones.I ordered the premium package for $50 and received 4 boneless chops (about 6 oz each), a package of 2 ham steaks, a pound of bacon, and a pound of pulled pork (smoked over pecan wood).  Everything is frozen, so you can just pop it in your freezer until ready to use, and everything is delicious.  The pulled pork is the winner for me since all I have to do is heat it!You can order and pay on-line and specify which farmers' market you would like to pick up from (their calendar is on the website).  Couldn't be easier.  Although my first order was put in the wrong freezer and sent to another market, they quickly made up my package on-site and took my word for it that I had already paid.  They also have a restaurant opening this month, I believe, at 15th Ave & Deer Valley Rd!~This is for the restaurant, not the market~ The newly opened building has the wonderful aroma of smoked pork. That alone deserves 4 stars. It is a order at the counter, they put together the meal and you pick it up. They can fit about 25 people and it is clean and inviting. The pulled pork was as great as expected. $ generations of hog farmers know how to raise them pigs. The sides were choice of: beans, Potato salad or coleslaw. The beans are doctored up canned beans with real hunks of bacon....yummy. The Potato salad is said to be homemade but had that strange sweet taste to it. While good it was not great. The slaw looked but but I did not try any. 2 sauces Hot or mild... go for the heat, remmeber they are from Nebraska...it was not hot. LOLThe prices seem reasonable, the staff is excellent. The food is great. Look out for breakfast and Swine and Dines... they are getting a beer license. SUUUU WEEEEE.Reviewing their food for the first time at their new restaurant location in far north phoenix (Deer Valley Airport only USED TO be the boonies), but i've been hearing about their meat for some time now.A delicious smoky aroma gently smacks you around and lulls you into submission once you enter.  A simple menu offers the lunch selection (soon to offer breakfast too). I knew i wanted pulled pork as an entree, and honestly didn't notice what else they had.  The usual side offerings of beans, potato salad, and coleslaw never appeal to me, personally.  I don't fault them for that, but a pickle spear being my only other available side left me feeling less than satiated.  Maybe some french fries, or at least chips?  The pulled pork sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, and the meat was juicy without being fatty.  The bun was simply generic.  Maybe these guys could get into cahoots with a local baker to put their special meat on something a little more worthy?  The sauces offered were "Sweet Mild" (which was both) and "Hog Wild Hot" (which was neither, but still tasty).  Both had a distinct molasses sweetness in a thick tomatoey base, the Hot with a little more spice flavor to it, but not much heat at all.The atmosphere is simple and clean.  Ribs, breakfast, and "Swine & Dine" nights are on the way, according to the owners.Look forward to many more days of coming back to work smelling like a meat smoker !First off, this place is not easy to find...  But that made my trip to find some "porky on a poke" even more interesting and some what of an adventure.  I've been looking forward to eating at their Pork on a Fork dinner after sampling some of their delicious pulled pork at the Town and Country Market. Thanks goodness for that little foldable road side sign stating "Pork on a Fork" ~~ this way...  I found them! You open the door and you're blasted with the awesome aroma of slow cooked pork, smoking in a wood burning oven/smoker.  "What a smell!"  The place is no frills, simple yet very accommodating for people wanting to dine their.  They are a take out or dine in.  They have a small selection of menu items for both breakfast and lunch, mostly pork products.  This is what makes this place unique and awesome!  They are able to focus their efforts on perfecting "porky on a poke" via pulled pork, bacon, ham, brats, polish dogs and beef brisket.  They do offer a variety of side items as well but "no salad for you" here.  Important factoid: They are not open for dinner ~ 7am-3pm only.The service was excellent and ready to answer any questions you may have concerning their menu. I had their pulled pork sandwich which brought the biggest smile to my face after eating it.  In fact I think I'm still smiling and it's been a couple of days ago since I was there, lol! There portion of smoked pork-to-bun was definitely in favor of the smoked pork hands down.  It was a big sandwich and full of tasty, smoky, moist porky goodness which I topped with their Hot BBQ sauce. The side if waffle fries and beans were average at best.  We also had their Spicy Polish which was good but no comparison to their pork. We also had their potato salad and coleslaw which were again just ok.This is a fantastic place for smoked pork sandwiches, ham and beef brisket!  I am looking forward to trying their bacon, BLT or their pork burrito on my next visit. If you're near 19th Ave and Deer Valley, head east about 4 blocks on Deer Valley until you see a little "Pork on a Fork" road side sign and turn in.  You won't be disappointed.What shall  I tell you first?Another great strip mall non descript place hidden in an industrial area. I do have to say they did a great job making the restauarant look clean , inviting and very functional for a very small space. I definitely will be back ...love the smoky flavor of the meat, sweet and throughly washing the meat with flavor  and the sweet pink ring  that makes the meat  and you know its the real  smoky deal. they have lots of choices of sauces but it was juicy and flavorful enough that I could have eaten it without sauce. The flavors were great  all around even my daughter's waffle fries was really tasty. We loved the smoky sweet white BBQ beans. Our friends Paul and Paula ( see Paul I mentioned you ...now write your own darn review)  had brisket and a tasty smoked sausage which looked great and the bites I had were delicious.  Prices are very reasonable and the service was perfect. Look for them at local farmers markets , Friday night dinners (prime and ribs mmm)  and hopefully a bigger site s I can bring my friends.Unfortunately, it's time once again to drop my rating of what used to be one of my favourite restaurants. If this happened at any other place I'd give it a 1 star and permanently avoid on principle, but because PoaF have pretty much the best barbecue I've ever tasted it'll get a flat 3, accompanied by a giant frown of annoyance.So what happened? Did the prices increase like they did at Loving Hut? No. Food quality dropped? No. Still cramped as a sardine tin inside with less than a snowball's chance in hell of getting a seat at lunchtime? Well, yes, but that isn't the reason. This time it's due to false advertising. Several weeks ago they came up with the idea of a loyalty card. Buy 5 meals, the sixth is free. Here's my photo of it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/825nC-s-cQG6Hsul5Gm2cA?select=sSvKMJtwYvgp3PuNafyBsA). Seems pretty obvious how it works, right? Well, last time I was there I reached the free meal marker. I usually get their "Smokin' Meal" menu item - two types of meat, plus two sides and half a sausage. However when I tried to claim the free meal the counter girl informed me that they don't give that particular meal out as free because, quote unquote, "there's so much meat in it". Which equates to about two fistfuls of meat, half a sausage like I said, plus maybe eight ounces in canned baked beans and sweet potato fries. She then tells me that I can get any of the other items on the menu for free, or else she could give me a free drink OR, "say.. three dollars discount". The card didn't say "excludes Smokin' Meal". They brought me there six times and told me the card was frickin next to worthless. Get another menu item for $7 for free, or get $3 off my smokin' meal which is only a couple of bucks more than the items they classify as free? Wow.I'd have been happy to show up here forever and pay their asking price for a meal. But the fact that they pushed off a loyalty card on me then told me to GFY when I tried to claim on it is rank as hell. Fail, lose two stars, Seacrest out. Oh, Seacrest back in for another ten seconds. Went there today, bought the usual, girl didn't offer me another card or mention the concept at all, left. Still delicious; still pissed at them. Seacrest out again.It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)======Smoky Goodness Alert========Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!  Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!  You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning. If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there.I had forgot how long it has been since I have updated a review. Pulled pork piled high on a fresh bun with some good bbq sauce...sounds like a good lunch to me. I have been cutting the amounts of food I eat and opted for the PPS with no sides. There was plenty of meat and bread for a lunch. They have opened the suite behind them to allow for additional seating. To be honest It looks like a kick ass place to have a get together or small party!The staff was great as usual. I appreciate that most of all.My wife & I ordered take out tonight from here we both ordered the BBQ pork burrito with the cornbread as a side. Upon opening the box the aroma of the BBQ pulled pork permeated the room right away. The burrito was very large with a tortilla that was bulging from the pulled pork inside. As my wife & I took our first bites we both looked at each other acknowledging our approval of how delicious the burrito was.  My pulled pork was juicy, well seasoned, incredibly moist and tender with a whole lot of awesomeness. It had an amazing Smokey flavor and the extra side if BBQ sauce was really good. Both meals came with cornbread which was the perfect addition to the burrito. FOOD: Great BBQ - Love the tangy/sweet sauce , The food is incredible. I really enjoyed my meal.  SERVICE:  The staff is always very pleasant. PRICE: The price is entirely on-point.  For the quality of food you receive, which is one of the best BBQ places I've tried in Phoenix. The food is worth every penny...and probably a little bit more.  I have never been disappointed here. CONCLUSION: One of the best BBQ places we have tried.  RETURN FACTOR 100%.       ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
Paul Kitching 21212=This has got to be one of thee least well known out of the very few michelin star restaurants in Edinburgh and I really don't know why?!?! It is set in a lovely big ol' townhouse on Calton Terrace. The interior is understated elegance, which was a relief! Didn't leave me thinking I was massively under-dressed (silly, I know). We sat in the drawing room with a G&T whilst waiting for our table. Lovely surroundings but I was slightly underwhelmed by the Gin selection. Good. But not great.We were then later sat. The dinner room stuck with understated elegance. Big windows infront of the kitchen are always a nice touch. I liked it.I shall not recount every single little thing we ate. But I can tell you one thing - every morsel of food we had here..... was.... incredible. 5 courses of truly incredible food..... with a couple of wee treats inbetween courses. As you would expect. The portions are not massive. But we left feeling very satisfied but not uncomfortably full. There is no better way to end the review. We recieved our bill -  2 years ago I would have been gobsmacked by the price of it. But..... my response was, you know what, that is very reasonable considering it is without a doubt some of the best food I have ever eaten. And that makes it worth every penny. A great treat.
Taco Mac=Taco Mac, seems like an Applebee's menu, wings, sandwiches, burgers and salads.  In fact, those are the words out of Billy's mouth. I thought to myself and said aloud, I do not want to eat here. But we were pressed for time and couldn't go anywhere else.  I joked with Billy, watch the food be fantastic, since I was judging it without even trying it. I realize this is not fair, but it totally seemed like a chain restaurant menu.We ordered a couple of beers off the expansive beer list, where is the Dewey Decimal System when you need it? The beer menu is alphabetical, so if you want to try something new, you have to read the whole column to find the type of beer you would like.  Maybe it should be divided by style, then alphabetical.  No drink specials, booooo.  They only have pint night one week night. We weren't on the right night, so I did not process this information.Billy ordered chips and salsa and a Monterrey chicken salad.( I was going to a movie so I was just going to eat some of his salad.)Copied off menu:Grilled marinated chicken atop crispy romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes, cheddar-jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, black beans, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips.Surprise surprise, the salsa had a nice kick and the salad was really good. The ranch dressing served with the salad was fattalicious! YUMMY.Judging from the remarks from other Yelpers, seems like a place, that you might want to avoid at peak hours.  But to meet a friend, sit outside, drink beer and have a snack, I was pleasantly surprised.Dear Corporate people at Taco Mac, let your servers untuck their t- shirts. Please and thank you.This is bad. This is really bad. I have a place barely a mile from my home that offers 200 bottled beers and 140 beers on tap. They have food. They have outside seating. They have inside seating. They have so many TV sets tuned to sports that you might never miss "a" game, forget about "the" game.None of the distractions like at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, this place is about the beer. Yep, the food is good too. So far, my favorite salsa in Charlotte. Also, the Turkey 'Cue sandwich is good.Parking can be a bit of a pain, since it's Piedmont Row. But that can be conquered. (It's the idiots who put their Chevy Tahoe in a "compact" space that bother me.)Let me know when you're here - I might be here too. :-)
Spotted Donkey Cantina=Muy bien Spotted Donkey! It was by chance that I realized they opened a second location much closer to my house and I couldn't wait to check it out and see if I could finally save gas and still get the same great food. The answer is yes, yes I can! Once you enter Spotted Donkey, you'd never realize you were actually in a strip mall off Hayden. It's cozy with dark wood and a Spanish feel and it's roomy so that you don't feel cramped and like you're on top of your neighbors. The lounge to the left houses several tvs and comfortable seating and the dining room to the right houses several tables for dining. I think this would be a perfect option to bring a large group. The food was excellent and absolutely up to par with the north location. They brought out chips with three different kinds of salsa. Be warned, have your water before you take a bite because if you are a sensitive sally like me when it comes to hot sauce, you will need a sip! For a meal, I went with the Fajitas. I wish I had shared because they were hearty and filling! The only thing that would have made the meal better is if it came with beans and rice, but they did get an extra point in my book for including guacamole with the meal without charging more or having to order it on the side. The traditional margarita was spot on and one I could find myself drinking one too many of. I think the Spotted Donkey is a great option for visiting to have a couple drinks on a weekend night in the lounge, or if you want to have a dinner for two or ten in the dining room. But before I go, I have to mention the only catch of the night. Not a catch enough to make me lower the five star rating, but one worth mentioning. We went there for a leisurely dinner and were definitely not in a rush. We lingered over the menu, ordered a drink and then ordered food. Literally 5-7 minutes after ordering the food, it came out...we literally were in and out in 40 minutes. So...if you are going for a casual lingering dining experience, take your time ordering because if it's anything like my visit the food will come out fast! However, if you need a quick dining experience without sacrificing your food quality, Spotted Donkey is...spot on!Was looking for a Mexican joint on Yelp and stumbled across this place.  Since I was dining solo, I saddled up to the bar to grab some dinner.  I'm so glad I did.....here's why:+ The Cheese Enchiladas rock!  Priced at $14, they're not cheap, but they're damn good!  They have 2 sauces on them....Green and Red....they each have a distinct taste that make the dish explode with flavor in your mouth.  Awesome!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=8bxEWo47aCR19UIK3eh8DgThe sides of Beans & Pickled Carrot Salad is unique and flavorful!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=c_fS-JOQv__lXA4lLY3BRwThese were easily the best Enchiladas I've ever had.+ Decor & Atmosphere.  From what the bartender told me, it's only been open 6 months or so.  The decor is unique...I have no idea how to describe it, otherwise I would....it feels upscale and modern, let's just say that.+ Friendly employees.  Everyone was really nice and offered suggestions on the menu.+ The Chocolate Lava Cake, $8.  Ok, I wasn't going to eat dessert, but the bartender talked me into it....I'm glad he did.  It was freakin' awesome!  However, I will warn you....it' a big portion, can easily feed 2 people.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=hUdZO9aFRVVBbR_9IxQg-Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=fViTAdL3HGNICqHPwuWx9wServed hot and moist, the Chocolate Cake melts in your mouth.....when you slice your spoon through the Cake, the hot Chocolate Lava center oozes out....together with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it makes for an awesome combo!Overall, it was a great experience.  I was told they have 2 happy hours, but forgot the times....it's an early and late schedule for them....so it can cover both early birds and night owls.Return Factor - 100%I was almost ready to give Spotted Donkey the coveted 5 stars, but it occurred to me that I was most likely wanting to give that 5th star because I had not eaten anything resembling Mexican food in over a month!  So reason won and I'm going with a very strong 4.Not your typical menu of tacos and enchiladas smothered with a cup of melted cheese and swimming in grease.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Nothing beats good Sonoran fare in my book.  At Spotted Donkey you will find chimis and enchiladas on the menu, but also cornmeal crusted mahi mahi and pan roasted pork tenderloin.  We started with the chips and salsa.  I have to say I was not all that impressed with the chips.  They reminded me more of a bigger version of Fritos than a thin and crispy chip I prefer.  Served with a trio of salsas, my favorite was the charred tomato followed closely by the green tomatillo.  The pineapple habanero may have been tasty, but one bite and my tongue was so swollen I lost all sense of taste for the next 15 minutes.  My husband managed to eat a fair amount of it, however.  I attribute that to his southern roots and exposure to moonshine at the age of 6.His entree was the chipotle honey-glazed grilled salmon tostada.  With a black bean mango salsa and avocado vinaigrette, it was quite good.  The only thing negative...it was seriously undercooked in the middle.  Had it been mine, I would have sent it back.  I know there seems to be a trend of rare fish being served, but if this was intentional, the server should ask how you would like it prepared.  I smartly chose the mesquite roasted port antojito...like mini tostadas but served on a thicker corn "cake" that is fried.  The pork was perfectly lean, perfectly seasoned, and quickly devoured.For dessert we shared the ancho chile brownie sundae which was served with both hot caramel and hot fudge sauces on the side.  Expecting to prefer the chocolate sauce, I actually did not.  Although it had good flavor, the consistency was off and there was a little separation.  I am not usually a fan of caramel, but this sauce was ridiculously good, with a strong hint of salt coming through.  Had it been served with nothing but a spoon, the dessert still would have worked for me.  The ancho chile brownie was fantastic, although I maybe would have preferred just a touch more of chile in the background.  I would be hard pressed to go back and have any dessert other than this one.I loved the atmosphere at Spotted Donkey, loved the food, and had fantastic service.  The underdone fish was the only reason it didn't make the 5th star this time around, but I would definitely return.
Yummy Yummy Chinese Restaurant=Yummy Yummy Asian Food is now sitting in my tummy tummy.  I thought for sure I'd get the FTR on this one, but Adam and Norman beat me to the punch... I'm always excited to see new restaurants open up in my hood, especially ethnic restaurants.  So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.And when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said 'no' without even entertaining the idea.When I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn't include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn't have fortune cookies?  Anyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the "Health Food Section" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as "yummy yummy," but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  I would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie's, or Lao Thai if you're wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.
9091=I have been stalking 9091 Taco (a play on the Korean "gogi") since they first started revamping the old Sexxxpresso location.   I noticed that they finally looked open for business today when I came into work, so naturally I had to stop by for lunch.Right now, it's walk-up or drive through (possible seating area to come) and their menu even says that they deliver!They do tacos, burritos, tortas, and bibimbap (listed as Bi Bop Salad on the menu).  Some items (at least the Bi Bop and Torta) appear to be served with a side of sweet potato fries.  And to clarify, I mean sweet "potato fries" not "sweet potato" fries.... more on that later.All items come with the protein of your choice (beef, chicken or tofu) and can be regular or spicy.  I asked about the veganness of the bread for tortas, but the guy wasn't sure and suggested I get the tofu Bi Bop Salad, which definitely had no animal products.  (The burrito has sour cream and cheese, but that could probably be left off.)  So, several vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. lots of meat choices, of course.The Bi Bop came with rice, lettuce, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, sprouts and marinated cubed tofu.  Served with a side of gojuchang and a sweet soy sauce and oddly, salsa.  All sauces were very good.  The "salad"didn't look like a whole lot of food, but along with the side of fries, I was pretty full at the end ($8.99 for Bi Bop, comes with fries).  So, the fries - tasty but weird.  They are super super thin cut, like matchsticks.  They are pale yellow like regular potato fries, but very sweet.  Almost like they took regular potatoes and added sugar.  It's probably some kind of yam or something though, because that would be really strange to just sugar up some potatoes.  My friend got the meat torta ($6.99)and gave it a thumbs up.  Bottom line - it was tasty and provides a nice vegan option for a quick lunch that is within walking distance for me.  I will probably be a regular customer.This is what Korean fusion should taste like.I usually like to moderate my expectations for a place that has high reviews. That wasn't the case with 9091. I was expecting great things and that's exactly what I got.They seem to have a pretty simple menu. I went with the Spicy Korean Chicken Burrito ($5.99). It was cold out, so after about a minute there waiting, the guy asks where my car is. I point to the other side of the trailer (is that a trailer?) and he says to wait in my car and he'll bring it to me. Nice!Long story short, that burrito was supremely good. Wow. Like I said, this is what I was expecting Korean fusion to taste like. I'm sorry to say (coz Ron is a nice guy) but it provided that little bit of extra flavor that I was missing from Hanshiktaco.I must return.Wow! It took having my initial review as ROTD to remind me to update.   So, yeah.  I am definitely a regular here.  The tofu tacos ($1.99 ea !) are my go-to quick lunch.  Two tacos (comes with the sweet potato fries) are enough to fill me up.  Sweet soy marinated tofu + lettuces, cilantro, and green onion in two little soft corn tortillas.  Served with the same trio of sauces (soy, gojuchang, salsa) as the bibop salad.  The guys who work there are always so friendly, and it only takes a few minutes to get my food.  Bonus, if you call ahead, they'll have it ready for you!I was happy to see something good took over the old Sexxxpresso location, which I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.This place is so good and so hilarious!  I'll explain.My first trip, I tried the spicy chicken burrito.  It's actually kind of sweet, which I wasn't expecting, but they gave me a bottle of their excellent hot sauce and that solved the problem.  It's super yummy!  It comes with avocado and a big chunk of cotija cheese in the middle.  I know the cotija cheese may sound weird, but is actually really, really good.  I talked to the nice man who took my order and he said they can make the burrito more spicy next time.While I was there, they blasted I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston, More Than Words by Extreme, and the theme song to Annie!  Crazy!  I Will Always Love You has been stuck in my head since.Next time, I tried the beef tacos and ordered them actually spicy. Which apparently means you order them regular but spicy. The tacos were also very, very good.  Overstuffed tacos with lots of cilantro and cabbage.  You can't possibly keep everything in the taco but it makes a nice little salad when stuff falls out and they give you a fork so it's all good!  The friendly man taking orders came out and gave me a mixture of jalapenos, celery, and soy sauce to put on my tacos.  Very yummy and not overpoweringly spicy.The music... they blasted Creep by TLC and, again, I Will Always Love You!  Nooooo!  Just when I got it out my head, now it's back.  :)They are open 10am until 10pm... 9pm during winter.  Closed on Sunday.  This would be a great late night drunk place.  I can totally see myself trashed at 3am belting out I Will Always Love You while eating beef tacos.  But alas, not open that late.  I'll have to start getting drunk during the day.The only thing I didn't really like is the sweet potato strings that come with each order.  Maybe I'm on sweet potato overload since it seems to be so common now.  But the sweet potato strings definitely are not the focus.  Go for the tacos and burritos for sure.  I'll definitely be back. As often as I can.
Nostrano=And now, a love letter. Dear Nostrano, I'm in love. Your space is architecturally stimulating and brings together a carefully thought out blend of wood, metal and glass into a cozy destination right for any engagement. Sitting at the bar is bomb, but the tables are equally pleasant. As for cocktails, your fall tonic is everything I love about autumn minus the crunchy leaves and oblong gourds. It's spicy. It's sweet. It's refreshing. It's deep. Please keep this little guy around. Your orecchiette, ohhhhh your orecchiette. It's firm but not tough and stands up to the amazing blend of brussel sprouts, parsnips and fennel sausage. The fact that it's finished with shaved goats milk cheese makes it (apologies to my favorite house-made pasta and sausage making machine Chef Ginny Wooters) the best... THE BEST I've yet to encounter. And dessert? That's when like turned into love. Take two acclaimed pasty chefs from Chicago and put them under one roof and YOU MUST GET DESSERT, it just has to happen. Priced higher than one might expect, but for good reason. They are visual works of art, and from a taste perspective, dynamic and intriguing. My caram√©lia chocolate cream with raspberries, toasted brioche gelato, hibiscus and smoked almonds was pretty much one of the best desserts I think I've ever eaten. It was incredible. Just incredible. And so Nostrano, I hope this is the start of a beautiful relationship. Keep making unbelievably tasty things and I will forever be in love. Yours today, tomorrow and forever,Corey DI love lamb. Not to be confused with I love lamp.But let's start at the beginning. The marinated olives and sourdough focaccia was the perfect starter. What looks to be normal bread is actually a tasty homemade loaf of deliciousness that you can dip in marinated olives. Who needs a plain plate of olive oil when you can dip it into actual olive juice with tasty olive treats.I was very excited to see Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb rag√π. The pappardelle noodles were fresh and al dente, just the way they should be served. The lamb ragu was incredibly flavorful with the whole dish looking small but being incredibly filling to the point where I couldn't finish it all. But then there's dessert...I was full, but that didn't mean I couldn't indulge in a little sweets action. I mean, c'mon. We ordered up the Affogato (caramel gelato, sea salt, espresso, bombolini). I would have never thought to put gelato in a pool of warm espresso, but hey, that's why I'm an awful baker (and cook for that matter). The gelato ran into the espresso and made a dreamy concoction that could satisfy you alone. But no, there's more. Served on the side are four tiny sugared donuts. Added dipping bonus round! I also thought it was nice that this restaurant doesn't scream Italian. It doesn't have pictures of granny's making pasta or vines of grapes hanging from the walls. It's modern, sleek and clean. Perfect for lunch, dinner or dessert. Like... you should go in for all three because you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't!Truly a fine dining experience here every visit. Madison is fortunate to have such a lovely restaurant.Locally sourced ingredients, and a nice balance of interesting dishes that include rarity items like wild game sausage. I love that they make every dish a unique blend of ingredients.Really, though, don't we all visit here for the desserts? I've read the chefs are married and the better half of this dynamic duo is baking her amazing creations downstairs while he runs the main kitchen, which you can catch glimpses of from the bar.I have but one complaint, which is they do not have decaf espresso. I realize this is an oxymoron for many who may read this review, but there is a famous dessert with caramel gelato, swimming in espresso, in which I would love to indulge, but the caffeine would put me over the edge. My server says many patrons request decaf. It is unfortunate they cannot oblige.Oh, and we also visit for the clever craft cocktails and creative mixologists.A recent visit during Madison Restaurant Week, winter 2015, proved to be a lovely way to spend part of a dreary afternoon enjoying a 3-course, perfectly portioned lunch, for only $15.Finally, I will mention some folks will find the menu a bit intimidating. I admit I usually Google at least one listed ingredient during each visit. I suggest jumping into the menu with both feet. You will not be disappointed!Returned to Nostrano last night with part of the ladies progressive dinner. I picked Nostrano because of the excellent experience that I had before. This time, I was embarrassed that I suggested the place. While the dessert was as good as I remembered it, the service was odd and occasionally downright rude. Our server did not know the menu and all we were having was dessert and drinks. He couldn't answer questions about drinks, such as "What is this?"  He recommended a drink for another in our party and described it as smooth and extremely palatable. When it arrived, it was anything but smooth, instead it was extremely medicinal and sharp. This is fine if that's what you were expecting but she was not. We also had people in our party that has some dietary restrictions and they were really unaccommodating. For example, I ordered the Affogato and asked to go easy on the espresso as I'm pregnant. He told me flat out no. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes. He did offer to serve it on the side, however I was just stunned. For such a lovely establishment to be so unaccommodating. It was more like the service that you would get a Dick's Last Resort. You know, where you pay them to be mean to you.When I have been to Nostrano on a weekend night, when they are much busier, I have received exceptional service. It seemed as if they have their B squad out on week nights. I'm still disappointed thinking about it. In short, I felt like an inconvenience the entire time I was there and like they don't want my business.
BabyStacks Cafe="RED VELVET PANCAKE?  OH...HELL NO!"The menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=L04CYf9iZEDwFairvDQFIQWhen I saw that popular item on the menu, I did actually shout out loud and created a troubling scene in front of many patrons and a dirty look in front of the owner, who was also there dining with her family.After that unnecessary outburst, I settled down and ordered the full stack of the Red velvet Pancake for $7.95. The full stack of the red color pancake had six red slices with mini chocolate chips, a thick cloud of whipped cream as the topping and two cups warm cream cheese syrup on the side. My pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=3ms4kj7wayMeLFKfxJpb1QI got to tell you that this cute little caf√© is one-hour away from downtown Las Vegas; the red velvet pancake is definitely worth the drive. I have never had any pancake as good as this. The whipped cream is thick and the cream cheese syrup is very unique and adds the exciting taste. This caf√© is only open for breakfast and lunch. The caf√© is also located west of the Las Vegas medical facility. The one-hour drive is definitely worth it. And I might do it again and try the other flavored pancakes and American and Filipino cuisines.I was skeptical this place would live up to the hype, but OMG did it ever! The 30 minute drive from my house, the 40 minute wait, all freaking worth it. This will never be a regular spot for me (5000 calories for bfast isn't a habit I need to get into!), but for a special breakfast this is the best place I've been off the strip in Vegas (sorry, Bouchon is still my overall fav!). They get major props for letting you pay a minimal charge to upgrade to the "specialty' pancakes when ordering any of the egg dishes. Honestly the smaller (2?) portion of these sweet things is perfect and it's nice to have an egg dish AND a dessert to go with it ! I had the breakfast burrito (special from the chalk board) and red velvet pancakes. The breakfast burrito wasn't much of a burrito (well not in a stupidly huge Chipotle sense), but more of a large taco. This was absolutely perfect for me - huge burritos are a turn off and I don't like the ingredient ratio you get with this burrito the size of your face. Burrito (bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes) was perfect, but the red velvet pancakes did steal the show! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Ridiculously fluffy, perfect red velvet flavor - you must try these !My husband has a certain fondness for chicken fried steak and sausage gravy. He's tried it everywhere here in town from Tiffany's to all the casino diners. He's always bummed that it's not nearly as good as what he's used to from TX. This place was by far the best we've had in Vegas and might be better than any in TX as well. The steak was tender (not chewy and gross), the batter was nice, and OMG the gravy was perfect. It seemed to not be frozen, or they buy an incredibly high quality frozen product - either way, they fooled me. Tasted homemade! He had the smores pancakes that were tasty, but not nearly as good as the Red Velvet!!I never thought I'd find a local place with BETTER pancakes than my favorite (Oreo Banana Pancakes at Bongo Room in Chicago, btw), but honestly they were! I'd put this breakfast spot up against any diner, anywhere. I'd love to see them add some coffee drinks to the menu (oh and expand to Henderson!).Came to pay another visit to this up and coming spot!  I kept blabbing about the red velvet pancakes to my girl and  convinced her that it was worth a try (she's not much of a foodie.. yet!) Got here before noon and was seated right away. I couldn't help notice this lady that was seated right next to me. She looked so familiar.. Well, it was my first invited friend on Yelp! She provides some of the most interesting reviews: Blair B.! Hi Blair! And Megan S., nice meeting you as well! What a small world..The Belly Pleasers:Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Came neatly plated, corned beef was the typical canned stuff but for being canned, it was satisfying. I must note that I do prefer the real stuff (shredded/chunky) but their stuff did have a slight advantage over almost identical looking corned beef I've eaten at other places before. There maybe something with the oil the cook it in or some special seasoning they throw on there?! I also decided to try their seasoned potatoes. They looked plain but once again, they were tastier than I expected. Results, Nothing over the top but I was happily filled up!*Chicken Fried Steak with Hash, still Reigns Supreme!Carrot Pancakes: I wanted to try something different, since my girl ordered the obvious red velvet pancakes that she wasn't gonna finish and scoot over my way anyways.. The carrot pancakes came with the same cream cheese syrup, nuts sprkinkled on top, had the same texture as the velvets and tasted good, borderline great.. BUT in no way compared to the Red Velvet Pancakes!!Red Velvet Pancakes: my girl ordered the short stack (3 pieces). She took a few bites but didn't really express her emotions much but I could tell by her facial reactions that it was captivating! She finished more than half the order, more than I expected and said "they were delicious! I really liked the little sprinkled mini chocolate chips and the whipped cream".. Another happy customer :).. Round 2: Everything was pretty much as Great as the 1st Time!Oh my it was brunch time and still crackalizing! If you didn't understand that, it was packed! I wouldn't really suggest coming here in groups bigger than 4. Although, I'm sure you can it'll jus be a longer wait. I ordered the Kalua pig Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the adobo omelette. And together we ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes as a dessert. That's how we get to try a little bit of every goodness. The kalua Benedict was perfect the way it was made. The yoke breaking over the meat and the crispy edges of the meat added a smokey hint to it. I tried some of the adobo omelet and it was good, but I've had bigger for the same price at aloha kitchen. On the other hand, the macaroni salad that came with it was unique with it's hint of crab meat. The red velvet pancakes was the perfect puzzle piece for my belly's satisfaction with it's sweet cream cheese syrup. The service was on point and friendly. The parking is plenty. Be aware, it's disguised in an industrial area.I am most certainly filled and ready to come back to try the s'more pancakes.I am not usually a fan of pancakes, but this changed my mind wholly! The best breakfast place I've ever tried, and the most creative! Everyone must try the Red Velvet Pancakes once in their lives! It's a must!!! Ps. Be sure to have patience on the day of because there might be a waiting list for a table!Stopped by to grab some lunch with my Mom the other day.  I've read many of the Yelp reviews raving about the Red Velvet Pancakes and had to experience this for myself.  Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.I ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).The food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.I then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.Mom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.Our server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.Will I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me.....When Babycakes Cafe first opened in October, we were invited to join the Husband's cousins in experiencing this new breakfast joint.  Unfortunately, we couldn't make it out that morning but heard raving reviews from them and soon after, it was blowing up on Yelp!  It's been on our radar since, and when a groupon for Babycakes showed up, we scooped up on this coupon!Yesterday was the big day - most importantly, we wanted to avoid the weekend rush.  Reviews about an hour long wait weren't something we were interested in, and luckily, it was only a ten minute wait for our party of three on a Wednesday around noon.We decided to share three items that were unique to Babycakes Cafe than other breakfast joints in town.* Red Velvet Pancakes "Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles.  Served with cream cheese syrup." (Full stack $7.95, Short stack $5.25) - First off, I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes and it's not my first choice in breakfast.  But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice! * Kalua Pig Benedict "A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce." ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though. * Rick's Adobo Fried Rice "A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions." ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.Overall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.Service - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups.The cousins and I ordered:1.)  RED VELVET    7.95 (FULL) 5.25 (SHORT)Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup.This tasted super delicious.  It wasn't too fluffy nor was it heavy.  Normally when I eatpancakes from other establishments, I feel very heavy.  The combination of the whipped cream with the chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup blended well together.2.)  RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE  8.50A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.I thought it was just okay.  I wasn't too much of a fan with the egg since it had no flavor to it.  My cousin said that because the Adobo Fried Rice already has enough flavor, to add sodium to the egg would just possibly be too salty.  I think I would just like the Adobo Fried Rice without the egg wrapped around it.3.)  KALUA PIG BENEDICT  9.75A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and our delicious hollandaise sauce.This was my favorite.  I would come back here for this because I just love Eggs Benedict.  The taste of the Kalua Pig gave it a flavor that matched well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  A lot of people on Yelp felt that it was too bland.  I found adding some salt to the dish pepped that up.  4.) NUTELLA CREPES  8.25 plain or 9.25 (with seasonal strawberries)Nutella mixed filling spread topped with fresh whipped cream and almonds.  This was definitely a great way to end our meal.  It wasn't too overpowering with the Nutella and had the right amount in the crepe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but this was well done.  It doesn't look too hard to make.We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)-Red Velvet-S'Mores-PB & Jelly-Lemon Ricotta-Carrot Cake-Bacon Pancakes-Whole Wheat~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself "Why cabbage?" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!! A Hui HoRED VELVET PANCAKES with whip cream and mini chocolate chips!! I'm a sucker for red velvet pancakes!Finally went to Babycakes this past Friday :DMy friend/high school classmate was visiting from Florida so I wanted to take him to a yummy breakfast spot! I've been wanting to try Babycakes for the last 2 months and have been waiting for someone to visit me in town so I could experience Babycakes with someone else. I didn't realize that Babycakes is 8 miles north of me... but it was worth the drive!Came in around 10am... no wait.We both ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice... I got the red velvet pancakes and my friend got the white chocolate chip mac nut pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and you can't go wrong with the local favorite portuguese sausage eggs and rice.I would love to come back again... when more friends visit me in town again. Pay your bill at the counter. casual dining. stress free parking. good customer service.If you're visiting Vegas or a local... make Babycakes on your to eat list!I'll be back for more!!!Aloha...-Miss Yelp 2011Are you of Filipino or Asian descent....and you want some pancakes? Well then, Babycakes Cafe is for you!  The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?Babycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your "What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.We meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!I just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.On to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  The food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!Babycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!We'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?Go here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.  Another reason to visit sooner!Bookmarked forever.  Read a ton of reviews.  It's like a group mantra.  RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP RVP.We were so excited to finally come here and it lived up to the hype.  Got the large stack of RVP and an order of their homemade corned beef hash which came with eggs and home fries along with a short stack of S'mores.  Is this breakfast or dessert?Holy pancake overload, Batman!  Everything was delicious.  My wife said it was the best corn beef hash she had ever eaten.  We finished everything and went into a  total food coma.  3pm turned into nap time and I don't think we had dinner that night.  Not sure if it was the carb overload or the sugar crash or both but wow.I'm gonna do something eggy next time with a short stack so it doesn't kill me for the rest of the day.  This place is definitely worth the trip though.  Friendly staff!It's too bad my new favorite breakfast place is in Nevada.  I'll have to visit this place every time I'm in Vegas.  It's worth waking up for.  It's worth driving to.  And it's worth the wait.  Everything I tasted was phenomenal. The Red Velvet Pancake was out of this world!  The cream cheese syrup with buttery whipped cream really made this velvety pancake unforgettable.  I can have this for breakfast everyday! I thought their Rocky Road pancake would be too sweet.  It was perfect! Impressive that almonds and marshmallows were inside the chocolate batter as well as on top.As a peanut butter fan, I went bananas for my PBand??? pancake.  With peanut butter in and out of the pancake, I can taste how any topping would go well with this pancake.  Elvis would be proud!  He'd probably be here everyday too!  I had an omelet with ground beef, bacon, cilantro, and green onion.  It was like a marriage made in heaven.  Every flavor came out and I enjoyed every bite!  The Adobo Fried Rice was amazing too.  With marinated shredded chicken mixed with rice AND wrapped in four eggs, this unique omelet is definitely something to brag about.  Service was flawless, even with a long wait.  Their large size cups are ingenious for less frequent refills (for water, orange juice, soda).  But the coffee kept coming.    Can't wait to come back for more of their fresh pancake creations and other breakfast specialties.I've been a few times with the BF since my initial review and it's slowly crept up into a favorite breakfast spot for us. Firstly, I'm a Filipino so any place that has steamed or garlic rice is cool by my standards. This is a cool inbetween middle of Hawaiian breakfast and American style breakfast that is similar to what we would have at home. It's the varied options that bumps this place for us. I cannot eat pancakes alone for breakfast as it just is too much, too sweet, so it never seems worth it for us to get a full order at many places and they don't do short stacks of flavored ones. Here, many of the breakfast come with a option of a "babystack" (2 pancakes) and you can upgrade it to the many gourmet flavors for just $1.50 more. That amount with a savory breakfast seems perfect and costwise is great to get breakfast AND the flavored pancakes for under $10. Most places we would have to basically order pancakes as our third entree plate and that's usually too much to eat without others sharing.I tend to favor their omelettes, as they are pretty fluffy and a good size or I let my Filipino all hang out and get a simple breakfast eggs and sausage type plate with rice.Our go-to pancake flavor is the lemon ricotta. This one is a bit more crepe or german pancake like and is just very light in flavor. Lemon flavored sweets is a new thing for me, and this place definitely has helped convert me We normally get another rich flavor to contrast. However, the chocolately type pancakes here are not overly saccharine and dense. We had a almond joy flavor recently off their specials and it was fluffy, and just deliciously balanced. Nothing richly sweet like the chocolate bars. Chocolate pancakes is one of my least favorite kinds, but theirs is highly enjoyable for me. I've had their famous red velvet before, and honestly, every other flavor I've had surpassed that one so don't be afraid to delve out of the box. Service has been pretty decent of a range of acceptable to great. It's always at least friendly consistently. We go during the afternoon mostly, so it's never been a wait but is busy. I'm not sure if this place is packed with a waiting during usual breakfast hours on weekends, but I imagine so. If you don't like waits, well breakfast at breakfast time is maybe not a good thing to do.I have yet to try some of the specialties like the kahlua benedict, but mostly because I have trouble thinking about coming here and not getting a pancake. They sound great though that it just might be worth it! In fact, I think I may go this weekend again. I've been on a big breakfast kick lately since we've been waking up early.I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the "Banana Cream Pie" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on "Carot Cakes" and "PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested "Portuguese Sausage And Eggs". He said they have a "Garlic Rice" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. They have a great kids menu at affordable prices.Please don't hate me, but I think BabyStacks is a bit over-rated.  It is a good diner but I don't think it blew my socks off at all.I have heard a lot about BabyStacks and I am always reminded when I drive past it at least once a week.  I am a devoted patron to a different local breakfast dinner and usually go there for breakfast.  We wanted to try something different, so we headed over to try BabyStacks.Our first mistake was getting there at 10:30am on a Sunday.  Oops and here comes a 45 minute wait.  That was self-inflicted pain, but we dealt with it.  Since we had a long wait, we had already checked out the menu and figured out what we wanted.  The menu has a lot of variety and definitely something for everybody.  This is always nice because I know we can never agree on food at my house.  They have your normal breakfast items like egg dishes, biscuits and gravy, and of course a multitude of pancake choices.  They also have a decent lunch menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  On top of all of that, they have Hawaiian food on the menu.  Like I said, something for everyone.I wasn't in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat, so I went with Loco Moco.  It was good, but not great.  It totally hit the spot for my craving, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It came with a side of mac salad and it was really pretty bland, in my opinion. The first time I had Loco Moco was in Maui, so I am probably ruined since I compare everyone's version to the first one, and few compare.   So it was good, but not great.My hubby got a breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage.  It was a huge burrito and he was only able to eat about 2/3 of it.  It also came with a side of regular pancakes.  The pancakes were ok, but again, nothing special.  Overall, his breakfast was ok and pretty average.My mini me got the kid's grilled cheese and it was an awesome grilled cheese.  It was super gooey and overflowing with cheesy goodness.  Now I know what you are going to say, "Why didn't you try the fancy, smancy pancakes?" Well, I wasn't in the mood, so there.  Maybe this is why I am only giving it a 3 star rating and didn't get my socks blown off..  We do plan on checking it out again when we are craving pancakes and maybe it will be better next time.  For just regular breakfast food though, I think I will stick with my go-to place around the corner.  Based on this experience though, everything was ok.  The service was ok, the food was ok, and the prices were ok.It's been a while since my last visit so I was enthusiastic to return to BabyStacks Cafe. I was headed  west to visit a client so this was the ideal to have some bfast. I was greeted and seated immediately but unfortunately I had to flag a waitress down to finally place my order for coffee and a Kula pig Benedict. When my entree arrived I sampled the benedict which was stellar! The kula pig had a smoked flavor and contained green cabbage which harmonized superbly with the medium cooked eggs and hollandaise sauce.I also noticed they offer Loco moco on the menu. My mouth is watering while writing this and looking forward to returning!Don't be scared off by the ridiculous wait times: we were told it would be 45 minutes, but we were seated in 15! Service is friendly and quick, but once they give you your bill make sure you head to the front to cash out- the servers don't do that part.KAHLUA PORK BENEDICT: Didn't care for the cabbage, found the pork itself a little bland, but somehow all the flavors together really made a great dish. Wish the potatoes had just a touch more seasoning, but they were perfectly crisp.HUNTINGTON SKILLET: Seasoned potatoes topped with over-easy eggs, bacon, cheese, pico de gallo, AND avocado?! It's a party in your mouth, no additional seasoning needed. WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES: These are so sweet, you wont even need the syrup. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish a short stack they were so sugary. Didn't detect any macadamia flavor or crunch, though.GARLIC RICE: Love how fragrant this dish is! Smelled it cooking and had to have some, definitely tempted to upgrade to the adobo fried rice next visit.The thing that really amazed me was that none of the food we received was unnecessarily greasy, a common issue with breakfast/diner food. If you want to come here, better to go early (before 10) or wait til lunch- the place really cleared out by 11:30AM. Really liked the friendly island-style service, want to come back for the Kahlua grilled cheese.
Jamburritos Cajun Grille - Express=Y'all don't know good eatin' 'til you stopped at Jamburritos!  My tastebuds died, went to heaven.  I'm a southerner.  I DO NOT, I DO NOT, order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south.  It just doesn't happen.  Something about folks in other states putting beer batter or breadcrumbs or  flour based breading on it that runs me outta the restaurant.  But I figured, this Mex-Cajun fusion way would  be something to try.  I ordered a fried catfish jamburrito... that's fried catfish, with jambalaya (2 staples in my kitchen) and all the other fixin's of a burrito.  I got the fire hot sauce on the side and I also ordered up the hush puppies.  They had Faygo pops (yep, I said "Pops", that's cause I'm from the South.  If you're from other southern regions, you might call it a "cold drink".) That took me back years to my childhood and I ordered up the orange Faygo.  Whoop Whoop!  So, what does this southerner say?  They killed it.  The hush puppies were absolutely delicious.  A bit on the small side in comparison to what I'm accustomed to having back home.  But exactly the taste you want in a hush puppy!  WOW.  I'm bringing my mom to the truck, I bet she hasn't cooked hush puppies since I was a kid.  The Jamburrito was something out of this world.  The taste of the jambalaya in every bite of the catfish was an amazing mixture of spiciness with the delicious cajun flavor of the rice.  And don't forget that there's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito.  The lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce.  if you don't like spicy, don't get the hot sauce on yours. Here's a pic of my plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix?select=xh1Ac9X35EPQywGj9QZbnA#7gSc9b6Jr19CHMRtb40tmAWhat a creative fusion of the Mexican burrito and cajun food.  I was so satisfied and  thrilled with the tastes and flavors.  I have to go back and try their friend crawfish and perhaps some other things that will take me down the Mississippi river of memories... Bravo Jamburritos!  Bravo.
Graze=The wife and I dined here for dinner on 8/9/11. Ordered Fried Pickles ($4) and Pork Buns ($6) for appetizers, the Graze Burger ($19!!) and the Burger of the week ($15), fries with both entrees.This was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity-est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal.First impressions- No reservations needed- cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy- very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor- seemed like they were trying for an artsy/modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. Service was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry & we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally.  After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good.  The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet (on Broadway) back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again.  The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'.  At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees.After what felt like forever (but was probably about 30 more minutes), our burgers & fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries.  My burger was the Graze burger (fresh ground sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche) The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun & caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese (even though we are in the dairy state), but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste & texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the $19 hamburger. $19!! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way.The wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast.  She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. I know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do- the french fries were very good. So there you have it. $46.42 (after tax)  for some darn good fries. Not what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. An expensive lesson learned.Oh Graze.Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze. When we met, I was certain I was going to like you. I needed to have brunch, cocktails, dinner then lunch, cocktails, cocktails and cocktails, but I was pretty certain after my first trip we'd be close. And we are. I love the space; modern, but not annoyingly so. I love the situation behind the bar; boozy drinks that are "spirit forward" (heeeeey Tom). Bevies please those with a hankering for sweet or spicy and they don't cost an arm and a leg. (I mentioned they're boozy, yes?) Oh, and the food I've had their has been ta-heh-sty.Burger = YUM. YUM. Perfectly cooked, hard to find... I find in Madison. Corned Beef Hash = Hash yeah!Fish Fry = Panko? Yes, please. Chicken Skewers = Perfecto!Anything on the cocktail menu! Anything.Fried Pickles = Huuuuuuuuge deliciously breaded fried bits of joy. Service is always awesome. ALWAYS. And although it can be a little while for a table at din-din, staff is super nice about keeping you informed re: the wait sich. I'm going to miss sitting outside on the patio while it's cold, it's lovely out there.As an out-of-towner whose knowledge of Wisconsin is confined to the Mars Cheese Castle, (where you'd think there would be a king and queen, but nope, not even a prince) A&W Root Beer, (in the tall frosty mugs of course) and Culver's... this trip to the midwest is to discover some of the best the region has to offer (and to attend a wedding).Upon the recommendation of a college buddy of mine that now resides in Madison, I decided to check out Graze.  With an impressive dedication to local sourcing and regional ingredients, this restaurant across the street from the capitol is clean, chic, and well-managed.I checked in at the hostess stand and requested a table for two.  They did a good job managing expectations, let me know it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  We were seated in about 30 minutes.We got a booth and were immediately waited on and served water.  Our appetizer order was taken right away since we knew what we wanted, a very good sign.  Our waters were never less than half filled and the service was impeccable.  Not too much attention, not too little.Coming into Wisconsin, I had two must-haves, cheese curds and fried pickles.  This meal would satisfy both those cravings.We started with the Fried Sassy Cow Cheese Curds, a quintessential Wisconsin food.  Deep fried and ooey gooey delicious, these vodka battered treats hit the spot after flying for 12 hours.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7EbwThen came the fried pickles, always a winner.  Although not spears, these were very thick cut chips, good enough.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ybbedyV4NXfunWXFYd4QZQOther yelp reviews guided me to the seasonal punch.  This did not disappoint.  This season's concoction is peach mixed with Door County Vodka.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ndQ7vK4Ilig01Tt0eNlnKQNext we had a taste of Korea in Chicago.  Wait. What. Korean food in Chicago? Dat don't make sense.  But it was pretty good.  I feel the regional ingredients really help this dish out (and a generous helping of kochujang sauce).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#qEI2dTuN_t_7AbVR0wO35ABut let's be honest.  The star of the show here is the $21 Graze Burger.  Yes, you heard me right, I paid $21 in the midwest for a burger.  Ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye and short rib, with caramelized onions, a cabernet jus, a sesame seed brioche, and some fries. Daaaaamn this was delicious.  Call me a heffer, I will GRAZE on this all day.  Although the price was steep, best burger of my life.  Hand's down.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#bxmvvO3M7cCWfgMaH_2kSwA great way to start off #ChuggyEatsMidwest2013 on IG and Twitter.  Off to the next recommended eatery!Graze is one of the most acclaimed restaurants in Madison, with very good reason. It's the less formal (and less expensive) sister restaurant of L'Etoile, which is right next door, and just steps from the Capitol. Graze (so named for the farming aspect as well as what the menu inspires guests to do) is less formal, but just as much creativity and attention to detail go into everything on the menu. It's the kind of place you'd go just for drinks or food, and stay for the other. During a recent thirty-six hour stay in Madison, we went twice; once for early-evening cocktails and snacks, the other for a mid-afternoon nosh. It was close to our hotel, but proximity aside, we went back because we just enjoyed it that much.I can't say enough good things about the fantastic food and terrific cocktails. Over the course of two visits we were able to sample quite a bit of the menu and there wasn't anything we didn't love. On the evening visit we tried Sassy Cow cheese curds with a vodka batter; deviled eggs, house-made pickles (beets, cucumbers, escabeche, daikon, kimchee), truffled popcorn, frites with garlic aioli, and fresh oysters with just-grated horseradish. Everything was eminently enjoyable. My cocktail of choice was the 'Herb 'n Cruise,' a tasty concoction of New Amsterdam gin, Lillet, basil simple syrup and lemon. It was so smooth and drinkable. Later on I switched to a non-alcoholic seasonal lemonade and this week's flavor was blueberry-rhubarb. So fruity and refreshing!On the second visit, they were still serving their brunch menu so we just shared a lox and bagel plate (and more of that delicious lemonade!) and that too was top-notch. The bagel was an "everything," the cream cheese was flecked with bits of fresh lemon zest and dill, and the lox was in the shape of a rosette. On the side was a tiny dish of capers and red onion. It was a lovely presentation and tasted as good as it looked.The servers here are some friendly folk and took great care of us on both visits. The menu changes seasonally and it goes without saying that all the ingredients are locally sourced.Graze is now on our "must-visit" list for frequent trips to Madison.My go to spot for brunchGraze has won me over.  My first couple visits were less than memorable - I could see the potential in the menu, but the execution left something to be desired.  But over the past year, the consistency kitchen and the service has improved considerably and Graze has been coronated as The Emperor of Madison Brunch until further notice.  After a recent trip to the Madison Farmer's Market, my wife and I decide the dodge the rain drops and grab some morning vittles (and libations).  There are a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to set up camp at the bar.  The bartenders promptly welcomed us and took our drink order.   I tried the Retox (Cacha√ßa, Maple Syrup, lemon juice, cayenne) and my better half went with the Bloody Mary.  At first I was neutral on the Retox, but it eventually won my over as the Cacha√ßa (a liquor made from fermented sugarcane juice) cleared the fog from a soggy slog around the square.  The Bloody Mary was a little heavy on the horseradish for my taste, but my dining companion was very impressed.As for the culinary component, I elected to try something new and ordered the Chicken-Fred steak.  Instead of the usual cream-based sauce, this version had a excellent brown sauce with a hint of sage which complimented the steak, which was top notch, it had a nice crunch, but not greasy.  The rest of te dish was satisfying as well.  Some lightly dressed grape tomatoes, crispy hash browns and two eggs easy over that were perfectly executed.    Portion size was just right - I cleaned my plate and felt satiated, but not bloated.  We finished off our brunch date with an order of the beignets, and their pillowy goodness was the perfect finish to an excellent meal.While the meal was a bit on the pricey side for brunch ($55 for two drinks, two entrees and a dessert), we both felt the value of the meal exceeded the price.There have been some complaints about the service at Graze, but the bar staff was courteous and attentive during our meal.  Despite a full house in a relatively open space, the noise level was not too bad - it was easy to carry on a conversation.I also appreciate how Graze uses locally sourced products from area farms to create its menu.  As long as they can continue to effective execute the vision of Chef Tory Miller, they will continue to be my go-to option for brunch.We were here for lunch on a Thursday, right when they opened at 11 - first customers! (We were literally standing outside the door waiting for them to open shop :)I went with the Korean Rice Bowl, which consisted of a glazed pork belly, kimchee (fermented Korean-style vegetables), mini cool cucumbers, and peanuts. It tasted decent. I think that I may have liked how it looked, more than how it tasted. The kimchee was a little too pickley/salty-tasting for my liking.We also ordered their famous Pub Burger that's served on a house-made english muffin with bacon and cheddar cheese. That was definitely yummy.The farmer john's sandwich of ham and provolone cheese with sliced apple, spinach, and basil pesto mayo on sliced baguette was pretty good, as was the soup that came alongside (can't remember what it was...it was the special of the day).The overall atmosphere of the place was great. Very clean, updated, and cheery with the natural light from State Street shinning in. Their hot tea selection is plentiful and the Rishi brand that they sell is quality.  Our waiter was very accommodating and considerate as well.I hope to try out their offerings for brunch sometime soon as I hear that's pretty good!A big fan or Tory Miller and what he's done for the Madison foodie scene, I was pumped when he opened this place!  Killer spot on the square with awesome views and fresh urban "farm to table" type decor.  The focus is just good quality seasonal food!  We had the pickle sampler for an appetizer and it was fantastic, inventive, and fun.  The graze burger was out of this world, and I had the pulled pork macaroni and cheese which was equally amazing.  The last time we visited I felt like they were short staffed so I will give them a little lee-way on timely service, but the quality was there.  The bartenders are always great with an ever changing drink menu...and the bar area is a great place to see and be seen!Corey D and I headed here for a late-ish dinner during my quick trip to Madison and boy, this place was hoppin'! With good reason I see... The food is delish, the service is friendly, the drinks are creative, and starting at 9 pm Sundays through Thursdays they have a buy 1, get 1 happy hour. I had fried pickles, cheese curds, and a beet salad and I would be a happy camper to return here and eat again. Bonus: they have wine on tap which is always a good thing in my opinion.Definitely well worth a try if you are in Madison and looking for good food + good drinks.Best cheese curds in Madison. Hands down.Best brunch in Madison??? Perhaps!Man, I'm lovin me that fried chicken and waffle. Chicken. Waffle. Perfection.But dude the seasonal fruit pancakes with apple cherry compote and cinnamon butter....umm, I'll take an extra order to go...If you're feeling traditional, don't worry you can get your eggs and bacon. Uh huh.I was feeling indecisive amongst my Madison bookmarks and proferred the wife to make a selection amongst my selections. I hardly had to spit out the word Graze and its connotations before she made that her choice. I didn't complain; a bit of homework led me to understand that Graze is run by a Bearded chef. That's Beard, as in James Beard. Shaken, not stirred.Graze sits a modest, modernist glass case of emotion directly across from the Capitol. It's connected to its sister restaurant, the starry-eyed named L'Etoile. The view from either is quite spectacular.Of course, a place that calls itself Graze screams farm to table, though exactly what farms are left unclear by the menu. The menu, like the chef-owner, has a Korean slant to it, with Wisconsin farm overtones. It also has a $21 burger purported to be one of the best in America.It is perhaps unfair that I had just eaten the best burger in Chicago, the meticulously simple concoction at Au Cheval. So, and especially for a Jackson plus Washington, there was barely a chance for Graze's burger to equate. Graze's burger is good, and there are parts that are great--the tangy caramelized onions, the delicious on-the-side aioli, and the wonderful fried egg I stole from my wife's bibimbap bowl.Here's where it falls short. The first is the at times delicious and at other times overtly sour-acidic patty. It's a combination of bacon, sirloin, ground beef, and short rib, and if you just drooled on your phone or computer screen a little, it's OK. That all sounds as mouth-watering as it should, but the patty was a little too big, didn't hold together well enough, and was splashed with just too much Worcestershire-cabernet jus, killing the proper taste of the meat. The second is the fact that the burger plain done fell apart, whether from too much jus, too much meat, or my daft idea that a stolen fried egg would be the cherry on top. Burgers. Shouldn't. Fall. Apart. Period. (And if they do, as in they are meant to, you had better dang well wrap the sucker in white paper first.)Extremely high expectations for the burger aside, the meal went really well. The cheese curds, a delicacy we had to order, this being Wisconsin and all, were fantastic. Special kudos to the house ranch that tasted a mite like tartar sauce, a plus for me. The pickle board was also a great deal of fun, with six different pickled plates ranging from kimchi to beets in a citrus vinaigrette. Yes, kimchi--remember the Korean thing. As we hadn't had Korean food during our duration in Chicago, now approaching eight months, the wife narrowed in on the bibimbap bowl. The gochujang and its spiciness set her back a bit, but the bowl was chock full of fresh, delicious vegetables and marvelous blocks of crispy fried rice. Even at its price point, the bibimbap was tasty and impressive.Too full for dessert, I'll call the night here. Graze is a great space with charming, inviting decor and a solid wait staff. If the burger had been mindblowingly good and worth the price tag, this would be a five-star review. But like I said, it was a high bar to reach, and a fantastic meal nonetheless.Fresh. Local. Seasonal. Delicious!Graze is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. I love the emphasis on supporting local farmers and using fresh ingredients.The food is flavorful and nicely plated. Everything I've tried has been great. The burger is juicy and delicious.  The bibimbap was superb and spicy. Every bite is like a party in your mouth!  The drinks here are amazing! My favorite drink at the moment is the springing in the rain drink. The cucumber is very refreshing.This is also a great place for brunch. The scramblers are delicious, and the Bloody Mary's are loaded with goodies!Dear Graze, I am SO mad at you! We have encountered one another twice so far--and you never meet up to the hype. No one would write a letter to another person like that, so continuing... I haven't heard a bad thing about Graze from any of the locals. It's beautiful, everyone seems to love it. The first time I went, I had the bibimbap bowl. It tasted like kimchi and that's about it, so if you like kimchi then go for it! I don't crave fermented cabbage on the daily, so it would have been more appetizing to me if there were more flavor profiles. Aside from this, the rest of our experience was pretty "meh." Nothing to write home about. Service, cheese board... Meh.The second time I went, the food was better, but the service was out the window. We sat for upwards of 25 minutes before being greeted by our server, who I had been watching the whole time to see if she would notice our empty table. (Yeah, I'll creep like that when I've been waiting for 5 minutes already.) I had to go back to the host table to get the ball rolling, and then we waited for another 7 minutes before she came over. Not sorry--this is inexcusable. If you go for brunch, order the bibimbap burrito and some cheese curds, but have fun waiting an hour. I am just not going to deal with it again...Things that don't make me sad: five-star lunches.I am pretty obsessed with Graze even after just visiting once... I can see myself stopping here every time I'm in the beautiful city of Madison. It's such a gorgeous restaurant, and the natural light is bound to make any day better (so is that cocktail list, am I right?)Speaking of cocktails... I tried The Claire ($10). It's a pretty pale pink and made with Graze watermelon basil shrub, Tito's vodka, lillet, and quince & apple citrus syrup. So fresh and delightful. The Farmer's Market caught my eye as well... it's an "elderflower sparkler" with elderflower blossoms and sparkling wine, two of my favorite things.I made a rookie mistake and showed up only just a little hungry, so I ordered only a creamy tomato soup. It was so good, but I had so much regret I couldn't try more. The deviled eggs are certainly on my list for next time.As you can see, I really love this place. Can't wait to try more of the menu soon!
Hole in the Wall Crab Shack=First impressions are lasting impressions right? Some might say it's ludicrous to grant 5 stars to a restaurant that you've only eaten at once, but these guys are on point. Not just with the service, but also the fantastic food. I have never been giddy for a restaurant before this. Ironically, the couple that came in after us was just as giddy. The kept talking about how their friend raved about the place and I can assure, it's not all hype.Everything is made to order so expect a wait for crabs and chat it up with the owners. Live crabs are delivered on Wednesdays and boy oh boy are they good. I can honestly say that the garlic crabs were some of the best crabs I've ever had. They were seriously Orgasmic with a capital O. What's KFC's slogan again? Finger licking good? Heeeeeck na, this place is so much more deserving. I seriously sucked every single one of my fingers. Crab cake kinda guy? The crab cakes were made just how I like them. Little filling, lots of crab lumps, cooked to a golden brown on both sides and amazingly tasty. Lemonade kinda person? They have some good homemade lemonade. Don't do crab? Okay how 'bout shrimp. The fried shrimp, OMG, seriously? My new, absolute favorite shrimp. And they tell me the steamed shrimp is even better! If you're worried about looking cute while you gnaw on a claw, don't stress too much, it's to-go only ATM. They do plan to expand next door and add seating though. The Crab Shack is just that; a Hole in the Wall. There's a counter, a kitchen, some benches, and two awesome owners manning the register and kitchen. Upon entering, you'll be happily greeted and they might ask how you heard about them. It seems most of their customer base is due to referrals and word of mouth. So if you still haven't heard, let my big mouth be the first to tell you. If you like crab, fish or shrimp, you must check out the Crab Shack!Well well well, Hole In The Wall Crab Shack...nice to meet you! I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it. I'll be back to try more of the menu very, very soon!
Cafe J√§ck=Cafes sind ja eine Kategorie f√ºr sich.Es gibt die gem√ºtlichen und die schnieken, die mit eigener Konditorei und die die eher auf Kleinigkeiten setzen. In manchen gibt es sogar selbstgemachte Pralinen.  Und Omas am Nebentisch. Andere wiederum sind eher mit WLAN ausgestattet und bieten im Home Office arbeitenden eine nette Abwechslung.Das Cafe J√§ck ist eine f√ºr sich. Der Kuchen in der Vitrine sieht verboten gut aus, gleiches gilt f√ºr die Pralinen und Kleingeb√§cke. Das Interieur quietscht dagegen zwischen allen Stilen. Gem√ºtlichkeit will nicht so recht aufkommen, aber daf√ºr f√ºhlen sich hier unterschiedlichste Menschen willkommen und schaffen gemeinsam eine Atmosph√§re des aus der Zeit gefallenen Oase f√ºr diese Momente, f√ºr die noch kein Ort geschaffen.Mein ortskundiger Begleiter tat gut daran, mich hierher zu f√ºhren und sorgte f√ºr seine Bestellung "eine heisse Schokolade 66" f√ºr mein Erstaunen - ja, hier kann man seinen Kakao in Prozent bestellen von milchschokoladig bis dunkelzart. F√ºr Leute wie mich, die der Milch und dem Gluten fernbleiben d√ºrfen fand sich auf Nachfrage in der Vitrine ein Florentiner. Der war eher unspektakul√§r und ich beneidete die Begleiter um ihren saftigen Himbeerkuchen.Der Service - well, der Service w√§re das Argument, das f√ºr mich gegen einen Besuch spricht: Muffelig und alles andere als den prallen S√ºsswaren gerecht werdend, wurden wir begr√ºsst, bedient und abkassiert. Schade!
Lee's Sandwiches=I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.(UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for "less ice and more coffee" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.Don't quite understand the Yelp hate. I won't try to get into a battle of words with my fellow Yelpers, because I trust their opinions on many places, but on this one...I respectfully disagree.Let me set the scene. It's 4:30am. I'm on my way home from the club. I had NOT been drinking, so I was able to judge my food with an able tongue.Lee's is like your typical Fro-Yo Shop on crack, because it's 10x as big and is actually a Sandwich joint (with Fro-Yo...Yo). I ordered the #11 combo, and my sandwich was out within 4 minutes. The baguette was PERFECT! The lunch meat they used was tasty, and I just LOVED the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to the sandwich to give it that extra Asian flair :)I can't wait to come back. I most certainly was not disappointed. I did not have the horrible experience that some of my friends did. I say give it a shot and judge for yourself.Yeah baby...bumped up to a 3 star rating now!I was just not satisfied with my 2 star rating that I had to issue in my first review.I wanted to give Lee's Sandwiches one more shot before I crossed them off my list forever!This visit was a lot better and I am pleased for that. I ordered the same a BBQ pork bahn mi and asked that they put extra sauce since last time the sandwich was a bit dry. The sauce they put in the sandwich is a yummy sweet special mayo, very flavorful indeed. This time the sandwich had more filling in it like it should, more BBQ pork and pickled veggies which was really good.I also ordered a passion fruit italian soda with the chewy gel cherry and fruit bits at the bottom as well as two chicken egg rolls which were delicious!Although I ordered the same BBQ pork sandwich as last time, it was much better today! Lee's seems to lack consistency which is important, not good when the way your sandwich taste or is made depends on who makes it. Really do not like to have to make a 50/50 bet or roll the dice on whether or not it will be hit or miss. Not a good factor!I will return and hopefully my order will come out and taste the same as today did rather than on my first disappointing visit.The only thing that could have been better was the wait for my order. There were only a couple of people in front of me and I waited for awhile in line and once I placed my order. Service could be faster that is for sure, there clearly is no urgency to get the orders out.Lee's we have come a long way baby, you and I have really got something going on.I am hooked and crave you constantly. Why do I have a constant simmering need and want for you? Your baguette bread is delicious chewy and always fresh, your BBQ pork is very tasty and your pickled veggies with sweet house mayo make my taste buds happy! Just a great combination of flavor and some really good bread just do it for me!I have been to Lee's so often that I have filled and redeemed the buy 10 get 1 sandwich free cards a few times now.I feel bad for my sweet boyfriend because my craving for this BBQ pork bahn mi sandwich is so often that he is tired of the sandwiches. :( He has tried them all, meatball, combination, BBQ pork etc and all are great but he just can't eat their several times a week like I can.I am addicted to this simple delicious and filling sandwich. My first visit and review was not so good however I gave them another chance and now am glad to report the goodness is consistent!I also enjoy their spring/egg rolls as well.Hahaha. Can one write a review on a place they were at, but quite drunk at the same time? Yup, I was THAT girl - passed out in one of the booths while her friends are ordering.I remember that there were crumbs on the table, the seating areas, and the place wasn't too clean - but it was open until the wee hours of the night. Perfect for the after hours munchies. They have great iced coffee, so make sure you grab some!I'm glad they picked me up a sandwich - it was great the next morning. But what can I say? There's nothing that totally stands out with this place. So... A-ok. Lee's is located on Spring Mountain Rd - the "Chinatown" "Asian" area of Vegas. There's plenty of parking, no valet needed. Cheapie food, open til the wee hours.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!!!!!! Being open 24 hours is probably the only thing that's good about it, but everything else just blows. It's in the Pho Kim Long parking lot, so beware of parking. It's in an Asian plaza (if you get my drift). The employees are not friendly whatsoever. The one chick who took my order even got annoyed when she gave me someone else's food. Like hello? You handed me the bag! Sorry for being an inconvenience to your life. Anyway, on to the food. The watermelon smoothie was disgusting. They don't use fresh fruit, so it was that super fake watermelon syrup tasting crap. Mixed with boba that turned solid after 5 minutes of being in the smoothie, just awful. It got thrown away after 2 sips. What a waste of $5! I hate their baguettes here because they are seriously like break-your-teeth hard. So, I opted for my sandwich on a croissant. Instead of the light and flaky croissant that we all know, what I got was bread baked into the shape of a croissant. Effing deceiving people! If you look at my picture, you can clearly see its bread and not a croissant. The meat was boring and tasteless. My bf had to put Sriracha on his sandwich when I brought it home just to add flavor to it. He also said the baguette was hard, which I already knew.Ok, and they have this stupid policy that states any purchase with a card between 9pm-5am will be charged an extra 25 cent PER ITEM! WTF!!!! I'm pretty sure they make enough effing money to suck up credit card surcharges. If not, go back to being cash only. Don't be cheap and try to suck up any bit of money that you can. I used to like eating here when I was younger and didn't know the difference between food and good food. After eating so many bahn mis throughout my years of living in Vegas, I can strongly confirm that I will never eat here again. Garbage, just garbage!Lee's Sandwiches is definitely the place to get your snack on. It's located in a shopping center in the middle of Chinatown, which most of the time, sucks driving in no matter what. Lee's is definitely a go-to at any time of the day simply because they have affordable food that's a little above average in quality. I usually come during late night hours after work or class because it's not really busy and it isn't too pricey to break the bank.The interior is bright. There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing. It literally looks like a scene from iCarly or some other show on Nick LOL. Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!If you don't want to drive all over Chinatown for decent boba and cheap snack-like food, then Lee's has got your back!When did Lees get so corporate??? I used to go to a Lees when I was younger and it was the best bang for your buck... But I guess either massive inflation hit or because this Lees is in Vegas... $4.50 for the number 1 special! That's nearly $5! What is this? A Vietnamese subway?! Banh mis are known for their value... Cheap eats, usually a banh mi would cost you like $3 or even buy 2 get one free... It might be this location? But if that's the price, Lees sandwiches have gone up. They also don't have nem anymore... But they did have cha lua and if you buy it they give you a loaf of bread... Great deal but you're paying $6 for cha lua... I guess I'm used to paying $1-2 less. Maybe it's this location... We made a pit stop to eat breakfast and got some sandwiches for lunch. It was okay...
Thai Style Noodle House 2=First things first: this would be a five star review, however they were out of panang curry when I visited last...this will easily be bumped that extra star if this was an isolated incident.  I loved that panang!Thai Style Noodle House was a real treat.  This location is a few suites down from Waffles Cafe on Fort Apache.  During one of my visits to Waffles Cafe, I saw that the staff was ordering Thai food; within 20 mins the food was delivered.  After some investigation I saw that Thai Style Noodle House had recently opened this location.Later that week I stopped by for dinner and ordered a chef special, panang curry with avocado and salmon.  This was simply...awesome.  For my curry fix I've been going to Archi's...if only I found Thai Style sooner!  The avocado was a bit hard, but the flavor of the panang brought a smile to my face with each bite.  I ordered it at a 5 out of 10 on the hot scale, and it was what I expected.  After a second visit, they've been consistent with their scale through the four dishes that I've thus tried.Since then I've had the papaya salad, red curry, and the pad see ew.  After adding some chili powder to the papaya for a little more kick, it became a great side dish to the entrees.  The red curry was good, but I enjoyed the panang a lot more (they were out of panang this night).  And the pad see ew was a very pleasant surprise!  I've had this dish before at other restaurants, and it came out oily and bland.  But here the noodles were cooked perfectly and mixed in with egg and beef, creating a lovely texture with the soft egg and noodles giving way to the thinly sliced beef.  I've been expanding my tastes recently when it comes to Thai cuisine, and I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Style!I'm becoming a Panang addict. I have to try it wherever I go. Tonight was no exception. After reading Anthony M's ROTD, I figured this would be a good place to take my Dad for a little birthday dinner with my brother.Panang Avocado with Salmon. Doesn't that just sound awesome? Well it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. Honestly, I still prefer Archi's Panang overall, but I love the fact that it comes with ample large chunks of salmon and avocado. It's kind of a perfect little marriage. You take some salmon and avocado in with your rice on each spoonful. The combination works swimmingly.As it turns out, my Dad no longer eats spicy food. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for him. He ended up going with the Seafood Wonton soup. It looked delicious and had plenty of seafood. I like the uber-wide bowl they use to serve the soup. My brother went with the Yellow Curry with Tofu. I didn't ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it.As a side note, it was strange that the place was basically empty when we got there, but within minutes, the place was full. It's like after we sat down, a constant stream of customers just kept walking in until all the tables filled up. Also, I found the TV programming to be interesting. I used to love home improvement shows and seeing an Asian version was definitely entertaining.Thai Style Noodle House was worthy of two visits within a week - lunch specials are a great deal here so we couldn't resist returning!From 10:30 am to 4 pm, lunch specials are in full swing.  (This applies on weekends too!)  For $5.95, you choose one item from their list and you also get soup of the day, steamed rice, and choice of appetizer (fried tofu, egg roll, or fried wonton).  For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!Soup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.  First visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.  On our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.Be sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.Their version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.Service is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.Overall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.Minimum $15 for credit card use.I'm usually never on this side of town so thanks to my fellow Yelpers for convincing me to try this place out. There were many other great choices I had near the area but so glad I chose this one.Small, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.The noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew. The panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.I would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.The great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here. Next time, I'll be going to either the Chinatown location or the one in Summerlin.
Zink. American Kitchen=Zink is the new M5.Thought I would pop in for a little bloody mary on a beautiful October day and check out the new location of Zink. Their lunch menu offered a Five and Dime special, 5 entrees to choose from for $10.Choose one of five entrees for $10served with caesar or wedge salad-Smoked Tortilla Soup & Chicken Panini-Roasted Tomato Bisque & BLT-Angus Mushroom Burger & Onion Rings-Curry Chicken Salad Pita & Spicy Feta-Wild Mushroom & Goat Cheese PizzaI thought that was interesting and I asked my server what he liked on the menu and he liked the idea of a small salad and a choice of entree. So I decided with the BLT & tomato soup. Service was good, the food is top quality, but the reason for only three stars is because they served refrigerator cold tomatoes on a BLT. Really? A restaurant with chefs has tomatoes in the fridge?  They should be ashamed of themselves.Great patio! It might be one of the best patios in CLT.I've been to Zink many a time and most of my visits have fallen on lunch. However, this time, our most recent visit was of the dinner/evening variety. Saturday evenings in Southpark are not typically on our radar, but we ended up meeting some friends and we were thrilled with our experience. We made a reservation for the evening on the patio. The weather was great and live music was filling the patio. We had a seat in the rather quiet and intimate setting on the patio. The patio setup they have here is so great at night. Much more quiet than you would expect. We ended up ordering some drinks, but then the weather took a turn for the worse. We asked our server if we could switch to inside whilst waiting for our friends. She happily obliged and scored us a great seat in the large dining room. A great courtesy without even batting an eyelash. I ended up ordering the cucmber gimlet and loved it. I switched for bombay saphire gin and enjoyed it very much. A nice cocktail to sip throughout the meal. The bread they served pre-meal was focaccia and it was fantastic. A nice change from the standard pretzel bread (which is divine). One aspect of their menu that is so attractive is the adaptability for vegetarians. My wife had no problems with the menu and if she wanted something sans protein, they were happy accommodate. Thanks for this!I ordered the new "Nacho" brisket burger. This is the first time I've had a burger med rare in Charlotte and the second time I've had a burger made from brisket. All I can say is WOW. The flavor of the beef was so intensely smokey and well-balanced with guac, onion straws, jack cheese, and that incredible brioche bun...A homerun for sure. Glad to see these guys are not joking around with their burger(s). I've had the Wagyu burger on occasion and I've always left happy...and so full. It's definitely not a burger for the faint of heart. Another small not, but huge props for having Northcoast Scrimshaw in a bottle. My favorite Pilsner and so stoked these guys typically have it. Dear Zink,Thank you for your incredible staff, accommodating dining areas, flavorful menu, miraculous beer varietals, and adaptability. Sincerely,Ben.
Pita Pit=I cock-blocked with a pita . . . . =(I discovered this place during my trip out here for work.  I went in to order a pita and as the girl at the counter was making it, a guy walks in and she gets really excited.  They chat about their plans for the night because apparently he was going laser tagging, but she has to work until 10:30pm.  She abruptly has to kill the conversation to finish my order.  Pitas should never stand in the way of love.Like subway, but 100x better!White or wheat pitaMeat:  spicy chicken, beef, falafel, badger special!!!! (potatoes, bacon, cheese, jalape√±os, oinions, green peppers,nspicy sauce) and a bunch of other choices.Add ons: everything and anything:  spinach, romaine, alfalfa, tomato, hummus, olives, taziki, pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, etc.9 diff sauces: mayo, sour cream, spicy chipotle, ranch, etc.I hope I can find one in California . . . and not cock-block.
Long John Silvers=My daughter took me to Long John Silver's, (attached to an A &W BTW), at my request for a belated Father's Day lunch. Boy...what a terrible mistake! I should have known better because several years ago I had pretty much the same experience. Thinking it was old oil to blame for the grease laden sponges they called fish and shrimp, I was sure this different location would be better. WRONG!!! Absolutely identical. I got the 2 piece meal which included 2 pieces of fish, cole slaw, fries and added 3 shrimp. The fish, shrimp and fries probably began previously frozen but hey...if you use old oil that you fried french fries, onion rings, hush puppies, fish and shrimp in, all day and night  long in, well.... YUK! I could feel my arteries hardening with each bite! The once 3oz. fish fillet was transformed into an 8oz. slab of battered lard as well as everything else that was fried. I know that economic times are tough but come on...use fresh oil and your customers will return in droves. There were only 2 other customers in the dual type restaurant.  Neither of us finished our meal! Total tab was $14.08 with 4 coupons received in the mail. (would have paid almost $20 without coupons) Needless to say, definitely my last visit to LJS ever. Hope I live long enough to continue to avoid them and hope you all do the same!
Doodles=I admit (with shame) that I delayed eating at Doodles until just recently.  The location is set in the greasy pit of campus-town, where I hesitate to venture unless compelled to by some supernatural force (like the lure of hot noodles in winter).The interior space of this tiny shop is not exactly comfortable, but this is the unfortunate case with most campus businesses (i.e., furniture and surfaces should be able to withstand physical punishment from college students).  For those choosing to dine inside, there's a picnic-style bench and a counter with stools.  I guess I can't hold the lack of interior design against them because the restaurant is not attempting to follow a conventional theme.  The manager explained the primary concept behind the place is "food-to-go" (so students can eat something while running around campus), and all the food is packaged for such a purpose, including the noodles.  Next to the front counter is a cooler with various drinks (both American sodas and Asian fruit juices) and "snack" foods.  From what I observed, the same snack foods aren't served each day, though I haven't gone often enough to figure out the pattern/rotation of the different foods.  These were a few dishes I noticed during my visits: glutinous rice balls (classic snack served in Taiwan and other parts of China), Chinese steamed buns, edamame, various sushi rolls, vegetarian gyoza, and spam musubi (a Japanese-Hawaiian invention that probably deserves a certain skepticism from most diners). Of course, the main feature of this shop is ramen.  When I mention this, most people respond indignantly, "What!?  You can buy ramen for 40 cents at Wal-Mart!"  The ramen-eating experience here is NOT the same as boiling noodles and adding sauce packets in your own home, though.  Your ramen bowl is fully customizable, from the available broths (sesame, miso, kimchi, beef, seafood, etc.) to the toppings you can request for your bowl (baby bok choy, nappa, egg, fried tofu, wakame, Thai fish cakes, beef meatballs, etc.).  At around 50 cents per topping, I was initially expecting pretty skim offerings, but I actually get a pretty decent ratio of noodles to vegetables.Maybe this little restaurant appeals to me because very few places can offer me a reasonable lunch for $3 (and student debts are the primary constraint on my dining options).  Probably real adults with real jobs would be less impressed by Doodles, but this is an ideal restaurant for most college students.
Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli=Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli has finally opened just a few doors down from 168 Supermarket. And on its first day being opened to the public, it has already attracted a very nice crowd of eager patrons.From the hand written signs near the cashiers counter, it states that it is open everyday except Thursday. This little restaurant with seating capacity of 48 has a Breakfast Menu which is served from 7am to 11:30am, and a Lunch Menu served from 11:30am to 9pm. Since I was coming from work, by the time I had arrived it was already 11:36am and most of their breakfast items were sold out. Meaning no freshly made soy milk (or Iced Soy/Bean Juice as it is called in their menu) for me, which was the primary objective of this visit and the reason for skipping the free lunch at work. So I ordered the Beef Roll with Preserved Vegetable (it was that or the version made with pork), which was pretty much the only item available from the Breakfast Menu. And it was quickly served to me on a red china and still wrapped in the plastic wrap.  It is a sesame crusted thin bread stuffed with slices of braised beef with Chinese preserved vegetable.  It was alright. A little on the dry side, but a good experience to try their version thousands of miles away from the original in Taiwan and China.As I ate and looking over their menu I see that they also serve various handmade dumplings (such as "Steam Bao" aka Xiao Long Bao, which was also sold out), Spicy Beef Noodle (which I ordered), various Taiwanese Deli, Shaved Ice (which they don't currently serve), cold beverages and hot desserts. The back of their business cards also states in Chinese that they served Taiwanese style hot pots, but that is not in their menu, just like the breakfastitems are not listed in the menu. I also ordered "Temple Meatball" and Fish-Ball Soup (should be more accurately called Fuzhou fish ball).The first item I ordered arrived quickly, since it was premade and came on a plate still wrapped in plastic wrap.  It was okay, maybe too dried and lack much flavor to warrant trying again in the future.  After that it took pretty long for the items to be sent out the kitchen, since I doubt they were expecting this kind of crowd on opening day and they probably don't have any proper line cooks working in the back.  So by the time I finished everything and paid by bill it is 12:50pm already.The kitchen is definitely not ready for the better than expected turnout, but hopefully with more practice they will soon get the hang of it.  As of right now, there is no POS in use, so items that are out, must be communicated to the staff taking the orders as it comes in, and if not everyone is on the same page, you end up with customers waiting for a good long time, until they either ask about the status of their order or just gives up and pay for what they have already been served. Furthermore, the kitchen and the expeditor needs to agree on how orders are placed and executed, because the time for discussing how to handle order tickets is not in the middle of service.Food-wise, I thought it was just okay.  The best item I tried was the Spicy Beef Noodle, except I felt the beef needed to be braised longer, since not all of them were tender. There are also still a lot of things I want to try if they are actually available, so I will be back.Menu - sadly very typical of the mom and pop operations in that the English translations of menu items are 1) misspelled, 2) poorly translated, 3) utilises questionable word choice.  If the restaurant needs someone to correct their menu, I can do it. I just hate seeing simple words like tofu, noodle, chicken spelled correctly in one part of the menu and not in others. And I also can't understand why some parts of the menu is not translated at all, like the shaved ice. It is not that hard to translate select any 3 toppings, 4 toppings, etc for X price.Parking - pretty convenient since it is in the same plaza as 168 Market.Price - pretty reasonable for most items.3 stars.They also have shaved ice on the menu, but it is not available yet.We ( My date and I ) checked out this newly opened Taiwanese Deli place that's next to Lelysee Bakery and near 168 Market.Reminds me of Tea Planet without the booth seats and colorful interior. They have some snacks and health products for sale that you can browse through if you like..They have a self serve utensils and water dispenser if you need an extra bowl or cup to share food or just to drink plain water.We ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea, which was delightfully refreshing to taste. I could drink 10 of these if there were refills.. but that's just wishful thinking. This is my all time summer drink to cool my body when I feel like I'm about to experience heat exhaustion... it works instantly and you literally feel relieved.. even to say... Aaaaaaaaaaah!!For dinner, we ordered two most popular Taiwanese dishes:Spicy Beef Noodle (Soup) - Surprised it wasn't overpowering with the spices that I thought it would have. It was actually just right in giving it a kick each time you took a sip. I actually really enjoyed this broth. I loved the noodles! It had a great texture as if it was homemade. Thicker than fettuccine noodles, but thinner width-wise. It was like udon noodles texture, but half its size... absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beef was like stew meat that is cooked for many hours... unfortunately I had to minus a star for the fact that some of the chunks of meat ( the ends/corners of it ) were quite tough to chew upon. And for that reason, I couldn't even eat the remainder of the beef chunks, but I did finish all the noodles, sliced green cabbage, and some kind of pickled shredded mustard green.Rice with Pork Chop - It also came with a boiled egg, steam greens, and ground pork. The coating is somewhat similar to katsu style, but this batter they dip the pork chop into and deep fry is on point! It had a light, airy crispy crunch on the outside.. which was my favorite!!! * My eyes lit up like Christmas lights in full blast from biting into a piece. Very tasty and satisfied all my taste buds. Even the meat was tender and juicy.  Bravo!! Bravooooo!!! I definitely recommend this dish if you love meat and deep fried food. It really hits the spot indefinitely :)They also open at 7a.m.- 11:30a.m. for breakfast, which I heard was incredibly cheap, but good. Service was quick, but not much smiles... At least my tummy was smiling and it put me in a great mood. Hey I'm an emotional eater... What? *Ladeedadee skipping away.....We were fans of the Champion Gourmet on Spring Mountain and very sad when they closed down.  However, the Yangs (Bobby and Misti) were the first to tell us that they were reopening business in this shopping center and we anxiously awaited their grand opening.  What we loved most was their hot pot option - something that currently is not offered.  (Word from Auntie Bo directly said she'll be starting the hot pot business again come the new year! Yay!)We even missed out on the famous CMYE: Breakfast of Champions event, which got raving reviews and reinforced how fabulous the Taiwanese breakfast experience was there.  (We plan on hitting it up one of these days!)One day the Husband came home and said he wanted some Spicy Beef Noodle Soup from Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. Apparently someone from work had been raving about it, and yelpers concurred!  So off we went to dinner!This is what we tried:   * Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) - This is THE thing to order at Yi Mei.  Look around and you'll see every table have a bowl of this.  Every review talks about it and I can see why.  The Husband liked it and found the beef to be tender.  I was personally enjoying the noodle part more.  It had a good texture, something that Suki L. talks extensively about it in her review.  It also came with bok chopy and pickles, be sure to ask for more of those preserved pickles because they add a nice contrast to the dish.  Bring me a bowl of the noodles, broth, bok choy, and pickles and I'm good to go! * Special Fry Tofu ($4.99) - This was a long shot because we weren't sure exactly what was going to make this a 'special' fried tofu.  While we waited for this dish to arrive, the Husband asked if they had the stinky tofu still.  I wasn't sure since there was another dish on the menu called "Hot Spicy Special Tofu" and thought that may be the dish!  When it did come, it looked like before with pickled cabbage and a dipping sauce.  When I bit into it, it was definitely the stinky tofu.  The texture was a bit dried out, but the crispiness of the tofu was refreshing.* Green Onion Pancake ($2.99) - One pancake arrived and it was a bit thicker than what I'm used to getting. We needed to add some hot chili oil (and other condiments found on the table) to give it a little more of a kick.  I personally prefer thinner green onion pancakes.* Steamed Bao ($4.99) - Also known as Shanghai dumplings or Xiao Lung Baos.  They were the last to arrive.  There were eight small dumplings that were a little gummy and could have used a bit more time in the steamer.  I prefer it that way so the hot soup within the dumpling can burn my tongue a bit.This is a pretty casual restaurant where there is a self service station for hot tea, water, and utensils.  You'll find this on your immediate right when you walk in.  Take a seat and be sure they know you sat down so you'll get menus.  (Try to ignore the spelling errors on the menu.) And when you're ready to pay, head to the register and know what number table you sat on to help them out.This place is steadily busy, and not just from new customers who happen to be shopping at the nearby 168 Market.  But rather, these are long-time customers from their old restaurant.  You can tell they have a strong following.When the Husband was paying, he got a chance to meet and talk with Auntie Bo, who is just the friendliest lady.  That's when we heard that hot pot was returning come the new year and we were psyched!  You can't help but love the family-oriented atmosphere where regulars come to enjoy some quality homelike food.  She really makes an effort to know her customers!   Not only is Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli a restaurant, but it's a mini market as well. You'll find dried goods and refrigerated items for sale.  Take a look around for some interesting and unique goods!Update! 01.06.11 - I stopped by and asked Auntie Bo about the return of the hot pot. Looks like it's not going to happen anymore. =(  She said they just don't have the staff to do it.  Oh well.  But she did mention Dragon House as an option for hot pot which I can confirm!Ask a Chinese person to take you here...your experience depends on it. No one speaks English...and no one will try to understand you if you don't speak Chinese. My first experience here was great, I came with a fellow yelper, Mike C. and had him order everything. My order came out and everything fine.My second visit was a desperate one. I originally stopped by Asian BBQ and noodles but they're closed on Fridays :( So...I decided to drive across the street. I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked if they could add wontons in it...weird I know but I was craving both. First they brought out a bowl of wontons in beef broth which is understandable and forgivable because of the language barrier. They took it back...added the beef and the noodles...everything looked great until I started eating. The wontons were falling apart as soon as I tried picking them up with my chopsticks. I was starving so I ignored this and continued eating until I bit into one of the wontons and realized that it was still pink...undercooked. Gross...-_-The service here is non existent...They have a water cooler and Styrofoam cups if you need water... Feel free to walk up and get it yourself. Same goes for napkins. This experience was probably an extreme of how bad a meal could go wrong here...but I will not be back. This decision was made after considering that the first visit was decent. There are just too many better options in the area.
Indaba Restaurant=Little plates, they're only little plates which surely means I can only eat a little amount. Right? Right?! So Katya assured me after my fifth helping from one of the many little plates on our large table of 11.But really, I didn't care how much I'd eaten or how bad (read: gooooood) that might be. I was already in my little state of 'food ecstacy' as Kerrin R described it. Why? Let me enlighten. Tapas are, delightfully, little plates of food. This means you can order 2 - 3 plates per person, which means more variety. When you go along with 10 other yelpers this means that at least 25 little plates are ordered, all of which are passed around, which results in a LOT more variety.Jurgen D and I did some tactical ordering and went for the:- lamb with apricot (daily special)- sea bass with lime and ginger (daily special)- chicken with black beans and mango (daily special)- haggis with spinach and pine nuts- mixed grilled vegetablesI also happened to sample many other things passed around, up and down the table including:- garlic and chilli prawns- courgette wrapped feta (daily special)- pork ribs in chilli and honey- the goats cheese with onion marmalade- another type of pork, this time fried- the beef sausage - grilled haloumiOh my, I think I'm forgetting some too. As Jurgen and Aidan have said below me, the restauarant is whilst mainly Spanish in its style, a mix of Venezulaen and South African too. The only thing that would have helped was outlining what on the menu heralded from which cusine, but in the end it didn't matter as it was all superb.My favourites were definitely the haggis and lamb, oh and the pork. The haggis was the best I've had in Edinburgh so far - in a Spanish restaurant. It was so moist, not dried out and crusty as it often can be. And mixed up with the spinach and pine nuts - wow, flavours I've never experienced before. The lamb was a really generous serving for a small tapas plate - two large skewers. Cooked so it was still pink in the middle and the apricots were lovely. The goats cheese was epic, a whole block of goats cheese which we all sampled and agreed was creamy goodness.Oh but yes, there were also desserts. With such offerings as 'crying chocolate pudding', 'almond cake' and 'cappucino cake' it was to our delight they had the 'trio of desserts' option. For only ¬£6.95 you got a slightly smaller version of three of the desserts - fantastic value. The almond cake was so moist, although for me a little bland but then I'm not the biggest almond person. The crying chocolate cake was the opposite - rich and dark and brooding. I think it's called crying cake as it almost made me cry tears of joy. And the capuccino cake was lovely and tart and not overly sweet.But the winner hands down was the rhubarb and ginger sorbet. It was just...so...rhubarby!! Seriously. The most rhubarby flavoured rhubarb thing (apart from actual rhubarb) that I've tasted. So refreshing and brilliant to cleanse the palate.This place is an absolutely fantastic find. It has that real neighbourhood hidden gem vibe to it, one that you'd be delighted to stumble up on by accident. As Jurgen said, despite being a Monday night it was almost full by people in the know. Huge props to the staff as well. I booked the table for 11 at 5pm that night, and despite being full they accomodated us without any fuss. The staff also all tried really hard, and the front of house / owner was really helpful and genuinely nice.Oh and another favourite - the coneryor belt effect of food. Just when you'd finished one, another came, and so on and so forth. As Aidan has said, this was great as it meant it didn't all come at once and go cold. I could get used to all these many, many, many small plates of food...!
Noodle Pot=I am always in search of a restaurant that serves really good beef noodle soups.  So I was excited to see the interior of this restaurant being put together a few months ago.I finally came here with another Yelper for dinner and to give their food a try. The restaurant was not busy at all (I was the only in there while I waited for my friend), so service was quick when we placed our order.I ordered the Beef Noodle with wide noodles $7.99.  The flavor was good,the noodles were chewy the way I like it, but the beef could have been braised longer.  I think China Mama and even Ay-Chung Noodle has better Beef Noodle Soup, so I will likely try something else here in the future.My friend tried the Babo Mian, which he said was good.  $6.99We also ordered an appetizer that was on one of the papers taped to the wall. The chicken was good, just a little pricey for the portion.Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent.  The food was adequate. Price was alright.   WiFi is free, but there is no place to plug in your laptop.Decor: 3/5  Nothing special.  Just a fast food restaurant kind of furniture and decorations.Food: 3/5  Okay, but definitely room for improvement.Service: 4/5  Efficient.Location:  4/5  In China Town.  Close enough for the tourists staying on the Strip, and locals wanting to eat at a restaurant on Spring Mtn.Cash only, which my friend said was the reason why he didn't dine here sooner, as he didn't have cash when he initially came here.  I know it is a business decision to process credit cards payments, but it seems that it is a small business expense to cover to not lose potential businesses from those intending to pay with debit/credit cards.Want to try some quality beef soup noodles?  A few simple choices an you're there: 1.  Beef, beef tendon, or a combination of both.2.  Thin or thick (hand cut ribbons) noodles.3.  Mild or spicy soup.The hardest thing is finding the place.  Deconstructed:  Very well seasoned, deep beefy soup base with the wafting aroma of star anise, hint of ginger, and dried citrus peels.  Great noodles with just the right amount of chew.  Clean, tender, gelatinous tendons (sounds disgusting but "a rose by any other name...").  The only catch, the beef is sometimes over braised.  Tender, but dry.  Very common, I'd guess it's authentic by default.Beef stew soup $8. Beef tendon soup $9.  Combo at $8.50A simple meal doled out in a non descript restaurant with "classic" service (you got your food right?)  It is what it is and that's not bad at all.My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.Brrrrrr...... It is super cold night here in Las Vegas (12/07/2013) we're talking mid 20's. Definitely soup weather. Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated. Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow)Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot. Here's some of the rundown. Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing. Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree. Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings. The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel. I'll definitely be backMany Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. (Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pi√®ce de r√©sistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).Not a bad Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup...From yelping around in Las Vegas, looking for a place that was still open late night, and targeting restaurants that had noodles...this establishment was the one that I chose for our intoxicated food adventure.I was lured to this location not only because of the high ratings, but because of their advertisement of hand-made noodles.The noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.Im usually a PHO-type of guy when it comes to drunk munchies, but after eating here, this place isnt a bad substitute.RECOMMENDED!UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
Los Gemelos=Horchata doesn't get better than this. The consistency of the cinnamon infused rice milk at Los Gemelos is perfection. It's spiced and sugared and oh so good. Many restaurants tend to dull this drink down so it's thin as water and way too sugary. Not Los Gemelos, nuh uh. They do it way right.Get some tacos while you're here too. The steak variety is served with cilantro and diced onion and is probably best, but I've had chicken a handful of times as well. If you're looking for something a tad heartier, go for the fajitas and prepare for a lot of food. I love that smokey grilled taste on the meat and veggies, nailed it.Also, they default to corn tortillas here, which is fine by me because they're delish but ask for flour if that's your thing. Service can be bothersome at times, especially if you're pressed for time, but that can't keep me away from their horchata. I have yet to find a better glass.
Subway=Yep it's Subway with subs made your way with your choice of bread which now includes flat bread that is really good.My hubby took me here for lunch one day while we were out and about running errands around town. He decided to try a flat bread sandwich and let me tell you the bread is fresh and delicious! I think I will try my sandwich on the flat bread next time because that was a real winner!I usually get the meatball marinara, spicy Italian or veggie delight depending on my mood.The subs are standard at each Subway, what makes your experience good or bad, hit or miss really depends on the employee behind the counter at the time. There is no real consistency as some employees are more generous then others with the toppings.It is annoying to have to ask them to add more lettuce or tomato to your sub which is necessary when you can barely see it on your sandwich. On this visit I had to ask for more of everything including purple onion as I kid you not she put 3 little pieces on my FOOT LONG!I don't know why we continue to visit this location as the service sucks sour balls!. It is the same lady who looks at you as if she has more important duties to do like mop the floors. Which while we dined she was sweeping by our table at our feet. That is a pet peeve of mine, sweeping while I am eating. We were the only damn people in there at the time, she could have waited until we were gone. Well as I have come to realize in life not everyone has common sense.This particular female employee is consistent in her personality I have to say, she looks and talks as if she is giving a speech at a funeral. She has been there every time we have gone I swear she must be the only employee there. This was our last visit for sure, she just confirmed and made that decision for us. Anyhow, there are lots of Subways around town so it will be easy to pass this one up along the way.
Chipotle Mexican Grill=Stopped by the Fedex Kinko's Store next door around lunchtime and was hungry for some Mexican Food.  Luckily, this Chipotle is only steps away.I went for the Steak Burrito had them put Rice, Pinto Beans, Hot Sauce, Sour Cream, and Guacamole in the Burrito.  The Burrito was solid as usual for a Chipotle.  The Guacamole & Sour Cream makes the Burrito for me.  The Rice has just the right amount of Lemon juice on it to give it that slight tart flavor.....and the Hot Sauce has a nice kick to it.I think they do a really good job because they have such a small menu and focus on providing consistent product.Will I return?  You bet.This place rocks.. they can get busy but they hammer right through and you get fresh food!The freaking cook is amazing to watch as he dices and slices. I swear he is gonna loose a digit. Fun to pass time as you wait in line!They have always been clean, quick and really nice here.
Polo's Italian Cuisine=Came on a Saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately. It is a smaller place with a bar capable of seating 15 or so and about 15 tables. I'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing. It provided a nice ambiance.The menu consists of apps, salads, a few pastas, traditional entrees and pizza. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app and weren't too impressed. They weren't terrible, just nothing special. The entrees were a different story. My husband's mushroom lasagna was to die for.  Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of each ingredient. I had the veal parm and it hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading. Their marinara is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own. The portion was quite generous and was accompanied by spaghetti and marinara. Our only compliant was that they do not offer draft beers and their bottled beer selection was very limited.While many traditional Italian dishes are not listed on the menu our server informed us that items like marsalas and piccatas are available upon request.
The Living Room Wine Cafe & Lounge=I have learned one very important rule and it is that I'm only allowed to order bruschetta at Postino. Period. End of story. That said, the butternut squash soup was delicious as was my one bite of the Steak sandwich, which I might just order myself next time. The space itself has a much warmer, intimate feel than expected. It appeared so bright and coffee house like on the website that it was actually a deterrent. I get it, your space is clean and you want to showcase that but it really does give the wrong impression. I also understand the concept of lighting for photography purposes but it appears bright and uninviting, definitely not date worthy. Anyway, I'm glad I was wrong.The cocktail list was uninspired and I don't recommend bringing a beer geek here, but if you're into sharing some munchies and splitting a bottle of reasonably priced wine, this (and about 20 other spots in the valley) is your place. No offense to The Living Room, I will surely be back, It's just that I'd really love to see a restaurant owner bring something fresh and new to the table. I feel like everyone is doing a version of this...I too noticed the flickering light issue but being that I'm not prone to seizures it didn't bother me much. The service was on point and our server was attentive without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy ourselves. When questioned regarding wine options he actually had an opinion and some basic knowledge to back it up. That may seem sad to get excited about but hey, I've gotten used to vapid shitty service, even coming out of some seemingly 5 star establishments. We came, we drank, (a lot) we dined, (not enough) and we took cheap cab rides home. Ahhhh, the beauty of living in Mid-town.  I'll be back Living Room; I'm not in love...but you're a perfectly acceptable rebound/transition until the next best thing comes along.
Hash House A Go Go=Yelp Challenge 365 # 175/365there are several Hash A Go Go's and as a matter of convenience, I tried the one at M Casino. By the way, it's just as easy to get to M's Hash A Go Go than to stress with the traffic; park or valet your car, then walk to the restaurant.... Mihcael C is correct on the size. I don't know if any ONE person can finish the entire entree......Rod U is correct that it may appear to look like / act like a "chain" restaurant and in a way, it is....Here's my take: food was good. The portions were a little too large (very large for my appetite), service was excellent and there was no wait for seating (at least when I was there). As Rod says, you can't go wrong with the price. Averaging $15 per entree and enough to feed 2 or 3 people, really can't complain.I had the Chicken Pot Pie. By taste, it was a "chicken pot pie". By design, it was a "work of art" you may just want to look at.  My friend had the chicken and waffles. It was okay= like southern fried chicken and maple syrup I guess...I think I would go back if, and only IF, I was in a large group knowing we could have several entrees and share it for tasing purposes....One last thing! They have the best bloody marys by taste and price south of the Strip.
Twisted Lizard Tavern & Grill=This is a tough review to write because I live in the neighborhood and like to walk over for dinner. It is a cool set-up with the open bar and the outdoor area, but this place has a real identity crisis. I went there a few times when it was Portobellos. The food was terrible and the menu was all over the place. When it changed to the Lizard the food got better and the menu more uniformed. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the food has gone way downhill over the past six months, and the service is spotty. Several of the servers and one of the bartenders are great, the rest are rude and slow. The food is either very greasy, or dried out. I sure hope they can fix this place. To the owners I say: "Figure out an identity that works with the local clientele, change the menu to something that is simple, straightforward, uniform, and most importantly GET A NEW CHEF!"
Two Hippies Beach House=The Hippies thought they could fool me...the Hippies thought I wouldn't see their little trick with the profile change.I haven't been stoned in a very long time...I pay attention!So, since the hippies were good enough to change their Yelp profile to avoid these previous reviews, I think I'll post this one under the new profile.________________________________________________________A friend of mine called  and said "let's have lunch!"He seemed so excited...and then he said "hey, buddy...there's a brand new Two Hippies near Old Town!"I threw up in my mouth a little and said "but I don't think these Two Hippies joints are very good"He promised this time the experience would be better!He's a lying sack of...well, you get my drift.I went anyway and had essentially the identical experience to my last (and I do hope this is my last) experience with the Two Hippies.Not surprising that this place is identical...the very same franchisee operates it (in the location once occupied by the late,and not apparently lamented in the slightest, Desert Dogs and Dessert), that operates the other Two Hippies Joints that I've tried.Two Hippies is recycling the very same thing over and over!Oh well.And except for the actual physical location and the fact that I had a pretty flavorless burrito instead of tacos, recycling the same review that I used before works stunningly well for this location, too!And it's appropriate since Two Hippies seems intent on recycling their formula, ad nauseum.Very "green" of them (except of course for the styro and plastic everything else).Plus, I'm feeling lazy today (or green...I can't remember which).Here is the review, for those of you still reading:"I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-IBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)And, I like taco's:)And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)No beach at 5th and Camelback:(But, I digress:)I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)"
Lucky Strike=If you know me, you know that I'm an advocate of almost anything Phoenix.That's why when Lucky Strike was set to move into Cityscape, I was thrilled. I've been to the Lucky Strike in LA, and have always had a great time.I've been to Lucky Strike PHX about 4 times since it opened and for the most part, the wait and bar staff have been above par in their customer service. I am particularly appreciative of waitress Nicole, who has an uncanny ability to almost anticipate what the customer needs before they even ask. She has an overall pleasant personality without being too saccharin-sweet, know what I mean?For employees like Nicole, I commend Lucky Strike. Now, here's why Lucky Strike irritates me: it's their "we're hot shit" mentality. 1. I tried to reserve one lane for a Wednesday night, and they respond with a "we only take reservations 7 days prior." IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, FOR CRISSAKES! And this is Phoenix--not Hollywood, not DC, not Miami. People are not going to be lining up for lanes on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night. At least NOT YET.2. Do you validate parking? No, you don't. Not even an hour validation. Hell, CVS does even if we just buy a package of band-aids, but you don't. So we have to pay the $12 parking fee.  Throw us a bone here! We are Phoenicians who try to minimize walking in the heat. We like convenience but not at a steep price. Phoenician women also like to wear heels so why make them walk just to go to your establishment and spend AT LEAST $14 for the first game, $10 any additional games, and some change for libations and grub. You want us to patronize you, work with us. CVS did.3. I know you're new but you gotta train your receptionists or the people who are tasked to answer the phones first. They are not rude, but they do sound clueless machines who will spew out the corporate answers to your questions. Just saying. A few almost sound as if they're "hot shit."4. On your website, the dress code states: Head gear is not permitted. But it seems to me, fedoras are okay. Last I checked, a fedora is head gear. C'mon, don't be a hatist (as in HAT not HATE). Stick your policy and be fair. If you think a baseball cap might be gang-related...just remember the Mafias of yesteryears wore fedoras. If you're going to say "head gear," mean it and don't let your hosts make a subjective decision whether a hat is offensive or not. You're not god of head gears. (But do me a favor and kick out anyone wearing Ed Hardy caps.)Lucky Strike, please understand that Phoenix is still learning that there is life after 5:30p.m. in the downtown area. We're not a tough crowd. I mean we're fascinated by flashing lights and air-conditioning. But we do need some coddling, some TLC. And when you "win us over," believe you me, we will be fierce followers. But the: 7-day advance reservation, no validated parking, the "we're hot shit" attitude might.and inconsistent dress code policy will not win us over. And I personally, would like for you to succeed here.We Phoenicians are quite different form the LA, Miami, Denver, etc. people, so don't categorize us the way you would categorize them. We are fascinated with your right now--your concept is so hip and cool, we like it! But if you don't treat us right, it won't take us long to realize that at the heart of it all, you are just a bowling alley with soft-dim lights and air-conditioning.Five stars for having the best meal value with recreational outlet during the lunch hour.  Your lunch outing will get you a great meal and a free game of bowling for only $5.50. Srsly!I've done the lunch & bowl three times and each visit was easy breezy, just stick to the following:Most people are there during their lunch hour so show up a little early to guarantee access to the next available lane. Sign up for your lane immediately upon arrival and order your meal as soon as your server checks in with you. Keep your game going and avoid stalling and lingering. Believe me, two players can get through a game and lunch within 45 minutes. Most importantly, just have fun!I heard that Lucky Strike opened downtown several months back, but I'm not a huge bowler, so I didn't really think twice about it.  However, a few weeks ago, Jared got it in his head that he really wanted to go there...  So last Friday night, while at dinner, we texted Amber and Dallas  to see if they spontaneously wanted to join us for  drinks and bowling at Lucky Strike... and sure enough, they did!  (Gotta love the spontaneity!)Unfortunately for us, we weren't the only ones in the mood to check out Lucky Strike; the place was packed with an hour wait when we arrived!  We stuck it out though, and despite being on the pricey side, we did end up having a ton of fun!  A couple of rounds of drinks later, we finally did get a chance to bowl.  I was by far the worst bowler in our lane; (bowling is not my sport even sober).  Little known fact: Amber and Dallas are pretty serious bowlers... they both have their own bowling balls at home but they didn't bring them out with us this time.  I am sure I'll return to Lucky Strike; I think it's a great new addition to CityScape downtown, but next time  I'll call ahead to reserve a lane... and I may even try to brush up on my bowling skills before I return (or not)!We had an office party here Friday for our one-year anniversary.  So, being that I didn't have to pay for the games, shoes, or food, my review is based on my experience.  Just thought I'd get that out there so nobody reams me.  We got the private room, which was really nice.  In fact, everything here was really nice: the decor, the people and, being that it's a new bowling alley, the shoes.  The shoes were still brand-new.  That's huge.We had a TON of food!  Pot stickers, pizza, veggie trays.  Everything was great and tasted fresh.  It wasn't Sysco food.The service was outstanding!  I'm not one of those people who says "outstanding" very often, but we were really taken care of well.There's a nice lounge off the main room for people who just want to...go to the bowling alley to drink.  Do people really do that???  I can't wait to get a group together to go again.  It's fun, it's Downtown and I'm excited about CityScape!Dropped in with some friends.  The lanes were all taken, so we went over to the pool tables to play some pool.  They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.The pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.There's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.Overall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.Return Factor - 90%My first experience here was short, sweet, and to the point. It was pleasurable. In other words, I had been eagerly anticipating a return.My second experience was cause enough to never return. Picture this- there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance, and mind you, 'twas about 1:15AM when we arrived. We had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular looking bar that actually showcases local artists' works (I'd give them more than two thumbs up if I physically could for this) so the idea was to grab a few cocktails. Service was lackadaisical at best even though we were the only ones at the bar itself.The epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extreme absence of management, poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartenders, and the uber extremism of the  "bouncers." Unfortunately whenever there are a bunch of guys behind me yelling at me to "get out" after the bartender has just delivered a drink, I am going to be a bit frustrated. By the way, it was still before 2:00AM.Ultimately it's a shame. As I was walking out I told one of the "bouncers" that I would never be back, to which he replied, "It's no skin off my back." For a service-based business in downtown Phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for any patronage they may acquire is simply dumbfounding. I live a few blocks away and whole-heartedly wanted this place to be a "go to" spot for when friends and family from other parts of the valley and from out of state visit, but if the "bouncers" are the only voice here then I would prefer to give my business to anywhere besides Lucky Strike.
I Love Burgers=If you are staying at the Palazzo, this is a super-convenient gourmet hamburger place right to the left on the second floor as you get off the elevator! It usually is not busy and the food is pretty good.  I found myself returning multiple times during my stay. Like any self-respecting modern hamburger place, they have several exotic burger options, as well as many different beers on tap.Although things can get a bit pricey, they do have a great happy hour with half-price appetizers and deals on drinks (which I enjoyed on more than one occasion during my stay).  If you order a large beer, you can bring the cup back later for a $5 discount on the next beer.  The receipt you get is also good for 25% off of a breakfast order - and although I didn't try it, I heard good things about it.  If you are looking for something quick, easy, and pretty good, this place will hit the spot!
Saffron=It's never a good sign when you drive up to a business and the parking lot is empty. To be fair, it was 5:30 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, but still, this is an Indian/Pakistani restaurant, so you'd think the typical crowd might be more World Cup and less Big Game.It's an even worse sign when you see vinyl lettering on the window of an Indian restaurant that reads "Salon de Fiestas." And sure enough, walking into Saffron for the first time, it doesn't feel at all like a cozy Indian restaurant. It feels like a banquet room. Only two booths, the rest of the expansive room filled with round-top banquet tables, chairs covered in plastic, a little stage in the corner. And COMPLETELY EMPTY.An Indian restaurant should smell like, I dunno, Indian food when you walk in. This place didn't. It smelled like ... an old folks' home. Or something. Something not right. And it was dead quiet in there. Not even a TV or radio on.There was one person visibly working in the entire place, a middle-aged woman who was helpful enough but not very friendly. You think she'd be thrilled to see even one person, let alone a couple, walk in. Not so. She kind of just gestured toward whatever table we wanted, dropped off menus, and disappeared. Didn't ask us for drinks or anything.The menu was typical Indian fare, and prices were about average. We ordered some of our favorites -- veggie samosas, pakora, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, as well as some rice and two kinds of naan. At the same time, the host/server/whatever finally took our drink orders. Sadly, this joint doesn't serve alcohol. I hate it when I can't order a good Indian beer with my meal.It took a long time to get even our drinks (water and iced tea) out, which came with the appetizers. The samosas were OK. The pakora was weird. I'm used to pakora being similar to tempeh -- just vegetables dipped in batter and fried. These were more like spongy batter balls with diced veggies inside. Maybe they're more "authentic," I don't know, but they sucked.The entrees were solid. Nothing to write home (or, um, on Yelp) about, kind of weak-flavored, but decent. The naan was good enough. We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate to use, and when the lady first looked at it, she said, "That's not us." She said this because their logo didn't print, and she thought the "missing image" graphic was someone else's logo. I had to point out to her the NAME AND ADDRESS AND PHONE of her own business. She did eventually take the discount off our bill.Interestingly, at some point, a man and his child walked in during our meal, heartily greeted us, and I assume he is the owner or manager at least, which leads me to believe our host/server might have been his wife. Maybe she was grumpy that she had to work by herself while he was watching the Big Game or something. Had he been there when we first arrived, we might have felt better. But either way, we're never going back here, which is a shame, because it is literally walking distance from our house.There's another review here which describes Saffron's interior as being more like a banquet hall than an Indian restaurant and I have to concur completely. When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.After being instructed by a small child to "just sit anywhere" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.The restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.After a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).Our host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd "ketchupy taste" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.Despite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.This is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.I got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate. Finally, after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there, lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home TWICE in the time we waited to pay for our meal.The food here is great, but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay, including 30 minutes after you TELL THEM you want to pay is just unacceptable, especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow.So upset! After buying a groupon we decided to finally give this place a try. Even after reading the reviews I took a leap of faith on this place. First off we drove 20 mins to get here to be ignored at the door when we entered that WE had to ask after standing there for 5 mins if we should just seat ourselves. An unpleasant lady said sit anywhere and tossed some menus on the table. Without an " I'll be right with you". We waited 15 mins without someone even bringing water to our table!! We got up and left. Now I know why I stick to my five favorite restaurants. If you want good Indian go to taj palace. That's where we're driving now where we know we'll get awesome food and great service.
Nittaya's Secret Kitchen=What can I say, I really like this place.  It's not traditional Thai, but what do you expect with Thai tapas.  Everything I had was really, really good and inventive.  My husband and I were starving so we started off with three "tapas" - the shrimp patties, stuffed angel wings, and spinach salad.  I love the spinach salad!  It's tempura spinach leaves served in a big cone (like French fries) with a yummy dressing on the side.  The shrimp patties and stuffed angel wings were also very good, but the spinach salad stole the show.  The shrimp patties were pretty much what you would expect.  The menu says "Thai spices" but the patties aren't spicy at all.  Decent size and the plum sauce drizzled on top tasted great. The stuffed angel wings are a little different than what I'm used to, but still yummy.  A lot more chicken than "stuffing" and with cilantro.  For entrees, we had the spicy green bean pork and the basil beef.  Their spice rating system is from 1 to 5.  The spicy green bean pork can only be made a "2" or higher.  Hence the word "spicy" in the name.  We got the pork as a "2" and the beef as a "4."  The "2" was just perfect for me and the pork with green beans was delicious.  The beef was also good but I could tell it had more oil on it and I would probably break into a sweat if ate too much.  The entrees come with white rice, which was cooked properly.  All the plates come with little orchids on them and are served family style.  I liked the presentation of all the dishes, especially the spinach salad.For beer, they have Peroni, Blue Moon, and Coors Light on tap. We ended up having two Blue Moons, which went really well with the food. They do have some more interesting beers by the bottle, such as a Joseph James stout.  They have a very nice selection of wines but all the red wine is stored on shelves, so it might be too warm.  But they did have a sign outside offering 50% of wine by the bottle on Thursdays so I may have to check that out.  They also carry some sake.  Most of the desserts have coconut.  It's a Thai restaurant so I expect that.  We ended up having the Thai donuts, which were really tasty.  The caramel sauce is supposed to have coconut in it, but I didn't taste it.They took my restaurant.com certificate, no problem.  Service was great - very attentive and helpful.  Small, cute place.  A little dark, especially in the bathroom, but the d√©cor is nice.  Looking at the reviews, I think this restaurant has been paying attention and making adjustments because I didn't have close to the same experience other reviewers had. This restaurant is definitely going on my regular rotation.I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Thai tapas, what a unique idea, but I'd probably still stick with ordering a main dish and some tapas as appetizers to try. Every dish I tried was absolutely amazing. The spice levels were right on point and the ingredients were fresh. We ordered the egg rolls and firecracker shrimp to start. They were delightful. I highly recommend the shrimp. They were seasoned perfectly and had a great spicy flavor. I ordered the panang shrimp curry and my fella tried the green curry with catfish. My panang was pretty good, but the star of the dinner was the green curry. It was incredible and there was avocado on top that complemented the flavors perfectly.The interior is TINY. A little cramped, but decorated nicely and the staff is extremely friendly, warm and attentive. Our water glasses never went unfilled. Our waiter was fantastic. He was incredibly friendly and funny!I'll definitely be back to try some of the other intriguing menu items despite living kinda far from Nittaya's. I highly recommend this place! It's not authentic Thai food, so if you're looking for that, you might be disappointed, but delicious nonetheless.Honestly, the place is a bit pricy, so I'd definitely recommend checking out the restaurant. com site for a discounted gift certificate.A beautiful restaurant in Summerlin.  Great ambience and perfect for date night but but BUT, make a reservation as this place is tiny and has limited number of tables.  I went here for our lunchthey're not too busy for lunch. We got a free sangria with our Yelp check-in.They have a great lunch special menu which comes with a salad with ginger dressing, pot sticker and entree for about $11.  I got pad thai spicy 3 out of 5,drunken noodles spicy 5 out of 5.  My pad thai came out really spicy and the drunken noodles were milder so we swapped towards the end when I was covering my nose with tissue.  Despite that, I thought the food was delicious.Service was great.  Our server was attentive.  The food is more expensive here than other Thai restaurants but this is more upscale Thai cuisine.  I'd have to come back here for their tapas and I know I will be back.I am teetering between a 3 and 4 star review and because of the rocky start to our evening, I am going to have to go with the 3 star for the moment.When we arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 5:30p, this very cute and intimate restaurant was pretty much empty. However, the host asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and said that he wouldn't be able to seat us because it was 1/2 priced wine night, and they'd fill up. Um..okay.... (looking around empty restaurant)... Well, can we sit at the bar? Long pause. How about outside? They hesitated, but said they'd set up one of the outside tables. That was a process that took awhile. Because it was a bit breezy outside, we asked if they could set up the outdoor space heater. Another process.  That finally being settled, we sat down at the somewhat shaky table.From that point forward, things went well enough. The sangria is delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the fried avocado, the veggie potstickers and the mango bacon wrapped shrimp. All of these offerings were very good and again, the presentation was lovely. Service was friendly and pleasant. As the evening progressed, the wind picked up, and even with the space heater, I was downright cold. I asked our server if it was possible to move us inside to finish. We went inside, and while it was busy, there was a small table right by the bar. She said that the reservation wasn't until 7, so we would have plenty of time to complete our meal. So...why weren't we just seated there in the first place?The seating issues did put a bit of a damper on the meal, but I am willing to give Nittaya's another try.I didn't think I'd find a massaman curry better than the one at Chada Thai. But, I did at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Located in a small strip mall on Rampart, this is definitely no secret. If you come on the weekend be prepared for a long wait. The interior is tiny with tables too close together and a bar area that has almost no separation from the dining room. The massaman curry ($16) is excellent, as is their "World famous" spinach salad ($11). Crispy, light tempura batter covers a heaping mound of spinach. Add the chicken  and lime dressing to it and it's unforgettable. For more subtle flavors, the coconut soup ($9) is the way to go with a thin, smooth broth bathing chunks of chicken, tomatoes and mushrooms.If you can get a table, dining at this modern Thai place is worth the trip to the westside suburbs. It may not get the press that other popular Thai places get, but they are more than capable of challenging the heavy hitters in town for the title of best Thai restaurant.The "Not So Secret Salad" is one of my favorite salads in town! It's more of an interpretation than an actual salad, but I don't let that pesky detail get in the way. The dish is tempura-fried spinach leaves with a sweet-and-spicy dressing slash dipping sauce. You can dip the leaves as you go and eat it like nachos, or dump on the dressing and attempt to use a fork. Either way, your taste buds will be quite delighted. You can share this as an app or order it as your main, like I do.Nittaya's Secret Kitchen has $11 lunch specials that include a salad and potsticker, as well as a Happy Hour (Mon-Thurs, 3-6PM). The Not So Secret Salad is also $11 though, so I find myself ordering that instead of branching out to try new things.Small neighborhood place, classy d√©cor and local art, lots of wines available. They have a small section of patio seating, and some day I'll actually try something else on the menu.
Nobuo At Teeter House=Nobuo just knocked one outa the park ! Tonight was an open house and food tasting of the new menu at Nobou at the Teeter house. The place is a small historic home renovated and sits just across from Pizzeria Bianco.  The evening was $15 and we sampled everything on the menu. Is was a full house and the food kept coming. The servers passed Asian Hors'd ouvres to our tables. Every bite was succulent with the freshest of the fresh. A piece of salmon wrapped around a very special little almond drizzled with a unique basil sauce. Pork buns that melted. A square of watermelon with cap of goat cheese, refreshing ! I absoulutely loved the tasting and can't wait to go back for dinner ! This cuisine if something out of the ordinary and very SPECIAL ! This is fine dining in a cool hip place !I should be disqualified from reviewing anywhere that Nobu cooks. My love runs that deep. So I'll just drop off this 5-star and continue to post photos of every delicious meal.I don't do sexy well. All of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness. Drunk on sake from Nobuo, I attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes. He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening. My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption. We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait. While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself, we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns. Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff. The Teeter Tots, Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce, were so good. I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now, but nothing has come close. Now, I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns. But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure, so I gave these guys a shot! Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision ever!Get frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance!Lindsey here, reporting to you live from a self-induced food coma thanks to the delicious cuisine courtesy of Nobuo. Let's see...where shall I begin? I finally had the perfect excuse to check a visit to Nobuo off my list: Yelp Eats! So tonight, fellow yelpers and myself sat in the adorable Teeter house and dined on master cuisine. I began with the refreshing watermelon and goat cheese salad. It was like a never-ending bowl of melon that was perfectly matched with creamy goat cheese. As our table laughed and chatted about everything under the sun, I ordered another appetizer: the teeter tots. Holy tots Napoleon! At first glance, the idea of tofu teeter tots didn't appeal to me too much, but I'm a sucker for anything fried so I decided to give it a try. Well, the fried tofu was smothered with mouthwatering sweet sauce and after one taste, the rest of the table ordered a dish for themselves! In fact, they were so good, Dave N ate them again for dessert! Even if you aren't a tofu lover, I still suggest you get them. They are heavenly. Now let's move on to the entrees. I had half of the soft shell crab sandwich dish and half of the pork belly steamed buns. Both were crafted perfectly. The pork belly steamed buns come on a rice bun and the pork and sauce are complimented perfectly within the bun. The soft shell crab sandwich comes with two small sandwiches. The crab melts in your mouth and the sauce is the perfect addition. If you go with a friend, order both dishes and share! We ended the night with a sweet goodbye known as the orange almond fritters. Imagine four donut holes with ice cream on top and covered in a thick Carmel/orange-like sauce. Perfecto! The atmosphere here is wonderful as well because it's situated in the historic Teeter house. In fact, tonight I learned that this house was occupied by the owner until her death in the 1970s. It's truly a piece of Phoenix history and worth stopping into even if it's just to see the house. But do yourself a favor and stay to dine as well!Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 3:07/14/11My first visit and I already love this place!  It's got everything:  great location in Heritage Square; easy access to nearby parking (w/ validation- sweet!); classy, understated elegance; amiable and demure staff; and the gorgeous and terrific food!  What makes Nobuo stand out from all the downtown eats I've had the pleasure to try, though, is the low-noise level-- one would think that in such a historic building such as this, with wooden floors, wooden furnishings, and many small rooms that can easily fill up fast w/ lively diners, that it could get very noisy indoors, but in the two hours our group spent there, not once did I find it too noisy.  On to the food!  Still satiated from my late lunch, I decided to skip the apps and ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich, since I also wanted to have the Dark chocolate tofu mousse for dessert later.  From the adorable beverage booklet, the iced teas begged to be tried, so I ordered a Lychee red iced tea, which came unsweetened.  [Other selections were Hibiscus oolong iced tea, several varieties of green tea, Ramunes (Japanese flavored sodas, three varieties), sakes, red and white wines, beers, and $11 cocktails.]  Several others had ordered apps and were gracious enough to share-- the Teeter Tots app was a HUGE hit!  So much so, that two Yelpers ordered two servings, and another had three or more!  (The third one was dessert, someone remarked.  LOL)  These fried tofu cubes w/ miso sauce surprised me w/ their delicate crunchy exteriors that then revealed juicy tofu inside, and the spicy miso sauce that they were tossed in was impeccable!  I'm not sure if the twelve Yellow-tail sashimi spoons were house freebies, or if three Yelpers ordered them (four spoons per order), but I really enjoyed the two I had tried.  (I'd initially turned down invitations to try them since they contained avocado, which I love, but the fruit unfortunately does not love me; However, they looked so beautiful and so enticing that I eventually broke down and tried one, minus the avocado.  The first spoonful was exquisite- tangy, garlicky, and clean-tasting, and I had to have another!)  My sandwich was, just as Lindsey wrote, perfectly crafted-- two magnificently-toasted focaccia "buns" housing golden-brown battered small soft-shell crabs, with greens, red onions, and a pepper aioli (I asked that the cucumber be omitted).  I'd definitely order this entree again! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w#gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w  Last, but certainly not least, the deep, silky Dark chocolate tofu mousse, w/ green tea ice cream and candied orange peel was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ  (Notice a pattern here?)  The Orange-almond fritters were fantastic, too, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the mousse!  I'll be back very soon, Nobuo!Nobu offers Japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional Japanese setting.  There were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard Japanese Isakaya (tapas).  My favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible.  The spicy miso sauce was very addictive, and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent.   The soft shell crab sandwich was good, but I think I like it more in a sushi roll.  As for dessert, after seeing everyone's order, I just couldn't resist not to order one for myself.  I have ordered the Orange-almond fritters, the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid, and tasted even better.  The exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing; just wish they have another scoop on it.   I took the pork belly buns home, and tried the next day. The braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a Chinese-style dish that my dad loves.  Actually, I preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun.  I just don't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat.    Overall, I had a superb UYE dinner at Nobu.  I am glad that they participated in Yelp Eats Week.   I hope they will be back for next Yelp Eats Week.  Thanks so much for organizing this, Lindsey!five stars alone based on the grilled tofu salad and the pork belly bunsthis is one of the spots you have to visit on any down town pilgrimage, it's simply one of the best restaurants phoenix has to offer.This is a great , intimate, and special gem of a place with fantastic creations from the James Beard award winning chef, Nobuo, in the Heritage Square's Teeter house, a historical old house with hardard floors and simple understated elegance, all in the heart of DT PHX. In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates, or what one might call "Japa Tapas",  made with attention to detail, flavor and texture, at reasonable prices, this place was part of Phoenix  Yelp's Eats Week recently, with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies.In a cozy, quiet room with only 4 tables, with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations, the two of us split the following:Small BitesKimchi ($6) - napa cabbage, dried shrimp, seasme oil, red chili. Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp, this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor, crisp and crunchy, as a salad rather than a pickled side dish. Excellent!Nasu ($8) - eggplant, bacon, red miso, Tokyo negi - this small bacon wrapped morsels stuffed with eggplanbt and akamiso, with shaveed green onions. (8 small pieces) Heavenly! Others not tried: Shishito Pepper, Watermelon Goat Cheese salad, Tempura Squash Blossom (All $10 or less)Cold DishesYellow Tail Ceviche ($14) - myouga, sesame seed, sherdded taro - a superb blend of textures from the Hamachi to the Taro shavings, caressing the palatte with sultry pleasure (4 pieces)Tako and Tomato ($16) - fresh grilled octupus, house made mozzarella - like a mini-Italian Caprese appetizer, with half a cherry tomato, a small ball of mozzarella, a touch of basil, and a scored, pounded, grilled tender piece of white octupus! Outrageous yet comforting in its combining recognition with a new ingredient! Others not tried: House cured Salmon, Ebi Salad, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Shiromi Carpaccio, Big Eye Tuna Tataki (all $12 - $16)Warm DishesPanko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich ($12) -  housemade focaccia, cucumber, kanzuri aioli - this is not your daddy's crab sandwich! Crispy soft shell, great aioli, a mouth watering delight!Seabass & Mushroom ($14) - seabass baked in parchment, garlic butter, sake, soy - delicate, flaky seabass soaking in a hearty sauce, on a bed of shitaki and enoki mushrooms, with a sweet sake, butter and onion base, tender, yet dripping with exciting goodness like a goddess in heat!Others not tried: Okonomiyaki ($8) - classic Kansai pancake favorite! Pork Belly Buns, Fried Sodt Shell Shrimp, Warm Duck Salad, Yuan Yaki, Foie Gras, Coconut Curry Lamb, (all $10 - $24)DessertChcolate Mouse with Green Tea Ice cream and chocolate syrupThis is a terrific date place, intimate and romantic, or a Foodies orgasm, and all at reasonable prices for the quality of creations and food. We had 2 small bottles of Junmai Sake ($12 eacch) but they have a huge selction of sakes going up to near $600 a bottle, as well as a good selction of beers. Relaxed atmoshere, not hoity toity at all, not attitudes, very down to earth. This is an excellent choice! And of my many reviews, only 10% or less get 5 stars from Wanugee, so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve!Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.The BF and I went to Nobuo last night for the first time with a local dines deal. The place is cute, it's an old house and you sit in one of many small rooms.  As we were seated, we overheard some other people complaining about their experience...uh oh. So, needless to say, I was a little worried. We ordered a whole bunch of things to share. We got the sugar snap peas, the fried and stuffed squash blossom, a special that was fried octopus balls (as in they were in a ball shape....stop being dirty :-P) , the sea bass and mushrooms wrapped in a pouch of sorts, and another special which was local chicken 3 ways. I also got a cocktail, the grog, and we shared the mousse for dessert (it was a pretty indulgent night). Here's the breakdown:Sugar snap peas: this was not my fave, but the BF liked it a lot. It was a little fishy and served cold, and I just didn't totally love it, but he ate it all. Fried squash blossom: I loved this dish! It was stuffed with goat cheese, was light and crunchy, and I thought it was soooo delicious. The BF didn't like it, but he's a goat cheese hater. Octopus balls: The garlicky sauce was good, the breading was good, octopus has a weird texture, but overall, I liked it, they did the best they could I think with this odd ingredient. Sea bass: This was the star of the show...the sea bass was not fishy. It fell apart. It was savory and delicious. The mushrooms were luscious, earthy, and added tons of flavor to the fish....I could eat this fish any day of the week...so yummy. Chicken 3 ways: Again, this was pretty delicious. The chicken was served: panko fried, wasabi grilled, and marinated in a soy onion mixture. The panko fried was good, but pretty expected. The wasabi grilled was awesome, I could feel the spice in my nose and the chicken was so moist, but the clear winner on the plate was the onion soy chicken....oh em gee.... this had such a wonderful savory and sweet flavor. The grog: This cocktail was strong! But it had a nice honey and orange flavor....definitely worth the 11$ because one was certainly enough. The Mousse: oh so chocolately and creamy...the green tea ice cream complemented it very well (and I do not care for green tea desserts). We were told that the secret behind this (and don't read this if it might ruin your experience) is that they use tofu in it to give it that silky texture...brilliant!Overall, I really enjoyed our meal there and would definitely go back again (although I would order a little less cuz we were stuuuuuffed).
Perk Eatery=I went here a couple of weeks ago for a Smunch get together.  We had a group of about 10 spread across two tables.  This was sort of a basic breakfast/lunch place but a bit on the larger side and with lots of diners it had a good feel to it.  Service was great and they did not bat an eyelash at the few special requests made.My first menu choice was eliminated because they did not have gravy that morning so I went with the potato pancakes.  Not impressed, they were very sweet owing to the onions chosen and were thin and burnt a bit around the edges.  The side of corned beef hash however was excellent, shaved corned beef mixed with their rosemary potatoes.Being a half hour drive in the wrong direction I wouldn't go back on my own but I would certainly recommend it for a meeting place with somebody in the area.After hearing that the owners of Perk Eatery were from Michigan, I think I got my hopes up that they'd be able to make fluffy omelettes like I get back home... unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  However, I did enjoy my meal at this little locally owned restaurant.  I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).Would I return? Sure.  Am I rushing back? No, but I don't want to deter you from checking it out.  And please let me know if you are more "perked up" after dining at Perk than I am!5/10/12Finally made my first visit today.  Funny- I told the greeter that I'd been waiting to try Perk for years, yet I added the bookmark just last year.  May 8, 2011, to be exact.  Anyhoo, the restaurant looked better than a roadstop diner- a lot better.  After reading a few reviews, I was expecting worse.  There were actually some nice pieces of wall art.  Overall, I liked the energy inside, even though there were only two or three other diners present at the time.  Since I'd already checked out the menu online, I had two choices in mind to try (French toast or pancakes), which would depend on what the daily/weekly special was, and what the "nut" was in their caramelized banana nut topping for the pancakes, French toast, and waffles.  Since the special "for a few days" was Pumpkin pecan pancakes and pecans were the only nuts on hand, and I've a pecan allergy, I was reduced down to the fresh berries topping, and so I ordered the French toast combo, with soft-scrambled eggs, spicy chorizo ($7.99 menu price) and a cappuccino ($2.99).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw?select=U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ#U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQWas excited to try another organic eatery since there are only a few in town, but I'm a bit disappointed on this first visit to Perk Eatery.  The eggs were fine, and the spicy chorizo complemented them well.  (The salt in the chorizo created a nice balance with the unseasoned eggs!)  The French toast had a nice crisp to them and were not at all greasy, but I guess I was just expecting more.  It didn't have enough custard for me, and I suppose I'm used to a little bit more decadence... mascarpone cream, caramel, creme fraiche, or just plain butter, even.  At least the pancake syrup was 100% maple.  (Can't recall if it's organic, though.)  The eggs served here are local Hickman Farms cage-free, so that's a plus.  Would love to see this updated to organic in the future.  The cappuccino was made with organic Passport coffee, and it was good, but I'm not used to seeing such a stark white froth, and so thick!  No matter- I got over it  quickly.  :)Restaurant and women's restroom were clean and organized.  Service was friendly, and I liked the frequency in which Daniel and other employees (owner/managers?) came by to check up on things.  I thought it cool that someone (he struck me as a manager, or co-manager) handed me another napkin just a couple of seconds after maple syrup dripped from my plate onto the napkin on my lap.  Good eye!  While the French toast was, to me, underwhelming, it hasn't stopped me from following Perk Eatery on Twitter to try the Lemon-ricotta pancakes when they're on special.Note to Perk: Please update your breakfast menus to reflect the price change of the French toast combo.  A $2 upcharge for a one-person ticket is no big deal, especially if everything on the menu is organic, but I don't know if I'd be as nonchalant about it if I brought in a larger party and the ticket reflected a higher discrepancy...My recent breakfast at Perk was OK.  The food was good, but the lackluster service will make me think twice about coming back.My mom and I both enjoyed our breakfast burritos (mine with bacon and hers with ham).  They were smaller than I anticipated, but tasted good, especially when topped with the side of cilantro jalapeno sauce.  However, our waitress was pretty brusque - no interaction at all after taking our orders.  It would have been nice if she could have managed to come by to check on us, refill our water/my mom's coffee or even make eye contact at all.  The restaurant was NOT busy - less than half of the tables were occupied.  I had to ask the hostess for both a water refill and our bill.  When our waitress finally showed up with the check, she slapped it on the table without even breaking her stride, all while looking out the window.  Hello!?  No 'thank you', or 'have a nice day'.Eh...  I can make my own breakfast burrito, thanks.Haven't seen some girlfriends in a while and they suggested meeting up for breakfast, the place picked was Perk Eatery so off we went!We were a party of 6 and I met up with everyone around 9:45ish on a Sunday, and what a cute place this is, like the vibe of it! This place was also featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives (I personally have never seen any of those shows, but do happen to wind up at places that Guy has been too) I ordered the Outlaw Scramble, came with 3 eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, saut√©ed onions, green peppers covered in cheddar cheese and topped with this amazing cilantro jalapeno green sauce also severed with a side of county style rosemary potatoes. I also got a side of Corned Beef country style hash.  The corned beef hash was DELISH, I loved the flavor of the corned beef, this Irish girl was happy for sure!  The Outlaw Scramble, man that's a great dish, my eyes were bigger then my tummy so I didn't finish everything, but what I had was so good! The green sauce OMG amazing!!  I have to say I did have plate envy for a minute or 2 , my friend next to me ordered something that is not on the menu, but was featured on the show, the Breakfast Enchiladas, 2 enchiladas with slow roasted pork, green chilies, black beans rolled up in corn tortillas covered in red sauces and topped with 2 eggs,  I did something I never ever do and asked for a bite of her food. OMG that stuff was amazing! I want to go back now and order it for myself! The red sauce has a kick to it, its soo soo good! Damn good breakfast enchiladas! Look forward to going back!Perk Eatery was the place picked for May's Breakfast Club UYE, and I for one was pretty excited for this! I adore Perk Eatery, haven't found a dish I didn't like. The food is greatWe were a group of 14 and service was good, everyone was taken care of and coffee cups were kept filled.Since finding this place back in Dec I have become a very big fan, and since my 1st visit they have expanded the place and took over the shop next door, and have a bar inside too, loving the new look Perk!This time around I went with the corned beef country style hash,  its rosemary potatoes, nice thick slices of corn beef topped with melted swiss cheese and served with 2 eggs, I had scrambled and also had English muffin (you can get any kind of toast you want, but I love me some English muffins) . Other than the Breakfast Enchiladas, the corned beef hash is a favorite dish of mine! It's just sooo dang good. I love the thick slices of corned beef and country styled potatoes omg YES! I don't think I can ever have corned beef hash any other way. I've been ruined haha. If you haven't tried the corned beef hash, you should but also everything else is delsih too! I crave the corn beef hash and the breakfast enchiladas, oh and that cilantro jalapeno sauce is amazing too, oh yes I know I will continue to keep coming back.I must admit I don't quite get Perk. I've eaten here several, actually many, times. I started as a curious DDD watcher, sharing the obligatory Wine Country French Toast. Pretty good. The favorite of our group on that first visit, however, was the rosemary breakfast potato. I was mystified, however, as to why DDD was drawn to this Scottsdale locale. Perhaps the crew wanted to stay at the Westin resort across the street. I've returned over time with several different diners in tow, sampling pancakes... The potatoes were never again quite as good as I remembered, varying quite a bit visit to visit. Other items seemed Denny's-like. Never felt a welcoming vibe. I've lived in the Scottsdale/PV area for many years, so I'm used to "Snotsdale" attitude common in the area. Maybe they're just catering to DDD tourists. Hard to say.On this day I dropped in by myself. Wanted to try their Belgian waffle, an item I'd never tried at Perk. Wanted a cup of coffee. Was seated and then waited. And waited. No coffee. No water. No welcome. That's the review I've been procrastinating about, I thought. I've been here often and still do not feel particularly welcome. At prime time. The hierarchy was all there. Not busy. I finally got up and left. No one said anything to me. Hmm. I drove down Greenway to the very non-Snotsdale Country Boys at 32nd Street. Only my second time there. They recognized me from a prior conversation, one unlike any I've ever had at Perk. They poured me coffee before I had time to open the menu. What a contrast. The 40th Street Caf√© is another Greenway Road breakfast spot I'd recommend ahead of Perk. Perk's food is at times interesting, perhaps more interesting than the other restaurants mentioned above, but the restaurant is missing the warmth and consistency you hope for in a neighborhood breakfast joint.As someone who is a confirmed corned beef hash lover I was really looking forward to coming here. It may not be the best hash I have had but it is in the top three. It also came recommended from a Yelp friend.  My wife went with the Wine Country French Toast which she loved. It has Brie cheese sandwiched between two large slices of French Toast topped with roasted grapes and a Rosemary wine syrup.  Needless to say I went with the Corned Beef Country Style Hash.  Our server explained how it is prepared every morning and made to order.  It was accompanied by two sunny side up eggs and two thick slices of whole wheat toast. Apparently within the last couple of years business has grown exponentially as they have expanded to the space next door and have added a bar. I would have loved to try the Bloody Mary but was driving.Maybe next time I'll give try.Oh Breakfast Club, just what would we do without you? I for one would probably eat a lot less breakfast, that's for sure.The long trek ensued from my humble abode in Cenpho, Monica, I hope you know I don't travel this far for just anyone. Finally landing on the huevos rancheros, my taste buds were excited to dig in. The cilantro jalepeno sauce was delicious with a good mixture of spice and flavor, it was tasty.With a decent sized group of 12 or so, the staff were able to accommodate us without many hiccups at all. We all chatted, got to know each other more, hung out, and had a great time. Be sure to try this place out soon!Happy Yelping Phoenix!
Restaurant Cuisine Cantonaise=This place is located in the heart of Chinatown, the reason we decided to try it out was because we were asking around for a good chinese place and we happened to stubble upon the owner's daughter along with her friends. She told us the restaurant is good, and we believed her, simple as that!The decor was bad and next to our table were the electrical wires that lit up the street sign, it was a little scary, because one move and you turn into the fried duck they were serving the table next to us.Anyway, we were blown away by the food. seriously!! I got the beef and chinese broccoli and my friend got the spicy shrimp and scallops, and we got the fried rice. It was one the best chinese meals I had in a while now.I will definitely come back when/if i am back in the beautiful city of Montr√©al.
SaBai Modern Thai=After a day of shopping for fortune plants, I had a golden opportunity to take my lovely mom to Sabai. We were exhausted and we were famished, so I suggested to have lunch here since we were in the area. The restaurant itself is rather roomy and clean. Pink flowers adorn every table which I thought was special. Buddha sculptures and fortune plants are also on display. They were running a lunch special entree for $8  which includes a soup or salad.I ordered the veggie delight and a Thai lemonade and mom dearest got the Pad Thai and Thai tea. The service here was super quick and the dishes were delicious.The chef definitely made the dishes pretty and our waitress was super nice. The only thing that bothered me was the music. It was a tad loud and distracting, so it was hard to enjoy a good meal.That said, I'm giving them 4 stars.SaBai Thai has become my new go-to place. I absolutely love the dishes, the service, the ambiance, and the overall experience!This Wendy's converted building is quite deceiving. The inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. At night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, SaBai Thai is a perfect spot to take a date. They have an EXCELLENT happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of Sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on HH). I generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant. As far as food is concerned, I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well. The staff is incredibly friendly, especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. His wife, Holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect Modern Thai environment.In additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have GREAT hours, especially for an Asian restaurant. Most Thai places close from 3-5 and don't do Sunday lunch service. SaBai Thai's modern take grants us Thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!I think even Mr. Sheen would agree, SaBai Thai is a WINNER!!!On my last visit to Phoenix we hungry ( yet lazy) so we decided to order delivery from SaBai Modern Thai.  We found the website very easy to use.  The menu items are sorted by type of food: appetizers, soups and salads, house specialties, stir fried entrees, etc.  When you select any item, a window appears asking you to designate a spice level for that particular dish on a scale of no spice, medium, Thai hot, mild, or hot.  You can also designate special instructions such as no onions.  I ordered my dish Thai hot, but my fellow diners stuck to the mild level.  I chose the Mussaman which consists of braised boneless beef short ribs in classic mussaman curry with potatoes, carrots, onions, whole peanut and cinnamon essence.Our food was delivered quickly; everything was still hot, and the food was packaged securely enough that none of it spilled.  Things started out very well.  They ended well, too.  The dishes were generously portioned and quite delicious.  I couldn't finish all of my rice and curry, so I had enough left over for breakfast the next morning.  I didn't try any of my brother's dishes, so I can't comment on those, but mine was delicious.The convenience of having food delivered right to the apartment was quite a treat.  I'd definitely order from here again.It started great.  The coco soup and lettuce wrap started were impeccable.  We ordered an entree to share trying to save room for dessert. The Pad Thai arrived and looked beautiful.  I have had this dish before here and really enjoyed it.  My son put a spoonful on my plate and one on his.  He tasted a shrimp and immediately said something was off. He decided to just avoid the shrimp and continue with the meal.  I took a bite of chicken and that had a sour taste.  We took a couple of bites of noodles.  No problem there.  The waitress came and I told her that the shrimp and chicken tasted odd.  She mentioned the chef put fish seasoning on them and that could be it.  She also wanted to know if I had tasted their Pad Thai before. Yes, and it was quite tasty a month ago.  The waitress took the platter and two plates away.  She came back and said because we ate half of the dish, the restaurant would only charge 50% of the $12 price.  Hummmmm, half of the platter was gone because it was on our two plates uneaten!The waitress also said I should have told her immediately.   The first time you checked, wasn't soon enough?Sad and disappointing.  Ultimately I did not have to pay for the dish but the restaurant acted like they were doing me a favor and I was a cheat.I called in an order of their Coco soup to eat for a cozy Sunday dinner. It was good, but not the best that i've ever had. It did cure my craving, and was jam packed with chicken which was a major plus. I completely recommend ordering a side of rice to put in the soup, it makes it a meal! It took a while for a call in order (About 25 mins) and the restaurant wasn't very busy but I do have to give props to the lady that took my order, she was VERY friendly! Since my favorite Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays, I would come back here as a replacement since it is in the hood! :)
Tasty Thai Restaurant=Small place, big flavor! This Thai restaurant is worthy of its name. The exterior of the building may be very generic, but inside it is very clean and cozy, with a friendly staff adding to the overall warmth of the place. The food is very well seasoned, the heat tempered to your taste, with individual flavor elements like toasted garlic and spices distinct without being overly assertive. The food is well priced, too. This is certainly a place for numerous repeat visits.
Strip N Dip Chicken Strips=Healthy eats for $5.75 (including drink).. *Swoon*! Although I was basically trying to eat "healthy", I tried the grilled, fried, and baked strips (I did it for Yelp - how can I rate a place without trying it all?)! I'm with Ann Marie - the grilled were actually my favorite. They put just enough glaze on them to give them flavor without being overpowering. They were grilled to order (guy threw them on the grill right when I placed my order!) and were so delicious. Baked wasn't all that special, but fried were awesome ! No idea how they aren't greasy ? Panko ..mmmm.. so light, so fresh, and so "not fried" tasting. Love it ! I was thrilled to death to get 2 skewers of fresh delicious veggies with my chicken (green peppers, onions, tomatoes - yum!). I also tried a plethora of sauces. For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce. My coworker was very pleased to find liquid cheese (like that kind that put on nachos at ballparks!), but I couldn't stop eating the BFG house sauce. It kinda reminds me of In-n-out special sauce, but yummier. It's a simple concept, but executed well. A good value, healthy, and delicious !This place was on my 'To Do List" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!I like Raising Cane's, its close to school and home, drive thru available, always hot, and the toast.. sometimes I go there just for the toast, but thats the problem. I can't be going to my chicken finger spot and only looking forward to the toast. Nooooow... lets pretend I am married to Raising Canes then.. BFG would be my mistress, cheap, hidden, ultra friendly, gives more than receives, and satisfies. Since I've cheated it would only be fair that I compare my lover and my new mistress. Raising Cane's Box Combo (6.89) versus BFG anything (5.75). The drink- Both locations offer similar drinks, coke, diet coke, orange fanta, sprite, and etc.. so thats a tie . The dip- Canes has ketchup and that brown gravy cane's sauce. BFG has 8 dipping sauces (guessing here), from a range of sweet honey mustard to the wassabi cream that brings a little spice to your life. My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.  The side- At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG. EL POLLO (CHICKEN)- Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG. Oh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.It is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop.The food is good here, but the customer service is phenomenal! Yes, I said phenomenal. The guy who took our order and served us our food was super attentive, funny, and an overall awesome person! My friend's car died because she left her headlights on and he jumped her car for her! :) That's customer service baby! :POn to the food... I ordered the baked chicken strips and tasted the fried chicken strips. The winner is FRIED CHICKEN! Doesn't it always win? The mac & cheese is creamy just the way I like. They had many sauces to choose from, but I'm not a sauce person so I just chose whatever.Note: This place isn't big at all and the seating is limited to about 20 people total. I will be back... I wish they had a drive-thru!I've been meaning to come for a long time. I pass by it all the time to/from work and it's either too early or too late.Jin greets us and like what most Yelpers said asked for our names and asked if it's our first time.BF and I both got the "Create Your Own" combo with fried strips, mac and cheese and each a wasabi sauce, BFG for me, and sweet chili for him. While we were waiting he asks, "are either of you Yelpers?" I thought it was rather curious question but I said "yes". He then explained that it's because he noticed a pattern of ordering that first timers who get what I got tend to be Yelpers because they read what is considered the "best".  On the way there I was reading the reviews and he's right.....and about 10 of the reviews are people I know. Haha. So there- they know youre a Yelper if you're getting the "best of" box. Then he asked about us and told us a bit about himself and Tin. The strips were juicy, crispy and not oily at all. I love they have a variety to sauces to suit your mood to dress it up but even alone it was nicely seasoned. I loved the wasabi sauce..a little bit of zing and a bit of sweet. The chili sauce is not that thai chili sauce from the bottle and was tasty with a hit of cilantro in it. BFG has a good tang. Garlic bread has slices of garlic on it. Yay! I kinda eat a lot of garlic so it makes me happy (sorry if I sit next to you while I sweat, haha). Mac and cheese is very cheesy and gooey. I hate when baked gets dry but this had a lot of cheesy goodness. If this was open late then I'd probably never go to Cane's. We only go there because it's fresh and open late. I'll steal my Yelp bestie Angela H.'s word- it's "normalicious". Delicious, doing simple comfort food right. As we were sitting there enjoying our food, Jin came to check on us and refill drinks so even though its counter service, they sit wait on peoples tables. We also listened to convos and he greeted a few people coming in by their name. If he remembers everyone that's pretty impressive. We'll find out the next time we come in.No, for reals! BFG, man! B... F'ing... G!I've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!I ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!When we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!The best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son! And wha!?PUT SOME WASABI CREAM IN YO MOUTH!!Came here with my yelp-izzles a couple weeks ago. LiLy D and I popped our BFG cherries. Elnino F was back for round 2. Owner Jin Choe asked us for our names and he remembered that we had actually met a week earlier when he was picking up food from Soyo where me and a group of the yelp-izzles were getting our drink on. I noticed that he was on a first name basis with all his customers. That's what's up!What I ordered:#1-4 Baked Strips-Baked Mac & Cheese-Garlic Bread-2 Sauces (I picked Wasabi Cream and Buffalo)-Reg. Drink (Arnold Palmer)Everything was yummy yummy in my tummy. The Wasabi Cream sauce was the bomb-diggity!! The service was excellent. Jin came around numerous times to make sure everything was alright and that our sodas were topped off. I will mos def come back to try other items from the menu and the whatever the weekly special is.Thanks for dinner LiLy!I know- how many flippin' review updates am I gonna do?!But it's a BFG first (I think) to have a fan family.It's already known the BF and I already love this place but we brought mom and grandma so their opinion matters.....the place is mom and grandma approved! My mom in law likes their mac n cheese a lot and for a person who doesn't like chicken, admits this is pretty good chicken. Grandma has been wanting chicken strips and she loved it. She's already talking about coming back. We also shared the chicken nachos so I'm 2 of 4 on the specials. Pretty good and a decent portion for $3.25. We all had a plate so we were sttuuuuffffeeeddd, but Jin totally pulled my leg to get it (thanks- I will get it again). The chicken strip phenomenon still perplexes me- so simple but it's crazy how much people it attracts. I love it so I am not complaining. Now I'm keeping an eye on Tin because there has to be some magical voodoo dust in the panko. I have not met a person with bad things to say about BFG yet I've met people who will talk shit even about Joel Robuchons food. One of my friends from Los Angeles knows about BFG and I wasn't the one who told them...seems like the chicken did more than cross the road. Vegas now and onto west coast domination?Have to agree with the positive reviews posted about BFG Chicken Strips.  They serve a simple menu, but the execution of their chicken strips is spot on. Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.It is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right. I tried Combo #1 (maybe not the "healthy" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.About the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.Tinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!Food: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips.Service: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here.Location:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95.Parking: 5/5  The parking lot is large, it should not be a problem.The Skinny: great fried and grilled chicken with awesome unique dipping sauces with some so-so sides(4) Service: even though it's counter service, you get the warm and fuzzies when the owner makes it a point to get to know you (5) Value: a great plate of food (plus fountain drink) for only $5.75 plus get your 10th combo plate for free? - bring it on!(5)Planted in a rather large strip mall, this place is rather inconspicious. Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!Combo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).The grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.The other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.The reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.These are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.Finally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it). This place has the makings of a great neighbourhood joint and I can't wait to come back here again!Okay, enough already!  The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!BFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  The menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.With five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. Their fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.Of course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.And there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!Another perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  And finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.I also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  Their only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to try this place out today!I came with my mom for a late lunch after a full day of shopping. We shared the grilled chicken strips with veggie skewers and the fried chicken strips with the baked mac n cheese. Everything was out of this world delicious and the service was so incredibly friendly and welcoming. I'm a big fan of the fried strips, but I think I almost liked the grilled ones a little better. The mac n cheese was phenomenal and super duper cheesy. Just how I like it. They have an incredible sauces too! My favorite was the wasabi cream. So perfect!The food was incredible, so was the service and on top of all that the prices were beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity that you get. Winner winner, chicken dinner! I'll be back... and soon!Awesome Mac & Cheese!SITREPI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.THE MAC MENUMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate "Classic American Eats", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!SPECIAL PREPARATION!BFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of "cheesification".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)THE LOWDOWNIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.So BFG was created and owned by Jin and Tin who has now sold it to someone. Now, whenever ownership changes there is always a worry if it is for better or worse of the food and service. When a place that had a frontman bursting with personality that built a rapport with people, it's admittedly hard to not miss that. I am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi. I like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that. Service is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial... Still, if you want some good basic comfort food chicken strips, this is where I go and you should too.I think I am in love!!!After hearing about BFG Chicken Strips for months through the grapevine, I was finally able to get over there today and check this joint out.  And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!As the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.  The mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.A great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?So yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out.They put in a fancy soda dispenser and, in order to compensate for the new expense (along with "rising food costs"), have dropped the drinks from being included in their meals. I only got the Gold Peak tea to begin with, so the machine doesn't do anything for me. They also raised the prices of the meals to add insult to injury. I removed one star for removing drinks from the meals and one star for raising the prices while simultaneously giving less. Probably won't be a regular here any longer. The days of BFG are over. Just doesn't seem worth it to support this place anymore. The kid at the counter is still really great with customer service though. He's always friendly and attentive. Just don't like the direction this company is headed in. There are plenty of other places to get my chicken fix.Chicken strips & Thai ice tea ~ why not?Lots of mixed feelings on this place. I came here for two reasons: Yelpers seem to love this place & they have funnel cakes! It's hard to ignore funnel cakes! This place is located in a very large strip mall & walking in I have to say I was not impressed. It was run down. The decor itself is nothing special but I let that slide when things are tidy. They weren't. It was also dirty. Trash on the floors, everything seemed out of place & the kitchen area which is open shouldn't be because there was shit everywhere. For a moment I thought to myself, this can't be it. We ordered the fried strips that come in panko which were great. Fries were ok. Garlic toast was really good & my man loved the hot chick. We also had the baked strips with mac & cheese, both good. Overall the food was good. They gave a wide variety of side sauces & I loved trying most of them. My favorites were the honey mustard & sweet chili. The Thai tea was my least favorite item of the evening as it was bitter & needed more sugar (super disappointing). Now to the funnel cake. AMAZING! It was perfect & couldn't get any better. By far the highlight! I appreciated the pop art (always a good thing to see) but the place really needs a facelift. It also really needs to be cleaned. I didn't take pics of all the issues but someone needs to rescue this place. The food is good & it would taste even better if the atmosphere was improved. Food gets 4 stars but atmosphere & cleanliness get 2 so I settled on an overall rating of 3.It's a good sign when a place is packed with people because that usually means the food is bomb! It wasn't even an hour into Strip-N-Dip being open, and it was packed in there... I decided to order the food to-go because there wasn't enough seating, even after waiting and receiving the food. That wasn't a problem, though, because waiting for these chicken strips was so worth it. The place may be hidden by the building next to it, so if you're getting directions through your phone or GPS, then just keep driving and you'll see it. The interior was black and red with checkered flooring. Everything looked clean and well-maintained. It's a bit small with limited seating, so if you come in on a busy day, chances are there will literally be no seats available. I got the 6 fried chicken strips, which comes with a small slice of garlic bread, 3 sauces, and your choice of side. I also got one baked and one grilled strip a la carte, so I can taste the differences... I am not disappointed in what I got!The baked strip was juicy and tender. I feel like sometimes when chicken strips are being cooked, no matter the method, they run the risk of becoming dry on the inside. I think Strip-N-Dip nailed their cooking techniques because none of their strips came out dry. The grilled strip had the distinct "grill" taste. It was juicy as well, and would be the best thing in between bread for a chicken strip sandwich. The majority of the other strips I had were fried. The fried strips were perfect! The panko breading was a golden brown with a good crunch, and the chicken inside was tender... They hit the bullseye on all of their chicken strips, so I don't think anyone would be disappointed in ordering a certain type. As for the sauces, I got: the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and their strip sauce. The wasabi cream had the subtle taste of wasabi, but with no spiciness. It's a more of a creamy sauce (like their strip sauce), so it's better paired off with the fried strips. The honey mustard, which is a classic, was sweet and paired well with every type of strip. Oh! And they offer Thai iced tea/coffee and funnel cake -- perfect menu items to satisfy your "just desserts" appetite. Strip-N-Dip did not fail to deliver. If you're ever looking for a spot that serves chicken strips that are NOT from Cane's, then this is the spot for you!
Biaggio's Pizzeria=Stopped by this evening to attend a Tweetup at this joint.  My friend was hosting the Tweetup and I love Pizza, so why not?  I'm glad I made it!There was a special buffet of food setup just for the event.  Salad, Chicken Wings, Baked Ziti, and of course Pizza!  The Pizzas that were available were Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Chicken & Artichoke, and Cheese.  I ate a slice of every Pizza, a little Salad, about a dozen Wings, and a small portion of Baked Ziti.  I wasn't planning on eating that much...I swear....but the food was sooo good and the owner, Biaggio, came out and insisted that we try everything!  How could I say no?The Pizza is NY style thin crust.....and damn it's awesome.  It folds just right and the proportion of Cheese and Sauce is perfect.  The Meat on the Meat Lover's Pizza is something else too....I don't know if I could ever be a Vegetarian.  I suggest eating the Pizza fresh as the slices can get greasy fast...especially with the Meat Lovers.The Wings were served plain with the Hot Sauce and Dipping Sauces on the side.  Biaggio told us that the Salad Dressing/Dipping Sauces are all made from scratch in the kitchen.  The Bleu Cheese dressing was awesome....didn't have any of the others.  The Wings are battered and were cooked just right....not too greasy, which is how I like them.The Salad was ok....I didn't have much of it though because I ate so much of everything else.  The Baked Ziti was great too.....the Cheese was gooey and full of flavor.After I was done eating, Biaggo brought out Fried Dough sprinkled with Sugar & Chocolate....I had to have a bite....yum!  Then he brought out a cake for his Son's Birthday....what, more food?!  I took a couple of slices home....I couldn't eat any more.Overall, the event was fun and the food was plentiful and awesome.I spied the menu and saw that they serve Breakfast too.....I don't know how I'm going to lose any weight with this place in existence!Will I return?  Are you kidding me?!  I want to try Breakfast and their Subs, and a bunch of other things on their menu....of course I'll be back!Saturday night and the family wanted pizza. We headed over to Biaggio's to see what all the hype was about and it didn't disappoint. We walked in, were greeted by Biaggio (the owner) and his staff and grabbed a seat. We ordered a medium supreme pizza and a slice of cheese pizza for my two year old. While waiting they brought out a complimentary meatball and some bread. The meatball was amazing -- made in-house with a mixture of pork, veal, and some other stuff I don't remember.The wait for the pizza took a little while and when Biaggio checked on our order he found out that they made a meat lovers pizza by mistake. He came out and apologized and said that he would bring it out so we could munch on it while our correct order was being made. The meat lovers pizza was delicious, filled with house made sausage and bacon. Our supreme came out a short time after and that pizza was equally amazing. One of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. Despite all the cheese and sauce the crust remained crispy. That's something other pizzerias fail at.They boxed up the pizza we couldn't finish and on our way out they thanked us for coming and said if it wasn't a five-star experience he'd make it one next time. While I don't normally like it when businesses solicit stellar reviews from customers, the food and service was so good that I can't give them anything less than top marks. Now that Ciao Ciao is closed this will no doubt be our go-to pizza joint.Biaggio joins Bo from Yi Mei Champion Deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet. People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).5 starsI hate to go against the grain, but as a true pizza connoisseur, it would be wrong to hold back on this one. For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. I do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having "burnt" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. I thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. In fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!). This pizza may be appealing to some, but this isn't anything like the pizza served in NY.I have never been treated so badly by a restaurant. I take back my previous statement that the owner is friendly. Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that "wasn't the service" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, "We're out." He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again. You don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to "The customer is always right?" When did it become "The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?"  All he had to do when I came in was say, "I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better," and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back. Not with an owner that treats customers that way.It hurts to write this update.  Biaggio and his staff are super friendly and will bend over backwards to get things right.  Maybe this just wasn't their night last week.  But it still shows how far they'll go for customer satisfaction.   7:45pm: We feel like a pizza.  Just moved closer to Biaggio and the last 2 experiences we had there were good so what the heck.  I order a large supreme with extra cheese.  The lady over the phone tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.  8:10pm: I arrive and the cook informs the cashier he hasn't even started my order yet.  She seems shocked.  There was some grumbling back there with Biaggio and the staff.  Biaggio come up to me and apologizes profusely for the mishap, gives me my $23 back and said he would take care of me the next time as well.  I didn't think it was that big a deal and did not make a stink over it at all.  I said it would not be necessary to take care of me on the next trip and tipped $3 to the staff.  The pizza comes out unusually fast and I go home.8:27 and 24 seconds:  Arrive home and bring the pizza to the dining table and my wife takes the first bite.  The green peppers are COLD.  The pizza is not even warm and the consistency of the cheese is weird.  It was as if the cook took a cheese pizza that had been sitting out for a while and attempted to reheat it with the toppings he just added.  I thought I could just ignore all this and eat it but after half a slice, I called the restaurant and explained the situation.  The cashier offers to deliver a hot one to my house at no additional cost.  Fine!  Why would the cook think he could get away with giving me that first pizza?  Did he just think we wouldn't notice?  It was kind of offensive.  I've never returned a pizza ever before!  I couldn't believe it. 9:03: New hot pizza arrives and it's definitely oozing with cheese.  It doesn't have as much pepperoni or sausage but still way better than the first one.  The thing was that this new pizza was NOT five stars.  Not even close.  I could rattle off 5 other places off the top of my head that were better than this.         But the service, effort and attempt to do right is what saves it from giving them 2 stars.  I honestly believe this could've been just a bad night but I hadn't eaten there in over a year and won't give it five stars if it doesn't deserve it and tonight it certainly did not.  I am coming back for wings and pastrami but on the border for pizza.given latest move, I spend more time at the LVAC gym at Flamingo/215 than the Eastern location.  I have a new rule - when megabucks or Powerball lotto jackpots exceed $100 million, I drive to the NV/Cali border to buy tickets.  well, they are both currently over $100 million so on Wednesday, post work out, I start the drive, but, it is lunch time and since Biaggio's is nearby, how about a few slices to go ?I opt for the two slice soda special costing $6.  While waiting, talked to owner about how long it's been since my last visit.  The owner is a hoot - an old school guy !the slices took a little longer than it should given they were not busy - who knows, maybe it was a fresh pie being cooked.Anyways, the pizza was above average.  First of all, I was appreciated of having bite sized pieces of sausage on top - seems simple enough but last several pizza experiences involved "sausage strips"  not to my liking.  I really liked the crust - thin but not paper thin, had a crunch to it yet also some softness, too. could have used a tad bit more sauce but not a major issue.Overall, worth a return if i'm hankering for pizza post-work out or in the area for other escapades.pic includedI really wish I loved this place as much as everyone else does because it is ridiculously close to where I live. Unfortunately, it fell short of the hype.I ordered delivery from Biaggio's and everything went fine, nice person over the phone, delivery was on time (you'd hope so since I could literally walk there). My gripe was with the pizza itself, along with the side orders I had.I've had pizza in NYC, this is not NYC style. The crust is much thicker, the sauce was thick and the cheese made a hard layer over the top. You know that kind of cheese, that would all just come off in one piece? It was like that. The crust itself had small bumps on the bottom which means it was probably baked in a pizza tray, and not just tossed and slid into the oven. All of this is perfectly acceptable if this is your taste, but it's not for me.I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, and the salad came topped with olives, cheese, tomatoes and cucumber. The tomatoes were mealy and tasteless because they had been in the fridge for too long. The dressing wasn't as sharp as I'd like and I ended up adding some red wine vinegar at home.I ordered the zucchini sticks specifically because it said "sticks." I hate zucchini rounds, because when they're cut like that, they get overcooked and loose their texture. It also means a lot more breading, and rounds are always breadcrumbs. I like zucchini sticks that are beer battered, and was hoping these would be like that, but knew not to expect the beer batter. I was disappointed, since I was expecting sticks at least.All of these things I think mostly come down to a preference, but I didn't see the same quality everyone else did. I might end up giving this place another try, but with Those Guys also in the vicinity, it'll be tough for me to break away after my first experience.Service is excellent & very friendly. Establishment was clean.Value is good... $5.99 for 2 large slices and a drink.Pizza is average. We ordered the pineapple & ham slices, which were ok. I ordered the "Art of Chicken" which consisted of diced white meat chicken, artichokes, peppers, garlic and black olives. The picture shown in the restaurant was nothing close to what I got. The toppings were piled on after, on a sauceless cheese slice. I guess this is how they customize each plain slice. What bothered me the most was the smell of dirty dish rag that kept wafting from the pizza or was it the parmesan cheese shaker? It was hard to say. I didn't enjoy it at all, but luckily I did get a backup slice of cheese as my 2nd pick. The cheese slice was good, but swimming in a pool of grease. Be careful not to splash it on your clothing like I happened to do.I wish I enjoyed it more as the people in there were very nice and kept asking, "was it delicious?". I didn't have the heart to say "no...", so I just nodded.There is a certain smell of garlicky sauce, a hot pizza oven, etc. when you first walk into a really good pizza place that unfortunately Biaggio's lacked.3.5stars...I was craving chicken wings tonight during a Netflix marathon but was too lazy to get out of the house so I turned to yelp for some help. Chicken wings: Ordered 30 wings. These wings are so good! Fried and juicy without being too oily. They arrived hot and crispy with sauces on the side. Garlic knots: I'd pass on these. We ordered an order of 6 and only finished 1. Fries: Nothing special...White pizza slice w/ mushrooms: Underwhelming to say the least. It tasted as if it was left out all day. The slice was cardboard-like. The cheese reminded me of rubber. I tried reheating it in the oven but it didn't help much. The chicken wings were absolutely delicious but everything else was disappointing. I have a feeling that the wings may have held up the order which would explain why everything else arrived cold. The order came out to $50 before tip. Overall, I'm happy with the order.  My cravings for good wings was satisfied and I got to finish an entire season of House of Cards without leaving the house.
Aloha A Go Go=WHERE: Located in the plaza on Charleston & Sloan.WHEN: 10am-930pm, I believe.WHY: If you happened to just recently move around this side of town, and are desperately in need of some quick and great tasting Hawaiian food, look no further!WHAT: I had got off from work and straight home to some hungry brothers of mine! We debated on what type of food to eat, and came to conclude we were all craving some good old Hawaiian food! I would usually drive that 5 minutes to Island Flavor, but the 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes from our new place! Boohooo!!! =(I then decided to search on Yelp, and I was lucky enough to spot this SPOT. Muahaha!!First thing's first. We step in to order. My brother and I both get the chicken combo, while my other brother gets the local plate. (Most plates are 8 bucks and well-worth the 8 bucks!!) While we are waiting for our food, the server brings us a bowl of MISO SOUP!!! C'mon, who has ever had a side of miso at a hawaiian joint!! I say BOMB.COM!!! That right there = SOLD! Haha.After a minute or so, we got our actual combo plates. Fast service, I may add! I loved the chicken katsu, but my bbq chicken was on the bland side.  I could suggest adding a little bit more seasoning or even bbq sauce would have done the trick! Besides my bbq chicken, everything was splendid! I will definitely come back on those chicken katsu crave days!
Mundo Trattoria=A small, elegant and pricey Italian place in a surprising strip mall location. My work associates and I came here on a quiet weeknight with good appetites, and we were not disappointed.The menu was simple but had lots of good choices, plus there were four or five specials that night. I chose the red snapper special, and it was excellent, large, and perfectly cooked.  A delicious bottle of light chianti for the table, and we were set.Ambiance was very pleasant: Red curtains on one wall, birch branches in vases, elegant photos and prints surrounded us. The service was also excellent and attentive. I'll make an effort to return if I'm in the area again.
Sushi Imagine=I tried Sushi Imagine for lunch, I have yet to go there for dinner. After yesterday's lunch, I'm really looking forward to it.After drooling over some of their food pictures, I decided to head there to try their famous Sunshine Roll. However, after looking at the menu, it would've been foolish to not take advantage of their lunch specials. Tuesday's $5.00 lunch was grilled mackerel & kara-age(bite-size fried chicken) including salad, rice, & miso soup. I settled for their 3-piece nigiri, tuna, salmon, & shrimp with California Roll. Accompanied with miso soup, also. $5.95. Great deal, I thought. Fish tasted fresh and yummy. I'm not sure if I looked at the kids menu, because they had a regular chicken teriyaki bowl special for $2.99. I ordered that for my son and we shared everything. Our bill = $9.56. Nice! Moms of toddlers: it was ultra cute when the server brought my son an adorable kid's plate, that came with matching fork & spoon!It's a small place with only about 5-7 tables and seats at the sushi bar. The staff  greeted us warmly and our food was served fast. Our server was very nice, I did notice she forgot my water. No big deal since I had brought a water bottle for my son. That is overlooked if my server is smiling.. and remembered my extra wasabi! Other thing that was noteworthy was she seemed hesitant when I asked them to substitute my shrimp nigiri for something else equivalent. They did...just was hesitant, it'd make me wonder if they are very open to substitutions. I'll see when I go back!I glanced at their rolls and dinner combos. Rolls were priced about the same as other sushi joints, and dinner combos had a big variety to choose from. I'll write an update after trying their Sunshine Roll my next visit. I just had to say I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch there!
Carnegie Caf√©=Has this cafe always been here?  I have no idea.  I discovered this cafe was here when we were setting up an event for work, and my boss said we were getting lunch here.  Who am I to complain about free lunch?You walk up to the counter, order, and find a seat.  There is real silverware and plates, but we ended up taking food to go.  They provided us with plasticware and napkins.The menu is small.  There were four sandwich options, two soups, a salad, and a few other things.  What I really liked is that each sandwich came with a side.  I got the buffalo chicken breast sandwich ($8.75), which had buffalo chicken breast, America cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  The sandwich was large and tasted good.  I had two little cheese and sun-dried tomato risotto bites.  They were delicious, and I wish there had been more.  Apparently the chips for a side are good as well, and there were quite a few of those in a portion.The service was friendly, and everyone was happy with lunch!
Sofrita=Took Mom here for lunch on May 1st.  She was looking forward to it, as she had seen Sofrita's segment on Check Please! Arizona on DVR the night a few days before, while I had just seen it the previous night, although I've bookmarked to try this place for many months now, ever since I saw it advertised in the defunct Redendo's Pizzeria on FLW.Mom ordered the Shrimp Street Tacos, which she very much enjoyed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA#XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA  I asked what in particular was the best part of this dish for her, and she said that the shrimp were of very good quality- big and great texture. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ#mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ  I had the bruschetta board, choice of four, which Mom was also looking forward to trying, since it was featured on the show.  I ordered it, because it was one of the few items I could try (other than the salads) since the tacos were all encased in corn tortillas (corn allergy).  Their website mentions sandwiches, but I don't recall seeing any listed in their one-page menu...  I chose (from left to right) Cilantro hummus- awesome flavors, and one of my favorites of the four; Red pepper hummus- didn't impress me, but I've had a sensitivity to red bell peppers over the past few years, but Mom loved this one (!); Smoked salmon (with egg salad El Diablo and capers, and diced cucumbers as well, for those who are allergic to cukes)... this was another one I liked; and Chicken salad (with raspberry mayo and dried cranberries)- took me a couple of bites transitioning from the smoked salmon for me to enjoy this one.  I liked the textural differences from the soft mouth-feel of smoked salmon and egg salad to the chunky grilled chicken cubes and chewy dried cranberries.  Mom didn't care for it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q#8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q  And last, but certainly not the least, was the star of the show... Postre de caramelo, or simply "Santa Marta," a yellow cake, which reminded me of pineapple upside-down's yellow cake, with a layer of flan on top, toffee crumbles, and caramel and cream sauces drizzled on top.  I had the berries on the side due to an allergy (yes, it sucks to be me).  The two-sauce combo also gave the yellow cake a slight "tres leches cake" flavor, which I love.  This was a big hit with Mom!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ#wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ3.25 stars for now, but we definitely want to go back.  Mom wasn't happy about the prices, but our server, who I later found out was the manager (chatted her up after Mom left and I paid the bill), and the kitchen were willing to work with my allergies and tried to accommodate.  I love that the area is across the water fountain!  I somehow missed the fountain on my way to the restaurant (we came in separate cars), and I was on my way home when I spotted it across the street, so I parked at the shopping complex and went for a stroll.  I want to take Mom back to Sofrita, so that she and I can have a stroll after.  That is, if I can talk her into it...  Btw, the fountain comes alive on the hour, every hour, and I was lucky to catch the show before it turned off around the 15-minute mark.p.s.  The unisex restroom was quaintly-decorated (unlit ritual candles, wood sculptures, etc).  It's dark in there, which may have contributed to the slight urine odor I detected, possibly from little boys (and/or perhaps drunk men) missing their marks?  I didn't want to stay long enough to find out.  I meant to say something to our server on my way out, but got sidetracked talking about Redendo's former pizzeria location on FLW that was sold a couple of years ago.
Comme √áa=Going out for a nice steak dinner on xmas eve has turned into a tradition for us but we opted for something different since we're planning on doing Carnevino for new year's eve.  Glad we did!!The food was tremendous.  The prices aren't that bad either.  Not the most romantic restaurant..much better for a group.Before I get into the food..I have to mention how good their Comme Ci cocktail is.  They got a whole prohibition cocktail thing going on which is all the rage but the Comme Ci was the real deal...totally refreshing.  It was some kind of cucumber, lemon and pepper thing with white rum.  I can't wait to drink these on their balcony during 100 degree weather.  They are $15 though so I gotta try to figure out how to make these at home.  Appetizers:Salade Frisee aux Lardons: Warm bacon vinaigrette, poached eggOur awesome waiter, Keith, mentioned the French eat this salad at home.  If this is true...I'm inviting myself to every random family dinner the next time I'm in France!!  I couldn't get enough of the cured bacon with egg yolky goodness covered over everything.  Steak Tartare: Coleman Ranch beef, capers, cornichonsI had never had Steak Tartare prepared the way they did it.  They mixed the beef in some kind of mayo/horseradishy sauce and it was so fn good.  I could've eaten this as my main course.Entrees:Crispy Skate Grenobloise: Haricots verts, lemon, capers, brown butterBEST SKATE EVER!!  Nothing else to say.  Duck Confit: Pommes Lyonnaise, braised red cabbageNot like I eat duck confit very often but a lot of restaurants seem to use duck breast for it now but duck thigh is really where its at!  Super juicy and flavorful.Dessert:Chocolate Pot du Cr√®me: cardamom cr√®me chantillyLike the best Nutella ever.  There are so many other things I have to try on the menu.  They also have daily specials along w/ raw bar.I want to preface this review by saying something very important...there are only a few things that Rex Marvin hates...that isn't true...but let's pretend it is...Rex hates everything...Rex hates you...but for this exersize in fiction let's say Rex is a good man with a few unnatural hateful feelings.  First would be hard boiled eggs.  Second, the Yankees and all Yankee fans...front running bastards. Last is a common one...the French.  Chicks don't shave. They all surrender at the drop of a hat. The country could be conquered by two determined 14 year olds...quite easily.  Rex is a man. The French have one man...and he is really a she who hasn't shaved or bathed for a long time. Only good thing is those French Broads are easier to bed than it was for the Germans to run past the Maginot Line. I say this for a reason...I am on vicodin and dust cleaner...AND...because I was sent an invitation to "Rex Martin" for a new French restaurant called Comme Ca.  Insert your own "Comme" joke here...Rex doesn't do low brow. (Believe me damn you!) I stared down at my the my mustard sandwich (mustard slathered on my palms) and decided...okay Frenchie...you want it...come get it.I promise two things dear reader...one...I am not wearing pants...two...my hatred of the French is outweighed by my love of food. When I got to the new Cosmopolitan Casino I wasn't impressed.  The parking garage is like a slalom course designed by a drunken idiot.  I get out of the car I "borrowed" and walked quickly for the elevator. I went up to the third floor and found my party. A nice group of people. Very uptight. Three times people asked me if I planned on taking the shoes tied strategically around my neck off and wearing them on my feet. Maybe they just have a foot fetish.  It was weird. Anyway, we sat down and as I looked around I was genuinely confused...and the menu didn't help. Does this want to be a French Bistro or a Gourmet restaurant?  Truthfully...it was never really answered.  The waiters wear this hideous plaid shirt and it is so tacky for an upscale place.On the good side the view is amazing. It is a perfect location on the strip and their balcony is really nice.  Again...not quite right. They had a sitting room and on the tv was a tabloid show.  Honestly? That is what you turn on? Why have it on if something that stupid would be playing?  I sat down next to a darling woman. Sweet. Accommodating. 500lbs. Sweaty. I was in love.  We shared our appetizers.  I had the bone marrow and she had the soup of the day, which was pumpkin or butternut squash...so mediocre I forgot and it has been a very short time.  I sucked it off of her chubby fingers. People vomited in their mouths. I smiled. My shoes dangled brilliantly. The bone marrow was a revelation...it was something really special. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was good. The soup...here we go again...something that should have been good but wasn't. The flavors were muddled and it was desperately under seasoned. The consistency was perfect. Velvety and creamy...too much cream actually...but here is an idea...SALT. I think salt is like soap to the French...something used all too sparingly. It was a common theme. My main course was the Duck Confit.  It was okay. Far too small, especially when I saw my soon to be huge mistress's giant steak and bucket of fries. It was staggering in comparison...it was like a midget standing next to a really small midget baby. Almost too hard to imagine.  The portions were so far out of whack it was ridiculous. The steak and fries was pub food, the duck confit was fine dining...if it was actually done right. Again hopelessly under seasoned and served with a sad little helping of "herb salad". Only if you consider lettuce an herb was that an herb salad.  Again, good and bad, pub and fine dining. To illustrate my point...there is a damn cheeseburger on this menu. Such a muddle concept it is hard to fathom there was any real planning.  Desert...the French have to get this right. Not doing this right would be like not watching Jerry Lewis movies or anally raping Pepe Le Pew...just not right.  Well, bend over Pepe it is time for your degradation and humiliation let's hope you are into that. The "Pot de Cr√®me" tasted like whipped off brand hazelnut spread. Decent but not good.  The Profiteroles of my sweet chunky lover were harder than they should have been...and didn't taste as if they were made fresh. The Apple Tarte was eaten by others and enjoyed.Afterwards Rex went to the bathroom to enjoy a little alone time and when I walked into the main men's room...between the bar and the dinning room...there was ONE toilet. It was a bathroom for one. If that place is packed how the hell is one toilet going to work exactly? Nothing says fine dinning like waiting in line for the John. While I was in there someone knocked to get in...totally ruined the mood for me. I left aggravated. I left chaffed. It was not good. Rex hates any bad food.After perusing every single restaurant in Cosmopolitan, which took some time, my husband and I settled on Comme Ca (pronounced kom-sa, for those who care).  I guess I was expecting this to be a fancy French restaurant but it is casual bistro food.  The servers all look like lumberjacks (red flannel shirts, black pants) which I found amusing.  Although a few patrons showed up dressed to the hilt, this isn't a super fancy kind of place. After being seated, the hostess told us about the balcony and said we could go out there anytime to just look at the Strip.  They have seating and heat lamps out there.  However, we had a good enough view of the Strip from our seats so we didn't make it over there.  It looks cool, though.  It seems like every restaurant in Cosmopolitan is required to make craft, old school cocktails.  Being a big cocktail fan, I ordered a ramble ($15) and my husband got a New York sour ($15).  My ramble was ok.  It was hard to get any of the raspberry flavor since all the raspberries were trapped below under a crapload of ice.  Let's just say I've had better.  My husband's New York sour was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I think I'll stick to American Fish for my cocktail fix in Vegas. The wine by the glass selection is pretty good.  I got a glass of the Orin Swift cabernet ($19), which was tasty.  They also appear to have beer on tap, as I saw some patrons with beer in pints.  Something to try next time.  For whatever reason, I didn't see beer taps at a lot of the restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.  The food here is the main star.  The beet salad ($11) and French onion soup ($11) are absolutely to die for.  Also the steak frites - so yummy.  I opted for the flat iron steak ($29) and it was pretty darn good.  It comes with herb butter on top just in case your fat intake is not all it could be that day.  You can upgrade to a filet for $36 and there was a $56 option of some sort that I don't recall, but why bother when the flat iron steak is so good!  The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  There were a ton of them and we ate them all, even though we shouldn't have.  My husband got the crispy turbot (usually crispy skate, but they were out) for $27.  I was so enamored with my steak I frankly don't remember the fish.  We had a caramel tart for dessert ($9) which was great as well.  It comes with hazelnuts and ice cream which goes so well with the tart.  Great caramel flavor!Service was pretty good but there is a lot of time between courses for some reason.  Our drinks and starter courses came out fast but it took a while to get main entrees and desserts for some reason.  However, our server was really nice and knowledgeable and two managers came by to check on us.The restaurant only has one-stall restrooms, which annoys me.  But the restrooms for the Cosmpolitan are just outside so it's not a big deal. A little disappointed in the cocktails but I'm a tough person to please in that category.  Definitely a fan and I will be back!The decor for this place was definitely the best part. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEAIt was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHAThere are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-wShrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2QCroque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpywMac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMgThe chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeAThe caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3wThe waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.(3.5 stars)This Comme Ca is David Myers' newest restaurant (located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan).  The original Comme Ca in LA can be good or quite average (depending on what you order).  The Vegas location features a pretty similar menu (the same good/average may apply).This Comme Ca has a much better decor/atmosphere.  I've always felt the Comme Ca in LA has really just inhabited its location rather than transformed it.  The layout and design is so much more well thought out here as it combines both French brasserie characteristics and modern touches (which is kind of like the menu--classic French bistro re-imagined for a contemporary audience). The room at lunchtime also takes advantage of its Vegas location.  They use floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a lot of warm natural light (as well as provide a good view of nearby casinos).  I think there is also an outdoor dining area, which probably incorporates The Strip even more.For food, the meal began with a complimentary French baguette--similar to the one they serve in LA but not as good.  It was freshly baked and warm; however, the crust was a little too hard and the bread was too chewy.I went with the 3-course lunch pre fixe ($32).  They give you a good variety of choices in entrees as well as a decent variety in starters and desserts.I started with the endive and watercress salad that was garnished with blue cheese, julienne apple, roasted walnuts, and a sprightly vinaigrette.  The endives were fresh and crisp (great snap to them).  The watercress was also fresh and good.  The combination made for a good salad base.The garnishes were good.  The walnuts provided a good crunch while the green apple gave the salad a good tart flavor.  I also liked the blue cheese, which had a good creaminess to it and was not too pungent, but there was not much of it.  The salad was nicely dressed with the vinaigrette.  It was a light tossing, which kept all the ingredients crisp and not soggy.  Still, the vinaigrette was a little acidic.For my entree, I went with the Scottish Salmon that came with artisanal polenta and oyster mushrooms.  It was a decent portion for a lunch entree.  The salmon was moist and had a good outside sear.  The outside sear had a good flavor, which made it feel like they left the skin-on (even though they didn't).  Salmon can have a strong fish flavor and this one certainly did.The polenta was creamy and pretty good though polenta is not my favorite side.  There was also a mild cream sauce that did not really do much.  There were also some oyster mushrooms on the plate, which were nicely cooked and not rubbery.  Unfortunately, they were incredibly salty.For dessert, I went with the profiteroles.  Like the LA Comme Ca, the profiteroles at lunch were not the standard profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, they filled the profiteroles with Chantilly cream and then topped them with vanilla ice cream and a crystallized sugar garnish.  They then poured a dark chocolate sauce over top of it.The presentation was nicer than the LA Comme Ca's lunch dessert.  Also, the dark chocolate sauce was thinner and had a much better and smoother flavor (but still rich).  The vanilla ice cream was good and creamy.  I liked the crystallized sugar garnish, which provided a good sweetness and crispy contrast.The profiteroles though were not the type of profiteroles I am used to; the profiteroles here were quite small.  They were very crisp on the outside and were not light, airy and soft on the inside.  They tasted more like a cross between a profiterole and a brioche cookie/biscuit.  I saw a photo on Yelp where the profiteroles looked to have the appropriate size and texture so it might just have been the day I went.  The Chantilly cream filling was good.The waitress (Andrea) seemed new (it is a new restaurant after all) and very trained.  She did a good job.  She was pleasant, personable, polite, and very attentive throughout the course of the meal.  She also (though this didn't really impact the overall dining experience) looked very similar to an actress, but I couldn't pinpoint who.Comme Ca's $32 3-course lunch prix fixe is a good deal especially when you consider all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas.  In terms of their regular prices, the prices here are about what you would expect to pay at Bouchon (The Venetian); since they are both French bistros, they have many similar items.  The food at Comme Ca might be slightly less.If you haven't been to the Comme Ca in LA, this one is a decent lunch option for Vegas.  The food was not spectacular, but there was consistent quality with each dish (the mushrooms being the exception).  If you've been to the Comma Ca in LA, You may want to branch out and try something new since the menu is similar.Complimentary parking via valet; parking structure may also be available.Since my first pseudo-disastrous visit to Comme Ca I've been back. And back. And back. I believed the place deserved a second chance-I mean with such a beautiful space and wonderful view it was hard for me to discount it on one grossly inattentive and downright terrible waiter.I'm glad I gave Comme Ca a second (and third and fourth and so on) chance! I've become a fan of their early evening happy hour in which they offer up their 18A menu for 1/2 off. This specialty drink menu is made up of handcrafted drinks with a prohibition style theme. They spare no expense when it comes to the ingredients and the variety, creativity and presentation of this menu just can't be found anywhere else. While I appreciate the unique menu I cannot justify paying $15 for one drink and choose to frequent the bar during happy hour only. Call me a spoiled local, but I've been groomed to appreciate and take advantage of happy hour.Most of my return experiences are based on the bar/lounge area-I was introduced to the bar after winning one of the restaurant's Twitter contests which got me two free drinks off the 18A menu. Since then I've been back several times and have pegged my two favorite bartenders- Len and Tony- however not a favorite drink, only because there's too much good to choose from! Recently I had the Queen's Park Swizzle which was pretty to look at and just as pretty to drink. The drinks are strong, so for those with, say, clean and undamaged livers, proceed to the 18A menu with caution.I ate here during Restaurant Week and had a truly delicious meal with excellent service. Our waiter, Ed, was above and beyond knowledgeable about the menu and walked us through anything we had questions on. When the food was brought out, either he or his assistant explained the dish very well, not only telling us ingredients but any special techniques used in the dish (obvi not getting to technichal). For example, my friend ordered the steak tartare which was served with an egg yolk confit-the egg was cooked sous vide which I thought was interesting. Just little stuff like that showed he took his service standards seriously and that was refreshing.Also had that evening was the tomato terrine (with heirloom tomatoes I believe-YUM), oxtail jam with roasted bone marrow which is just as mind blowing as everyone says, crispy skate and beef cheek bourguignon. All were very well prepared and beautifully presented. The beef cheek was SO tender and served with these tasty sort of potato cakes.  I'm 90 percent sure Comme Ca has ruined all other boeuf bourguignon for me which I think I'm ok with.Looking forward to coming back and giving some other items I've been eyeing a try. Very pleased with the improved service and the outstanding quality of the food!(4 stars for ONLY the Friday/Saturday Lunch/Brunch thing)People find it hard to believe that Rex Marvin can change his way of thinking.  The Rex Marvin who wore a Mao jacket for 11 years after he died. The Rex Marvin who up until 1997 steadfastly believed that Nancy Sinatra would one day be considered the finest entertainer of our lives.  The Rex Marvin who dug up the grave, at great personal peril, of Yuri Andropoz in 1991 because he was convinced that the old commie was still alive.  Yes, that Rex Marvin CAN change his way of thinking.What is this about you ask? SHUT UP I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU!!  A few weeks ago a faithful follower, who has yet to pledge his worldly possessions to me (he says because of the mortality rate of people who do), went to Comme Ca for their new bunch/lunch menu which is available on Friday and Saturday. He raved in his own pedestrian way.  He is a small man with small thoughts. The kind of man who still listens to Sal Mineo records and Men Without Hats 8-track tapes.  Stupid. Mediocre. Tiny penis and even smaller balls.He did say one interesting thing...3 courses...20 bucks!  So I stole 20 bucks from my meth dealer who looks like Ethel Merman and started walking.Desperate to see how the mediocre exists I decided to see what this idiot thinks is so wonderful.  The primary focus of his rant was the duck meat filled cinnamon roll with crispy pork belly and a duck fat frosting. I went back to Comme Ca thinking it would be a disaster...poorly executed as was my previous experience.  When the very lovely waitress (who I have undressed many, many times after my brunch) put the cinnamon roll down on my table I knew that there was a chance that even the stupidest person might be right once. Two bites in I was sobbing uncontrollably and screaming out loud "Why Lord? Why let me taste this amazing delight now and not 58 years ago as a small child!!???" The Lord answered..."because I hate you."  It wasn't actually the Lord it was a Cuban bus boy named Thaigo. That was a bummer. The cinnamon roll was not. It was perfection. It is absolutely one of the best things any human being can ingest. EVER!  Sweet. Salty. Smokey. Crunchy. Soft. All textures. All tastes. Rex Marvin was in love. In love with the waitress and in love with the Cinnamon Roll. If I had to chose which to save in my life raft that raven haired beauty would be on the bottom of the ocean.The second course was a fancy ham and cheese sandwich (there are other options like pancakes but after the sweet roll, I wanted pure savory) and it was terrific. It was a  very fancy gruyere cheese and ham sandwich with a great white sauce and a soft egg on top.  The soft egg made it happen. That was a brilliant touch. The richness of the sauce and the egg elevated a simple sandwich.  If Rex has an issue my bread wasn't great. It was regular white bread, or at least it tasted that way. It wasn't toasted enough but it was too hard, if that makes sense.  The last dish was, and there are choices of  profiteroles or cr√®me brulee, for Rex was the cr√®me brulee and it was the best Rex has ever had. Rex practically stuck his tongue in the ramekin and licked it clean.Rex has one major issue. The coffee. It was horrible. It was bitter, slightly burned and very reminiscent of Starbucks.  Starbucks sucks! At this kind of place you need to do things well and this was a big issue for a brunch.  The waitress, while stunning, was adequate. She was friendly and that made up for it, but when she had more than a few tables Rex was often forgotten...and no one...and Rex repeats NO ONE forgets Rex.Here is another problem...don't say brunch and open at noon!  OPEN EARLIER ON SATURDAY! Try 10am!A better experience than last time. The cinnamon roll will be a great memory of mine until syphilis eventually eats away my memories.  Still, Comme Ca...get it together. If you never want to reach greatness you are doing everything right. If you want to be great, like Rex, you need to start doing it all right. Like the great Myrna Loy told a young Rex "Rexie...you...you...do it all right. Now be a dear and get my teeth from the night stand." She was all class. Comme Ca...you aren't just yet.Damn. Not sure why the hate, the food was delish. Serious Delish.The service was also spot on, even though we were Grouponers, we were treated like high rollers, our server not only was professional, she was cute as a button with sexy southern style and a flirty fun attitude: perfect accent to the upscale decor and high falootin food.I got the Beef Tartare, not something I do most places but it was well recommended and boy, were they right. For an entree, I had the brick roasted chicken with duck fat fried potatoes and yes, that was as drool worthy as it sounds, the chicken was perfect, the potatoes managed a level of decadence not normally obtainable by lowly tubers. My guy ordered the  Bouillabaisse and it was as impressive as you'd expect as a star of the menu.I'll be honest, I don't remember the dessert, but not because it wasn't memorable, I'm sure it was delicious.  But, after all the good wine, amazing food and stellar service, I think I was just blissed out and anything else was just more of the same.During a recent trip to Vegas for a meeting, we dropped into this restaurant for a business lunch.  Having walked by this joint at dinner time and seen the large crowds, I was pleased to see very few people durung the lunch hour.We were seated near the windows so we had nice sunlight coming into the room...which is rare for Vegas casino restaurants....nice touch.I ordered the Comme Ca Burger, $19.The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I immediately noticed that the Ketchup was homemade and not bottled....another plus.  The Burger was also a hand made patty, not frozen.  It was very juicy and delish...yum!The server was pleasant and realized that we were at a business lunch, so she gave us our space to talk and work.  However, she remained attentive to our needs and ensured that our drinks/food were taken care of.Overall, it was a great experience for a business lunch.....good food and service.Return Factor - 90%Stopped off for a drink at Comme Ca before a dinner reservation at Milos... just down the hall at The Cosmopolitan. It's beautiful, classy and the perfect place to take your parents, a date, even a group of girlfriends. I can't see how anyone would be offended to drink or dine here. Pretty impressive bar! The wall of booze and 11 page wine/spirits menu could be slightly overwhelming to even the most experienced drink... But it's a French restaurant in Vegas and they have to be prepared for the most obscure requests.Everyone besides me had a cocktail... Mom really enjoyed her Ginger Joy with pear vodka, sugar, lemon and ginger. A big wino, I went for a glass of sparkling rose. It was the holidays, I was with my family and it seemed like the appropriate celebratory drink. Perhaps I've become accustomed to drinking California sparkling wine vs French champagne, 'cause I did not enjoy my wine very much. It was *very* sweet, almost syrupy. Luckily it had bubbles which made it drinkable. And I was with good company so it wasn't that big of a deal. Perhaps the regular clientele prefers sweet wine to dry? Pure class, all the way at Comme Ca. Grab a cocktail and see where the night takes you!Comme Ca, a French brasserie with a stunning terrace view of the half scale Eiffel Tower, offers a $17.50, three course lunch special featuring delights such as steamed mussels and pot de creme. The best part - lunch runs late.Grab a table at 4:15 p.m. - (lunch close at 5 p.m.)  and linger through the evening.I finally made it to Comme Ca for lunch!  Now what's so special about their lunch you ask?  For me, one specific dish has intrigued me for a long time just because of how bizarre it sounds....their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.I've waited a looooooong time to try their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.  Mainly because I guess it's a seasonal dish and it's been on and off the menu.  Last time I was Vegas, it was off the menu and I was devastated.  Like Harold and Kumar devastated when they discovered that their closest White Castle turned into a hot dog joint.When I arrived at Comme Ca it was for a late lunch and the place was pretty much empty by then.  That's a good thing for me since it would mean that I'd get extra attention from my server.  Her name was Britney and she was awesome!  I loved how she read my mind and knew that I was there for the Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun when I said I wanted something unusually different and waited a long time to try it.So here it is!  Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun with smoked bacon frosting, huckleberry, and Pork Bellyhttp://bit.ly/Vn2SCtWas it worth the hype?  You betcha!!!  It's funny how this is listed on the menu as an appetizer.  The taste is really unique when you have the sweetness from the bun and huckleberry and then combined with the smoked and savory flavor of the duck confit, bacon frosting, and pork belly slices, you have a kaleidoscope of flavors all over your taste buds.  Despite being an appetizer, it was really rich in that whole thing can fill you up.  It's like breakfast, lunch, and dessert all in one!  This definitely ranks as one of the best things I've ever eaten on the Vegas strip.Yeah it may be a little too premature to give Comme Ca 5 stars based off of one lunch dish, let alone an appetizer, but the whole experience with the nice view of the strip, awesome service, and enjoying one of the one of the of creative dishes I've ever eaten, it totally says 5 stars all over!  I can't wait to go back next time!Comme Ca has made its way into my favorites for strip-dining. Prices aren't crazy, food is great, and the way they took the fine dining concept and made it more comfortable is fabulous. The view helps too. Be sure to request a "window seat" when you make your res. Good way to impress your date ;)Servers are dressed in plaid & jeans. They're genuinely upbeat and friendly and I haven't met a server that isn't a good "sales-person" too (if you catch my drift). They also respect your privacy, don't comment on your conversation and know just when to come around. They are very good at what they do. Which is another reason why I like to take people here. It's upscale without being intimidating while offering mid-to-high price items. Nothing says cozy like eating a $75 steak on a paper placemat. You don't have to worry if you're using the right fork or if the stuffy suits next to you think you have bad posture. *kidding* *not really*On the Menu: Not to miss is the Bone Marrow with Oxtail Jam. The bone marrow is average but that Oxtail Jam takes center stage! Lots of tender meat, rich flavor, and little bits of ligament in it. It's just perfection and needs to be eaten on a regular basis. The beef tartare is by-the-book but noteworthy. It's served with some house-pickled stuff which is delicious. If you're considering the Duck Confit, I would skip it. I ordered it once and it was pretty miserable. Maybe miserable is a harsh word but I definitely didn't enjoy it. It was a less than hot and the flavor was lacking depth. Entree-wise, I suggest passing on the steak-frites. I see people order it all the time. It isn't the best in Vegas and not worth the price tag. I made the mistake of ordering it once and was less than impressed. There are so many more tasty options on the menu--like the scallops, short rib or lamb--so why would you settle for something so average? The short rib on the current menu is served with farro (which is my new latest healthy grain obsession--step aside quinoa!) and probably one of my favorite short ribs in Vegas. Seems like there's one on every menu but this one actually stands out. Lamb is also excellent. I like how they incorporate grapes in the recipes--adds a nice touch of sweetness to the dish. Oh, and if your there on a Friday, be sure to order the scallop special at least once. You won't regret it. The food here doesn't scream overly fancy creative stuff but it doesn't have to. Chef Brian does an excellent job of serving up enjoyable versions of these French classics. Just more reason why I think this place is great for dates or group dinners. There's something everyone will love but its still special.Comme Ca translates as not poorly or not bad ... and that's exactly what Comme Ca restaurant at The Cosmopolitan is ... not too bad.The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds. I forget the names, but one Pacific Ocean and the other was Atlantic. The Pacific were smaller, but better.When it comes to Comme Ca for Happy Hour, it is kind of comme si comme ca.This is my third Vegas trip in a row visiting Comme Ca.  It's pretty much become one of my default stops in Vegas that I simply just can't avoid and it's really hard for me to resist coming here for lunch.My last two visits simply just had me order their famous Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and call it a day.  Well, that didn't stop here with this visit.  But unlike those two visits before, I came with a bigger appetite and I ordered the their Oxtail Eggs Benedict as my main entree.Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll with Pork Belly --  http://bit.ly/1c1GQSFw/ smoked bacon frosting, raspberry compoteThis is one of those dishes that seem to get better every time I have it, even for the third time.  Like before, it's really hard to explain in words how amazing this thing is.  Sweetness from the cinnamon roll and raspberries, savory duck confit inside, and smokey flavor of the pork belly.  Oh, and there's Bacon Frosting too!  It's really not fair that I have to fly to another state to have this.  A must order every time!!  Oxtail Eggs Benedict  --  http://bit.ly/190ewQcw/ warm goug√®res, spinach, two poached eggs, truffle hollandaiseAre you kidding me?  This is definitely a great savory contrast to the sweetness of Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll.  There's a lot going on with this Eggs Benedict because of the braised oxtail and the truffle hollandaise.  It's oozing with flavor and has a lot of substance.  This is food porn at its finest.  One of the best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had!!I can't help but give high praise for their lunch which is only available Friday through Sunday.  There are plenty of other things to try like their Comme Ca Burger, Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Red Velvet Bacon Waffles. Someday, I'll be back to try their dinner.  I probably don't need to, because I would most likely end up going back for lunch anyways and I'm perfectly fine with that.Came here specifically to try the Oxtail Eggs Benedict! Glad it did not disappoint :DOxtail Benedict ($22): Warm Gougeres, Spinach, Poached Eggs & Truffle Hollandaise. WOW...THIS WAS OUTSTANDING! Loved every bite of this...wish it never ended lol.  Seriously, it was probably one of the BEST things I've ever ate this early in the day!  If you are coming here for breakfast food...do yourself a favor and order this!Croque Madame ($17): Smoked Ham, Gruyere Cheese, Farm Egg & Mornay Sauce. This was outstanding! So much flavor here, every bite puts a smile on your face!  It was very good....not as impressive as the Oxtail Benedict but was wonderful :)Quiche Du Jour ($16): Gruyere Cheese and Mushrooms. I'm not a big quiche fan, but this was pretty good. If you are considering ordering this, I am sure you will enjoy it.Factoring in the excellent atmosphere, great service and AMAZING food, I am confident in giving Comme Ca the 5 star review!  I will be back to give the Burger a run for its money!A beautiful French spot with some amazing strip views!The restaurant is very comfortable and cozy with a sexy Parisian feel. The modern and classic touches are everywhere and the service is always great. On this particular visit we ordered a cheese plate with honey comb which never disappoints and a few french onion soups, then steak & frites for the man & I decided on the special which was trout almondine. All items were great and definitely one of the best french onion soups in town with the perfect crispy, cheesy crust.Let's get to the views. I love sitting in a dark room and just watching my surroundings. The bright colors from the outside keep flashing into the dark room and I love the energy of Las Vegas Blvd. Its all around you but yet you're in a very comfortable spot at a beautiful table just enjoying everything. I also want to point out that they have an amazing social hour menu for cocktails & food at the bar & lounge. We absolutely love this spot.
Canteen Modern Tequila Bar=Oh Mill. You are so fun but overcome with college students so it's sometimes hard to enjoy your splendor -- until now that it is. Welcome Canteen Modern Tequila Bar. You are welcomed with open arms to Mill! You are trendy, classy, decently priced and tasty! When I hear the words tequila and bar, I immediately feel a phantom hangover coming on and assume that if I visit, I should be prepared for a long headache filled morning after. But, don't let that fool you about the Canteen. Although the tequilas are top notch and flowing straight from the border, there's much more than lime and salt to this place. Let me first start with the decor. It doesn't quite fit in with the divey feel of Mill but that's a good thing. Similar to the class La Bocca brought to the street, the Canteen has a classy edge to the decor. It's very open. You could easily have a large party here and still have room for more. There are two patios; one off the front and one off the back. The bar is spacious and there's also a patio off the bar -- so actually there are three patios! I thoroughly enjoyed the back patio. The tables are high tops with cushioned seats and umbrellas. The tables are far enough apart from each other that you aren't sitting with a neighbor and sharing your salsa with them. I could easily see this being a fun restaurant at any time of day or night and it's going to be a perfect leisurely spot to stay for awhile. Now on to the food. Delish! First of all, go during happy hour. Between two of us, we had two margaritas, two taco plates, salsa and guacamole and it was only $10 a person. The items on happy hour have "hh" next to them -- and there's a lot to choose from. I think I pay more at a local Mexican fast food restaurant! And though the food is competitively priced, you wouldn't know by the taste. The margaritas are freshly made with lime juice and not pre-made margarita mix. I could absolutely tell the difference and while I'm not normally a huge Margarita fan, I could see these being dangerous and turning the night into a 5 margarita time. The guacamole was freshly made and had a good kick to it. We had the Cascabel salsa which is what I suggest. It was a tasty salsa to accompany the guacamole. When I saw that an entree comes with three tacos, I was worried it would be too much, but they are actually street style tacos so three is just the right amount. I left satisfied but not too full. I got the chicken tacos and my friend got the shrimp and we split. I like the chicken tacos better than the shrimp but they were both excellent. Add some of your guacamole and salsa to them and they are supreme! I think that Julian Wright did an excellent job adding a little bit more flare to Mill and I see this restaurant being a huge success. I would absolutely make the drive to visit again and make a night of it here.This place is the shit - so much so that I'm willing to take the light rail all the way from midtown to partake of its delicious drinks and food. Happy hour runs every night of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays, from 4-6:30 and it's one of the best HHs in Phoenix, in my opinion (and I thought that before Phoenix Magazine rated it as such). You can get 50% of house margaritas (quite large and decently strong), bottled/draft beer, premium well drinks and all tequilas. Plus, select food items, including some of the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had, are also 50% off. Those mushroom tacos with roasted blue cheese make any reasonable person not miss meat and have a very complex and sophisticated flavor profile. The cool indoor/outdoor vibe is the icing on the cake and makes this a perfect place for Phoenix day drinking. Take the light rail there, get drunk and soak up the rays. You won't regret it.
KoMex Fusion=Ok, I heard about this place from a friend on Twitter.  Their Twitter account is:http://twitter.com/FusionTacosIf you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.From what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.The place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)The Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.Overall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!Will I return?  Absolutely!Whoa! This is my new favorite hole in the wall. It's currently in the middle of a tiny carneceria but they are moving by the end of the year. It sounded like they might be planning on becoming an actual restaurant, rather than a grocery counter with food.Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food. Huh!The owners are Korean, but they speak Spanish. Linda, the owner, said her husband was cooking her some food and everyone was interested. And their fusion food was born.I started with a bulgogi taco. I think I prefer Hanshik BUT...the taco was $1 and muy delicious.I then got a bulgogi teriyaki bowl and a pork tamale to go. The teriyaki bowl was $5 and the tamale was another $1. That food will probably last me for 4 meals.The teriyaki bowl is delicious. I mean, best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. Yum. Yum. Yum!And the tamale was even better than the teriyaki bowl! I freakin' love this place. Cheap, delicious, creative, good eats. I couldn't ask for anything better.I will be back..again and again.Edit:This place has moved and is now a full-time restaurant, rather than carniceria with a food counter.If you're looking for atmosphere, forget it.If you're looking for delicious comfort food, go check it out!I haven't eaten everything on the menu (yet), but most everything I've had seems to have Korean influences, which makes sense given that the owners are Korean.I got some wonton soup today. It's really not much like traditional wonton and Korean flavor peeks through....but it's delicious, comforting, and a bargain.The tacos are now $1.25 and still muy delicious! I came in for takeout, but Lynda still brought me out a side of chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were kind of soggy in the middle like homemade...and that's the way I like my chips, but others might disagree.Still, a ton of food, and a ton of flavor, for very little money. And I still love this place!My wife heard about this place on Yelp and really wanted to try it. So we ventured over last weekend. I am glad we did!This is one of the best Korean/Mexican fusion places I have been to. WAAAY better than Hanshik taco and maybe even better than the famous Kogi trucks in L.A.We got the chicken, beef, and pork fusion tacos. We got the chicken in a lettuce wrap and the other two in a corn tortilla. We also ordered the bulgogi burrito. Everything was great. I preferred the tacos, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I'm not a big fan of rice in my burritos.I plan to be a regular customer.OHHHH YEAH!Love this place and will be going there a lot.  Let's start with their story.  They are a nice Korean couple who ran a Mexican market for 10 years.  Their food isn't a copy of the Kogi truck phenomenon in Southern California but rather a result of their experience at the market. They sold tacos, burritos, etc at their market.However, they cooked food for themselves.  So they would blend mexican food with korean bbq, chinese food, etc.  Pretty soon customers would ask them what they were cooking/eating and ask if they could try it.  Long story made short - eventually their fusion food was doing much better business than the market itself.  So they made the leap to open up their own restaurant.Now - on to the restaurant.  It doesn't have a ton of decor but that's to be expected from folks opening up their own business on a shoestring budget.  The food, however, is outstanding.I had the following:Burrito with Korean bbq pork.  This was definitely the highlight of my meal.  Served with a side of kimchee (though I'd recommend you ask for it inside the burrito if you want the best experience), the bbq pork is absolutely delicious.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, and savory.  Served with rice and veggies inside.  They serve the kimchee on the side cause they are worried about how Americans will react to it.  But I think you need the tangy kimchee to balance out the richness of the meat.  That's standard cooking.  The owners also bring you 3 hot sauces.  A korean chili, mexican hot sauce, and the owners' own house made hot sauce.  I'm not a big hot sauce person, but the owners' sauce was really excellent and flavorful.Taco with bulgogi (beef).  A big, meaty taco that has too much to eat without spilling out the fillings.  I don't think that's necessarily great to have so much on top but I know others will love the value.  Served with a lime wedge as is traditional.  Nice tender, flavorful meat with nice crispy veggies.  They serve you tortilla chips and salsa while you wait.  They seen to be from flour rather than corn tortillas which is unorthodox but fine.  The value is definitely there.  It's cheap.  I actually think they should raise the price a buck on all the food and move to a richer neighborhood but that's just me.  I will back here many times.  This is really a hidden gem.After many sleepless nights I've decided a name more appropriate for KoMex. ChiKoMeRican Fusion Express. What the heck is right. I don't think I've have ever ate anywhere that serves Korean-Mexican fusion, Mexican, Chinese, and American. It is like the food court at a mall fell into a pot and KoMex was the product. What I like:- Uber cheap food. For $1.25 you can get a taco, but not just any taco, Korean marinaded beef, chicken, or pork sheltered by two corn tortillas OR protein style (lettuce) at no charge! Good bye Taco Bell Grade D "meat". - It tastes good. YEAAAAAAAA!- The portions are very generous. You can't even hold a taco without the lettuce, purple cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro falling out.  - Everything is cooked to order, just in case you were wondering why your taco is taking 10 minutes. - FREE chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. They make their chips from flour tortillas though, but, it is free. - FREE fruits for dessert. Sometimes I've gotten oranges and other times watermelon.- Drink selection is pretty interesting. Jarritos, Voss water, typical sodas, lemonade, Starbucks frappuccinos, and I believe I saw a coconut juice drink. What it is not:- This is not a Kogi's. KoMex serves food more family like and Kogi's is more street and greasier.- No Korean only items. I'll live. - Fancy. It is not in the best of spots, or has nice decor, but it gets the job done. - Going to make your wallet or bank account cry.- Going to give you a reason to regret. yeaaaabuddy!I'm a good honest man. I don't cheat. I don't lie. And I certainly don't steal. But KoMex makes me upset for making me feel like a thief! I'm actually upset that this place charges so little for the amount of quality food they serve. At the end of every meal, I get this guilty feeling like is this check a mistake? I can't buy this much happiness for so little. This place puts cheap fast food to shame. Try to spend $10 here for lunch and finish all the food they serve and you will understand. That's just speaking volume. Now as for the quality, my god! I can't even get my grass fed organic meat to taste this great. The other reason for the 5 stars, the Wontons! Fried or boiled. Unbelievable! 4 for a dollar is absurd. Now this is the definition of bang for your buck. Nothing in the universe can taste this good, per bite per $0.25 period.Say MexKoWhen I was a kid I saw this commercial where someone carrying a piece of chocolate fell into someone holding peanut butter, and peanut butter cups were discovered! Now, that's fusion! I don't know who fell into who here but mixing  Korean and Mexican did not have the same effect as the peanut butter cups for me. And don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad but I would rather have either Korean or Mexican, but not mixed, which they also serve. I did like the chips the salsa and the guacamole they were very tasty, and I would stop here just for that.Service was very good, very friendly and attentive. The place is small but kept clean. Oh! And the Korean lady taking my order and asking me how I wanted the food made, in Spanish! Now that's a bonus star! (Review went from three to four.) I will probably stop again  and try other items, Mexican or Korean but not mixed. For now, I'll just stick to my own Korean, Mexican fusion..... me and my Hyundai.Korea and Mexico are almost 7,000 miles apart.  The only herb in common, cilantro.  Why the fusion works?  Who cares.  Its just really good grindz.All three fusion tacos (bul-gogi, dak-gogi, and daeji-gogi) are great.  The proteins are all deeply marinated, slightly charred and overcooked (it works) and served hot with cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions, all overstuffed in a corn tortilla.  Perfect contrast of both temperatures and textures.  Add some kimchee and hot sauce (several choices but the Asian works best) and you got it all (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy).  Fusion street food heaven!The burrito is equally good.  Same great beef, chicken, or pork with the same taco toppings and the addition of seasoned rice all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  Once again, squeeze some lime, add some hot sauce and its all good!  (It even taste good cold especially at 2am at the tables). Prices are...heck, dirt cheap ($1.29 a taco, $4.99 for a burrito).  Dine in and you get free chips, salsa, and guacamole.Recommended.Almost six months had passed since I last reviewed this fine little restaurant, and it was time for a return.  I found it to be just as accommodating as before, offering free bottled water and complimentary homemade tortilla chips with a spicy guacamole dip.  I was even supplied with extra guacamole at no charge when the first quantity ran out.This time I wanted to try new items.  So, I had a half-order of Wonton Soup and a full order of Mark's Favorite Chow Fettuccine.  The Wonton Soup was a simple but delicious bowl of Cantonese goodness.  It contained 4 doughy wontons filled with ground beef and pork, 1 button mushroom, some onions, and a touch of whisked egg floating in a very hot, very tasty broth.  A full order costs only $1.00 more, and contains 8 wontons!  My main dish could easily have filled two diners, and it was probably folly for me to eat the whole thing in one sitting.  About two-thirds of the way through, I was asked if I wanted a to-go box--as if that was the normal regimen for a single diner--but foolishly declined and forged ahead until I was thoroughly stuffed.  And, my bathroom scale made me pay for that extravagance the next day.The food itself consisted of a generous amount of hunks of tender chicken, pieces of lean beef, and medium-sized nicely stir-fried shrimps mixed with green and purple cabbage, red and white onion strands, green and red bell pepper slices, some carrot splinters, and oodles of fettucinne nicely mixed together with a very light brown sauce.  The dish just needed a little salt, which slight application of soy sauce quickly provided.  It was a fine platter of multi-flavored and textured treats.  Complimentary orange slices and a fortune cookie were brought to the table at meal's end for a refreshing finish to a very substantial lunch. I did notice one thing different from my two previous visits.  Instead of several casually clad 20-something males predominantly in attendance, this time the nearly completely full small dining room featured a wide mix of diners, including snowy-haired senior couples, young men in suits, a technician in surgical scrubs, the middle aged, and a young couple.  The demographics have shifted to a wider audience as the kudos keep coming in for this no longer obscure, cook-to-order gem.I am so late on this bandwagon.  Writing a review for this now is like just getting into the "Lost" TV series yesterday.   Loved it all.  Kimchi was a must have for my tacos.  I enjoyed the pork, bulgogi and chicken in that order.  I wondered what their regular Chinese or non-fusion dishes are like but I will never know.  If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.  Free fried wontons with a check-in.  Afternoon lunch coma sets in upon completion.  Corona or Hite beer would compliment their stuff perfectly.  Maybe they let people byob?W - O - W !What can I say...Eric R. and I came for Jen S.'s UYE, and it was a grand time!The contest: $10 for all you can eat tacos (your choice of meat and sides) and free soda, iced tea or water for 15 minutes.The challengers: Eric R., Tiffanie R., Gabe, Jen S., and Danny.  The first four did the challenge at the same time, and Danny upon entering battled in round 2.It was a meaty, fast-paced chewdown with flavors flying and lots of excitement.  Jen and Eric were neck-and-neck when it got to tacos 9-11, but Eric's one extra bite claimed initial victory.  Enter Danny, who inhaled 8 tacos in 7 minutes, with all looking good, but he hit a wall, and after 9, Eric R. was declared the winner. The prize: a KoMex t-shirt and a picture with a sign that read, "I ate 11 tacos and one bite!"Tiffanie got recognized for being the only woman brave enough to try the challenge.Otherwise, for us sane people: Lily, Jieun L., Anthony M., Tony T., and Paolo D. - oh, and me! - we ordered from the menu.  I missed out on the free check-in wontons because they have pork, but we were given 4 plates of them generously!  We also got chips, salsa, guac and 4 hot sauces.  There was one I really liked with onions and Korean spices and other herbs.Everyone seemed to go for the lettuce wrap tacos except Paolo who ate his Torta Ahogada in record time and licked that plate clean!I got one beef fusion taco with avocado and jalepeno, and one fusion tostada, the star of the show...a rice patty (perfection!) topped with chicken, lettuce, pico, Korean hot sauce, avocado and jalepeno.  It was so amazing I wanted another one but refrained from overstuffing myself!  I think I am now hooked and next time I am over here, it is 2 rice patty tostadas for me!I also enjoyed the delicious mango-passionfruit iced tea.  I also noticed in the cold case KoMex carries Sweet Leaf mint and honey iced tea, the only sweet-ish tea I will drink (and it is made in AUSTIN!)Soooo much fun and I really liked everything I tasted.  Thank goodness Jen S.  hosted this fabulous event so we could finally eat here.  We also ran into Clint B. here who was here with his family for dinner!In this battle of man versus tacos, Eric R. won!NEWS FLASH! THE HYPE IS REAL! I REPEAT, THE HYPE IS REAL!%$#@!@#$% Sorry, that was me banging my head repeatedly on my laptop keyboard because I am so mad at myself for not going to this place a lot sooner! I couldnt wait to get home to do this review and I hope my keyboard is gonna work long enough for me to finish this!I ordered the Bulgogi Beef Burrito and my son ordered the Beef Bulgogi/Spicy Pork combo so we can share. OMG I couldnt make up my mind what to eat so me and my son split both meals.The Burrito has the best of both Korean and Mexican worlds! Now I know why they named themselves that. This tasty choice has Meat with Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian (Soy/Sesame base Sauce).Service is, let me put it this way, a little slow BUT before you jump to conclusions, you have to understand that they make everything from scratch and if a big party before you put their order in, then that is what is gonna go through first. That's understandable because if you ordered before somebody else, whether big or small, you should get it first right? With that said, I was a little irritated at first, but when my food came out and went straight to my mouth I was mad at myself for being irritated because the food is well worth the wait! I recommend that you don't be in a rush to go anywhere else if you plan on eating here and if you can order to go, that's even better because by the time you get there, it should be done.With the popularity of this place blowing up, I see one of two things that might happen: Either they open up another place or move to a much BIGGER location or both. The demand is definitely gonna out do the supply sooner or later because on really busy nights you are definitely gonna have to wait a while to get a table.Some random info: They are closed Mondays so make sure your cravings don't fall on that day! They have free wifi but I couldnt get my phone to work with it so maybe next time I will ask them. Parking can be a nightmare because they share the same small lot with other tenants. They take all major credit cards but be advised that anything under 10 bucks, you will be charged a service fee so as much as you can, pay with cash for all orders under 10 bucks. Its not Komex's fault. Its just that anytime you have a terminal for accepting cards, the company that processes it charges the business owner for every transaction. So you see its not a ploy for Komex to make more money. It's more like a convenience fee for not carrying cash. They don't have a take home menu for the info you need but you can look it up through their website:  www.komexexpress.com So with 350+ reviews averaging 4 1/2 stars, what more reasons do you need NOT to go here?I would like to thank all my Yelpmates for their wonderful reviews. If it wasn't for them I would have  no clue about this place. You know who you guys are your all on my Yelp friends list who have reviewed KoMex. You guys ROCK!So I woke up today around 4:00pm, still a bit jet lagged from my Asia trip, and i was craving Asian food, but something different than my usual eats.So I decided to finally check out KoMex. I was a bit reluctant to go because it is so freaking far from where I live. I checked out google maps and it told me it was going to take me 30 minutes to get there.I decided to go anyways and give it a whirl. I texted my roommates and they too wanted to go with me.About 25 minutes later we finally reached KoMex located on Decatur in small plaza. ( I must say DAMN! they need to open one in Henderson)The location is a bit far but i must say i do not regret going. The HYPE about this place is true! This place is awesome!I ordered the Bulgogi Taco and the Pork Taco which were cheap only $1.29 each.  Both tacos were to die for! They were a perfect size too!We also decided to try the Bulgogi Nachos for $7.99. This nachos is not your typical nachos. The chips itself even taste way better than your average mexican restaurant chips and their salsa and cheese are way awesome too. The nachos was so good i highly recommend this dish while over there.So since this place was far i decided to order more food. I figured hey might as well, I don't finish it at least I have leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast tomorrow. So i deicded to order the Kimchi fried rice with beef. I must say it was orgasmic! I'm normally not a fan of Kimchi, because it's too spicy for me. But who cares after eating KoMex's  nachos.Overall i give this place a  5 star. Good food! Very cheap! and friendly staff. I am looking forward to try the Bulgogi Fries on my next visit. Try now! Komex will give you the ultimate FUSION experience between Korean and Mexican!WHO: To all of you Korean food wrapped in tortilla goodness lovers!WHEN: I'm not too sure when they open, but I do know they close at 9pm.WHERE: North Decatur, sooooo far but soooo good! =/WHAT: It all began one night at about 8pm. My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lolWhen we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!I FINALLY made my way to KoMex after long anticipation and boy, did it live up to its hype! I stopped in after finding myself on "that" side of town and had luckily arrived ten minutes shy of their opening time. My guy and I sat in the car to wait until the clock struck 11. As we did, I noticed car, after car, after car pull into the parking lot. I kept eying the rearview mirror saying aloud, "I wonder if they're going to KoMex..." As I watched the first car full of people make their way towards the KoMex door, I jumped out of the car and dashed for the door (I entered first by the way). We took our seats and browsed through the menu. While there were many items on the menu I wanted to try, we agreed that we HAD to try something off the fusion side. We decided on sharing an order of the Bulgogi fries and musubis on the side (the latter selection mainly due to the fact that I have a man from the islands). So, the place filled up within minutes of being there and while we waited, we were served homemade chips that were warm, crisp, not too salty, not too greasy. Just my style. The fries arrived first and man, were they delicious! The mixture of flavors of everything atop the mound of goodness was perfect-- It somehow tasted as though you topped off an order of Gordon Biersch's garlic fries with perfectly cooked bulgogi. Let me tell you, it tasted better than an order of Roberto's carne asada fries after a night of intoxication. The musubis arrived shortly after and didn't disappoint. I've actually never seen them molded the way they did-- they were wider and flatter than other places usually make them. Two things I did observe during my visit which is the only reasons why I didn't tack on that extra star:1) As a holder of a food handler's card with lots of knowledge of food handling, I did observe one of the workers wearing the same pair of food handler's gloves the ENTIRE time I was there. The same pair was used to scoop ice, serve drinks, serve food, get items from the back, move the kitchen curtain, etc. I received a plate with a little bit of food on it as well as the drink I ordered having remnants of food that wasn't mine. 2) I should've chosen my seat differently. I sat in a position directly across from the opened gate that separates the little prep counter with the customer seating. This gave me full view of the large garbage can that I wish I hadn't had view of during my entire meal. Next time, I'll sit elsewhere. Can't wait to return!It takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightHit it!I wanna eat right nowI'm Greg N, and I came to chow downThis place is not internationally knownBut on the Yelp App on your new iPhoneIt's near the top and so highly ratedIn Las Vegas: and that's going to be debatedAfter you order, they give you fresh cooked chipsWith pico de gallo and guacamole dipsSome of the best chips that I've ever hadThis free offering made me feel real gladOrder three tacos with beef bulgogiRight on par with that truck called KogiKeep the flo' cuzIt takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightIt takes two to make a food so rightKorean/Mexican is outta sightHit it!

I don't see what the big deal is...I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.  To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entr√©e failed to pass my taste test.My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK....As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae...I knew that I was going to like this place before even stepping in. Komex is a fusion of Mexican and Asian...my two favorite foods. Their dishes are creative and very different. The fusion fries came in a huge order...very generous portions. I should've probably ordered the half order for my friend and I. The Bulgogi Tostada was my favorite dish...sweet and spicy. We also got the Bulgogi Nachos which were good but only the first layer...the toppings did not infect the whole order of nachos:( There was just not enough. The rest were just well chips...which are free when you dine in.Although everything was delicious, it's also very heavy...Mexican food usually is. I wouldn't eat here everyday but I can see myself craving Komex and making the drive to indulge in these unique dishes.If there was a fashion statement for food, it would definitely be fusion food! A lot of restaurants are trying different combinations and mixes and I think the best would be Korean and Mexican fusion food. When I found out about KoMex, I knew I had to give it a try. After reading the Yelp reviews and looking through pictures, I was impressed and my stomach was speaking to me... like it needed some KoMex! I'm just kidding, but really though, I was impressed now the only thing was to try it! There are two locations in Las Vegas now. When I first found out about this place, the only location was the one on Decatur/Washington. (I have yet to try the new one located on Buffalo/Flamingo). The location is somewhere more north of Las Vegas so a lot of the buildings are older and smaller. The plaza where it is located is in a plaza where there is a limited parking spot. Every time I go, I find a parking spot so i'm sure its not that bad! The moment you walk in, the restaurant is small, but it smells so good! Service is great! You are greeted immediately and sat down to a table.Every table gets a complimentary chips and salsa with guacamole. The guacamole is so good and taste very fresh! Everything on the menu is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant except it says "Fusion" before it. I thought it was funny! Anyway, some of the food that I have tried:Fusion tacos- I usually get the pork belly tacos and the bulgogi tacos with flour tortillas. Oh man, oh man... what can I say about the pork belly tacos... IT'S AMAZING! The pork is so fatty and cooked perfectly! Its not tough and its so juicy! They put the pico on top with shredded lettuce and the sauces that the server gives you once your food is ready! Bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine! The beef is cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness to it! All the tacos are delicious and you have a choice of flour tortillas or have them with a lettuce wrap!Pork-belly fries- Okay, by now I think you should get the hint that I love pork belly. One of my guilty pleasures! Think of carne asada fries, but with pork belly and the special sauces that they add and jalapenos! It is that good! Must try for yourself!Pork-belly musubi- It was a special at that time, but i'm sure you can order it. Just like spam musubi, they replace it with pork-belly. It was a bit too oily for me so I wouldn't really order it as much. Only when I crave for it!Fusion chimicanga- I had this with bulgogi and man.. its HUGE! I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good nonetheless!My favorite here would definitely be the tacos. Man, i'm getting hungry just writing this review.We found this place on Yelp! Thanks for all the previous reviews! We were greeted by friendly staff and we're seated. We had just enough time to study the menu. Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now! I'll definitely be back!Dammit, I really really wanted to like this place, and I still do want to, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. The restaurant is clean and neat, and the service was good. We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it. The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch. Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :(
Oaxaca Restaurant=I need to go back and I'm liable to up my review to 4 stars. I mean really: chilaquiles so close to home?!? They were delicious the first time but it's been a couple months - I need to get back there. Here's the deal: this restaurant used to be on Central Ave. just north of Hatcher (http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/0911mexdiningcheap.html) and they've moved to the Let It Roll bowling alley. As a consequence (I'm guessing) they were asked to have bowler-friendly foods like pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers. So, you'll find those on the menu.You'll also find the traditional Oaxacan food (and a mini version of the mini-mart) from the previous location.One drawback of being located in a bowling alley and being constrained to add bowling-alley food to your menu is that you're bound to have a customer that orders bowling-alley fare (which is never anything to rave about) and writes a review bashing the restaurant based on that - which is what one reviewer did. If you are going to try a Oaxacan restaurant, try the Oaxacan food, for cryin' out loud!You won't go to this restaurant for ambiance, although it does have a charm of its own, in a kitschy sort of way. But the food - wow, this definitely ain't one of the 'berto restaurants that litter the Valley landscape! Come here for the amazing tlayuda with cecina and tasajo (beware - it's a big portion, you might have to share) or the savory chilaquiles or memelitas. Perhaps pumpkin-blossom empanadas or verdolagas (purselane greens cooked with pork)? Decisions, mouth-watering decisions. On a cold day, have a cup of piping-hot atole. Or if it's a cold beverage you want. try the chlacayota; it's a refreshing drink made from a sweetened infusion of the chilacayota squash. It's not fast food and you may have to wait a bit as they cook your order but it's definitely worth the wait. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the prices are friendly to those who are on a limited budget.
Chaka Chaka Urban Cuisine=Chaka Chaka I love you!!!  I love hearing about fellow comics having some ambition and following a dream other than...comedy.  Charles started this place not too long ago and except for the porn place next door, it's great!  I think the neighborhood made for some good people-watching, too.Had the jerk chicken sandwich and the garlic fries.  I devoured both.  Well, I went with 3 other women in comedy and we all devoured our lunches.The server was super-friendly and prompt.  Even told him our orders and none of them got mixed up.There are only a few options on the menu, but I think it really works for Chaka Chaka.I mean, with a name like that, how can you go wrong???Oh, and get the brownie.  GET THE BROWNIE.
Penn Avenue Fish Company=It pains me to give my all time favorite sushi joint a 4 star review.  Why, you ask, would I give it my fav restaurant a 4 star?  Because service is just so horrible compared to the incredibly friendly and attentive staff at the actual Penn Ave location.  Is the sushi still the best in the city, heck yeah!  Do I salivate at the thought of their Pretty Girl Roll (salmon, avocado, spicy sauce and wasabi caviar in a soy wrap) and Spicy Yellowtail?  Heck yeah!  But then every time I head into this location the service is always the same.  Hurried and unfriendly.  Tonight was no different.  Our server was definitely not into us, or stopping at our table much and got our bill wrong 3 times.  I have never actually been to this location for dinner.  I know I should have tried an actual dinner item, but I REALLY just wanted some sushi!  I did, however, order the Butternut Squash Soup.  It was INCREDIBLE...creamy and rich!  This sorta made up for the crappy service (but not really).  Oh, and it's BYOB, awesome!I'm not swayed, I will be back....I just wish they'd be more friendly to make the experience better, since the food is phenomenal.  Here's hoping....
Joe's Diner=Finally an official "go to" diner for breakfast in Phoenix, without all of the added hype wait times and over~inflated~self~indulging hoopla that some of the "more famous" breakfast places have had from being featured on TV's food network!  Joe's Diner is the real deal, cooking tasty homemade breakfast the way it should be.First thing I noticed is this place is ten times the size of the other two "more famous" breakfast diners with plenty of room to move around with little wait times even when they are busy. It's easy in and easy out! Second thing I noticed was the service. It was fantastic and memorable! In fact it was THE BEST service we've experienced in any diner throughout all of Phoenix.  Even Joe gets involved cleaning tables, meeting his customers, shaking hands and asking for feedback on what he can do better to make your dining experience even better.  Dolores G mention he brought out some black eyed peas during her visit for good luck in the New Year. During our visit Joe brought out some samples of his candied toffee that was not on the menu for us to sample. It was toffee deliciousness that I've never experienced before. This owner is FANTASTIC with his customers!The third and final thing I noticed was their food tasted exceptional. Everything was cooked and seasoned very well. We ordered almost a sample of everything from pancakes with eggs, bacon and has browns to corn beef hash with eggs on top with a side of biscuits and gravy. We also had their Sunday special of eggs Benedict with a side of sausage.  Everything was awesome. Their homemade pancakes were light and had just enough flavor without being too doughy. Their scratch biscuits and gravy were "the bomb"! You can eat just the biscuit by it's self, it has that much flavor. Their sausage was exceptional with the right amount of spices and fat ratio. Their coffee was very smooth and tasty. They use Arbuckles, made in Tucson. We bought a bag to bring home!My only criticism was even though their corn beef hash and bacon tasted very good they weren't homemade at their diner, for everything else was.  Joe thanked me for my feedback and stated he has been working on making these in house with some trial and error. This is why this place deserves a 5 star rating, hand down. Joe and his staff will make your visit enjoyable, appetite fulfilling and well worth your time and money. I've been to the other two so called "more famous" breakfast diners many times and I have never met theirs owners nor have received service even close to this. Look out Phoenix and those two so called "more famous" diners!!  Joe's Diner will win you over as they have with me.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to try something Joe has either on or off his menu!01/20/11It doesn't take much to talk me into trying a new breakfast joint... I've a list of restaurants that were bookmarked YEARS ago, and I've yet to step into those places to order my first meals there, and yet, I read a couple of enthusiastic yelp reviews about Joe's Diner, and I'm there w/in a week or less, savoring for myself forkfuls of those delicious pancakes I read about, but there I go, getting ahead of myself...Delighted in finding ample parking (I think I arrived around 1030a or so), I walked into Joe's Diner pleasantly surprised to find a cozy 50s-, 60s-style diner.  Yes, yes, I read all about the atmosphere here, and I was still a little disconcerted, coming in from the open-air parking lot, but pleasantly so.  I liked some of the memorabilia, but I don't know what to make of the outdoor decor-- roofed and cemented empty garage w/ the parked truck?  Seems like wasted space to me- perhaps this is where the weekend overflow goes...  I initially was directed to the more-crowded room at the back of the diner, but it was much darker in there, and I wanted light (!), so I asked if I could have a booth in the more-spacious front.  "Sure," the hostess said, w/out blinking an eye, and I was already off to a great start.Couldn't decide what to have, so I decided to order the items that appealed most-- biscuits and gravy, pancakes w/ a side of fresh strawberry compote, and Thursday's lunch special of lasagna.  Ordered a cup of deliciously strong Arbuckles coffee, too.  The sausage and biscuits came out relatively fast-- good to note if you're really hungry and you want something quick! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA#LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA  I didn't care much for the biscuits, though.  Found them to be too tender.  (I like my biscuits to buckle, not crumble, a bit when I dig in w/ my fork.)  I'd requested the regular sausage to be substituted w/ chorizo, and the gravy was nicely done.  Too bad about the biscuits...  I next tried the lasagna... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw#CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw  Wow!  I really enjoyed the bites I had sampled.  The pasta was al dente- tender, yet had a nice bite to it; the filling was well-seasoned, yet not too salty-- meat was chunky, and the ricotta portion was generous; and the garlic bread that accompanied the entree was warm, perfectly crusty, and deliciously buttered.  I wouldn't mind returning back on a Thursday to have this dish again.  Last, but certainly not least, the pancakes!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw#cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw  Portion seemed small- there wasn't much of a rise, so I mistakenly thought the platter was of a short stack, but the server asked me to lift all cakes to see for myself.  Yep!  I counted three.  These cakes tasted amazing, and all they needed were a tiny bit of butter and simple toppings of macerated strawberries (I had to ask for a second serving of fruit).  Now, I wouldn't mind returning any day of the week to have a stack of these carb-delights!Cool retro decor; warm and friendly service, a bit relaxed in pace; and two out of three knock-out entrees on the first try put Joe's Diner on my list to visit again soon!  I'd take out-of-town guests here in a heartbeat!Weekend mornings I'm all about being a complete lazy bear, sleeping in then get up just long enough to lie back down on the couch. Only a few have the power to lure me out of bed and one of those is the promise of a big satisfying breakfast. Of course not by my own hand but by someone elses because lets face it, I'm that lazy on the weekends.So when I decided to cover the much buzzed about Joe's Diner it was sheer excitement that got me out of bed. You know a plate full of perfectly cooked eggs and bacon paired lovingly with cups of hot coffee and glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice are true motivators.As we saunter in we're welcomed by an upbeat good morning and sat pretty much immediately. Located in what used to be a classic car shop, husband and wife team Joan and Joe Seriale transport you back in time with 1950's nostalgia complete with glitter flecked seating and old tin billboards and neon signs. There's a flurry of waitresses and I kept waiting for Flo to appear with her huge red nest of hair but she never showed up.Concerning breakfast there's always that one nagging question, should I go savory or sweet? I say do both starting out with one of Joe's homemade Cinnamon Rolls ($2.59). The large yeasty bun arrived laying in its own caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon pool, complete with an oozing topping of cream cheese frosting. I nearly stabbed my partner with my fork after he took the best part, the tender loved filled center. When I eat a cinnamon roll I like take my sweet time, licking and nibbling on the outside, making sure I don't miss an inch of that roll. Then once I get to the center I'm gratefully rewarded with a mouthful of gooey pleasure.The Number Two ($6.49) is the more versatile choice when it comes to the sweet and savory dilemma. You get two eggs, your way, two sausage patties, two bacon strips and a short stack of fluffy pancakes. This plate has your bases covered with the addition of thick ropes of maple syrup which the pancakes gladly guzzle down. For an alternative try the strawberry jam in lieu of the syrup, some rules were meant to be broken.Joe's Homemade Biscuits & Gravy ($2.99) gets you a plate full of light-as-air biscuits grounded by a layer of sausage gravy. The gravy had a faint sweetness that was a surprise hit at our table.If you're having a rough morning from one-to-many last night, try this remedy, Joe's Breakfast Burrito ($6.59). Stuffed tight into a soft flour tortilla are three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and cheddar cheese served with a sides of sour cream and salsa. Or try the Breakfast Bowl ($7.59) which gets you scrambled eggs with ham, bacon and cheddar cheese served over home style potatoes. Both were filling and satisfying, the only thing was a couch afterwards to nap on.I foresee Joe's Diner getting me out of bed many more times in the near future, especially after dreaming about cinnamon rolls.OMG get the chorizo omelet!!! The place is cutely decorated and the service is super friendly, though a little slow. I am a booth girl, so I was happy to see that most of the seating up front was booths. I don't like tables and hate chairs.When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there.The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!Went here for a Saturday Smunch.  They were packed but the service was still great.  As things slowed down about noon the owner came out and made the rounds of his guests.  I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, potatoes, skipped the toast and added a short stack of pancakes.  Way too much food for me but it was all good, very seldom do I get pancakes that are not doughy and overly filling (including my own kitchen), I really liked these.
Midnight Diner=Great Diner Food...24/7.....Slack Service!Been going here for a few years now.  Up until this  year... I would have given it 5 stars.  I love the food but have to say that they really need to tighten up the slack in the service.They used to have a solid wait staff that had great energy and worked really well together.   They were entertaining and on the ball!   Now it seems like they have twice as many employees and the service is much less efficient.  Everyone moves at a glacial pace.When you pull in, you can almost count on the majority of the wait staff being in the back parking lot on smoke break.  The visit before last, we got there at shift change.  NEVER GO AT SHIFT CHANGE!!!!  They happened to get slammed and everyone got confused and in the weeds.  After 15 minutes, I had to flag someone down just to see if we were going to have a server.   After our order was put in and the food was delivered.... Our server never came back to fill a drink....and we had to flag her down to pay the tab.  I've watched food being auctioned off to the wrong tables, drinks spilled, dinner plates dropped etc.  It gets quite comical actually. No one seems to know what's going on there anymore.This past visit, there was a table that sat right beside us and it took 10 minutes for them to even be acknowledged.  One waitress asked the other waitress "Do you want them?" (Right in front of the customer)... They both rolled their eyes and walked off.  Eventually another server stopped to help them.  I think management needs to take a serious look at how things are being run and even possibly reclaim some of qualities that their former wait staff used to have.All in all, I'll keep going because I like the food.... But I may really have to think hard about going because of what I know is in store for the service. Perhaps they should can the smoke breaks.
Fukuburger Truck=Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.After a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. There was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.The music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. The menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.Once we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado "cream" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. The area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a "mutha fuga'!"to get back in the truck. This is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. EDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.I think my luck with Fukuburger is all negative or neutral at best.  Way back on July 1 (pre-grand opening) when I was following them on their blog and went to a Chinatown location at 8pm, where they said they will show up, but ended up being a no show after 60-90 minutes.  Then I waited in a line at one of the food truck rallies, thinking it was for Fukuburger, but the long line snaked its way to Slidin' Thru, and I ended up missing that opportunity.Anyway, finally thought my luck has turned when I was the second order placed at the Ellis Island sponsored Food Truck Smash-Up event.  When I received my burgers (#3 Buta-Burger & #5 Karai) I was pretty excited.  Finally a short line and short wait for this elusive and much loved burger, I thought.  Quickly navigating my way to a table in the shades, I took two pictures and attacked the burgers.  When I picked it up, I noticed that it was pretty greasy, to the point that almost 1/3 of the bun was soggy from the puddle of Fuku Patty grease.  As burgers goes, I was thinking this was no better than the cheap and greasy burgers served at hole-in-the-wall bowling alleys, and all the people that love and rave about Fukuburger must be on crack.At this point it would be a 1 star review.  But then I see the burgers that others ordered and I did not see the grease soaked buns or the puddle of melted fat in the paper trays, and realized that the food truck gods have dissed me again!Knowing that they can make and serve better burgers, I will give them one more try, but if the consistency is again on the negative side then that will be that + a down grade to 1 star for serving subpar food and lack of proper QA.1 star for the food + 1 more star because I know they can serve better ones than the ones I received for popping my Fukuburger cherry.Beep! Beep! Make way for the food truck...This mobile burger stand has quite the loyal fan base! Not only do they eat the food, but they hang out wherever the truck is parked and make an occasion of it. Seriously, I was here on a Thursday evening and there were at least 30 locals parked in the Fukuburger Truck lot, just hanging out. They must put something in the sauce.We took ours to go, as this wasn't the time to show off my +1's Honda Fit. I had the traditional Fukuburger and we shared an order of fries. HUGE burger, dripping with sauce. Delicious. Fries helped to soak up the juicyness, btw. Even though I was starving, there's no way I could polish off that much food by myself. If I lived here, I'd definitely be eating at Fukuburger more often. Sadly, I'll have to settle for the occasional stop on holidays or weekend vacations. Next time, I'll come ready to race!Just because it's a little cold outside doesn't mean you can't brave Father Winter and grab some grub from a food truck. Fuku is all that and a bag of chips. Er....Fries.I've been twice now, and both times, I've noshed at lunchtime into a heavenly afternoon. The first time, I had the basic Fukuburger. Amazing. They don't skimp on the burger patty!The second time, I had the SurrenderVegas special...named after one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas (per Yelpers and TMZ).  Yeah...they made a special burger named after a nightclub. Pretty damn awesome!They take credit cards. If you want all the morbid details, read the 200+ other reviews, but take it from me...this is a fantastic spot to get your food on.A few words of warning: Go Hungry! You will be STUFFED afterwards. Also, make sure you have a gym membership before you go. You'll need it afterwards. Also, try the Strawberry Lemonade. Lastly...be patient. As with all good food, it's made fresh...and it takes time. Don't be one of those overly anxious people. Peace.If you haven't tried these guys yet then go Fuku yourself! Literally! Come find out what everybody has been raving about! Their food is so good that their reputation has reached all the way to LA with an actual sit down restaurant! So if you are in the Hollywood area, make Fuku a part of your lunch/dinner plans. Your hungry stomach will thank you!As for the actual Fukuburger Truck, I originally gave these guys 4 stars because I'm very picky with who I give 5 stars to and it is very rare. The fact that it's a roadside truck and not a sit down restaurant, was major to me. BUT since I have been eating at their different locations regularly, I have grown to know the owners, Colin and Mags. You will not meet any nicer owners anywhere. Since these guys are customer friendly and they try to cater to everybody's requests, they have earned that 5th star! I appreciate the fact that they actually get back to you when you contact them. Now for the food. Doesn't matter if you're a first timer or not, everything on their menu is fantastic. Their beef Fuku patty is so juicy and perfectly seasoned that you will probably use it as the measuring stick to any burger you eat from that point on. What makes them unique is the different ingredients they put in their menu that you just can't find in other burger joints. Oh, and I can't forget to mention their different specials every night. Always something new and tasty. Special props goes out to Colin and Mags for actually naming their special the other night with my name! Awesome! Tell me how many other places would do that for you? Thanks again guys! Whatever you decide, you gotta get jazz fries with it. Trust me on this.Prices are reasonable compared to those other gourmet places. They take cash and cards. Remember, it's not easy to operate a food truck and they work hard so you can have a freshly cooked burger, so don't hesitate to show them your appreciation. Whether it's by tipping or giving them a great review, it's up to you.In conclusion, you will not find a better burger truck anywhere. Go to their website www.fukuburger.com for more info in regards to their shedule and contact info. Make these guys your regular stop and they will have you saying "TIP JELLY!"Last time I patronised this foodtruck, which was this afternoon, was my first time. And it was the best 5$ I have spent in a while. Instant customer as long as they stay open and keep the same owner/management. It was the burythehatchet event where the Fukuburger truck parked alongside bar + bistro on First street. I was attending the Mineola Twins stageplay across the street and was more than ready to try a quick burger. There was no line because they must have just set up and I had a #2 ("Tamago"). You may have heard that this burger is amazing. Well, it is. It is a shame I had not had it before and truly a threat to self-discipline for these things to be only 5$. I must say that it is unfortunate that there is no vegetarian option, but it is a minor point since I am not a vegetarian (the girlfriend is). In hindsight, after finishing my delicious #2, we should have gone into bar + bistro and thereby patronised both chefs involved with this friendly showdown. Alas, if only they can do this more often. - EI heart food trux big time and this is my number one grrrl!I frequent Vegas a few times a year and decided to look up some food trucks to check out during my stay. This has definitely become one of my staples when I'm in town!  Asian fusion burgers, fries with crazy sauce and fun staff are what make me a diehard fan. My favorite burger is hands-down the Buta-burger: applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled onions and red ginger topped with Japanese BBQ and wasabi mayo...yum town!!!  And I don't even like wasabi or ginger but the combination is outrageous. Look em up.  Check out the schedule.  Eat a burger.I'm pretty sure that Fukuburger has replaced dirty street tacos as my favorite post-libation-snack-while-you-sober-up option.Friday and Saturday nights they can often be found in a parking lot off of 6th and Fremont these days...and I completely support this decision. My standard these days is the #2 Tamago and their Jazz fries!  They do a great job with their burgers here...always cooked to a wonderful med-rare every time.  They have a couple house-made sauces that are spot on for burgers.  I would be confident ordering any of their items though.
Jimmy's Hot Dogs=My new go-to lunch or snack place when I'm at work in the Cotton Center area. Good honest Chicago-style hotdogs (using Vienna Beef) with the traditional toppings: mustard, onion, relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers, and celery salt -although you can tailor the toppings to your liking. Basic hotdog sandwich for $2.95, double dog for $3.95, pepper 'n egg sandwich $3.95, Italian beef $5.95; and all sandwiches include fries. A tasty meal, a great deal!Today was my first time eating at Jimmy's hot dogs, for hearing such good things & reading the reviews I was slightly disappointed. I wanted something quick & easy for lunch. It wasn't busy & service was fairly fast, I guess that's the benefit of having a later lunch hour. Customer service was ok, I mentioned it was my first time in and that I'd heard good things about their dogs. I ordered the fire dog(not spicy) which was told it's generally served Chicago style, I was asked what toppings I wanted, to my misunderstanding thought she meant additional to the Chicago style toppings. My dog which I'd ordered to go,  to my surprise only had what I thought were my additional toppings of spicy mustard & good bundle of jalapenos on it. It was a tasty dog & came with fabulous fresh hot fries for a reasonable price, I'll definitely try it again, it's close and good cheap eats.Wow, that was unexpectedly good!  I had the Chicago Dog (I don't remember, they may just call it an original hot dog) with everything and the free fries that come with it.  Ok, fine... you caught me, I'm lying... I had TWO Chicago Dogs.  Sometimes at places trying to replicate a good Chicago-style hot dog, I have experienced less than stellar results... things like soggy buns that fall apart or relish that is too sweet.  But here at Jimmy's, the bun was PERFECT and the the toppings were just as they should be!Oh, and the fries?  Ummm, UH-MAZ-BALLS!  Normally I'm not much of a fry guy, but here I let out my gluttonous fry side and gobbled up all dem fries!!I will DEFINITELY be back -- hurrah hurrah to Jimmy's for getting this Chicago classic just right!!It's been almost 2 years since I 1st stumbled upon Jimmy's and the 1st time I was just going along for the ride, and now Jimmy's is what I think of when I want a hot dog!  I am thrilled to see that Jimmy's is still doing great! They still have the freshest fries for a fast food joint, you literally watch the whole peeled potato get cut into perfectly proportion fries and placed in the fryer basket and watch them bad boys get fried! And you know what else makes these fries pretty sweet, they still are free, you are only pay for the price of the dog, and yes I bet are saying now oh but a 6 buck dog is paying for your fries, but here at Jimmy's you can get a dog for like 3.50, killer deal right there!Ever since I tried the Chicago dog at Jimmy's almost 2 years ago, that's all I crave, a Chicago styled dog, the tomatoes, the diced green peppers & onions, the peppers & the hot dog on this great bun!  So damn good!   If you haven't been to Jimmy's you should stop by, this place is more than just hype, its great hot dogs excellent fries at an awesome price!While visiting Arizona I called upon the local Yelper population to assist me in finding hot dog joints to visit and eventually review. One of the places suggested was "Jimmy's Hot Dogs" which serves Chicago style hot dogs and within a few days I had made my way there. I pulled up to a non-descript looking building and sure enough Jimmy's was there with Vienna Beef umbrella's out and visible. I walked in and decided to go for a hot dog and fries. I took a few pictures of the place on the inside and headed back to the table to actually sample the hot dog here. I ordered a hot dog with everything, fries and a cup of water. A few minutes later my order was up and it was time to try it.The bun here was a classic poppy seed bun as often found on Chicago style hot dogs. The bun was mostly soft with a few of the edges being a bit dry. The relish was of the neon green variety and was applied a little too heavily. The onion was chopped and applied nicely to the dog. The mustard was well applied as well, two thin slices of tomato were at the bottom. A thin pickle slice at the top and a pair of sport peppers were on the dog as well. The sausage used here was the classic Vienna beef natural casing and was properly heated up. The overall taste of the dog was excellent. The bun on the edges was a little more dry than I would prefer and the relish was applied a bit too excessively, but overall this tasted excellent and is a great representation of a Chicago style hot dog for people in Phoenix to try.The fries wrapped with the hot dog were "fresh cut fries". Over the past decade or so these have become extremely popular with hot dog vendors in Chicago. The good news is these taste like authentic Chicago style fresh cut fries, the bad news is as in Chicagoland, these are usually hit or miss and these were about average for ones found around Chicago. They weren't too greasy but they were a bit on the bland side. I didn't finish off the fries, but I will say these were a lot like what many places in Chicago serve.Overall for a Chicago-Style restaurant 1500 miles away, Jimmy's Hot Dogs easily exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend this place if you want a good example of what a Chicago style hot dog should taste like in Arizona. I tried several other places (with more reviews coming) that were serving alleged Chicago style dogs while in Arizona, and none compared to Jimmy's. I am going to give this place a full five star review.
Clean Catch Fish Market=Their product gets 5 stars and you definitely pay top dollar for it but it's great. Overall normal day service gets 2 stars as they are generally slow as hell. Today however gets 1 star.  0 or perhaps -1 if it were possible.I drive here all the way from Huntersville and don't mind the drive or their prices because the seafood is fresh. But I always call ahead to make sure what I want is in cause its quite a haul. No different today. Been wanting to make some chowder so called ahead and reserved 2 dozen cherrystone clams. "Do you have them? Yes, absolutely. Ok I'll see you in about 45 minutes." I get there, get ignored at the register for a few minutes and when finally helped. The woman looks at my order ticket, goes back to the back for 3 or 4 minutes and then comes back with an "it will be a minute". Ok. So my call ahead order isn't already ready. That sucks but I'll wait. Literally 10 minutes later, after they see me still standing by the register, one of the guys tells her to go back and "do a count of the clams". 3 minutes later she comes back and says something to the guy. Another 3 minutes go by and he goes to the back. Thank goodness he only took another 45 seconds to come back and tell me   "we oversold and have zero clams". No "I'm sorry." just a "well someone gave you bad information when you called".  You have to be kidding me. As Seinfeld told the rental car company. "You know how to TAKE the reservation you just don't know how to KEEP the reservation... What would have been great service recovery?  "I'm so sorry, how about a half dozen dry pack scallops on the house." Or, "Here's 5 bucks for gas or something, anything...!  Even half an effort like that would have kept me loyal. Instead... It's been nice knowing you Clean Catch.After more than 3 years I continue to be a weekly, if not more, customer to Clean Catch.  The fish is consistently amazing and over the years they have expanded things, offering a lot more of pre-prepared fish selections that can be heated at home and are outstanding.  Bill and Cain and the rest of the staff are attentive to your preferences, honest about how things taste and recommend amazing ways to cook their daily fish.  I am a fish lover and look forward to their creations and daily deliveries.  Recently I have tried their Tuna Tartare, Tuna Meatballs, Shrimp Enchilades, and so much more, all of which I love. And, I cannot forget to mention their homemade dumplings, from the Dumpling Gang.  A few different varieties but are all amazing.  There is nothing like Clean Catch in Charlotte and I will be a customer for life.  Check them out when you get a chance.
Thai Chili=It was a raining Saturday night and I was cold to the bone and wanted a warm bowl of curry to fill my tummy, I have driven by Thai Chili a few times and that night it was beckoning me to come on in, so I went!What a cute little place, love the feel of it. It's very clear that they do a lot of to go business, the call in orders & people coming and going were nonstop. Right off the bat I ordered some Thai tea, I love that stuff and it was perfectly sweet just the way I like it! Also ordered Sa-Te Chicken, it's really the peanut sauce I am after, that stuff is amazing, the chicken has always been a afterthought to me when I ordered that in the past at other places, but this time, the chicken was the main star, it was perfectly cooked and the seasoning, omg the flavor was amazing, almost shameful to put the peanut sauce on it. I was torn, I would bath in the peanut sauce if I could, but I didn't want anything to deter the flavor of the chicken, but in the end the peanut sauce happened.For the main dish I went with the Mussamun curry, I have to say out of all the curries, Mussamun is my favorite and it was what I craving on this cold night. It had great flavors, the chicken potatoes, carrots all perfectly cooked it was creamy orange and just heaven in the belly!! I also ordered it Thai Hot, whenever I got to a new place I just jump right to Thai Hot, the hotter the better for me, the waitress told me that's like habanero hot, and I told her to bring it!! When my dish arrived, you could visually see it was spicy, and after a few bites in my eyes were watering, SO SO GOOD!!! Then the waitress comes back to our table and tells me that their heat table goes to ten and that Thai Hot is around a 6,,,ooohhhhh oooommmmgggggg I need to try and 8 next time! Great little find, everyone was so very friendly, I enjoyed this place and look forward to coming backThis place would be your good, dependable neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I feel like it's not quite as authentic as Siam Orchid or Tum Nak Thai (both family run by husband/wife cook/wait teams) but they serve up some solid tasty food.They have a good range of vegetarian options -- I seem to always gravitate towards the Mushroom Soup, which is as close to my beloved tom kha gai as I've been able to get since I stopped eating meat.  The Golden Tofu is also pretty good but I sub peanut sauce for the sweet sauce it comes with.  I like their Silver Noodles -- mmm broccoli!  And they actually make a Larb Tofu, which is just alright in my opinion; even though it's been years since I've eaten beef, I think the dish tastes better with it than tofu.  My husband really likes their Beef Panang Curry and Pad Thai with pork.They have good lunch specials, a great rewards program, and very nice staff -- they always remember my name when I come in!  I don't think you'd be disappointed here.
Pyaar India Restaurant=I came to Pyaar in a roundabout way. You see, I asked the hotel desk clerk if he had a menu for the Thai restaurant around the corner, Archi's.  He said he did but they had changed the name to something else. He fussed around in a drawer (not in his drawers, that would be weird), said "Here it is" and handed me a menu for Pyaar.I knew right away that Indian cuisine is not Thai cuisine.  I'm funny that way.  While I have enjoyed being curried away at both, the food is distinctly different.  Anyone that is even a slight foodie is not going to confuse Thai food with Indian food.So I decided to check them both out. And I decided on Indian instead of Thai.I was the only one in the restaurant. I tried ordering several things and struck out with an assortment of "We're out of that" and "He only makes that during the day" (Hint-don't put it on the dinner menu).I opted to order several small things. I started with a veggie samosa, followed with some gobi paratha and to go...rasmalai.I really liked the samosa.  The gobi paratha was pretty good, with a nice robust and grainy bread.The rasmalai for dessert was...interesting.  Very sweet.Overall, pretty solid Indian, nice people and reasonable prices.And Sanford and Son on the tube when I left.Too old school for me.
Los Reyes de la Torta=Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."¬°Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.Adam...lead on!
Gold Chef=Trust me, I worked at a Chinese take out place before and this rice here is stale and day old, because fresh rice does not look off white and is not so hard.  Spring rolls when fried once are light brown in appearance, but refried ones that were not sold the day before, and thrown back into the deep fryer turns the edges dark brown and greasy.  Some folks might try to say the oil is just darker, but darker oil in the fryer means its not been cleaned and changed regularly enough that its gotten to a gunky black color.  It's a troublesome process and, it is true that most places do not do it often enough, but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your food.The chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all.  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce.  Overly starched and overly salted.  Does not have any flavor at all.  If this is NY style Chinese food, then its not the NYC I have been to.  My friend had their teriyaki chicken and its bad too : (  Same stale rice with pieces of oversauced chicken.  He said after it tasted kind of weird, not the teriyaki taste he was expecting.  Again too much starch and salt.  And this is the dude that eats everything. Dear fellow yelpers, stop short changing yourself.  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food.  Neither does big shrimp, crisp cabbage in egg rolls, big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food.  Guys, U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste.  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price, that's perfectly fine too, send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet, seafood or no seafood.  But please do not rate this place as 5 stars because a 2 star is generous.  I gave them 2 cause the service is good and they keep the place pretty clean and neat.  I think I am too generous already.Fast service and amazing food! had an order delivered to my home and I think its the best Chinese food I've had!
Tacos Mexico=I love a sketchy 24-hour taco shop, which is why Tacos Mexico has my heart. After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, "put burritos in me", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, "hood" had to offer.Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.
Mai Xiang Yuan=Watch through a window in the back of this tiny place as your dumplings get gently folded up and cooked fresh by women with serious, food loving faces. Enjoy the pop of juices, the perfect cooking, the lovely balance of flavours. Based on Yelp reviews last night we tried the beef curried dumplings fried, the pork, shrimp and coriander fried, and the pork and oyster steamed. 15 dumplings are served per order. Dinner was $35, served with speed and a smile by the one tasmanian devil of a waiter holding the whole place down and banging out some serious rapid fire turnover without making you feel rushed. We boxed up massive leftovers and left glowing.New Years Eve and my man romances me at a whole in the wall spot in Montreal's Chinatown. I will give it up he tried calling 100 places last minute but NYE, similar to places in NYC fill up fast and have $100 tasting menus and the food is never as good if you go on any other night so, why not go cheap, quick and delicious and get to the bar more quickly to celebrate with some bubbles?!First of all Montreal's Chinatown is great, same vibe as Chicago's. A few main streets chalk full of dumplings, bahn mi's, and other delicacies. The Yelp reviews were positive and Risa D stamped this one as the best so, done.The dumplings were amazing. But, just a heads up, this place ONLY serves dumplings. There are a few salad apps but, you are here for the dumplings and dumplings only. We went with all steamed varieties ranging from pork and leek to lamb and coriander (!!!) and finished it off with beef and onion. With 15 dumplings per order and at about $7 per order you get a lot of bang for your buck. Sweet. All were fabulous, I do want to highlight the lamb dumplings which I don't think I've ever had before and happened to be the winner winner chicken dinner of the meal. The other dumplings were just as great but the lamb had this extra kick to the meat. I also want to highlight that these dumplings were plump dumplings. Plump with juicy meat and with the skins being thin, the filling flavor really came through. Praise the dumpling lord, that's what I'm talking about. This place is super authentic with lovely lil' ladies in the back rollin' those dumplings as you eat. So fresh.My one gripe was they wouldn't give us water. We asked twice. Water never came. Dumplings and sauce are pretty salty and the free hot tea is really nice but, I really wanted ice cold water man. Whyyyyyyy?Regardless, this place was legit.The best dumpling place in town, good price and ultimately they serve dumplings that make us 'wow'. We try different dumplings each time we visit but always include pork, shrimp and coriander dumplings. Many people mention about spicy cucumber salad but try also lettuce and egg salad with wasabi dressing, it's amazing.so they moved, next door to a bigger, brighter and most importantly, cleaner place.in a way, this is an update from my previous review. instead of the 3 stars, i'm bumping it to a 4 stars as the food quality that you are accustomed to is still present therefore the fried dumplings that i'm not a fan of is still the same one.instead of fried, i got the steamed/boiled  lamb and coriander ones and they are still as good. my companion loved her dumplings too.bathrooms are cleaner, way cleaner! which is very unlike in chinatown. all in all, expect the same quality that made you love this place, just in a brighter and better place.probably the biggest disappointment, they are still out of many salad items..
Tropical Smoothie Cafe=Located inside the Green Valley Ranch. It's in the food court area just upstairs over the movie theatre.This is a small attached location with yogurt shop. The community seating for food court can be good or bad depending on how busy it is. When I was there it kinda sucked cuz there were a bunch of kids at the food court I think flowing over fro the movies.The staff is friendly. Got my smoothie out reasonably fast and was in the mood for fresh orangy mango taste. Bammm Sunrise Sunset it was. Strawberries, Pineapple, Mango and Orange with extra orange. Had it my way and like it!!Good spot for quick fresh while in thete and not wanting the whole restaurant thing.All good - do it!
Centurion=After watching a movie downtown, we decided to get a light lunch and I chimed in about how much I've been wanting to try Centurion since we nosed around on a bike ride last weekend. Little did I know we were in for a decidedly bold lunch. First, I must mention this place is in no way associated with its former tenant (214 Bistro and a later "rebirth" by the same guy). So there's no need to be apprehensive about the food or the service. And while the space hasn't been expanded, you won't be assaulted by airborne capcaisin upon entering. Rather, you'll begin your adventure into a quaint world with exceptional food. Our starter course was the fromage plate ($9) and we selected fromage a trois, manchego and goat cheeses. This was served with homemade bread, dijon mustard and jam on the side and strawberries. [The menu mentions a seasonal fruit is served with the cheese plate.] All were fantastic. Since none of us were terribly hungry, we decided to share our lunches. Robert ordered the gnocchi in shitake dijon cream sauce with panchetta ($13), his mom ordered the shitake spinach risotto ($8) and I their white truffle pizza ($12). Rob's gnocchi was triumphant and boldly flavorful, but not overpowering with the dijon mustard. MIL's risotto was delicate on the palette and remarkably refreshing on its bed of fresh spinach. My pizza was remarkably executed. It's made in a brick oven with pecan wood, which lends a fantastic smokiness throughout the entire pizza. Incidentally, the oven is also used to roast the rack of lamb and poached tilapia, which are on the dinner menu. So our "light" lunch turned into quite the experience, and with to-go boxes as we were all pleasantly sated on our rich meals by the time we were about half way through the portions. I'm on the fence about whether this would be a good place for a group. On the one hand, you could totally take over the restaurant with about a dozen people and feel like you have the place rented out to yourself. On he other hand, once this place gets in the foodie rotation it will be harder to accommodate. At least that's what I'm hoping.  Something that may want to be addressed is the bench seating. I was higher up at the table than Rob and Belinda and my legs were close to touching the bottom of the table. Maybe with someone heavier they would sink into the cushions more? Centurion was a hit with us, and this will be a place I'll return to again and again (I'm so excited to try the lamb!), and be in the top five places I'll be taking out-of-town guests. While they presently don't serve alcohol, they are applying for a license and intend to have premium beverage options (think a notch or more above top shelf).I'm starting to form an association with this place and watching movies at AMC AZ Ctr. Friday night I stopped by to have a dinner before seeing a film. Shortly after arriving, they addressed me by name and inquired about my bacon tattoo (thanks, Amy D!! They thought it was a hoot.) And they remembered I wrote about wanting the try the lamb ($27). In a word: Phenomenal Rubbed with Dijon mustard and topped with fresh herbs, the lamb was baked rare (I don't see any reason to cook lamb past rare; doing so destroys the terrific texture and flavor that make lamb such a treat for me). The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. Now I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal. And as my leftovers sat next to me in the theater, I felt wonderfully fulfilled not only because I converted to Team Jacob but because of the knowledge I would have the best lunch in the office come Monday. Centurion is a damn fine restaurant.I talked my gracious date in to taking me somewhere new for dinner on Friday night. He wanted Dicks, but I can be pretty convincing when food is involved. I head read a lot about Centurion on Yelp, so I persuaded him this was the spot to try. I was pleased to see we were the only people when we arrived. I always like the special attention and choice of seating. We chose a spot outside on the patio to take advantage of the beautiful evening and got busy with our orders.We started with the baked clams in a berry balsamic reduction and pancetta cream sauce, it was light and scrumptious. We also shared the three entr√©e dinner for two  1/2 rack lamb,  1/2 filet mignon and  1/2 poached tilapia. They were all excellent, the filet had a smoky wood fired sear and the lamb was incredibly moist. The entr√©e came with three risottos: a white truffle, a chorizo and manchego and a spicy coconut shrimp. The flavors were great, however the risottos were extremely overdone (had I cooked those at home I would have pitched them out before serving them to my guests). To the chef Eric's credit, he did offer to have us back and to try the risotto on him as he claimed that is not the norm. I will be back, the place is charming and the overall vibe very inviting, no one is perfect (risotto) but the heart and effort put in to the dish is worth a second chance.This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food. We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.  Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entr√©e was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.  At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.  The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, cr√®me fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some cr√®me fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.  The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.Good, but I don't think I'll "cross the Rubicon" for this place.  Don't get me wrong, the food and location are good...it's the execution.  The things that soured the experience for us.First, the whole restaurant.com mess.  We went with our gift card.  We were greeted with a sign explaining that if we had a card we should see the manager to get a refund.  We did as the sign requested, but were rebuffed.  She said that they were now overwhelmed and that we should take it up with the folks of restaurant.com. She explained that it was beyond their control.  Bad form, take down the sign then. Caesar wouldn't have put up with that kind of response in his legions.  Second, the set up of the place is cluttered and confusing and small.  There is no hostess to direct traffic- unless the you count the Centurion- so you are left guessing as to what to do.  Third, we came right before six and were told we had to wait five minutes to order from the dinner menu.  That was odd and not very accommodating. Once they work out the kinks- namely the restaurant.com fiasco- the place has potential.  The food was good.PS- The website states, "Serving food from the regions where the ancient Roman centurion marched with his men, i.e. France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, etc.." I had the coconut shrimp risotto.  It was great but I was unaware that the Roman Empire extended to Southeast Asia or the Pacific Islands.  I don't think any Roman, centurion or otherwise, ever tasted the sweet meat of the coconut.  Any historians are free to correct me.Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE:Dinner for four at 6:30pm on a First Friday could have been trouble, but there was no waiting, no rushed service, and no diminished quality from the kitchen.We were seated in the corner bench area in what I'd call a "studio restaurant" -- 12 or so seats, 5 bar stools, and in-your-face adjacent, bustling kitchen made for a lively and somehow uncramped 2-hour meal.Chef Osburn's menu had us perplexed by the varied and extensive offerings coming out of that tiny kitchen.  We spent 15 minutes discussing the menu and sipping APP: The white bean trio finds a way to present cannellini in three distinguished ways, but the puree with truffle oil lingers after the plate is taken away and breaks the three-way tie. The bread is deceivingly ordinarily looking, has a dusting of seasoning and absorbs olive oil very well.  [memorable ingredient: TRUFFLE OIL]SALAD: With Mom I shared the grape, apple, arugula salad that's served with blood oranges, smoked paprika cashews, and the most appropriately light application of blue cheese dressing I've ever had.  The oranges gushed, the apples snapped and crunched, the cashews were not overly smoked, and the arugula was crisp, not limp.  [memorable ingredient: perfectly purple BLOOD ORANGE fillets]MAIN: The gnocchi with season vegetables (artichokes, butternut squash, shitake mushrooms, leeks) reminded me that the fare at Centurion is decidedly French-Italian.  The sherry reduction with a touch of cream draws a sweetness across the top of rich squash, nutty mushrooms, and lemony artichokes...very lemony.  The gnocchi themselves were plump with a satisfying tooth-feel without being mushy or gummy or too potato-forward.  The dish -- like the others -- came out piping out, and with any pasta+cream dish, was best in the first 5-10 minutes.  [memorable ingredient: SHERRY]DESSERT: The table shared two: the espresso cup and the flourless chocolate cake.  The centerpiece item of the first was a dark chocolate demitasse cup -- yes, an espresso cup made from chocolate -- filled with an espresso mousse and toped with molten caramel.  The dense chocolate cup was a fun transport for the airy mousse.  (Idea: A graham cracker baked lid might have made this an interesting s'mores update.)  The flourless cake was also dense but not brick-dense, and the accompanying berry and apple-lemon purees made each bite a bit different. [memorable ingredient: APPLE-LEMON puree]SERVICE: During dinner the delightful server showed acumen in food knowledge and was attentive to everything from water to wine to cutlery to change for the parking meter.  When we arrived, the restaurant was serving about five guests.  When we left Centurion's small dining area and front patio were full.A strong meal for sure. I'll be back to try Sunday brunch soon.I'm in LOVE! I came here after purchasing a Groupon... We sat on the patio enjoying the great weather. Our server was great and we quickly found out he was the Owner/Chef. They were offering two liquors that evening and one was a Vodka filtered 5 times through white rose petals. There are no mixers so it was served over ice. It was THE best vodka I have ever had! We ordered the Artichoke and Salami pizza and the Portuguese style mussels to share. The owner recommended the pizza since it was our first visit. It was WONDERFUL! I couldn't get enough. I normally do not like tomatoes with my shellfish but I was easily convinced that the Portuguese style were the best, so I gave in and boy am I glad i did!!! I was actually eating the tomatoes out of the broth (if you know me that is amazing!). We had parked our car right in front of the patio we were sitting on... While the car parked in front of us was leaving they crashed into our car and began causing a scene...(long story short) The owner stayed with us until the police arrived and made sure everything was taken care of properly. He was so amazing and sincerely concerned about our safety. We owe him big time! Thanks again and I will be back very soon!Where to begin? I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man, but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skills.I'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it in.Attempt one: "We don't accept reservations this late." (The coupon required a reservation) Attempt two: "We're not open this late on Sundays" (It was 7pm) Attempt three: "We're not open, doing construction on the patio."In each attempt mentioned above, a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his reply.The final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered, she was much more professional and customer-service oriented. (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone. Hint. Hint.)After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired; $25 wasted.The owner said he felt bad about it, and gave us a few free drinks. I was livid. However, I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting). The salad was disappointing, the cheese overpowered it. I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plate.The friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoning.I think I should be forgiven for the one-star review, the rating is well deserved.So we decided to try something different last night.  Against a couple people's advice we ate at Centurion, we had heard it changed hands since our friends ate there, so what the heck.1) The waitress was extremely friendly and eager.  She needed a little polishing on the waiting skills,but nothing major.  We were very happy with her bubbliness.2) They do not have an extensive hard liquor selection, as they are more a wine bar.  No problem, except that the $10 - 2oz pour vodka "martinis" came out in those mini vintage coca-cola glasses, with an unripened green olive containing the pit (we were warned about the pit ahead of time).3) They have an extensive mussel selection, about 5 different ways to prepare.  The waitress was very knowledgeable on the different preparations and explained them all in detail to me.  I chose the Loise (some type of lemon, butter, caper broth).  She also explained that the mussels used were New Zealand Green mussels, and were bigger than ordinary ones.  Hmmm.  So my entree comes out in a large bowl filled with broth and no capers, and about 8 mussels, which were about 3x the size of normal mussels.. Sweet!  I thought...  Until I ate one.  It was the most disgusting tasting mussel I have ever put in my mouth.  It tasted like i just scooped up a bunch of fish crap and shoved it in my mouth along with some dead creatures.  Disgusting.  I only ate 3 of them and could eat no more.  I believe they had been frozen too, as they were terribly rubbery.4) My partner had the Portuguese style fish stew, which was much better than mine, but had a few flaws of it's own.  He watched as the chef thawed the frozen filet that went in it.  It also had a couple of those horrid mussels in it which he didn't eat on my advice.  He thought there was too much tomato sauce, although it was quite good.  I tried a couple of bites of the fish and sauce, and agreed it was much better than what I had ordered.  But not mind-blowing.  The other shellfish in his stew (mostly small clams) were fine, no taste really, but went well with the stew base.5) A couple other observations.  This space was definitely not intended to be a full service restaurant, nor should it continue being one.  It is about 400 sq ft inside, there is a bar (not the kind you drink from) dividing the kitchen from the dining room, so guests can see everything going on in the kitchen which faces the dining room.  W were able to see that not much, if anything was prepared fresh.  Things from cans, Uncle Bens rice packets, Franzio wine in a box (maybe this is the chef's private stash?).  The stove, oven, and brick oven make it extremely hot inside for the 4 tables.  Sitting outside was much better, but after May is not possible in Phoenix.  They apparently don't have a cleaning crew either, because all the extensive tchotchkes, pictures, and decor has a thick layer of dust on it.We arrived around 9pm, and there were 2 tables outside and 2 inside.  It looked as if none of those tables had actually eaten, but were just drinking wine and talking.  Maybe there's a reason for that?So much potential, but ultimately a let down.  We arrived at 730pm without a reservation. To be fair we had a Groupon and the fine print did require a reservation. But the place was empty except for two diners inside and a party of three on the patio. Eric hesitated but did accommodate us on the patio. We ordered two beers and the cheese plate to start. As we munched on the nicely presented cheese plate and sipped our beers the waiter came out to take our orders. He recommended the duck pizza. We planned to order two pizzas and a dessert. He loudly added up our tab and announced that we were his cheapest Groupon customers ever. A few minutes after ordering he reappeared and very unconvincingly told us that they were out of all Pizzas and we would need to order entrees. This was a desperate attempt an an up sell as Chef Eric was obviously annoyed that he accommodated us.  We were tempted to finish our beers and cheese plates, pay the check and leave but we did order two pasta dishes. They were mediocre at best. This is probably one of our least favorite dining venues downtown. The personality of the owner/chef is largely responsible for our disappointment.I first reviewed this restaurant 2.5 years ago and boy, time flies! Centurion continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. Easily in the top 5. It has changed a lot since my first review and now added Bar Maximus. You can still order food from the Centurion menu at Bar Maximus. I have several favorites on the menu which overall ranges from inexpensive to pricey. Lately, their Hamburg mussels is what I crave. It comes in a crockpot with a creamy sauce that you dip your endless, buttery bread into. Uh, so freaking to die for. My 6 year old and I fight over that dish. As a matter of fact, we are each going to get our own next time. Ha! I also love their Israeli couscous salad made with feta, salami, chicken, cucumber and a light dressing. They also make great pizzas, risotto and dishes from their brick oven. Try their handcrafted cocktails, too. While a little pricy, they are well-made. Eric also has a really nice wine list for different palates. Case in point, my husband and I have vastly different tastes in wine and can still enjoy a glass there.
Venues Caf√©=What a shame...Like so many of my failed relationships I fell for something that looked attractive, only to find out that beauty is sadly often only skin deep.  Such was my relationship with Venues today.It looked great.  The location is cool, right near the sundial and the stone work and rustic/contemporary feel really pulled me in.  We grabbed a table outside and the waitress handed us some menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  She brought an iced tea and then we watched.We watched the staff walk around seemingly in a New Years Day daze.  After about 15 minutes I told my friend to put down her menu, thinking that her still holding the menu was preventing the waitress from thinking we were ready.  Five minutes later I finally succeeded at getting that precious eye contact and she took our order.  Then...once again...we waited.Now another fifteen or even twenty minutes passed and this time when I gained that eye contact I must have triggered her memory that we still hadnt been served so she went and checked.  Nothing.  Another five and she says "I'm going to see whats going on!"  She came back and acknowledged that she forgot to put our order in and offered to buy me a beer.  It was too early so I declined, but no other compensation whatsoever was made for this screw up.She then came back again and told us that it shouldnt be much longer...there was only one order ahead of us.  How could anybody be ahead of us?  Wouldnt the kitchen drop everything to take care of the salad (thats right...thats all we ordered).  Nope.Another five.  "Its almost done...there are just finishing the chicken."  We stopped her and said "Thats OK now...just bring the lettuce...we dont need the chicken".  "OK...are you sure?"  "Yes!!!" we told her"  We expected her right back now...no such luck.  Another five and she finally came back with the salad with the chicken.  Now she didnt try to bluff us and took fault for the error.  I'll give her that but the check came without any favors.  Didnt offer dessert.  I wasnt drinking and hadnt even hinted that I do so it was surprising that the only offer she made was for a beer?  She joked and even tongue in cheek made fun of the situation and it did add some levity.  She acknowledged "The shitty service" (her words) which I did laugh at.  But who would go back when they didnt even say "Hey....its on us...just please give us a second chance".  I dont think I will ever go back.  Maybe for a drink but I really felt bad for everybody waiting on their meal.  I think that one table left without waiting for their food while we were there.Great atmosphere and unlimited potential I might guess but as for right now the "New Ownership" sign isnt winning over any patrons.  It couldnt have been any worse before.Good luck.  Its a tough business!
Firefly=Solid 3.5 stars.  We hadn't dined at a Firefly in at least a couple of years so what the heck.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of this one over Paradise.  High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  The menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster "escargot style" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  Aside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!  Who knew warm wilted spinach with pine nuts, roasted peppers and artichoke would be so good??  I think whatever dressing they had going on knocked it out of the park.  The sangria packed a nice punch as well.  I would be fine coming back to this location.
Chicken Shack=A young Rex...a young taught schoolboy Rex...was once a star athlete. I was good at all of the sports the other boys wished they were. I was great at shooting dice, 3 Card Monty, pick pocketing and loan sharking. I was the envy of my entire 3rd grade class. Very few kids that age can play the shell game on a street corner for 8 hours and then kneecap some deadbeat over a 20 dollar debt at night.  I was a machine...a well oiled, tight bodied machine. The girls...oh the girls...nap time was a special time. A young Rex surrounded by his prepubescent harem.  It was magical. I was on top of the world.  My aunt Eunice would see me come back with some old man's pension check, because he owed 3 weeks of the vig after betting on the Giants, she would beam with pride.  We would go to our special place...and then he would take me for food. I deserved it...believe me. She would buy me fried chicken. I loved it. It washed out the taste of low tide. Bribe sweet bribe. Bribed my silence.  As an older man I look back on those days and still cringe. Sure the money was good. Sure the chicken was good. The rest...not so much.I tell this tale of woe and want for one reason...all of that great chicken was almost blotted out of existence from a combination of court ordered therapy, LSD, electroshock, and Kenny G Therapy...my own creation...not for the week of heart.  I discuss it in detail in "Kenny G: How the Devil Gave Us Therapy."  Those great chicken dinners would be lost to the recesses of my mind...just flickering images...like the ones I see of me standing on top of a building, naked, wearing a beer hat and smoking a cigar...images of meaningful nonsense. That was until I went to the Chicken Shack. Oh, sweet Chicken Shack. Let me hold you. Let me kiss you. Let me call you aunt...wait...never mind. Chicken Shack does what it does...and it does it amazingly! Chicken Shack chicken is never frozen. The breasts and the wings are huge...like Busty Dusty big. Ah, memories...I almost suffocated at a club in Pittsburgh once. The 5 strip lunch/dinner is more than enough for the biggest eater.  It comes with fries and a drink for under 8 bucks.  Fountain drink for unlimited soda. I saw these two huge fat guys mowing down a 5 piece. They looked full. They looked content. They looked like they had hypertension. God Bless America. The wings are excellent but I recommend the strips. More meat. Tender. Juicy. Delicious. Same price. The sauces. The sauces are key to a place like this. Like having weed on you when trying to sleep with Jennifer Aniston. Mandatory.  Well, Chicken Shack doesn't disappoint. Recently I had the special Habenero Honey. It was sweet. It was hot. It hurt a little bit after 4 pieces. It hurt the good way...like being dumped by Amanda Peet...that body can only keep you happy for a long time...then you are just praying for a stroke.  The BBQ sauce is excellent. The Garlic Parmesan sauce is absolutely amazing. The chili lime isn't very good, sorry. Too limey...like Hugh Grant. If chicken isn't your thing...then you think that Rex will tear into you for going to THE CHICKEN SHACK...but no...not at all...they have a burger there that is amazing. A single. A double. A triple. You can add cheese and bacon. Yes...triple cheese and bacon.  Oh is it good...it's really good. I ate it. I cried. I ate it again. I cried harder. I threw a chair out the window. I ran. They have an all you can eat chicken wing and 1 dollar beers. If that doesn't sound good to you then you are a loser. I say that with no hesitation. No remorse. No second guessing. You are the type of person who would hold up a bank but leave the stuff in the safe.The atmosphere is great. They have funny slogans on the wall. Cute. Sickeningly cute. Rex is sarcastic. Rex hates it. Others will love it. The bottom line is that this is obviously a family place run by people who actually care. Rex is very happy to find a local business that prides itself on quality and building an ongoing local relationship with customers. Nice owners. Great food. Local. Cheap. Quality. When Rex dies please batter and deep fry him. He deserves the honor. Take a bite. Take a big bite. You love the way hate tastes.I went here ever so eager. My eyes went wide at the menu - so many possibilities and so many sauces to try.I opted for the standard wings. And went with trying 4 of the sauces - hot, damn hot, chili lime, and habanero honey. Blue cheese and ranch for dipping. Also ordered fries with fry sauce and potato salad.The wings themselves are nice and plump. Very good quality. And the wings are actually breaded, which can be hard to do well. But the breading was nice and crisp and had a good flavor. So all is good with the actual wings.The sauces, though, are lacking. The hot was actually more like a mild. Zero heat and little flavor. The chili lime was similar. I could barely tell it was chili lime there was so little flavor. The habanero honey also had zero heat and was too sweet. The damn hot, however, was fabulous. It had heat and flavor, but wasn't hot just for the sake of being hot. So, with the exception of the damn hot (which is the hottest on their menu), if you don't like heat or lots of flavor in your wing sauce, this might be the place for you. This is where they lose major points. The sauce is the most crucial part of the wings.The blue cheese and ranch were ok, but not great. They didn't add anything to the wings. They're just sorta there.The fries are really good. They are shoestring fries that are crispy and non-greasy. The fry sauce was just average. They do also offer chili cheese fries.The potato salad was edible. And that's pretty much the best I can say about it.Good service. Props for the $1 drafts and all you can eat wings.Overall, if they could just get some better wing sauces (or my taste buds suddenly deteriorate), I might be back.Chicken Shack.I'll keep you my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aqwn3jdQLCWnb59gHK4nAw?select=RdNqQUC1ycmedKx6NWD0Rg#YUmHZ0Wy3sIY5w6H0OZDKwWho has to know?Best fingers. Best fries. That's all you need to know.Nice little joint you guys got here tucked away in a plaza off of East Sunset Road.I ordered the number 1 combination which consists of 6 Wings, Fries, and a Drink for 8.29 plus tax. I chose chipotle honey barbeque sauce for the wings which has a nice combination of sweet and spicy. The wings themselves has a slight breading on it which gives it more of a crunch to its crispiness.As for the fries, SHOESTRING! I dont think I have had shoestring fries that good in a long time. If anything, I would go out on a limb and say it was even better than the wings! I can only fantasize how good their chili cheese fries might be. They also have chicken strips, burgers, and a salad with your choice of grilled or fried chicken. Now for the downers. Their prices are bit high for your basic chicken wings. The biggest thing I think that doesnt make sense is that they dont serve you any sauces with your wings like ranch, blue cheese, etc. Of course you can have your choice of dipping sauce but only if you wanna pay extra. Also if you want veggies like celery or carrots, that is also a separate charge. WHAT? When you think of wings, you see a plate or basket full of wings, fries, veggies and dipping sauce. That right there is perfection. I can think of many other places that give you dipping sauces and veggies included with your meal or at least free when you ask for it. With everything mentioned, mostly good and a little bit of bad, this warrants 4 stars. To the owners, if you are reading this, a little bit of sauce and veggies goes a long way.Wow! It should be called CheapSkate Shack! We are obviously regulars here (ashamed to say Dukedom) and they wouldn't let us have a water cup...basically accusing us of trying to steal soda. My daughter drinks water or soda. If she wanted soda today, we would have bought a soda like all the other times before. But to hassle regular customers about a stupid water cup is RIDICULOUS!! Being the greasy dive you are CS, you will attract the less than savory crowd who take advantage of water cup privileges. Solve the problem without insulting your regular paying clientele!Also from the lack of cleanliness in your dining area...you could do for a health inspection.Thanks to Bethany E. for turning me on to Chicken Shack. To my surprise after I checked in and was seated Bethany came over and introduced herself. It was a pleasure to meet you finally Bethany!It was the lunch hour and Chicken Shack was rockin although I had no problem finding convenient parking. I opted for the six wing combo which included shoe string fries and a beverage. Service is prompt - within minutes my entree was brought to my table and I was taken back of the size of  the chicken pieces served. I chose chipotle sauce on the side which was tasty and the fries were also yummy. The portions are generous here and I couldn't finish all  the fries.I would definitely return to the Chicken Shack.After living in Vegas for a year, I'm used to going to places with high ratings/reviews and being underwhelmed. This place lived up to the hype! Large, meaty wings in great sauces, with surprisingly tasty shoestring fries- and I don't even like the shoestring cut! Service was also surprisingly friendly and prompt, so don't let the location and exterior fool you.The #4 combo is the way to go for a little of everything: 3 wings, 3 strips, fries, a drink (fountain), and toss in bleu cheese or ranch for just under fifty cents extra. Your total is under $10 and it's enough to stuff you to the gills or share (though for dinner I'd add on an extra 6-piece).Habanero honey and jamaican jerk are really tasty sauces- as my BF said, I'd buy these bottled if they were available! The bleu cheese dressing tastes homemade, which makes paying extra for it a little less annoying.Wish they had more than one location- I think they'd do well on the West side (hint, hint).Read the reviews from this place a couple weeks ago and got excited, and as usual...I was let down!!! I never like to review a place after one visit anymore, so I gave it a couple chances. Fail fail fail. To succeed in business, you need great customer service. This place does not have it. After reading on their website that they close at 9pm, I get in my car around 7:45pm to travel 11 miles to this place. I arrive around 8:15pm. It's a family of four head of me in line. The guy behind the register is preparing some take out orders and never acknowledged them. They had enough with the waiting, and the lady says she's ready to order. His response? "Oh we're closed". What the hell are you talking about you're closed? He says "we close at 8:30 and its 8:31". I couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing! If the customer is inside before those doors are locked? You're still open for them!!! The lady and her family angrily walk out, and I do the same. What made me even more mad??? I get to my car and see that it's only 8:24pm!!! The boy was straight up lying to our faces!!!I told myself that I was done with that place, but because of such high remarks on yelp, I wanted to try the food. Decided to go back the weekend after, early in the day, so I can see if the hype was real. Ordered 3 wings, 3 tenders and fries. Back in college, I worked for KFC... So I know exactly what old fryer oil looks like when used on chicken, and what it smells like. Old oil (reused or not changed) will make your chicken darker, and make it taste funny. This was the case with Chicken Shack. Absolutely nasty. Fries were soggy and lacking taste. It was so bad that it prompted me to go online to find out who owns this place. Whoever you are...we need to speak. You served me a trash worthy product. Get it together. Will not return.Worst treatment ever & it was from the OWNERS. As someone who has worked in in the restaurant business for over 15 years now starting as a dishwasher and working my way up into management doing everything in-between I have NEVER seen anyone else, let alone myself, treated so unfairly in my life. I've been eating at Chicken Shack for over 6 years now. I live right across the street and have filled up MANY loyalty cards with them. Along with bringing my friends and family into their restaurant. Their cashiers and guys who normally work their are great. I call my orders in, they know me, and they take care of me. The other day when I stepped in the owners were working. I had called my $16 order in ahead of time, and the female owner came over and rang me up. I told her it was nice seeing them in the store and handed her my loyalty card. This is when the fun began. She begins to tell me they only stamp the cards for combos. Well...a combo is $6, I just spent $16, and normally the guys would stamp it for me anyways. I never even knew it was a combo card because they always stamp it because I'm a loyal, regular customer. Much like we do where I work. We actually take care of our regulars. I mentioned the $16 dollars to her...and I am not joking...this is where she proceeded to tell me that people like me were, in her words, "combo jerks". "People like you come in all the time trying to be "Combo Jerks"." I laughed it off because honestly I was surprised an employee would speak to a customer like that. Let alone the owner. As I got my order to leave I told her I was disappointed, and her response once again was "just don't be a combo jerk." I took the food and drove home. Still thinking of how I was treated I didn't think to check the food. It's usually just fine. Well, I got home to be surprised that half my chicken was burnt. I had had it. I called the store back. Got the run around for 5 minutes until I got the owner on the phone. I told her half the chicken was burnt and her response was "You were complaining from the second you got up to the counter. If you don't like it bring it back." WOW...just WOW and when I proceeded to tell her I'd never be coming back she hung up on me. Tell me that isn't great ownership. I don't know peoples excuses sometimes for being so mad at the world but this ruined my day. I was only looking for a meal before a night at work where I deal with customers with the utmost respect every night, and I lost my local eatery along with a dose of hope for humanity. I'm already spreading the word to those I've brought in. My family will not be back and there's a lot of us. I can't speak for my friends but they haven't been happy with their service in a while either so we'll see once they hear this story for the ages.Shack attack! From the first time we set foot in Chicken Shack to the present, it's been our favorite place for wings.  I have a catch phrase of 'Shack Sunday' because we always come here to get our wings during football season.  They open at 10 so it's perfect for game time. They are located off of Sunset in the Smiths shopping plaza so it's easy to find with ample parking.  Now let's get down to business- the wings here have stayed consistently huge, succulent and flavorful.  They offer a huge variety of sauces for the wings.  All are great.  The hot sauce and the honey habanero are our favorites.  You can choose to have them tossed in the sauce or on the side.  Tip- if you're carrying out, get the sauce on the side and toss them yourself when you get home. I hate to leave out mentioning the over addicting shoestring fries.  They do not skimp on these tasty sides.  The BBQ baked beans are also a favorite of mine. It's always a tough choice of mine which side to get.  Customer service is reliably top notch. They treat us like one of their friends every time.  They are always friendly and make a point to say hi even during a busy time.  I always appreciate their kindness as well as the amazing food.  Any day is always a great day for wings!I had to visit the Chicken Shack because I was craving their chicken fingers. I've been here a few times before, but I finally took the time to visit again and write a review.Inside, the walls are decorated with license plates from different states. It has a pretty cool feel to the place, but it can get crowded given the fact that it is small.Since I was buying food to feed 4 people, I ordered the shack pack (your choice of 25 wings OR 20 fingers, two large sides, and 4 drinks for $34.99). I opted for the chicken fingers and chose the macaroni salad, potato salad, and the coleslaw for my sides (I decided to get an extra side item instead of the 4 drinks). The chicken is supposed to be their showcase item, but it ended up being more of a letdown. The fingers are a good size for what you pay for and they're juicy when you bite into them, but the fingers I got tasted like they had been cooking in old oil (it wasn't that pretty golden-brown color, but more on the darker brown side). The sides were alright. The macaroni salad and potato salad were the better of the sides. Unfortunately, the coleslaw looked like it was put in a blender before serving. It was more on the sweet side and really watery.They didn't deliver on the wow factor, but I'm willing to give Chicken Shack another chance.Went to Chicken Shack last night after reading all the reviews here on Yelp, and having on my "Bookmarks-to try" for the past 2 months. Take Out or Dine In w/ Catering Available.Upon walking in at 8pm, I noticed approximately 75% of the the tables had chairs up, which was a sign of closing. My thought was they are closing early, as the hours posted show 9pm. Fortunately, we were able to dine in as I had zero interest in a takeout order.We were greeted promptly by a friendly cashier named John, who I learned his parents own this franchise.1 of 2 TVs were on, with enjoyable background music. After listening a while, I didn't notice a radio station; yet I heard a variety of artists. I asked if it was Pandora, and was told they use Direct TV and play 80s, 90s, Top Hits, Adult Alternative. All my kinda music, so I was pleased listening while awaiting our order.The wall decor of cartoon like bubbles displaying humorous chicken related quotes were amusing. The license plate theme was unique. The use of a mirror on one entire wall gave the illusion the place was larger than it was. 25 wings (1/2 Habanero Honey & 1/2 Damn Hot), 10 chicken fingers, 2 sodas, large order of shoestring fries, and a few dipping sauces were brought to our table from John within 15 minutes or less, served in to go boxes. Expensive at around $1 wing and $1.23 per chicken finger. Did not appreciate nickel & diming the extra .39 cents for fry sauce, .49 cents for bleu cheese, .49 cents for honey mustard, etc. Usually at these high wing/finger prices, small 1 ounce sauces/containers are complimentary.My son enjoyed his chicken fingers, fry sauce and honey mustard sauce. I enjoyed my breaded chicken wings tossed in the Habanero Honey, but the Damn hot wings were not to my liking as it reminded me too much of Frank's hot sauce. The good news is they offer 20 sauces to choose from. More good news is these breaded wings were cooked to perfection and very large in size.Our shoestring fries were really good!"No Coke! Pepsi!"...SNL circa 1978. My son had Pepsi, despite him preferring Coke. I had a Mountain Dew which I love, and when I returned for Round 2/refill, the machine was out of syrup as it came out mostly watery. Same thing happened w/ the Brisk Iced Tea; so 3rd choice was Orange Crush and was good. Another patron was experiencing the same difficulty, as we stood at the machine together attempting to get our drinks. Perhaps this was part of the closing process is to shut something off in the fountain machine, not sure; but it clearly didn't produce sodas properly. Storing the mop bucket w/ string mop next to the fountain drink machine is unsightly to patrons and really should be placed discreetly in the back.Around 840pm, the background music turned off and the cleaning process began. This was the second clue the employees are ready to go. Reminder, 1st clue was upon entering seeing all the chairs up on tables. Nothing makes me more sick to my stomach than watching a dirty string mop the floors within 15 feet of me, while I am eating. My appetite was lost and my son was filled after 6 wings, so we placed the to go boxes in plastic bags that John kindly offered and left. Personally, I believe cleaning and turning off music, chairs up on tables, etc should all be done AFTER the last patron has left the restaurant. I understand turning off the "Open" window light at the front, possibly locking the door, but not indirectly hinting to the patrons that it's time to leave when it's not even 9pm. It's not like the patron area is the enormous size of a banquet hall requiring hours of cleaning effort. My guess is Chicken Shack front area is around the size of a 2 car garage, requiring no more than 15 minutes if one were to really provide serious effort.Lastly, some of the conversation was regarding Yelp as John saw me taking photos and I told him I was going to do a review on Yelp. I told him it was the wonderful reviews on Yelp that inspired me to take my son here tonight for dinner. He mentioned the owners (his parents) focus mostly on the bad reviews and not so much the good reviews. I tried to inspire him by advising him to look at the bright side, as the bad reviews will help improve the learning process to what patrons experiences are, and the good reviews are certainly noteworthy and overall, outweigh the bad ones. Hopefully the owners also focus praise to their employees regarding the good reviews too. Employee morale is vital to success!So although my son and I shared a 2.5 star experience last night (rounded up to 3 stars), we will most likely return, just much earlier in the evening.
Cafe Rio=The food is great but service is terrible at this location. I accidentally asked for the house dressing instead of the vinaigrette and you would have thought I asked them for the world on a platter. The restaurant was an absolute mess, napkins and food all over the floor, sticky tables and even though I informed someone that the soda fountain was out of syrup, it wasn't attended to the entire time we were there. It's a shame to have such a poor representation of this great chain.
Kinh Do=A trip with family to Vegas means no clubbing or drunken shenanigans. First thing on our to-do list? Look for a Vietnamese restaurant.The Vietnamese-Chinese cuisine sign initially deterred us from Pho Kinh Do but to our pleasant surprise, it turned out to be more authentic and tasty than many Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area. We ordered the family menu which included dishes like Ca Kho To (catfish in claypot), Canh Chua (tamarind soup), Ga Xao Xa Ot (lemongrass chicken) and Thit Kho (saut√©ed pork). My family, including those visiting from Vietnam, agreed the food was flavorful and comparable to a home-cooked meal.www phokindont dot com Pros- #1.Cheap and tasty Chicken Banh Mi. It's all about the delicious bread. I have to give them credit for that.  Cons- #1. Really bad service. The waitress could not understand slow and perfectly spoken English to the point she was rude and short with us. Not cool considering we eat Pho regularly and know how to order right from the menu. Maybe it was my blonde hair and blue eyes or my friend's biceps that caught her off guard. Either way I felt discriminated against. Not a good feeling. #2. The Pho broth- Well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to Pros. The broth tasted dirty and just off which are usually a sign of a dirty kitchen.....#3. The meat in the Pho- Where's the beef? There were 3 pieces of beef. Nuff said. #4. Our order came out REALLY wrong. We both ordered Pho Tai and one of us was the lucky recipient of tripe. Big surprise at this point. Summary- As the great C. Barkley would say," That's turrible" . Since there are so many other Vietnamese restaurants on point in the same vicinity I will not be returning unless I suddenly get a craving for mop water. PHOKING EPIC FAILFriends from out of town were hankering for Vietnamese and we chose this place based on the mostly 4 star reviews and the free egg rolls with the Yelp check in.  It has probably been a good two years since I had pho.  That's weird for me to say or even fathom but hitting up all the places I have bookmarked ain't easy.My wife got the rare beef pho which she said was the best pho she's had in LV.  I didn't even have a shot at trying it since she scarfed it down so quick.  I went out of the box and got the curry pho which was filled with veggies and dark meat chicken on the bone.  I really liked the flavor and you could tell this broth had been simmering for quite some time.    Misti Y's review of Kinh Do was the one that stood out while deciding which pho spot to choose.  Lo and behold..who do we run into there but Misti and Bobby Y!!  I didn't notice her review was 2 years old but we still liked it a lot and definitely plan on getting our next phix of pho here!I was pho-kinh recommended to try this pho-kinh place.I pho-kinh-do love this pho-kinh place.I pho-kinh-do love the pho-kinh sweet spectacular service and attention by the lady boss.I pho-kinh-do love how deserted it was at an early lunch. For once I'm not pho-kinh staring at hordes of zombified-over-pho-kinh-partied-out-Vegas-tourists.I pho-kinh-do love my bowl of pho with its (not so oily) tasty broth, fresh beef, and pho-kinh perfectly done noodles.I pho-kinh-do love how cheap it is (after dropping pho-kinh pretty shillings down in most other Vegas spots or the Cathay dimsum craphole nearby).I will be pho-kinh back and totally pho-kinh recommend this place for those who need to fix a pho-kinh hangover (or a sick tummy like mine).Btw, might as well say that I pho-kinh love that BMW outside tinted so dark (including the windshield) that makes me think two pho-kinh words: "PIMP"+ "PUSHER". X)[PS. Pho is pronounced "Fa/Fuh" not "Fo/Foe"]Pho Bosa was closed (Wednesday) so I ended up here. This is another one of those moments....Thank. You. Yelp. App.The place was easy to find, about a mile up the road from Bosa on Spring Mountain. I walked in and was seated quickly with a fine view of the large TV playing Fox News (?). Tick...tick..tick. No one came to take my order for what felt like 30 minutes, although I'd guess it was more like 10. I finally scooped up an order of rare steak and well done brisket pho along with an iced tea and an order of spring rolls ($12 total). About 5 min later, everything came out. Iced tea was standard. Spring roll was good and the pho....the ____ing pho....was phenomenal. The brisket wasn't fatty, the rare beef didn't taste like concrete and the broth was the best pho broth I've ever had. I was full early on and just kept having one more spoonful...then another...then another...then I was sweating...then I ate more...then there was none left...then I was sad. Compounding the sadness was the fact that no waiter had stopped by for another 10 minutes, so I had to stare into my empty bowl (the alternative of Fox News wasn't any better). I eventually just got up and went to the register. I'm 4-starring this for now, but I have a feeling it will be bumped up to a 5 soon enough. Why? Only the finest in pho will get a 5-star rating from me and I have a lot more searching to do! Also, bleh to the service. Blehh.Note: the check-in offer of two egg rolls is not offered anymore :(EASY 5 star review in my book based on these two things : The Pho Tai & Banh Mi!Pho Tai ($6.95): Rare Sliced Beef Noodle Soup. Awesome! Broth is a little darker and more "meaty" with just the right amount of salt. So much flavor in here...from the first sip, I knew this was my new FAVORITE in Vegas!  Portions are large, lots of meat and goodies hiding inside, and all at a great price!  Can't ask for more!Banh Mi Thit Nuong ($4): Grilled BBQ Pork, Carrots, Mint, etc. Sooo good! Packed with so many goodies in a soft sweet bread, with a little crisp on the outsides. BEST Banh Mi I've had so far!  The difference is in the flavor of the grilled pork, and the amount they give you in the sandwich...Yum :PBanh Mi Bo Kho ($7.95): Beef Stew with French Bread. VERY flavorful broth, fairly spicy, with super tender beef...fall apart actually. Again, the best I've ran into so far, although I don't typically order this dish often, so take that for what it's worth. Can't go wrong here!We got Complimentary Egg Rolls with Yelp check-in! These were pretty tasty, with all the veggies / goodies to wrap them up and eat.  Good, especially considering they were free LOL.I found me a new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas!  Thanks Yelp :PPics :I never wanted to find the best pho in Las Vegas. Well, I would in an ideal world, but after being burned so many times, I just wanted one place that measures up to my Californian standards. I think my quest is finally over after lunch yesterday.All you really need is a hot flavorful broth, lots of delicious meat, reasonable noodles, and some thai basil and lime on the side. The pho dac biet (#5 [EDIT: appetizers are #1-#4] on the menu) came out very quickly after I placed the order (not a busy lunch hour). It satisfied my palate entirely, and it was very filling, about the same as a typical large pho somewhere else (there's only one size here) and very much worth the $7.49.I also ended up with two cha gio (egg rolls) from the free Yelp check-in offer. They were very crunchy and filled with pork, carrots, and mushrooms the way I'm used to having them, which is not the same as your typical Chinese egg roll with lettuce and whatever mush is in the filling. A quick wrap in lettuce and a dunk in nuoc mam was all I needed for a nice appetizer.Pho Kim Long, Lemongrass Cafe, and Da Lat all failed the test, but Kinh Do has passed with flying colors. Other than the Mexican server, they'd fit perfectly in San Jose. Actually, given the demographic trends, I guess they'd still fit.This is our usual Sunday morning stop before leaving Vegas. It is the perfect meal to end an exhausting and fun weekend. The employees will get you seated right away and are very accommodating. The pho bowls are only offered in one size, but it is a generous portion of broth and noodles. In my opinion, the Pho Tai could use a little more meat. All of the flavors are on point. I enjoy that the broth is a little darker and beefier tasting than other places. Note, they no longer offer the free egg rolls with check-in. But they are delicious so I recommend ordering them to share amongst the table. They come in a set of 4 with dipping sauce and lettuce and cucumber to wrap. If you're looking for pho in Vegas, this is where you need to go!Since Ramen Misoya was closed for interior remodeling I stopped in for lunch here. It was before the noon hour on a Thursday so parking was no issue.The older male who I suspect is the owner filled my request to be seated by a power outlet even though it was a table for 8. I started off with some pork springs rolls that were tasty and fresh. I also ordered the regular chicken Pho which was tempurature hot, contained generous amounts of chicken and the broth was delish.Overall a solid luncheon - good food and service, so I'll be back.
Hot Dog Haus=The Skinny: great juicy dogs for $2.99 - the Chicago dog comes complete with the neon green relish, make sure to try the schnitzel minus the bun, skip on the fries (3.5) Service: it's counter service and let's face it, the decor is a little tired (3) Value: the food is pretty good while the prices are reasonable, it's not a bad place to try out(4).Hankering for a good hot dog, we stumbled upon the reviews for Hot Dog Haus. A branch off of Cafe Heidelberg, it's hidden behind a Marie Callender's and can be a little hard to find.We ordered the Chicago dog, the Polish dog and a Euro-schnitzel (veal schnitzel in a kaiser bun) with a side of fries.Hot dog wise, they use the real deal here - Vienna Sausage. The casing's got a nice snap and keeps all the lovely juices inside as you bite in.The Chicago Dog is legit - sporting a poppy seed bun, neon green relish, mustard, fresh tomatoes, onion, pickle and peppers.  Absolutely no ketchup as it ought to be. It was pretty delish.The Polish Dog was loaded with saukeraut and mustard, had a nice flavour to the sausage that was distinctly different from the Vienna Sausage. Saukeraut was the word of the day because it was a little sweeter than your usual variety.French fries were okay while they were hot but got soggy quickly as they cooled down. I probably wouldn't order this again.Curious, we also ordered the standard Euro-schnitzel - a kaiser bun with schnitzel inside ($5.99; $1 extra for the upgrade with mayo, tomato, and lettuce).The schnitzel was absolutely lovely. Crisp, light on the outside, the schnitzel was tender and moist on the inside. The lemon it was served with added just the right amount of acidity. Unfortunately, the Kaiser bun was a different story. Overly dry, its size seemed to overwhelm that wonderful tasty morsel inside. The lack of condiments accentuated the subpar bread. It may be better almost to serve the schnitzel on its own.Given the food, the ambience and the service, I'd probably give this place a good 3.5 stars overall for their great hot dogs and schnitzel. It loses 1.5 stars for the french fries and the bun that schnitzel was served with.
Beckett's Table=Opening night! Loved it. I tried the brussels sprouts and the grits 'n' sausage appetizers, and both were excellent.  I ate the chicken 'n' dumplings main dish, and it was perfect. the vegetables really made the dish - perfectly crisp and fresh. i finished my meal with the pecan and fig pie with "cream cheese and citrus zest" ice cream, and was blown away. the ice cream was fantastic - highlight of the meal for me.i drank a nice glass of arizona wine and a nice ($8) AZ farmhand cocktail, which was a tad bit sweet for my taste, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.service was flawless, prices fair, and environment lovely. can't wait to return to give it a 5th star.Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start??Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what "ricard" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked "the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said "get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in "Six Billion Dollar Man" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially ("no ordinary pasta," said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.I'll be back- thanks BT!The tagline (and shiny new door handles) that say "Come Together" couldn't be more appropriate for Beckett's Table... Last night was only their fourth night open, and I'm giving them a solid four stars.  The Becketts and partners Scott and Katie Stephens did a remarkable job with the renovations of what used to be "That's Italiano."  The environment is extremely comfortable and warm.  The staff was spot-on, starting with the hostesses.  And throughout our meal, Court, our server, made plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions about the menu.  We happened to see a handful of friendly faces and friends dining while we were there as well.   We started off with the mac n cheese with pancetta and the oven roasted organic root vegetables (both a bargain at 5 dollars each).  Next up was the romaine salad and brussel sprouts, which are not to be missed.  The pickled golden beets in the romaine salad were unique and delicious, as were the hot appetizers and sides.  When I couldn't place one of the vegetables, Court was right there with the answer for me: parsnips!We paired our first course with the Pilsbury "One Night Stand" ros√© and liked it so much, we had another round.For our entrees, I had the blood orange glazed salmon and J went with the fork tender short ribs.  Both were large servings, especially the short ribs, and the description for these is perfect; no knife needed.  I actually liked the short ribs so much, that i ate more of that than I did the salmon, which had a bit too much orange glaze for me.  As if that weren't enough food, we finished up with an order of the fig & pecan pie...it is served with a cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream, the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  The only suggestion that Jared had for this course, was to also offer a Root Beer Float.  Perhaps we'll see that on the menu in the future?!One funny thing about the evening was that they were out of the "pat√© all the time," which was ok, as we can try it next time!  We will definitely be back to Beckett's Table soon - I see it being a regular in our rotation of neighborhood spots for sure!I loved the simplicity of my first dining experience at Beckett's Table. What looked like copper pipe cut for the napkin rings, small vases with a sprig of mint on each table... definitely no unnecessary frills here! Luckily the surroundings are simplistic because when the dishes are served - look out! Magic, spice and everything nice begins.We ordered almost everything on the menu (or so it seemed).So when it comes to starting off the meal, I highly recommend sharing the grilled cheese with pancetta & roasted red pepper tomato soup AND the vegetable chop salad with pumpkin seed brittle and a champagne vinaigrette. Although I won't lie - the creamy grits & spicy andouille sausage and mustard came in as a close second. The server mentioned there were three (count them....3!) different types of sausages in the dish. Fantastic and very unique.Onto the entrees! We tried four but of the ones we picked it was a close tie between the short ribs and the pork osso buco confit. The pork was interesting because it was served with a butternut squash spaetzle, roasted veggies and a black pepper reduction. Quite the combo!Looking for some serious winter-ish food?? Don't pass up the chicken n dumplings...just like mom used to make (shhh....only waaaaay better!)I almost forgot about the cocktails! They run a little on the sweet side so I'd recommend a cocktail to start but then stick with wine. We tried almost all of the cocktails but my fave was Miss Katie's Pimms Cup!Lastly, let's talk about dessert.While the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter and graham cracker was a novel idea - DO NOT PASS UP THE FIG & PECAN PIE. The fig is mashed into the most amazing crust (and I hate pie crust normally) and served with this cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream that was TO DIE FOR.The service was fantastic. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were larger than I'd expect for the price. Truly a wonderful addition to Arcadia.Lets start with the drinks, shall we. After all, it was "miss katie's pimms cup" that lured me here, being vegan, food choice has become an after thought. My drink, miss katie's pimms cup (pimm's #1, ketel one vodka, muddled cucumber, ginger and sprite) was amazing. So refreshing, not too sweet, subtlety of cucumber and ginger, I could have drank these all night and it would have been worthy of 5 stars, but a girls gotta eat!After I read the menu, and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen, I actually felt guilty for being Vegan. I too wanted to enjoy one of those mouthwatering meals. However, Chef Justin had no qualms about catering to my needs. I was informed he was preparing something special for me. I do Love surprises. It was quite a treat to have something so artfully presented to me. (see pics) Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious! It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of. It really says a lot about Chef Justins level of customer care that he went out of his way to prepare me something that was not just a bunch of sides thrown together on a plate. It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors. It was my pleasure to meet Chef Justin last night  and I can't thank him enough. My husband had the Short Ribs (see pics), which he'll attest, were amazing, as well as the Fig and Pecan Pie (darn, no pic) that blew him away. All put together with stellar service form Cort our server, it was a Wonderful evening that we will look forward to enjoying again and again.P.S.I hear they will be adding  daily Vegan/Vegetarian/GF options to their menu by the new year. I cannot wait!Probably the best salmon I've had in long time. It was cooked perfectly and the blood orange glaze, while a little bit of a sweet shock to my palate initially, really balanced with the accompaniments. It was good that our server advised me that the couscous would be cold -- I would have expected hot, especially on a winter menu but: (a) this IS Arizona, not the northeast and (b) with its refreshing mint accent, it was the perfect accessory to the salmon. The last thing I ate on my plate was the shaved veggie salad. It was such a great end to the meal. Really pleasant and crisp with the occasional treat of a yellow beet. I even shared a slice of beet with my friend, explaining: it IS possible to like beets if they are handled well. In this case, they were definitely handled well! A huge fan of Sam Pilsbury to begin with, I think this meal was made for his One Night Stand Rose. A match made in heaven!! On another visit I tried the pecan fig pie and really enjoyed it. The cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream was novel for me and really complimented the pie. The crust was also excellent. Last night, we had the creme brulee with shortbread cookies and it was a bit of a disappointment for me. While my dinning companion LOVED it, I found it a tad on the runny side and the shortbread crumbly. Flavors were fine but would probably try a different dessert on another visit. Beckett's Table is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene!Great meal there Saturday nite!  Our Waitress Allison was friendly, knowledgable and excellent at her job!The environment was fun, nicely designed and comfortable.  The wine list was complete with many offerings and I liked how Allison had both myself and my hubby taste it before pouring it!There were so many delicious sounding choice that it was difficult to choose...but we ordered the Shep's Pie and the Pork Confiet....both were fabulous, filling and unique!We saved room for dessert and we loved the bread pudding and pecan fig pie...the coffee rocked as well!Make sure you have a reservation the place was packed...and deserves to be!Absolutely Amazing!From start to finish, I was completely blown away by Beckett's Table.Beckett's Table is a type of restaurant I would expect to find in Beverly Hills or Hollywood, not in the desert city of Phoenix. BT has only been open a month but the owners have done an amazing job making sure this establishment runs like a well oiled machine that has no chinks in its chains. In fact, there is no way I would have known that BT has only been open a month if I was not told by our waiter. The inside of BT is dimly lit and has modern and rustic d√©cor. Even though the place was extremely busy, my fianc√© and I were able to grab two seats at one of their communal tables near the bar area. Right when we were seated we received complimentary warm wheat and white rolls with super creamy butter. These rolls were fantastic, especially the wheat ones which were really soft and sweet.BT's menu is made up of classic comfort foods with a twist. My fianc√© and I started the evening by ordering three appetizers. These are the apps we ordered:Creamy Grits with Spicy Andouille Sausage in a Mustard Au JusBeckett's Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Four Cheeses, Pancetta and Roasted Red Pepper Tomato SoupBacon Cheddar Biscuits with Apple Honey ButterAll three of these apps were delicious. The creamy grits were indeed creamy and contained lots of juicy, semi spicy sausage, tomatoes and grilled onions. The mustard au jus that was on the grits was also extremely flavorful. The little grilled cheese Sammie's were super cheesy and also somewhat salty because of the pancetta. The roasted red pepper soup was also really tasty. The bacon cheddar biscuits were warm, fluffy and had a nice bacon-y flavor. For dinner I ordered their chicken and dumplings entr√©e while my fianc√© ordered the fork tender short rib. The chicken and dumplings was served in a big bowl and contained juicy pieces of chicken, soft and squishy dumplings, peas, carrots, celery and an extremely flavorful herb saffron cream sauce. This dish brought back so many memories because as a child my dad used to make chicken and dumplings at least once a month. After him and my mom divorced when I was about 12 or 13, for some reason he never made them again. BT's chicken and dumplings was just as wonderful as the ones I ate as a child. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The name of my fianc√©s dish perfectly described it. The fork tender short rib really was fork tender. It was also huge and incredibly tasty. The big short rib was placed on a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes, green beans and a wonderful red wine herb reduction sauce. For dessert I got a slice of their fig and pecan pie with a scoop of citrus zest ice cream and my fianc√© got their bacon s'mores plate. My fig pecan pie, which won a Phoenix pie contest not long ago, was amazing. It tasted so much different than a normal pecan pie. The figs gave it such a different flavor and texture. The citrus zest ice cream was also unique and tasted wonderful. My fianc√©s bacon s'mores dessert was phenomenal. Forget the s'mores you make while camping, BT's s'mores blow those boring things out of the water. BT's s'mores plate comes with graham crackers, toasted homemade marshmallows, chocolate covered bacon and homemade creamy peanut butter that has caramel sauce drizzled on top of it.  All of these components come on a plate and it is up to you to put it all together in s'more form. It's funny because Scott Stephens (one of the owners) personally came over to us and said that my fianc√© was the first person he had seen actually take the time and build a s'mores sandwich instead of just eating all the elements with a fork. BT's s'mores are by far the best s'mores I have ever had. They were sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time. The service at BT was fantastic. Our server Josh was incredible. He was super friendly, funny and attentive. He talked to us about their menu, gave us suggestions on what to try and what his favorite dishes were and even joked around with us every time he checked up on us. Actually, everyone at BT was extremely friendly and they all seemed to enjoy working at BT. The prices here were great too. Our entire bill was less than $80 dollars, which I thought was great considering all the food we ordered. If you're ever in Phoenix then I highly recommend you pay a visit to Beckett's Table. This place is absolutely amazing and I look forward to the day I return to Phoenix so I can eat at BT again.Word on the street from the locals is that this new spot is the talk of the town, so I felt very lucky that I got to go here for a work dinner last night. We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about. The cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice). We got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either. For my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies. The desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite. I'm no expert in Scottsdale culture, but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh, classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers!Now that I've recovered from my food coma, I can happily report on my pleasant experience at Beckett's Table. As our large group walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back. I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening, the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture. Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia, you would never know once you get situated inside. We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire. Tasty!! It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it. So now moving on to the food. Order everything on the menu, or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious. The enchiladas have a zing to them, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness, the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more. Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone, I moved to the entree. Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option, I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go. Yes, it was worth every bite and more. The shorts ribs were so tender, the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment. To end the meal marathon, the group tasted all the desserts on the menu. Yes all of them. Each one was good in its own way, but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake. What can I say, I'm a chocoholic. In summary, this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group. You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere.Let me also might add...they are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.I went to Beckett's Table on a Wednesday night with the fabulous Aileen B. I was dying to try this place because she made my mouth water after reading her review. The pictures that on on yelp do not do this place justice. It is alot bigger than it appears and it is wide open. They are also already expanding the patio after only being open for a few months. We started off with some drinks, I had the classic painkiller which reminds me of a pina colada and you do feel like you are on a beach somewhere sipping on a cool refreshing drink. Aileen had a glass of white wine which for the life of me, I cannot remember but she did enjoy it and that is all that counts. We ordered some mac and cheese and roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer. OMG! People always seem to not enjoy the yummy goodness of brussel sprouts and believe me, this brussel sprouts were extra yummy. They were roasted to perfection and had shaved manchego cheese, pancetta, and had the sweet taste from the yummy lemon thyme vinaigrette. I am still drooling over those brussel sprouts as they really were that good. The mac and cheese was also divine. It was the creamy white mac and cheese with little bits of pancetta sprinkled very lightly over it. Between the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and the warm house bread with the honey butter, who needs a main course? ME! duh. So for the main course, I decided to order pork osso bucco. I was so excited about it because I had read how great it was in Aileen's review and I just had to try it. Well, unfortunately it was not all that great. The osso bucco was a little dry to me and I found that I am not a fan of spatezle as it had no flavor to me at all. I literally was moving my food around my plate like kid to make it seem like I was eating it. Aileen ordered wood fire mussels and she said they were good but needed a little bit more salt. I am not one to return my dish if I am not happy, but when our lovely waitress Rebecca came over to ask how the meal was, Aileen (bless her heart) let her know that I was not enjoying it. Rebecca asked if she could get me something else, but since I had my heart set on this dish, I politely declined. Well, to our surprise, Rebecca came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were not only comping the dish, but they were giving us the death by chocolate dessert as a treat. WOW! I was floored. That was very generous of them. The dessert was fabulous. Warm chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and a oreo cookie that was dipped in white chocolate. Yum. The drinks were delightful, the brussel sprouts were heavenly, the mac and cheese was creamy, the dessert was sinful, and my company was fabulous! Even though I did not like my main course, I will definitely be back to try something else as the service was great and they went above and beyond. Extra, extra special thanks to Aileen for inviting me and to my surprise treating me to dinner for my birthday.Comfort. Let me spell it out for ya Mary. Cool!Oh sooo goodModern. Urban. CozyFabulous. Fabulous staff. Fabulous clientele. Fabulous room.Oh sooo good.Relaxed. Yet energetic. Vibrant. T. Hmmm. T...Totally will visit again!The seared tuna app was outstanding with a crusty, herbed seared edge. My chicken and dumplings was okay...we were seated around nine and kitchen closes at ten. Dumplings were a little, well, stiff. Much like my rigid right wing cousin. I was missing Bisquick lol. Beef bourgoninase was outstanding. And the "smore" dessert was more miss than hit for me. VERY difficult to eat. Perhaps it was the bottle of wine that made it difficult to navigate the deconstructed dessert...or the intense light from the fullest moon EVAH!Great time. Good food. Great service. Good God. I will. Be. Back.Well once again I'm the last one to the party. Beckett's Table has been buzzing away since opening in the old That's Italiano space late last year. I've tried so many times to get in but for whatever reason or another didn't make it. Well finally made it in and I have to say, I wish I hadn't been so damn fashionably late. A couple of notable thing, the space is killer, rustic-industrial and second, the waiters are hot, especially our beefy ginger waiter Scott, Sam, hmm, maybe Bill? Anyway I can't remember his name but what I do remember was his attention to detail and service. Looking around you can see that all the servers were attentive and helpful to all their guests. I'm just a sucker for a beard, I mean great service. In case you're wondering who Beckett is, the name refers to local Chef Justin Beckett. The man has got some chops and has nothing to hide in his open kitchen. I love open kitchens, I think its an honest way of sharing how clean and organized a well lubed kitchen works, in other words the orders slid in and out with total ease. The menu is made up mainly of meat + starch with a few flare items that while are mostly comforting, shows the levels of sophistication, especially for a neighborhood kind of restaurant. At first glance the Country Pat√© ($12) seemed to be overwhelmed with way to many accompaniments. I'm a mustard and bread only kind of guy, but after trying each delicate bite with a different topping it all made sense. Each component is representative of a different tasting experience. Vinegary whole grain mustard is completely different than sun dried tomato making for an interesting and interactive experience. Another surprise appetizer was the Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage Trio ($9). I generally avoid grits simply because I've never really had them made well, though Beckett's version is as advertised, creamy and delicious. You can never go wrong with Schreiner's sausages, simply the best as far as I'm concerned. The only real let down was the Grilled Cheese ($9) served with bacon, four cheeses and roasted red pepper tomato soup. Every component was good except that main one, the bread, which was dry and not very tasty which made the entire dish unravel. Entrees were meat-centric starting with the oh-so-tender Osso Buco ($18). A pork shank braised in its own fat was melting tender, served atop butternut spaetzle and pepper reduction. The braising continues with fork tender Short Ribs ($19) that were big and beefier in flavor thanks to a red wine and herb reduction.What's a great way to round of such a rich meal? How about a slab of Fig and Pecan Pie ($6)? The sweetness really cuts through the richness from so many savory items. If you're still in the mood for unique, try the hands on Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores ($6). Yes, you read it right, slices of thick cut bacon that have been enrobed in chocolate. Once over the novelty, you realize that it's far too messy to finish.I think the party at Beckett's is only getting started.It's restaurant week, and I finally had the opportunity to try Beckett's Table. Having read so many good reviews, I decided to book a reservation here to take my mom out.I carefully inspected their prefixed menu, and was elated to see that they offered a vegetarian option.For our main course, my mom tried the chicken meatballs which, unfortunately, was not a fan because of the onions and peppery taste. (I guess she didn't look at the menu)I ordered the vegetable salad with champagne  vinaigrette, which was fine.For the main course, mom got the meat loaf, and I ordered the vegetarian mushroom lasagna (their vegetarian option).My mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted.My lasagna was decent, but I wish the vegetarian option wasn't a pasta dish.   I've been eating pasta this whole week, so I was sort of  sick of it.  A Total overload!Now as far as the service goes, it was great. Our server Michael did a great job explaining the menu, and the waiter's assistant kept our beverage full.My only fret is where they sat us. They gave us a table smack in the center of the restaurant, so regrettably, I could not provide pictures. Next time I'm going to ask for  patio seating now that the weather is getting cooler.I'm a fan - though avoid the deep fried deviled eggs that they offer every table. They were not at all what I expected (and I happen to love deviled eggs). The rest of our experience from the butter salad to her chicken with stuffing and my pork chop and baked beans were decadent. The coconut cake desert was one of the best moments of my life. Beckett's is an upscale experience at mid-range prices.Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype. That's when a restaurant throws in a communal table, brings back old school classics like deviled eggs as an appetizer, and/or covers bacon in chocolate on their dessert menu. Beckett's Table does all three, so people are obviously going to lose their shit over it. Let me break it down for you. Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:The wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)The Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment. The Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a brussels sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.That's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. Even my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service. The waiter was fantastic. Spot on.You know, it may be complicated to give me a real life orgasm, but it ain't that hard to give me a food-gasm. Now that's just a fact.
Hayashi Hibachi=Holy cow... we had the worst experience here! The one up in Surprise was a million times better!First of all, we walked in with a party of four on a Friday night and they looked at us like we were crazy. The lovely gal up front asked if we had a reservation, and of course we did not. They weren't very busy at all for a Friday night, but she acted as if they were completely swamped. She informed us that it would be a 20 minute wait like it was the end of the world, but of course to us that seemed very reasonable. I guess we're just used to going to busier restaurants on the weekends?Anyway, the wait actually took over 45 minutes--definitely more than double her initial guess. Whatever, we were able to grab a few drinks before happy hour was over so we were happy. The bar was actually the busiest part of the restaurant, and their service was fast and friendly. However, the rest of the place definitely took away from our positive initial experience there.We were finally seated in the normal dining area and had the slowest, most forgetful waiter ever. I also noticed that the Hibachi area of the restaurant had barely anyone in it, so maybe that's why it took so long to get in. Everyone was trying to get into the smaller, normal restaurant section! :P We just wanted a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night, but unfortunately our experience wasn't so great.We all asked for waters, and the waiter brought one. Gee, thanks. Communal water? LOL. He also kept forgetting things we'd ask for, so we actually had to ask other waiters/waitresses on THREE separate occasions for things that our waiter didn't bring. We would've reminded him, but he seemed to disappear for long periods of time after forgetting things. He also seemed to know whenever we were complaining about him, because he would show up immediately after. 6th sense for unhappy customers? :)Now, for the food... I had seafood kabobs, and they were okay. However, two of us had scallops in our meals and they were not cooked correctly. I know it's hard to cook them correctly, but these were just bad. The rest wasn't bad, but nothing great either... especially for the price.Oh, I think the biggest part that bothered me was the location of the restrooms. It was right next to the kitchen, so it was constantly busy with waiter traffic. This is fine, but the attitude of said traffic was what bothered me. The first time, three waiters almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom. They just looked at me as if I was in the wrong place, and of course I said "excuse me." They didn't say anything... just looked at me and went around. On my second trip to the restroom, three waiters/waitresses were standing in the hallway just talking to one another, blocking the entire walkway. I walked up and stood there, finally saying "Excuse me, I have to get to the restroom." One girl moved to the side a little bit, but the guy standing in the middle had his arms crossed with his elbows sticking way out and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to maneuver around his impertinent elbows in order to fit through the tiny gap the one kind waitress had made for me. Basically, I was thinking "WTF?!"When we were done eating, after we had paid the bill, we then realized that we had been there for over 3.5 hours. Ridiculous! The service was extremely slow and mostly unfriendly, the food wasn't good for the price we paid, and we just ended up being pissed off in general after leaving. This was our first trip to this Hayashi, but we wanted to try it out after having so many fantastic experience up at the Surprise location. I guess the name is the only thing these 2 locations have in common.
Poppy's Bagels & More=Great bagels, I can see Poppy's being my go to for bagels. Comfy little spot to hang out, outdoor seating & friendly staff. Everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and a cup of joe.  Just talking about it makes me want another one, good thing Julia S. gave me some of her bagels to go.  'I'll be back' in my best Arnold impression.Wandering around Harris Teeter Morrocroft (Taj)  this morning, decided to pick up some smoked salmon with all the fixins'.  Did not want to drive to Poppy's for a bagel, so I decided to just break down and buy a couple from Harris Teeter. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Bright light shining, angels singing.  POPPY'S bagels are in the bin at Harris Teeter!!
Seasons 52=Thank you, Seasons 52, for having me in for a special preview lunch last weekend... it was such a treat!I'd been to the Seasons 52 in Atlanta and had a great experience, so when I heard the news that they were opening a Biltmore location, I was really excited!  During my recent visit, I took a tour of the gorgeous new restaurant, which reminds me a lot of their Atlanta location.  It offers private dining rooms and even a room with A/V for business meetings... I also met some of the key partners of this Darden concept.  I actually sat next to Stephen Judge, their President, and learned a ton about the (100 wine selections / 65 available by the glass) on the menu from George Miliotes, Master Sommelier.  My favorite wine, from the eight I sampled, was the Aveleda Vinho Verde, Portugal 2009.  And as for the food, I didn't have anything I didn't like... it was all pretty spectacular.  Standouts were the Organic Green Salad with Oak-Grilled Mushrooms, Toasted Pistachios and Truffle Dressing (which I must mention arrives with a very unique presentation), and the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but theirs was perfectly paired with mashed sweet potatoes... mmmm!As for dessert, Seasons 52 supposedly originated the "mini indulgence," which is a small portion (shot glass size) of "the real thing," dessert... in all of its decadence!  I sampled the Old Fashioned Carrot Cake and the fresh fruit, which were both delicious!  The other ones looked amazing too, but I couldn't justify eating anymore in one sitting.  I did see the custom "Mini Indulgence Cake," which features 18 of these mini desserts; perfect for a celebration!As Sarah S mentioned in her review, everything on the menu at Seasons 52 is under 475 calories, so you can dine guilt free...**Fun fact: You can find out which "Mini Indulgence" matches your personality on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/seasons52?v=app_125847674120672(I was fresh fruit the first time and key lime pie the second time!)****Seasons 52 will be open to the public on 10/25, and I look forward to returning again real soon!I need to preface this by saying that this review was taken from 3 to 4 stars by way of dessert, but I'll get into that later.  I was invited to check out Seasons 52 last Thursday evening with a friend that I haven't seen in way too long and after checking out the menu online, it was a date! Seriously, google it, if your mouth doesn't water your a corpse.Everyone's really excited about the 'everything under 475 calories' thing and I get it...I suppose that is a pretty statement move on Seasons part. I will say that everything we had also tasted like it had less than 475 calories, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, I wouldn't come to Seasons for a steak if you know what I'm saying.....(i.e. filet mignon deserves a butter bath in my humble opinion) That said, I decided on the Caramelized  Sea Scallops with asparagus and sundried tomato pearl pasta (errrrr, Israeli Couscous) and my dining companion decided on.......wait for it........The Mesquite-Grilled Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables and roasted mushrooms! Yep! I did actually get to try it and like I said, I wouldn't come here for a steak. I, however, am the snobbiest of steak snobs so take that for what it's worth. It also didn't look like a Filet to me, more of a well pounded out top sirloin. I'm not claiming any deception, it just looked odd. My scallops were quite tasty and even though I missed the flavor that butter searing produces I would definitely order them again. The asparagus and pasta were good though surely difficult to really 'mess up'. The wine list was decent and I'm impressed that Seasons offers alternative menus for those that are vegetarian/vegan or have certain allergies or intolerance. This is when secksi time comes into play and the reason for the fourth star. DESSERT!Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse and Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust. Holy mother these little guys were divine. Served in what appear to be shot glasses, this was the perfect amount of sweet and delicious for two people that just consumed probably the healthiest thing they've eaten all week. Very rich and heavy, clearly hitting the 'under 475 calorie' mark by size alone. The restaurant itself has a pretty standard chain look/feel to it, reminiscent of a slightly upscale Cheesecake Factory. The service was great. Our server, Samantha was adorable and bubbly and was armed with enough familiarity of the menu to answer our questions knowledgeably. All in all a good experience. I'd go back for a dessert and wine happy hour (or four) in a second.i don't get it.our service was no bueno. our waiter rarely came around and kept forgetting things. also, they tried dusting our booth in the middle of our meal. i thought that was extremely tacky, it wasn't even close to closing or anything. they just felt like dusting over our dinner? they claim to be super healthy and fresh, but start to ask questions about the ingredients and freshness and you'll find out everything is rubbed in sugar and everything is frozen or pre-made. i went with the pork with haricot verts. i ordered it medium but it was well done and very dry. he sat my plate down and immediately said 'they over cooked it, would you like me to take it back?' 1. why would he bring it out if it was wrong?2. obviously, he didn't want to fix it or he wouldn't have even brought it to me....so i didn't send it back and i just added some salt to help it out. and i didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.so the price, combined with the food, and the bad service- i won't be going back.Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...Wow, came here again with a friend for lunch on Friday.Excellent service as always!! Lou was our waiter, he was very helpful in all depts.My friend Kris is very particular about what she eats, so this is a great place for her. They explain everything and can answer every question.Everything on the menu is low calorie. I got the mushrooms stuffed with shrimp and she got the Ahi tuna salad. Both were awesome.We also got the artichoke Pizza that was fantastic. They refill your drinks continuously and even their water is filtered. You can drink glasses of it without feeling you just poisoned yourself.The decor is dark wood and I think it is beautiful. They have an awesome little fire place in the front that I just love looking at.Restrooms are nice and clean, but the water never really got too warm to wash your hands.Lots of Parking, located in the Biltmore shopping Center/Also my friend got one of the desserts and she did not like it at all, she thought it was far too sweet, she said she could taste artificial sweetener in it.Lou was kind enough to take it off the bill.Awesome place and very healthy!This place is pretty damned good and I'm disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. I didn't understand the concept of fresh, healthy upscale eating so I was surprised that everything was so delicious while minimally impacting my ever-expanding waistline. It just goes to show you that in this world of poisonous, processed foods it is still possible to enjoy your food and be healthy so well done to these guys.I started off with a beer in the bar and started with the Blackened Steak and Bleu Cheese flatbread. The bread was thin and crispy and topped with two of my favorite things. Really delicious.For my main I had the grilled scallops with asparagus and tomato mushroom pearl pasta. The scallops were AMAZING and so tasty without being bathed in butter. My plate was served up so beautifully arrange with the asparagus spears arranged in a grid over the pasta, it was almost a shame to eat it...almost.Healthy then went out the window when we went through more than one of their Mini-Indulgence desserts. I had the key lime but my favorite was the raspberry with chocolate chip cannoli. Still fewer calories than a slice of cheesecake.The atmosphere is very nice, the service is great and like I said, you really can enjoy some delicious food with out so much butter, fat and additives.A good solid choice for a nice dinner or lunch.A friend of mine was in town and asked me to find a central meeting place for dinner. I got online to see what was good around the Biltmore area and found Seasons 52. Seasons 52 has a pretty user friendly website and it was easier to just type in reservations than to call directly. As it got closer to the reservation time, I called just to make sure they received the reservation and that everything was set. The phone was answered on the first ring and the woman quickly and very politely confirmed everything was in order.I arrived early and the hostess said it was fine to wait at the bar. After I sat down, I realized how gorgeous the bar was and in fact, the restaurant was huge and very well appointed. (see pics)The bartender introduced himself (Aaron) and was extremely friendly and efficient. When my friend arrived, we decided to just stay at the bar for dinner. The menu promised rustic cooking techniques like brick oven roasting & open-fire grilling that brings out natural flavors. The menu includes:FlatbreadsSalads/SoupsAppetizers:Shrimp Scampi (which I had)Asian glazed grilled chicken skewersLobster RavioliHummus Duo with Crisp Hawaiian Sea Salt LavoshBlistered shishito peppersLump Crab/Roasted Shrimp Stuffed MushroomsDuck Wing Lollipops (which I had)Ahi Tuna Tartare Caramelized Grilled Sea Scallops (which I had) Entr√©es:Entr√©e SaladsFish & SeafoodPoultry & MeatChef's SelectionsDesserts:Ganache BrownieCarrot Cake with Cinnamon HoneyChocolate Peanut Butter TortePies:PumpkinKey LimePecanBelgian Chocolate S'moresRaspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli (which I had - see pics)The wine list is bananas awesome!Whites:Chardonnay Pinot GrigioPinot Gris Pinot BlancSauvignon BlancRiesling Viognier Unoaked WhitesWhite Zinfandel Sparking DessertsReds:MerlotPinot NoirPetite SirahShivazGrenacheMonastrellZinfandel Tempranillo Sangiovese Cabernets & BordeauxPortFull bar for cocktails.

La Gourmandine Bakery & Pastry Shop=As a smart man once said: "Once it hits your lips it tastes so good!"That sums up everything about La Gourmandine Bakery!  The delicacies in the case looked scrumptious, it's hard to choose one... so I choose two!  I bought the D√©lice de Pistache and Paris-Brest.  The D√©lice de Pistache is Choux dough covered with pistachio mousseline and topped with dark chocolate.  I had planned on only taking a bite.  That did not happen.  In fact, as soon as I took the first bite I was floating away towards the pearly gates of heaven!  It was just divine!  The Choux dough was light and almond tasting, the pistachio mousseline was fluffy and distinctly tasted of pistachio (I hate when fillings don't taste like what they should) and the chocolate just topped off my dessert decent!  The Paris-Brest is Choux dough filled with hazelnut cream.  It actually looks almost like a doughnut.  It was the same heavenly taste!  They're actually very similar but different shapes.  The hazlenut again was distinct and the Choux dough was light with a slight crisp to it.  I would say my fave had to be the D√©lice de Pistache though.  But both were fantasmic!I also grabbd a sandwich, which was very good as well... But I didn't want to mention that first because I was too excited about th desserts!  I had the Le Campagnard, which is a French baguette with mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese.  The baguette was incredible, and I don't normally even like them.  Too hard to chew.  Even though it was a baguette, you could tell it was freshly baked that day, so it didn't have that stale taste a baguette from say, Panera, would have.  I'm glad they offer lunch, because it's a chance to grab a quick sammich and bring home dessert for later... or stuff your face with it then!Oh my! This place is great!My girls and I went on a sunny Saturday morning this past Summer. Surprisingly the line wasn't out the door. We were all overwhelmed by the variety of choices from such a small space. The pastries are out of this world! The Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine (Flaky pastry with chocolate barres.) is without a doubt my favorite pastry that they offer. They also offer danishes, croissants, individual little pastries, cakes, tarts and so much more. Everything I tried was delicious. They also offer coffee that goes perfect with the pastries they offer. The space is small with only a few tables to sit at so I would suggest getting your stuff to go. Their sandwiches are also delicious. The fresh French baguette really makes the sandwich. The Le Parisien (French baguette with butter, ham, and Swiss cheese) was my favorite.The people seem happy working there, are patient while waiting for you to make your choices and greet you with a smile. If you are ever in the area, THIS PLACE IS A MUST STOP!Love love love this small place. My boyfriend's parents live down the street and whenever we're over this area to visit, I always asked to make a stop here FIRST :) everything here is so pretty to look at it and most importantly, so so yummy! I can never remember the names of what I got because I always choose what I want on how it looks.. so the name is just a blur to me, especially with sweet pastries (ugh, so bad I know) Parking on butler can be a pain sometimes because of how busy this road can get but I never seem to have a problem with it. So it might just depends on the time you come in. Other than that I'm definitely coming back to try some of their sandwiches because I've heard great things on it tooListen: I'm just going to cut to the chase. If heaven had a bakery, I'm pretty confident it would be La Gourmandine.I've been dying to come here for ages now, and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. When I walked in, I was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly. It felt just the way a bakery should feel: quaint, homey, and it smelled wonderful.I was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, "Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!" I pretty much so wanted to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot, but instead replied, "Yeah, I'll take one of those, too."I left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because I obviously couldn't decide on just two. I apologize to my already non-existent waistline. I was trying to get things for my better half and I to enjoy together this weekend, but he's still at work and I can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.As I was checking out, my new BFF said, "Oh, you should come back here earlier in the day, we have twice the selection!" I'm literally glad I didn't come earlier in the day, or I probably would have left with 10 pastries. But tomorrow morning? Well, maybe I'll go back tomorrow morning.La Gourmandine has been on my Pittsburgh bucket list for a long time.  I came in with the fabulous Sophia H., and we got to ordering.  I picked up a Chocolat Fondat and the Opera Cake (Hellooooo.  Opera singer, Opera cake.  Duh.).  The pastries totaled $7.05, which was steep for the size.The Chocolat Fondat was described as a lava cake.  The chocolate flavor was very rich.  It was a fairly dark chocolate, which appealed to me.  The opera cake was this tiny slice of joy.  Dark chocolate and espresso and cake layers.  A flawless combination.  However, it was truly tiny, and was about 4 small bites total.The only side note is that my pastries became dry very quickly.  24 hours later they were already starting to go stale, which was a bit quick for freshly baked.  Baked goods from Prantl's last me for days with no issues.  This actually might stop me from returning because I do not eats sweets crazy quickly.  These baked goods will not stay good for more than 24 hours.If you have extra cash to drop, La Gourmandine has very high quality baked goods.  The credit card machine was down when I visited, but they normally take cards.While checking out the area for an upcoming event I stumbled upon the first location of La Gourmandine. I had no trouble parking and was pleasantly surprised to find it open on a Sunday morning.I went in and like its sister shop over in Mt Lebanon, the layout is virtually the same. They are noted for their flaky almond pastries which I have had before. That alone is my number one recommendation! However, since I have had it twice I decided to try something different. So I asked the lady about some of the new items they had. One was called Clafoutis which is made out of bread pudding and stuffed with cherries. The other was lime Bavarian cream with raspberry. I ordered both since they told me I could store the Clafoutis in my refrigerator for one day.They served my lime Bavarian cream on an actual plate with a fork. They also have a few tables where you can sit and eat. Again, they offer sandwiches as well as coffee or tea. You can also order cakes or pastries in advance. The staff was very helpful and explained everything to me.That new lime Bavarian cream was delicious and not overly filling which was perfect for me!  I plan on eating the Clafoutis later but I'm sure since they recommended it to me, I know I won't be disappointed. When I had finished eating my dessert I placed it to the left of the cash register which I was told was fine so they could take it away.This place is easy to miss while you are driving down Butler St but again the place fills up very quickly since it is a popular place for sandwiches and French pastries.I did ask if they were planning to add any other locations at the moment and was told they aren't. Either way if you visit this location or the one in Mt. Lebanon you will get exceptional service and some of the best Parisian desserts you can imagine.
Brosenbrus Cafe=12/22/10Nice space, but a bit too "cool."  That is, I don't find the atmosphere here beckoning me to stay awhile.  More of the "order something, or get out."  I don't mean to say this attitude is coming from the people there.  No- it's the vibe that I get from the furniture, from the brightness of the room, and from the music played at too loud a volume level.  I really like coffee shops that play music at a softer volume so that I may hear conversations I'm having w/ friends, or be able to read w/out having to work to tune out the noise.  (I tried using my iPod here once, but I couldn't stand the high volume level necessary to block out the shop's own music!)Read much about how great the food here, but since everything seems pre-packaged and processed (meats, cheese, sauces), and I couldn't get the rep to tell me which local bakery supplied the breads, I can only order the black tea (the green tea is tropical-flavored, meaning it's off-limits to me).  I did try the iced mocha latte, minus the "white chocolate powder mix" it is normally made w/, but the beverage tasted like it was missing something to round out the flavor and texture.  Yes, I know that's where the white chocolate mix comes in, but I can't have it, so I wonder what ingredient Brosenbrus could add next time to give the drink more creaminess, more oomph?  The shop also offers soy milk, but I'm trying to stay away from the preservatives that are also present in the liquid...Free wi-fi-- I like to come here when I have extra time before my massage at nearby SWIHA.If you're a college student and looking for a good spot to study, this is it. First of all, it's located on the bottom floor of college housing. Secondly, it's located right by camps. Thirdly, they have great Cartel coffee and what appeared to be tasty food (even though I didn't get a chance to try any of it). This isn't a spot I would probably seek out as a working professional to come and work out of but that's mostly because working here reminds me that my fun days of college living are long over and it's obvious that the students around me don't realize that one day it will also be over for them! The staff here is chill and friendly. The seating isn't super comfortable, but the tables have room to layout your work and the chairs are deep enough that you can slouch a little bit (shh, don't tell my Mom that sometimes I slouch!)It's not too crazy here and I was able to get my work done and have a comfortable conversation with my meetings. So college students or Tempe residents, this is a spot to think about!
Vida Mexican Kitchen y Cantina=To mix cultures, a Mexican Haiku:Carnitas tacos.Tableside guacamole.¬°Vida Cantina!We stopped into Vida during their grand opening weekend, deciding that 5pm would be a reasonable time to try and catch a table without a reservation.  We were almost turned away.  The patio was packed.  The inside was empty, but about to fill up.  Consider yourself warned.If you go, you absolutely must try the tableside guacamole.  It is made to order  from three avocados (six halves), cilantro, onions, tomatoes (and who knows what else) in a giant stone mortar and pestle, which stays on the table.  You unfortunately do not get to keep it.  That would be amazing.This thing is as large as my head and I have a big head.  If you're there with one other person, you should try this before ordering dinner.  It might fill you up all by itself (and it doesn't really keep for the next day).  If you have a large group, it will probably do as your only appetizer.  Even after eating two bowls of chips with this guacamole  - and salsa, which they mix with what seems to be adobo at the table to suit your heat preference - we still had a massive amount left to take home.For our meal, we had tortilla soup, corn with queso fresco (corn and cheese?  Awesome.) and carnitas tacos.  These might be the best tacos I've had in Charlotte.  The pork was so tender that after my first bite, I wasn't sure if I had any meat in my mouth.  It was that good.  The second bite gave me a bit of the skin, which was crispy and juicy at the same time.  But to eat meat that just melted in the mouth?  Nice.  I actually couldn't finish them because of the guacamole (unlike the guac, the tacos were good the next day).The only bad side?  I wasn't terribly impressed with the sides.  The rice was average, the corn was decent, but how bad can it be - put cheese on something after you grill it and it's going to be good.  But still it seems like Vida is off to an excellent start.  Service moved along nicely - I heard they had some bumps earlier in the week, but it seems they have them ironed out now.  Why are you still reading?  Go get some of that guacamole.Darn it, not for me. Since the weather is starting to get warmer, an afternoon on a patio was what I needed. Remembering that Vida has a lovely patio, especially for people watching, my husband and I went there for lunch. Knowing we wanted to spend a leisurely time, I thought we'd snack on their delicious guacamole to start. I remembered from my first visit that if you sign up online for their membership program, you get the guac for free. Signed up then and there, showed my server, server asked the manager, manager said, "No." I guess when their sign says that you can experience the benefits "immediately" that means something different. Something about a number...I got a confirmation email, but no number. After my initial visit, one of their PR staff called me to figure out what went wrong, we played phone tag, but they never followed through. As you can see, this restaurant is not a good stop for me...bummer.I will say, the server we had this time around was very attentive and friendly and the hostesses were very nice too. However, the food was still mediocre. I don't know if even the patio or getting a number for the free guac can bring me back...
Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon=I braved the reviews and decided to try this place out anyway. Sorry to anyone that has Ill feelings but unfortunately we do not know the truth and can only comment on the current, as we see it. It took me two u-turns to actually find the place but that is because I did not look at the address before I left. It is located on the North East side behind the Oil changing place. The building was bigger then I had expected and I liked the colors of the exterior. I walked in stuck me head in the bar and the waiting room and no one was there to greet me. It took about 2 full min which feels like forever for some reason. The owner (I assume) seated me in the bar while I waited for Ryan C. The interior was clean and inviting. I liked the bar setup. The bar tender/waitress helped me with a cold drink while I waited. I usually wait for Ryan for just about everything. LOL I looked over the menu and the the lunch specials are killer. $4 for a 1/4lb pork sandwich with a side. WOW We both had pork sandwiches one with fries and one with salad. The meat was good, we each had one hunk o fat but the texture and flavor (before sauce) was good. The meat was a little too greasy and soaked the bottom bun while dripping out as well. The spicy sauce was good but not too spicy. The blue cheese was lacking. All in all I had a great lunch. I would go back and use my REST.com coupon for dinner.There are times when people have referred to another person's review and said, "So-and-So said it all, I really have nothing to add." Well, in this case, it is literally literal. Daren C said pretty much what I would have said, as far as an objective description of the place and what went down. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hammered-hog-bbq-hall-and-saloon-phoenix#hrid:tVZ6FRcn8Osi0QsJT4beNQ However, I have to part from my wise brother in my rating. Although I believe we felt the same about the fact that the meat had a really good, smokey flavor, it was too greasy for me to enjoy that flavor. The bottom of the bun sponged up so much that it was soaked, and a light squeeze produced a stream and puddle. Eww. The meat and sauce had good flavor, so there's potential, but the grease just overpowered it so much, and I fear the repercussions that may be to come.Perhaps if I were "hammered" I would have enjoyed this meal better... I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot. I ordered take-out on a Sunday, and when I arrived I felt something was off right away. The place was dead... Not one person in the gigantic dining room, only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored. The bar however was pretty lively, maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food. Ribs - all char and fat, barely any meat and extremely overcookedPulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of greaseThe sides, corn (half a cob is considered a side for two??) Cheese grits, worst I have ever tried, dry and flavorlessCornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry spongeBBQ Sauce - disappointing at best, watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides).Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on topI really don't like writing scathing reviews, but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal. There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix, this is not one.
Che Inka Chicken=A rotisserie chicken place with a nice dose of homey ethnic flair - what's not to love?I kept it simple and split a whole chicken ($9.99) with a coworker. Drinks were $2. Food came out quickly and I dig the decor - eclectic and fun. Very Peruvian seeming, but what do I know ?Chicken was fabulous! Moist and very flavorful. I'm am a hearty eater and 1/2 a chicken with no sides was perfect for me. I can imagine if you're adding sides, desserts (the caramel crepes looked ridiculously good!), etc, you're probably fine with a 1/4 chicken. When they brought out chimichurri sauce and salsa for the chicken my heart sang for joy- delicious! Yup, I'll be back!
Windy City Beefs N Dogs=Was on the way home and remembered to finally stop by this joint and take it off my "To Do List".....thank God I did!  It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!I was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.I browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!I couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.I saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.After a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!The Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.The Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.The owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said "See you soon Peter!"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.Will I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories.I've eaten at the other location in Henderson and really liked it. They also have good deep dish pizza at the other location however the the only pizza you will find at this one is a puff since the menu mostly consists of dogs, sausages, Italian beef and wings. I had a #12 which is a 2 grilled sausages with onions and peppers on bread. The onions and peppers were perfect but the sausage was too dry. Remember I had not just 1 but 2 of these dry sausage to work through. Even with adding mustard it just didn't help. Then my wife and I shared a basket of chili cheese fries however we didn't eat but a small dent in them. After tasting the chili I remembered that I didn't like it at the other location either. Honestly I don't care that it doesn't have beans but what I care more about is that it tastes like a stinky armpit smells. I love chili just not here. My wife ordered a pizza puff that I ended up eating a few bites of and it surprised me how much I liked it. I have had more authentic ones at other places and this one is more like a over-sized totinos pizza roll yet it was damn good. I can't say enough about how nice the staff was. They took the time to show us menus we could read at a table since the menu board here is curved and at a weird angle so you need a neck massage after looking at it too long. Staff checked on us a couple times to make sure we were good and to see if we needed anything so that was a plus. The inside is small with some tables and a bar with stools and they have a couple tables outside.I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.I love me a good Chicago Dog and this place is pretty solid.  Vienna Beef everything, dogs, neon green relish, steamed poppy seed buns.  They have all the right ingredients that's for sure.  I prefer the jumbo vienna beef hot dogs.  They are skinless and a little fatter.  I've always thought the regular Vienna Beef dog, gets a little lost in all the toppings, and that was the case here.  However I swear as I was walking out, I heard them telling a customer about the Jumbo dog.  But I never saw it on the menu - darn it!.The skin on the regular dog gives it a little snap when you eat it, which doesn't really do much for me either way, but most Chicago Dog aficionados swear by the snap.  While this was a good Chicago dog, it could have used a little more celery salt and the tomatoes could have been a little better.  I did like how their pickle spear was sliced thin enough to actually be eaten along with the dog.  Most places you have to take the pickle off and eat it separately.  3.5 stars for the Chicago dog. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#Z6UGYg-LExpNUYs7Qt2jRAThe star of the show was the Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich.  They serve it dry, wet, or dipped.  We decided to go wet and it had just the right amount of sogginess to it.  I had them add mozzarella cheese and got the giardinera pepper mix on the side.  They have two levels of spice on the giardinera mix - medium and hot.  We went medium and it had just the right amount of vinegary spice to it.  The Beef itself had a nice peppery flavor to it, and it just melted in your mouth as it's been simmering in it's own au jus.  4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#dMWDeRLDPiRWLo09g5oQAgI don't really get the pizza puff.  After reading the yelp reviews, I thought some yelpers were on to something here, so I had to give it a try.  I found it very uninspired.  Like a hot pocket.  It had small pieces of ground sausage, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese, in a pastry.  Nothing that you can't get a frozen version of at a grocery store.  2 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#BmSWVAd7apKHf44lPrHtLwThe fries were just ok for me.  Fried to order and served in it's own little brown bag, they were plenty hot and you could add some salt and shake the bag.  They were pretty thin cut and on the crispy side.  I'm more of a thick steak fry or crinkly fry kind of guy.  I like to taste the potato on the inside of the fry.  So I knew right away that I wasn't really going to be into Windy City's fries.  3 stars.Service was very friendly and they made us feel at home.  You can tell they really know their local customers and they have a well deserved loyal following.  They also take pride in their restaurant and it was very clean and nicely decorated.  I also like how they randomly write a man and woman's name on a board every day.  If it happens to be your name, then you get a free hot dog.  How fun!  On this day Chester and Diane were the lucky names.  5 stars.
Republic Kitchen & Bar=One of my favorite bars in Vegas. Such an awesome concept with the old school classic board games such as rockem sockem robots, and jenga! Oh yea and the Wii upstairs, so fun!. Love the black and white decor and the upstairs overlooks the bar. Very cool. The prices aren't bad and they serve Illy coffee, my favorite!Its usually pretty busy on weekends so i would suggest showing up early to grab a table or the upstairs part for the fun games.Def a fun bar to check out when your in the Green Valley area. Ive never tried the food but it always looks delish.
Harold's Chicken=The food here is great and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the 1/2 white meat chicken dinner. The chicken consisted of two sizeable breast cuts of chicken, well-seasoned and bathed in just the right amount of sauce, and two wings, which were smaller but nonetheless delicious. I dock it stars for what I consider horrible service. After ordering I sat around the restaurant, waiting for my chicken to be prepared. While I waited, a large gentleman with a case of bootleg DVDs waited in the front of the store for the entire time while I was there. I never saw him order and he never received any food. I have no idea what he was doing there.After about five minutes of waiting I asked for a glass of water, The attendant behind the counter got me a class, but acted as if I had offended him by asking. Later when he removed an order from the back I asked him if it was my order and he said "No fool. This is mine." I am not making this up.A few moments later he walked out from the back with his order and tells me that I am spilling my water. I looked below me and did not see any spilled water. I checked by the fountain to see if I had spilled there. I hadn't. I checked the shelf behind me and found that indeed there was no spilled water. I don't know what the attendant was talking about, though I did get the strong impression that he was trying to intimidate me.Finally, the wait for the chicken should have been 10 minutes. Mine was 20, and it wasn't really that busy. I was in a hurry and this made me late.So yeah, there's some real solid food here, but I hope you don't have to wait around for it while the staff tries to intimidate you.i had a high expectation for this place, but yet i was let down. i placed an order over the phone, ordered the 6 piece chicken. ended up being around $10. and once you'll sit down and open up that box, you'll be in a world of shock! they got wings so small that you're mother wouldn't believe her eyes! the cashier (she's the owner, i'm predicting.) i couldn't believe she hid her baby under the register! my lady and I was trying to enjoy our chicken, then all the sudden. we heard a baby crying! upon observation, it was coming from under the register...yes, believe it. a chicken shack turned into daycare service. and the funny part, as we're eating. the chef walks out and calls me a fool( i'm sure he calls everyone a fool, whoever he sees) like get with the program, if you're representing an establishment you gotta be professional! and not insult a customer. the verdict, sad to say. i've experience better chicken, popeyes is still the best.Harold's is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get...A week earlier, Harold's flakey operating hours foiled a lunch date between Miss Joyce and I.  The sign on the door indicates Harold's opens at 11 AM, but at 11:40AM, the door was locked and the lights were off.  Just Harold's being Harold's, according to Miss Joyce.Fast forward five days:  I'm making a Woodman's grocery run and see the lights on and customers filing through Harold's door.  Throwing caution to the wind, I dashed through the front door and thus began my maiden Harold's experience.The employee working the front counter greeted me and handed me a menu.  It didn't take much time for me to decide on the  1/2 chicken dinner special (2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 slices of white bread, cole slaw and fries for $6.99) with the hot sauce on the side.  Because everything is made to order, I was told my food would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes.  No problem, I sauntered over to Woodman's and grabbed the handful of items on my shopping list. I returned 20 minutes later, grabbed a seat and after my lunch was delivered to my booth.SWEETBABYJESUS!When I looked down upon my newfound bounty, I realized I just entered fried chicken heaven.The sides of the flimsy cardboard serving tray were bulging from the sheer mass of my order. No anorexic birds served at this chicken shack.   My first attempt to tackle one of the drumsticks results in burned digits - confirming that this chicken was fresh from the fryer.  No heat lamps...check.  Pro tip: the white bread served with the dinner order has amazing insulating properties - use it to protect yourself when making a move on the first piece of chicken.The exterior boasted a crispy exterior shell that gave way with a loud crunch on every bite.  I learned that Harold's still uses  1/2 beef tallow /  1/2 vegetable oil in its fryers.  The seasoning was spot on as well.The interior was the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  My server left a dozen napkins on the table for good reason - I had juice running down my hands and dripping down my chin.  Pro tip 2: Do not go to Harold's on a first date or before a job interview.I absolutely loved the tangy cole slaw.  It had the right balance of sweet and sour elements and had a wonderful crunch.  The only negative is the thimble-esque serving size.  More cole slaw please!The fries were the weakest link of the meal - a little soggy but well seasoned.Unlike the colorful encounters experienced by my fellow Yelpers, my visit was uneventful.  Nobody called me fool and the bootleg DVD guy was nowhere to be found.  The server came by and cleared my table.  On the way out, she politely reminded me that I could order ahead next time if I didn't want to wait the 20 minutes.  However, I was only paying partial attention.  In my mind, I was already planning my return trip next Monday when the  1/2 chicken (dark meat) dinner is only $4.99.I had heard good things about Harold's Chicken, and I was itching for some righteous fried chicken on this particular day. I stopped in around 2:00pm, lunch time for many people. There were three guys sitting in back, perhaps eating lunch themselves. One man approached me and asked if he could help me, and I attempted to order some food.He said to me, "I can't do it, I have a meeting. I'm trying to open another restaurant." Wow, what a joke. Why oh why would you open another restaurant if you can't serve food at lunch time, with three guys sitting around? Isn't selling food the general idea of a restaurant? Furthermore, why is your open sign lit and your door open if you're about to leave and not serve anyone?I would review the food as well, but seeing as how I didn't receive any, this review will do until I'm proven otherwise. Maybe I'll try Harold's again, if I'm in the mood for wasting some more time out of my day.
Frankie's 710 Trattoria=I went there last night about 7:30 with a friend and the restaurant was almost empty. It was like that sometimes when it was Pie Town too. The pool table right when you walk in the door seems out if place. I would rather see more cool lounge type chairs to socialize with friends. The bar area has a nice feel to it. Our server was above average and very attentive - probably because we were his only table :)The new menu has many great choices for food and still some of their unique pizzas from Pie Town. We ordered the calamari and it was cooked to perfection - not overdone and chewy like most places around Charlotte. We split the chicken marsala and the bacon & egg pizza. Both were outstanding. Note:  I am giving 4 stars for the food and atmosphere, but I would like to give it 3 stars because the red wine selection was very very small, there were only a couple choices of red available. They said they were getting ready for restaurant week. So I am hoping if the owners read this, they will add more red wines like a cabernet and chianti.  We ended up drinking beer. I will go back and if the wine list is better, I will keep the review at 4 stars, otherwise, I will drop it to 3 for good.
Viet Kitchen=I take my sweet mom to lunch at least twice a month, so she can get out of the house once in a while. She likes Vietnamese cuisine, so I searched on Yelp to find something close to downtown.  I stumbled upon Dolores G's review and she seemed to like it, so I brought my mom here.My Mom ordered the house stir fry which is a noodle with beef, pork, shrimp, chicken and veggies stir fry. ($8.75) and I ordered the Sauteed Tofu with Tomatoes and Onions and Thai Tea. ($7.50). Given our hunger levels, we also ordered a couple of fresh Spring Rolls and shared a pot of hot tea.Mom really enjoyed her savory dish, Mine on the other hand was just fine. I guess I was expecting it to be more flavorful, but it's just Tofu with sauteed tomatoes and onions which I can easily make at home. I thought it was a little  under flavored in my opinion-- nothing that a shot of Sriracha and a few dabs of chili pepper sauce couldn't cure though. Portions are not too big just a scoop of rice and the entree', so if you have a big appetite better go to a buffet instead.But to be fair, I am giving them 4 stars for providing a clean establishment, good service and reasonably priced dishes.
Broadway Pizzeria=Another stop on my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition Tour, I decided to check out Broadway Pizza.  Since I was dining by myself, I opted to order 2 Slices.  Cheese Slices are $1.95 each with $.40 ea for additional toppings.  I ordered 2 Sausage & Pepperoni slices.After a short wait, the Pizza came out.  The slices were huge....a little bigger than what I normally see around town.  The Pizza is NY Style thin crust.  After a few bites I was underwhelmed.  The Pizza was just OK.  I didn't really care for the Sausage and the Pepperoni didn't have much flavor.Overall, the Pizza didn't leave me wanting more.  They serve other items like Wings and Calzones....maybe I'll come back to try one of those.Return Factor - 40%
JoBot Coffee & Diner=I am hesitant to even review JoBot Coffee.It's one of those situations where I'm caught in a catch 22: i want their business to flourish, but i want it to remain sparse and not overpopulated with d-bags.however they need the publicity and support so i will go ahead and sing my praises. JoBot for me, reprsents Israel. Now hear me out on this one Goyim:  If Phoenix is a metaphor for the world, and people like me, i.e. stylish intelligent cultured 20 something yr olds supposed hipsters persecuted as such a metaphor for the diaspora of jewish peoples than JoBot coffee would be our zion. You look about and as far as the gates of their partially sheltered courtyard extend you will see nothing but my peoples, heads bowed in solemn respect that denote caffeine addiction and apple computer usage, the cool kids vonnegut readers, cigarette tokers, friends of vegan and pescatarian alike. This place is my canaan in a fiesty world of jack boot goose stepping fascists in lifted trucks and tribal tattoo arm bands who'd just as soon shout a slur at me on my bike or rocket off a monster energy drink at the back of my head. JoBot is my shelter from the storm. and i sincerely hope it remains that way.JoBot is the real deal. Outstanding coffee, crepes and the service is first rate. I went to JoBot on a Thursday night, meeting someone special there. Walking in, there is a long corridor, with a coffee bar and stools lining the length of the bar.I ordered an iced vanilla latte, and my partner in crime had water and a banana nutella crepe. Our drinks and crepe arrived, and the reviews saying how great everything is, are really accurate. As it slowed down a bit, the amazing employee, Shane, asked us how we were doing, and we told him how great everything was. This spawned a great conversation where we learned a ton about JoBot, and coffee in general. Shane was so cool, and he taught us about the most popular items at JoBot, specifically a toddy. We had never had one, and Shane was nice enough to make a small sample drink for us, and it was unreal. SOOOOOOOO tasty and nice, but not as great as the service and conversation with Shane.Another super cool thing about JoBot, is that they have late hours EVERY day, so when you need a drink, snack, or tasty crepe, you have a spot to get your fix. Being at JoBot, you can easily have the feeling that you are on vacation somewhere really cool, and this is one of those places that you only wish you had back in your hometown. It sounds weird, but being at JoBot feels like a vacation, it's just relaxing, you're not rushed, and it's very laid back. The great news is, we have JoBot in our backyard, and I can take a mini-vacation anytime, and go there and relax. I am really grateful that we have locally owned gems like this in the 602. I really cannot imagine a situation where I would pick a chain over JoBot, Lola, or Giant Coffee. It's really nice to have a great drink, while supporting local Mom & Pops. That is what I call a win-win. Check out JoBot, you will not be disappointed.Wow, worse service ever!  My girlfriend and I went there on Sunday morning. We traditionally frequent different coffee shops during the weekend and looked forward to their good coffee and crepes. I love the screen door and intimate feel of the place, so relaxing.So we arrived and sat down, only to wait for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) before we decided to leave. The barista didn't even acknowledge us until half way through that time. It would be different if it was screaming busy  but there was only two other couples sitting down ahead of us. I spend alot of time in coffee shops, this place may have good coffee but compared to service at Lux and Lola's; I'll take my business elsewhere in the future.I came here this morning with the BF to use a living social deal I had bought recently. I was really excited to try this place, as it was crazy busy the last time I was there (on first friday), so I passed on it. This place is really cool, it has a nice atmosphere and feels homey and friendly. The whole street is like a little community, so it has a good feel, and I like to support that kind of business. I ordered an iced latte and the 'cannoli' crepe (ricotta, choco chips, almonds) and the BF got a hot latte and the PB, raspberry jam, and banana crepe. They were a bit chewy, but good flavor. The coffee was very good, it is made by cartel coffee, which I always like. I would definitely come back here to try different flavors and to drink yummy coffee.Holy Crepes! Iced Mocha - More like iced "crack" mocha...I'm bouncing off the walls. Si Si me gusta~Banana-Nutella Crepe - Sweet Virgin Mary silhouette on my morning toast, It was heavenly!...AND a punch card?! I'll be a doughy mess in no time. Thanks yo!Man, I REALLY love the food and the coffee here, but I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a business in my life, ... seriously. So... Let me tell you how my JoBot experience went down today. This is how it went down. I ordered a couple of crepes and a coffee from the incredibly friendly gentleman with the long hair. Then I went over to the register where the bald dude (the owner) was standing. I stood there for several minutes, holding my bank card in the air, while he ignored me and continued talking to some guy next to me about cameras. After a good, long while the owner finally looked at me and said, "Why do you keep looking at me?!", in just about the shittiest tone possible without necessitating a fist fight. I was pretty taken aback. I just said, "Uh... I'd like to pay for the things I just bought." The guy next to me who witnessed this unprecedented level of snobbery said, "Wow, dude. You were so nice about it too. I'm impressed. It takes a real man to be polite after that one." Then the owner continued to process my order (17 dollars), without saying a word of any sort, let alone a thank you. I'm a very mellow guy, but after that I was so pissed I thought about walking out. I'm still angry.I make it a point to be as reasonable and polite as humanly possible with anyone in the service industry. It's part of my moral code to use only my most impeccable manners when dealing with service people as I know they put up with a lot of shit in their line of work. I just can't fathom asking any customer "Why do you keep looking at me?!", under any reasonable circumstances. I mean, WTF? I was just standing there, card in hand, waiting to give him my money. I'm going to have to do one of three things. Option A - I never go to JoBot again. Option B - I convince myself that the owner has "some sort of mental problem" and that he doesn't understand that he's being an asshole to the customers. Option C - Keep going to JoBot like nothing happened and just expect to be loudly and openly disrespected by a cackling dimwit when I go to pay for my food.If you find yourself wandering the streets of down town phoenix late one evening, no, you're probably not homeless you were likely just hopping from bar to bar and can't remember. Don't fret because JoBot's lights are still on late into the night. While I can't say exactly just how late "late" is because I haven't payed too close attention to that minor detail and no one has posted it here on yelp yet. I can say they've been open every time I have visited after 11pm.Mental note to self, next time at JoBot find out about hours and update yelp. Is it considered a mental note if I just wrote it down? I'm also not so sure it was to self either as I plan to post this review sometime soon. Anyway.Give any of their crepes a try, they're all fairly good; although, I do prefer the savory crepes over the sweet crepes here. I truly can't believe I just said that actually, since most of my other reviews are for frozen yogurt and cupcakes, at least that's what I tried to order and was told "We don't actually serve frozen yogurt here sir. Would you like to try our crepes?"Loved the chorizo and egg crepe - twas the perfect combination of everything they combined together to make the crepe. I'm pretty sure it was part chorizo, part egg, part cheese and part crepe. But then again it was a late night and I did just swing by after visiting Lost Leaf next door.I hear they serve excellent coffee too, but I tend to stick to tea and pastries. Happy wandering my yelping friends! Hope to stumble into you sometime while chowing down on one of their tasty crepes.Positives: open late, free wi-fi, free entomology lessons (if that's your thing...read on)Negatives: everything elseOK WOW!  I have been meaning to write my first review for a while now, but I was basically forced to do it right now by my experience at Jobot.  Too bad my first review has to be a negative one, but I feel I owe it to all of you who so faithfully warn me to stay away from places like this, although you may have let me down on this one!So I read through most of the reviews and felt that I had a fairy good idea of what to expect.  Since many reviews seemed positive enough, I thought I'd give it a try since I am getting bored with the same old coffee joint.  So I found my way from the dark street in front of Jobot, through the dimly lit patio area, up onto the old wooden porch, to the front door, and into Jobot ready to fall in love with the place.  As I entered I was initially overwhelmed by three things.  One: the blaring punk music, two: the swamp cooler blasting air and noise directly at my head, and three: the total apathy of the staff who were conversing among themselves (ironically, about how "dead" it's been) while ignoring me.  I was eventually approached by a worker and I placed my order ($2.75 for an 8oz skim latte...more about the latte later).  While waiting for my latte, I decided to have a look at the pastry selection at the end of the coffee bar; only problem was, there were 3 employees standing there talking and blocking access to the pastry case.  I politely said "excuse me" as I tried to squeeze by them.  I kid you not...they glanced at me and then continued talking.  I squeezed thru the gaggle of employees determined to get a look at the pastries.  Once through the gauntlet of employees, I had a look at the pastries, which looked a little "run thru the mill" if you know what I mean.OK so determined to make the best of this experience, I pressed on.  While continuing to wait for my latte I poked my head into the two adjacent rooms.  The rooms are dingy and uninviting with hard, uncomfortable wooden benches and cheap metal frame stacking style chairs scattered about.  The crowd inside (two customers) was interesting.  One guy covered head to toe in tattoos hunched over an old laptop, and an older man snoozing in the corner near his empty coffee cup and book.  ...so back to waiting for my latte.  I intended to pay for it when I was intercepted by a 2 inch long cockroach crossing the floor between me and my latte.  I politely waited for it to pass.  While waiting for the roach to pass, I glanced at the guy who seemed to be in charge of the place to see how he would handle this most interesting situation.  He looked at me, shrugged his shoulders as if to say "whatcha gonna do"?  I almost laughed at the absurdity of it all, but quickly remembered I was on the hook to pony up the currency for my latte, which I did, albeit reluctantly at this point. I have taken my seat, opened my laptop, and am writing this review as we speak.  A few more shady characters have popped in and out, although they don't seem to be customers since they didn't buy any food or drink.  I assume they are friends with the owner(s).  My stomach has turned sour from the experience with the roach and having to recount the ordeal in detail as I write this review... so my latte will sit untouched as I leave in about 1 minute from now.  I hope you have enjoyed my contribution.  Thanks for sharing all of yours!Leaving Matt's low on caffeine and realizing Jiffy-Lube and Chase were not yet open to accomplish my afternoon errands I decided to next pay a visit to Jobot Coffee - a place I'd heard both good (music, coffee) and less-than-stellar (patrons, service) things about and pointing my GPS to the address I at first wondered if I'd mistyped; to say the least the area is residential and unassuming, but upon seeing the "Coffee" sign I assumed I was in the right place, parked, and walked in as Sigur Ros Takk played on the outdoor speakers.Half knowing what to expect from a house-come-coffee shop named the "best place to take a scenester" by the local media I entered the doors of JoBot to the aromatics of coffee and a bar populated by the partially hung-over and half-shaven but surprisingly also to smiling faces and families sitting with their Ipads as the kitchen turned out respectable looking sweet and savory crepes.  Not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee I was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if I wanted a menu or if I knew what I'd like I deferred for a moment while I perused the options - eventually settling on an iced Toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.With the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms I found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the Toddy - a rich blend from Cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 Strawberry "DohNut" and a $4.00 slice of Dr. Pepper Cake.  Beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze I have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  Moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since I ordered something as simple as "chocolate cake" and while there is no doubt I could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting.JoBot is the spot to go for a nice cold Chai or Iced Chamomile Tea at any time, literally their open twenty-four-seven. This place is soo uniquely cool. I like it!!Oh and they even have a cool little piano inside!! Mad nice!! It's weird how I get a look like, " What's this girl doing here?!" almost every time I come here. It's more FUNNY, than upsetting!! :) No worries, I guess I'm not their usual clientele. Oh well, they'll get use to it eventually! It might be the bright colors I sometimes frequently wear, who knows?!.Late Night Problems... there are those nights at 2 am when every thing with edible food is closed.  You pull out your mobile Yelp app.  You search for restaurants that are open now.... and just some times, you find a rare 5-Star gem and wonder,  "How could I have not found this place before today."  JoBot Coffee is one of those places.Everything about JoBot screams hipster.  It is in an ecclectic part of down town Phoenix, they serve as much local food as possible,  it sits next door to a house-pub, it is in a house itself and  the inside is retro-shic.  AND It is open 24 hours on the weekends.  I fell so deep in love with this place that I wanted to bring my cot and blanket and move in.  The selection of crepes and specials is phenomenal.   You walk up to the counter and order something good.  This IS a coffee shop, so expect brekfast-like options with tasty salads and other things.  Sit at the counter or a table inside or stroll to a table outside on the front lawn.... enjoy food.  Repeat.  Repeat.I can't wait for my return to this restaurant.  I am sure there are more exciting things about this place that I have yet to discover.We went for crepes and we had crepes and we were pleased.That would be an understatement, we were in heaven. The crepes were to die for! They had flavor that oozed more flavor. Each and every bite was a gastronomic masterpiece of flavor. Did I already mention the flavor?The coffee that accompanied the crepes was also wonderful. Not quite exquisite, just wonderful.When we arrived the music being played was David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust album and the DJ outside was blasting out some awesome Santana tunes.And the sun was shining and life was good.This place is an all around A #1, five star coffee shop with a cool vibe. This is definitely on my return as soon as possible list. Bring your bike, your electronic communication device (or a good book) and enjoy this wonderful oasis of cool eats in Phoenix.
Acropolis Ouzerie=Certainly the best Greek food I've had outside Greece. Fresh ingredients, freshly prepared and about as unpretentious as it gets. Had good chats with the owner though he was a little grumpy at first!
Cafe Cortez=$5 beer and a burger. Annnnd scene. Seriously, that's a hell of a deal. Sure, you're going into a crappy, smokey, hole in the wall cafe where people are coming to die, but still...$5 beer and a burger. The burger wasn't bad either! Wasn't great, but was totally edible. The beer? Tanaya Creek. Again, not too shabby for my $5. Would I come here for a casual meal? Nope. Would I enjoy this special again while having a few drinks on Fremont East? You bet your arse I will.What does five bucks get you these days? The answer is: not very much. Perhaps a box of Girl Scout cookies or maybe a crappy watered-down well drink at your grandpa's favorite dive...Well, I have some great news, my friends. Rather than throwing your last Lincoln on black and hoping for the best, save that last fiver and have that dead president treat you to a burger and a beer at Cafe Cortez. I cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle, in my eye. This is no lie, folks.Is it a great burger? We don't ask that question here. Instead we ask something like, is it a bad burger, or is it edible? Yes! Cooked well, served will all the standard fixin's and delivered with a side of sass and guilt from an "overworked" waitress. So the beer must be awful right? Nuh-uh! You'll be sippin' in style when you wash that beef bomb down with an ice cold Tanaya Creek - one of Vegas' finest craft brews.Good on ya, Cafe Cortez.We came here on a Friday night and ordered their specials1. Burger and Beer, 5- Extra cheese, 50c2. Prime rib, 9.95$19. - A bit of a wait time to be seated. Expected for a Friday night. - shallow whisper...strawsssss? huh? haha..uh, yes please. - Reminds me of Grand Cafe but worse. - Burger was good. Made medium not extra for grilled onions. Definitely get the cheese. Made it juicy.- Choice of Tenaya Creek or Bud Light. - Prime rib was chewy. Very similar to the taste of a Station Casino buffet. Decent enough to clean the plate after a few too many- Fries were thin. - Drunk? Come here for a cheap eat! Sober? Get inebriated then come back here to eat.
Xtreme Sushi & Sterling Steakhouse=My first one-star review. I feel really bad, but this is necessary. Before I start off about everything negative with this place, maybe a couple redeeming factor should be said. The restaurant is new, so the decor is pretty nice. The lounge area at the front seems inviting. Hmm... That's it!We had a party of eight with us that night. We all did all-you-can-eat except for one pair of couple. Given we are regular at AYCE, we know our orders can be pretty hectic, so we wrote down our orders on a piece of paper with how many number of order each. This should have made the server's life easier and the orders to arrive quicker. Well, we were wrong. One thing I can say is that I am glad there is no time limit at this AYCE because our dinner was 2 and a half hour long. This was not intentional on our part. First, they give you all the rolls you ordered, which I am sure it is a strategy on their part to fill you up with rice. Then they bring out four orders of the nigiri and the server asks you if you have gotten everything you ordered. WAIT A MINUTE! You had a list, didn't you??? Anyway, we waited for our food longer than it took us to eat our food. It was terrible! Second, the rice was cold and hard. I felt like I was swallowing pebbles no matter how much I chew. The fish itself was very decent and fresh, but the rice was terrible. However, as fresh as the fish was, the rice is about 75% of the nigiri, so there wasn't much room to turn this into a more positive situation. Anyways, this place is one dollar cheaper than your usual AYCE. I'd avoid it if I can. Good luck!Groupon Alert. I was skeptical of this place after hearing the downgrade in reviews as of late. Finally, I dragged my butt over there and I am happy to report that it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Not a rave review, but pretty good. I was able to enjoy the AYCE sushi option with my Groupon, while my fella ordered the steak. The steak left quite a bit to be desired. Bad cut, dry potatoes, not super flavorful. I wouldn't recommend it! The sushi wasn't bad. Some of the rolls were a little over seasoned and drenched in sauces. I found this to be the case with their salads as well. Too many sauces, too many flavors. I would recommend sticking with the nigiri or appetizers if you're getting the AYCE. The specialty rolls left quite a bit to be desired in the flavor department and were too overstuffed with rice. I have to give special recognition to the miso soup. I'm not typically a big fan of it, but I found this one to be well-seasoned and yummy. I had read quite a bit about bad and slow service, but I didn't find that to be the case. Our server was quite attentive. She checked on us every few minutes for additional sushi orders and the food came out quickly as well. Which helped them earn an extra star in my book.The atmosphere is nice as well. There is plenty of seating for large parties, so I think it's great for large groups to get together and chat. We were in a secluded room, which I didn't mind at all, but when the servers had to walk in and out of the room constantly they would yell out "corner" to notify people they were coming so as not to collide. Practical, but annoying after a while. There are quite a few sushi places I prefer over Xtreme Sushi, but it's not bad for the price.i wish there was an option for less than zero stars.  THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  here is my experience:enter the restaurant and we were told that there was a wait, we said that was fine and we would just wait at the bar.  the three of us sit at the bar and watch the guy behind the bar talking and drinking with a customer, he NOT ONCE even acknowledged our existence.  This went on for about 10 minutes, even when another party of four more people sat at the bar.  finally a girl came behind the bar and i asked her if we could order from her, and we finally got our ridiculously overpriced sake (more than double what you would pay at most sushi places).  we then were seated and given soup while browsing the cheap paper menu's tri-folded on cheap paper (very classy considering the price for everything).   while looking at the menu the busboy came and took all three of our soups before any of us were near done.  the waitress was nice, but you could tell she was new and a little overwhelmed.  we ordered several rolls and an appetizer and after waiting for more than 30 minutes we asked to talk to a manager.  a woman came over and i told her about the experience from the time we walked into the door and she just stared at me like a deer caught in the headlights.  i told her to cancel our food order and she said she needed to ask the owner.  to my horror she indicated the owner was the douche bag behind the bar that didn't acknowledge any of the patrons that are paying his overhead cause he was too busy drinking and trying to pick up a girl.  UNBELIEVABLE!  i asked the manager to just send the owner over, but he refused to come to my table.  i refused at that time to pay.  on my way out i confronted the owner, he was demeaning and rude beyond words.  i told him that i couldn't believe he didn't help or even say a word to us when we sat at the bar and his response was "i'm not a bartender, i'm the owner".  the whole time i was talking he kept trying to talk past me to the man in our group, you could tell that this foreign excuse of a man considers himself not only above serving a drink or saying hello to a customer, but also being talked to by a woman.   i cannot wait for the day his business shuts down, and we have all bet money on the month that it does, it's just a matter of time.  until then, sorry i could give you no review of the food as it never came out.  i can tell you though the prices do not justify the service, and the owner is a complete disgusting greasy ass.   head up the street and go to i love sushi, it never disappoints.Beware...this has been downgraded to a "do not enter" rating. Irate wouldn't be the word I would use when describing the service here. My friends and I were treated as if we stole something...read on for details. Certified regulars of this Palace of Pain, we endured mild mistreatment simply because we became hooked on the food and it's close to the house. We came here on 11-26, my birthday!, for a nice meal before heading to the bar. We should have known from the clueless hostess who we asked twice for outdoor seating, then led us to an indoor booth. Finally when we said, "can we not sit outside for some reason?" a different hostess replied, "Oh, sure we can set that up." Hmm...Since we weren't starving and had some drinkin' to do at the next location we didn't all do the AYCE, just ordered random rolls. An hour later (60 full minutes) members of our party hadn't received the first rolls they ordered. Second and third orders arrived and we reminded the server we were still waiting on some of the first items ordered, which she said she'd check on. Twice. How does that work? If I took a number at a deli, say 23, and 42 got his food next....there's a problem. Simple math. The place was busy but nothing warrants that kind of service. After a third time of asking where the missing rolls were, while exhibiting some visible displeasure, the waitress did bring some "free" sake but no rolls (the price being our sanity). When they finally did arrive, basically when we had our coats on to leave, we sent them back, completely tired of waiting and being treated like sake drinking children.The final chapter? When a member of our party calmly spoke with the owner, who self importantly posts himself up at the sushi bar, apparently watching orders not be made, this man had the nerve to argue that we had only been waiting 30 minutes. 1. What owner argues with a customer? 2. Even THAT amount of time is ridiculous for one roll!!! It was completely baffling, especially since we go there so often and were pretty positive the owner recognized us. There will be an empty space in this shopping plaza if this pattern of service continues and my friends and I will be watching from afar. Very far.So... I haven't been tempted to come back to this place since my first visit, until this week. My coworkers were in the mood for sushi and I said yes to their invite before I knew where they were headed. We arrived at the restaurant around 12:15 and the place was pretty busy. We walked in the door and I was already turned off by the fish and vinegar smell that welcomed us. That definitely set a bad tone for our meal. We ordered our food and each of our dishes seemed to come out pretty slowly. Not great, when we have a time limit.One at a time, our food trickled out of the kitchen and I can't think of one thing that I ate that was even slightly good. The tofu was flavorless and soggy, the edamame was bland, all the sushi and rolls were poor quality and texture. All the fish had an extremely fishy smell.  The sauces were too thick and sweet and I think everyone at our table had to force themselves to eat most of the food we ordered. I'm not someone who dishes out 1 star reviews very often, but I'm absolutely shocked that this place not only stays in business, but that they were actually pretty busy when we came. The prices are cheap for AYCE, but I'd rather pay a few more dollars for something edible. If I wasn't dining with coworkers, I would definitely have said something about both the service and the food.Xtremely poor.Xtremely slow.Xtremely rude.This place isn't called "Xtreme" for nothing! A few girlfriends and I settled for this 2nd string quarterback because the Heisman winner, Goyemon, was running a 2-hour long wait that night. None of us were that hungry so we didn't want to do AYCE, choosing instead to opt for a la carte choices. Everyone else ordered rolls which came out first while I waited for my hot item to come out from the kitchen. And waited. And waited. By the time everyone else around me finished, my order still hadn't arrived so I told the server to cancel my order, and she seemed completely unaware that I had even had anything to begin with. The whole time I was debating whether or not to say anything to management, and when I finally mustered up the courage to do so, it seemed only logical that the Jersey Shore character expediting at the sushi bar would be the one I'd need to talk to, since his face was the one plastered in celebrity photos throughout the restaurant. As I started to talk about my frustrations about the service, he waved me off and said I'd need to speak to the manager who was that other guy tinkering around some bar in the back that wasn't even occupied. Okaaay. So we did, and as I was mid-sentence, the manager actually turned and walked away for me. What does this mean? Are we done here? Because I didn't think we were! He came back with his card, and wrote on the back that next time we came in, I'd have 50% off my tab, apologizing and adding that unfortunately they only had one cook scheduled in the back kitchen to accommodate hot orders. 1 cook on a Friday!? There are too many things I could say about this lack of common sense so I need to cut myself off now.Let me paint you this horrific picture. Came in here with a party of 20 for my girlfriends birthday and was sat in one of the back rooms. we pretty much took up the entire room. We were all told we all had to do either AYCE or order off the menu individually. a few of us didn't want to eat but since we were being forced we all chose AYCE. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 rolls and a large sake. after about 30 minutes of not receiving either (a few friends still hadn't received their orders either at this time) we went to the bar to grab our sake. there was no bartender so we stood there for about 5 minutes and finally someone came up. we told her about the sake and supposedly the waitress never put in the order so we bought a large sake at the bar. the sake bottle looked pretty small but we took it anyways. come to find out she gave us a small sake bottle instead of the large that we paid for. when we brought this to our waitresses attention she ROLLED HER EYES and walked away... dude wtf. she never retuned with our right sake and she never returned with our food. when we asked her where our sushi was, this is what she had to say. "Listen there are 20 of you, if you know anything about the service industry you would understand this is a challenge" I honestly was so shocked this left me speechless. Myself and 3 other friends never received a roll, and when we got the bill she had added auto gratuity. I have never in my life asked for a auto grat to be taken off but this was an exception. i asked her too and she said she couldnt, the computer didnt "work that way" when i advised her I am a bar manager and i know damn well its against the law to force someone to tip you she walked into the back and never returned. we paid our bill (the large hot sake we originlly ordered was on the bill also btw) and left. When i got home i called to speak to a manager becuase i was FUMING. we were told there was no manager present. I will never retun to this establishment. what a scam.Beware! The "X" in "Xtreme Sushi" means stay away! Do it with me- two fingers, now! X! X! X!Where to begin? Here it goes... We went as a party of 4 adults:Even though the restaurant was quite empty, there was a little bit of a wait.. & we were seated down the hallway, RIGHT NEXT to the only other table (with 3 crying children), in the room. I get it, children will cry. When we sat down, we could feel the kids pushing on the back of the booth seat, repeatedly; so we had to politely move one booth away..The music was not at a dining level, I could have sworn we were at a Jay-Z concert! We couldn't even hear each other speak across the table... lots of lip-reading.The service, overall, was mediocre... at best. The water served was like drinking pool water!! I had to order lemon to try to mask the nasty chlorine flavor.. One of us asked a man what beer was served.. he looked at her like a deer in headlights & said he send the server right over.. but no such thing happened.Three of us ordered "all-you-can-eat sushi"-- & one (not a sushi fan) ordered a few appetizers, as her meal. The waitress brought the appetizers, along with ONE small dish of some ginger & old dried up wasabi the size of the tip of my thumb. (For the three of us!?, you're too generous!) Absurd!After we put our first order in, we waited 15-20 minutes(!) for just 3 rolls to be made. By that time the "crying kids table" left & they had seated another couple with a crying kid RIGHT NEXT to us, AGAIN-- after explaining why we had moved over! We should have left when we had the chance.The sushi was dis-gust-ing. In other words--revolting, repulsive, off-putting, unpalatable, foul, nasty, vomitus.. Take your pick. NOT FRESH IN THE SLIGHTEST. The "tempura" shrimp was cold & soggy. The tuna, warm & mushy!! Gross! The presentation was even horrible. Had to "fish" other tables for napkins, ask for wasabi & ginger for EACH of us that ordered sushi, not to mention- when we told our server our second order, (5 rolls) she didn't write any of it down, & guess what?! Just 4 rolls came out to the table! We took that as a blessing... Couldn't believe they had "Best sushi in Las Vegas" printed on their menu! Someone needs to take a permanent marker & fix that, they spelled "WORST" wrong. $80 down the drain, should have gone to In-N-Out! ... & for those "compliments" by people who think we "should have complained" & think I "must be such an awful person" to write my opinion & experience ...  Mentioning this to a manager was not worth my breath, that's what YELP is for, duh. I've been in the hostess/ server/ restaurant/ customer service business.. The etiquette-it's pretty simple!!Simply put, NEVER AGAIN.. ever.
Sunflour Baking Company=Small local business, let's support Sunflour by eating pies! They have the cutest, little baby pies, key lime, coconut creme and CHOCOLATE!  Enough for three normal slices or one just fat party pants pie. The nice girl behind the counter took two pies in the back for us and divided them so we could each take half with a smile! Now this is service!They also have sandwiches, cookies, savory muffins all wrapped up in a modern little dining room with friendly staff. I'm gonna rate them, three pinwheels.I would like Sunflour to make their coffee a little stronger. Please. PIE!!! 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288Ok...is it odd that I wanted to find something off about this place just to knock a star off it's pedestal? However, I must, enthusiastically, give it 5 stars as well! Andes mint brownies, morning glory muffins, ham & gruyere croissants, red pepper & cheddar scones...all do good! Yes, I decided to order a plethora of items for a recent house party. When in doubt, buy it all :)My favorite was the red pepper & cheddar scone. Can't beat a salt/sweet treat! They even have some unique low sugar carb beverages that are refreshing! Staff was very helpful and recommended the perfect items for my needs!
Firehouse Subs=Saw @ashley B's review and was reminded that this joint just opened on Saturday.  Decided to stop by for dinner and grab a quick bite.The place is casual dining with 20 or so tables.  You order at the counter and they call your name when your Sub is ready.  After browsing the menu decided on an Italian Sub (Italian Sub - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone Cheese and Italian Dressing sprinkled with Italian Seasonings) $5.59.....with a bag of Chips and a bottle of Water.  Total damage $8.42.The girl who took my order was very new and took a while to take the order, but she had a huge smile on her face and was very friendly.....how could I not like this place so far?There were a lot of employees working/getting trained.  My food took around 15 minutes to be prepared.....an employee apologized to me and told me they made my Sandwich wrong the first time, so they had to make a second one.  A) I'm impressed that they cared enough to make it right...some places won't.  B) I'm impressed that an employee cared enough to come and tell me about it rather than have me wait around wondering what happened.After I finally got my Sandwich, I took a few pics and couldn't wait to dive in.....it looked soo good.  After I took my 1st bite, I fell in love with it.....the combination of Meat, melted Cheese, and Italian Dressing/Seasoning made this Sub taste so good with the toasted Italian Roll.  The Jalapeno Chips went well with the Sandwich too.Despite the hiccups because of the new employees, it was a great experience.  They've only been open 3 days and I really like the attitude of the employees.  I hope they make it.Will I return?  You can bet on it!Couldn't resist coming back here to try more of their Subs.  Last visit, I got an Italian Sub.  This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!As I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!Of course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.I devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.Will I return?  I'm already thinking about it!Firstly, customer service was most definitely a 5-star rating!WHERE: Tenaya & Lake Mead, right next to Rubio's!WHY: To get your sandwich fix on =DWHAT: As you park and walk to the entrance, it really looks like a firehouse!! (Or, I actually didn't know if half of the building was actually under construction, HAHA). There were also about 10 or more specialty sandwiches, with a million different types of hot sauces! I really thought that was creative!! You are allowed to get up and choose one, either out of curiosity or to ADD A LITTLE FLARE to your sandwich!I had the Firehouse meatball sub because I absolutely love different meats and meatballs in my subs!! I also asked to add lettuce and tomato on top, which made it a little more sub-like! I was surely pleased with my sandwich and ate it all there! =DThey also had a signature fountain drink!! It was the firehouse cherry limeade, and of course I had to try it out!! It was a little on the sweet side, but it was okay.SERVICE:  There was one worker named Melanie, who gave absolutely great service!! If you're ever there, give her a shout out for me! She was really helpful with helping me pick out the right sandwich for me, and brought our sandwiches over to our table. She also said, "when you come back and eat inside, they should always bring the sandwiches over to you, otherwise don't be scared to let them know!" YOU GO GIRL! Haha, so kudos x10 to her!!*NOTE: The combo, which included a large drink, sub, and chips of your choice was just under 10 bucks!!
Bueno Burger Mex American Grill=The food is still decent but this place is going downhill fast. Today is my 5th visit in the 6 months since they opened and the place is in disrepair, literally! There is scaffolding in the middle of the dining area holding up a broken roof truss. They had most tables full but the rest had discarded foodservice items piled on them and there were fries and soda all over the floor by the tables.  The soda counter was filthy and a sticky mess and I truly felt bad for the elderly couple I saw clean their own table off when they realized none of the staff would. I really want this place and other small local restaurants to survive, but I don't think I'll risk being crushed by falling roof beams for the food again.**Update, got a message from Vanessa, who says she is one of the owners*** She expressed concern about the cleanliness, and commented that the scaffolding was temporary while the sort things out with a contractor. What upsets me, and made me add this update is the comment she made to me about not appreciating my review (which was written from my actual experience). Sorry business owners, if you can't take candor from your patrons on a public forum, you're in the wrong business. A negative review hurts your business less than allowing the negative experience that spurned the review in the first place!Also, the part about being crushed by a falling roof beams was intended as humor, not an actual expression of fear of injury. I know nobody would be dumb enough in our litigious society to allow people in an unsafe facility.Bueno Burger is doing some great advertising lately, taking full advantage of ValPack, etc to get the word out about their neat concept of mesquite grilled burgers and dogs,but if you live anywhere nearby, the scent of the burning wood alone has already piqued your attention.Sometimes it's possible to create expectations that are tough to live up to.  The air smelled great, but the burger itself just didn't seem to hang onto all of the flavor generated by the smoke while grilling.  It wasn't anything that was bad about it, but it just wasn't as exciting as i wanted it to be.I enjoyed it enough that i know i'll take advantage of a coupon and give it another go.
Millie's Cafe=Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it.It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).Here are some highlights if you're not familiar:Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dipPasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better)Amarillos... sweet fried bananaArroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beansand last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in)Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally. "Bottom" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!Fantastic food, friendly owners, a new favorite.I'll admit up front that I'm a huge fan of Caribbean food--anything with plantains in it automatically gets points in my book. I had been wanting to check out this place for a while, and now that I finally have, I'll be sure to make it back here regularly.This is a little place in an otherwise unremarkable strip mall on Main St. I believe there are only 3 tables inside this place, so there were a number of people who took their orders to go while I was in the restaurant. I think I heard one person say that he had driven from the other side of the Valley for the food, so I was pretty sure that I was in for something good. There are a bunch of pictures inside of Puerto Rico, as well as a number of little souvenir-type trinkets for sale. It's all enough to make me want to visit the island, especially when combined with the delicious food.There were a number of daily specials, sandwiches, and other items to order. As I was trying to decide, I saw a newspaper article on the countertop about the Jibarito sandwich. As soon as I saw that it used tostones (fried plantains) as the "bread", I knew what I was getting. The people with me got the pernil with arroz con gandules and the chicken with arroz con gandules. We also ordered sides of tostones and amarillos (a more dessert-like version of plantains) to share before our entrees. My nephews also each got a mango juice.The person taking our order--who I assume to be the owner of the place--was very friendly and helpful throughout. They definitely know what they're doing here, food-wise.So back to the food: My Jibarito was amazing! The tostones as bread contained some delicious pork and nice complementary items. I tried it with some of the hot sauce made in store as well as the garlic dip served with the tostones, and it was even better that way. This really is a good sandwich! It's not huge, so if you have a big appetite (like I do), some other food may be necessary to satiate your hunger.I'm writing an entirely separate paragraph for the garlic dip that comes with the tostones. This stuff is amazing! It's really a simple dip, I'm sure, and you have to be comfortable with the people you're around for the rest of the day after eating it, but it is delicious! There is a nice little spiciness to it, and it goes great on the tostones and the Jibarito sandwich. I'm sure it goes great on a number of other things as well, but I only had so much to use. Great stuff!Both the pernil and the chicken were done really well--great flavor and tenderness. The arroz con gandules was really great, especially with some of that hot sauce poured onto it. Speaking of the hot sauce, it's a very liquidy mixture that is very different from any hot sauce I've previously had. I'm not sure exactly what was in it other than a bunch of little chilies which seemed to have been pickling in the liquids. Whatever it is, it's a great accompanying flavor. Both of these dishes come in pretty substantial serving sizes.The tostones and amarillos were both done perfectly. The tostones were hot and crispy, while the amarillos were hot and sweet. Seriously, I could survive solely on variations of plantains. Finally, the mango juice was excellent. It's made fresh in the store with pulp, according to the guy helping us, and it smells and tastes like it's fresh. It's really like liquid, ripe mango.I'm really satisfied with my visit. This place turns out delicious food, provides great service, and does it all at a really reasonable price. For 5 of us, it was around $45, juices and appetizers included. I'll be back!
Garage Wine and Tap=Bleh. I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.Lovely bar in North Phoenix. I was going to say 'little' but it is actually deceptively enormous, going back a long way inside. Very friendly staff and good atmosphere, but not too many vegetarian options. My friend Sage dragged me over here for dinner, so I had to try it. I now live in the north side of town, so this place is convenient. I ordered the grilled Harvarti sandwich paired with Tomato basil soup. The sandwich was good, but I think the soup was warmed in the microwave because the bowl was too hot. The decor is kinda cool though, colorful lighted tires and bar paraphernalia that I am simply not expert enough to do justice to in my description. Parking is not easy, but if you drink you really shouldn't drive.I came here for dinner with a friend the other night, it was our first time here so of course we're excited. =)So we started with the garage fries. Let me just say these are probably some of the best fries that I've ever had. They came with this chipotle dipping sauce which was amazing. I almost felt like I enjoyed these fries more than my meal. For my entree I got the garage burger. I didn't feel like it was anything special. I've definitely had better burgers. I got sweet potato fries but the garage fries are wayyyyy better. They have a cute little outdoor patio that you can sit at and enjoy the amazing weather right now. As far as customer service, it was extremely slow and disappointing. We had no silverware when we sat down, when we asked for some, for some strange reason the waitress only brought one set for my friend. Not sure if we were supposed to share it or what. Everything was pretty pricey as well. I probably won't come back during dinner but will definitely be coming back for happy hour to enjoy their fries and wine.  =)
Rosati's Pizza=Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.This place has okay food but needs a lot of work in the customer service and time management department. I experienced several issues during my visit. The server took forever to bring our order out from the appetizer to the main meal. They were not bust at all so I don't know what her issue was. I had mozzarella sticks that were delicious even though they were only brought out because I reminded our server about them. The pizza I had was good too and like the sticks took forever to be ready. I know deep dish pizzas can take 45 min to an hour but this went beyond that. Inside the seating was cramped. I'd order from here again but likely it would be a phone order for pick up since I did mostly enjoy the food. I sure didn't like the service I received on the other hand.
Sharp Edge=I like this location is much better than the Friendship one for many different reasons.  Same beers, but totally different vibe!  The Beer Emporium is more of a bar kinda bar.  Bar food, bar atmosphere.  This Bistro location has a better variety and I think better tasting food.  Plus the atmosphere is a lot more inviting.  Couches in the front to relax at, nice sized bar and clean restaurant area.  Hence the Bistro title!I love their Dried Cherry Almond Chicken Salad Platter and Grilled Portobello Panini.  Of course for the tasty and indulgy choice I go for the buffalo bites aka wings.  The menu here has much more to offer than the Emporium does!I always love a good deal for Happy Hour, so thank gawd they have half off Belgian Beers.  If you love to indulge in the beers but think, like me, that they're too gosh darn expensive regularly, you can take advantage of the half off!  It may mean that framboise you lust after could be yours for $5!Last time husband and I were in Pittsburgh, we made a point of visiting Sharp Edge Beer Emporium.  We're Belgian-brew-heads.  We love a run down neighborhood watering hole.  It just made sense.  This visit, while walking from our hotel to The Strip, we happened to stumble serendipitously on Sharp Edge Bistro on Penn.  SEBoP is SEBE's more sophisticated big sister.  Me like.Leather couches, marble bar, polished wood, blah blah blah.  What you really need to know is: 36 taps of Belgian beer, plus hundreds of others in bottles.  Corsendonk, Leffe, Kasteel, Gulden Draak.  Anything your Belgian-swilling heart desires.  And during Happy Hour, EVERY BELGIAN DRAUGHT IS HALF PRICE.  Snag a seat on the small patio on Penn for prime people watching along with your brew.  Some folks were eating food, so I suppose there's always that if that's your thing.  Me, I'll fill the belly with Belgians.I stopped by Sharp Edge with CM for a drink after seeing the PGH Ballet Theater's performance of Beauty and the Beast last Thurs. evening.  I'm not really a beer drinker, but I'd been to the Friendship location for happy hour with my former lab two years ago and tried the raspberry Framboise and enjoyed it, so I figured I'd see what this location has to offer.When I arrived (at around 10:00pm), it was pretty empty, with only one or two other tables occupied.  I ordered the peche (peach) framboise ($8.50) and the Mediterranean nachos ($11.50) to share with my dining partner.  CM didn't order anything to drink himself due to having to drive afterward, but I can't help but wonder if it may have also been due to the steep prices.  (In a similar vein, I wonder if this is why it was so empty at the time that we came.)Both the beer and the nachos were pretty good, if overpriced. If you're a non-beer drinker or don't like hoppy beers, I'd recommend trying a Framboise, since they're more similar to a cider than a beer, due to the fruitiness.  The nachos were an interesting take on the dish, consisting of fried pita bread topped with hummus, asiago cheese, and tomatoes and back olives. I wish they had been a bit more flavorful, given the ingredients, however.Although I enjoyed the drink and snacks, the sticker shock of the price will probably prevent me from returning again, except for during happy hour.  I suspect the reviewer who said that they depend on conference attendees from the convention center across the street for revenue was on the money (literally). 3.5 stars.
Relish Burger Bistro=Two words: happy hour. It's every day from 3-6 PM and they have some amazing deals! You can get one of their delicious burger sliders for just $3 a slider. You can order their BBQ Chicken Nachos for about $6. Everything is very inexpensive during happy hour and everything is simply sublime! The menu here is pricey when it's not happy hour though, so be prepared to spend $16 on a burger if you miss happy hour! I like the atmosphere at Relish because it has a "man room" feel to it. The furniture is dark and comfortable, the windows overlook the beautiful Phoenician golf course and they have several flat screen TVs and a fire place. It's a great place to sit and relax. Now let's talk more depth about the food. I wish I could eat a million of their burgers! I don't know what they do to them but the burgers are extremely juicy, with this flavorful special sauce and placed on a soft bun. My second favorite dish would be the BBQ Chicken Nachos. The happy hour portion is smaller but still provides a decent amount of food! The BBQ sauce and chicken compliments the cheesy nachos and makes for a hearty dish!
Jimmy John's=If you asked me to name all of the things I missed about Illinois, I might need two hands, but I'd have a few fingers left over.  Jimmy John's, however, would be one of those things I missed.The employees are great- They're fast, they've got personality, and always have a smile on their face.They make the bread fresh in the store; sometimes when they hand you your sandwich, and the bread is still warm from the oven?  That's the greatest.Just hold the mayo (not a mayo fan)!Yes, I love Jimmy John's.  I've been to this location 3 times now.  Every time I go, I say to myself I will try something different....but, I always go with my favorite #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.50) w/Hot Peppers.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2UQESr5pUBW5hHf6Y0XCIQ?select=KshAeD8SKcWvNRdgFxMjiAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2UQESr5pUBW5hHf6Y0XCIQ?select=WFtxcGoKOzoCR4YFA5yNbAAs usual, they have the Sandwich ready before you can blink.  The Sandwiches at this location are just as good as the other.....it's a very consistent chain and the Sammies are great!Return Factor - 100%I found another Jimmy John's in the area.....I'm addicted to their Subs....sooo good.  Of course, I order my usual #9 Italian Club w/Hot Peppers, $5.50.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=ym9uaNFNqiVqdTUFGht8swhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=cnXDJkcZ2-4ikvr3W-lHOQThis place is as fast and consistent with the quality of their Sandwiches as any other location.  I like how it's right off the 101 and Raintree, very easy to get to.  I'll be back soon.Return Factor - 90%
Sugar Shack Sports Grill=I've been going to the Sugar Shack on 5th for about 3 months now to get my Steelers fix.  Yes, I said it, Loud & Clear - I am a Steelers Fan ! ! !   The Sugar Shack reminds of a few bars in the 'Burgh.  It is a Steelers bar and a Cardinals bar!  ?*$%@  how is that possible?  St. Louis Cardinals - think baseball...  Anyway, this place has the mandatory bar cuisine, burgers, French fries, etc.  The beers are reliable, not too diverse.  The Steelers Fans are here though!  If you are in the Scottsdale area and not up for drive to Harold's in Cave Creek, the Sugar Shack is a throw-back to real-deal, the Iron Curtain!
European Bakery and Cafe=I must say that this is a 5 star combination of those things that make an establishment deserve the coveted 5th star~Excellent, Friendly Customer Service Fresh, High Quality Ingredientsand Superb Quality ControlThe Pastrami is DELICIOUS here!The fresh $2.99 loaves are huge!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  Mmm, Bread.  }^ )Ok I agree that the owner(s) may be quirky.  Adds to the charm of the place as far as I am concerned.  I went there on Wednesday only to discover they don't open until 10 am.  Thought that was kinda weird for a bakery. Went back the next day @ 4 and there wasn't alot left but what was there looked fab.Let me explain I am not a fan of most european bakeries sweets because they are well......... just too sweet.  I do love the breads and the pretzels.  I also love a good plain coffee roll, strudel, ect.  Not sweet but more on the flakey flavorful side of things.   So while I skipped the eclairs, kreme horns, ect I did try a coffee roll and a french baquette. Let me say that it is the BEST french baquette I have had since I was in Europe.  Hands down.  The coffee roll was my breakfast the next morning and frankly I almost went right than to buy more of them.Yummo! To top it off, the elderly lady in front of me ordered a loaf of sliced bread and then discovered she didn't have any cash or her check book and was embarrased to tears.  The owner GAVE her the bread.  Some might say 'big deal it was only 3 bucks" to which I say YES it is a big deal.   Kindness is always a big deal to me.  I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food.Seriously one of the best subs you will ever eat. 1. Fresh baked bread2. perfect selection of hand picked meats and cheeses3. Quality toppings, sauces etc. 4. Bang for your buck. HUGE subs.5. Try the sweets!
San Francisco Sourdough Eatery=I was a little nervous to walk into this place because I know it is new and in an awkward area, but hopefully through the power of Yelp, it will pick-up and business will boom at this well deserving place. I was nervous because I expected to walk in to an eager set of a sandwich maker's eyes ready to over serve me and hear the obnoxious & awkward humming of the industrial refrigerator. Oh, how I was so wrong. They had a large staff already making sandwiches for a possible pick-up order and I was greeted with a welcoming crew. They left me alone to decide on my decisions;) and I chose a number 15 (turkey and lean pastrami)... regular size. My order was taken and I sat down in the neatly and cleanly decorated place.. very quick... and hand delivered... I got it to go so I could indulge and analyze this sandwich in my own private surroundings.. OH MANN. The bread on this thing (yeah, its called the SOURDOUGH eatery, but how often do titles back-up what they represent???) was incredible. It is a mild sourdough with the perfect amount of crustiness backed up by its light, airy, all the while perfectly dense breadiness! Then comes the mayo (which they make themselves with peppers in the mix), the Dijon, purple onion, sliced tomato, shredded lettuce.... then the meats. There is NO skimping out on the meat here. Perfectly layered with an incredibly generous portion. The turkey was delicious and the pastrami had just enough saltiness. Every flavor and texture stood out from its own while combing with each other in a beautiful harmony!!! Should food sound like a poem or a song?? Uhmm.... YES. and Sourdough eatery does this! The Regular size filled me to the brim at just $5.99 and next time I will be getting the Half sandwich.. I also can't wait to come back for a breakfast sandwich of theirs which they had for $1.99. I'm glad I went out of my "comfort level" to come to try this place out... a true Henderson treasure.Something is now SERIOUSLY amiss at SFSE. I was able to stop in on Wednesday, 5/2 and the first thing I noticed is the Illy coffee is gone. And I didn't see the super cool owners I saw last time. I ordered a Garlic Pesto sandwich and told them I wanted light mayo and mustard. What I got looked like a French's mustard bottle and a container of Kraft mayo had a love child together and it was not pretty. And it tasted like, well, we won't push Yelp's community standards for writing a review and you can just let your imagination fill in the blank. After skimming the reviews it appears ownership has changed and the focus may have shifted from quality of product to quantity of cash in the till. Which is a shame as what they had going on here was something pretty special. Now it's not even worth taking the time to exit I-215 to drive two blocks South to go to it. Tack on the stupid payment card policy (see my list description), pathetic fountain drinks that make me want to call Coke and complain directly, and a glare when I used the Yelp check in deal for free chips and a drink and I'm giving 1 star under protest.EDIT: There's been some new 5 star reviews posted for SFSE by people with no previous posts. That could be legit,  or it could be suspicious. I'm felt it was worth mentioning as this sort of thing can be people trying to counter bad reviews by gaming the system so to speak. Again that may not be happening here but it warrants keeping a close eye on it.
Pacific Seafood Buffet=Ate there YesterdayFood  was  average Sushi was Ok.    Waited a long time for crab leg.  Over an hour They were tiny for a 16 dollars buffetGood variety but  all tasted mediocre Lots of dirty plates.  Told the girl at the fruit bar, and she came out with a towel to clean it  right at the buffet table.  Donno why she did not take it back to the washing machine .   I took a pic tooGreat wall taste better and shan hai tooI'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress (while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant) recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet.  She was the BEST waitress we've had in a super long time and extremely honest with us when we asked her where she eats seafood and she said, "Pacific ~ but please don't tell anyone"..  If you're looking for a great Asian style seafood buffet, this place is it! It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas, but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ!I actually like this buffet better than the Rio.  It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price.  Albeit the decor isn't as nice, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, and we don't have to go all the way to Las Vegas to eat at a great seafood buffet ~ it's in our own back yard!This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a generous and decent sashimi/sushi bar. For dinner and lunch you'll find a huge selection of freshly cooked food to choose from like snow crab, sea bass, mussels, oysters, many different kinds of shrimp, Peking duck, escargot and so much more.Since this place is still fairly new, you don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.This is a great place to go when we are thinking about eating seafood, sushi and/or Chinese. I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 stars, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star.Bordering on 3.5.  It's all you can eat sushi and seafood for $16.The sushi was bland and dry.  The crab legs and cocktail shrimp were the best things here. They also have fried crab, fried shrimp, scallop on the shell, cooked salmon/white fish, bbq pork, short ribs, roasted duck, sausage, Korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and grilled octopus.For dessert, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies -- all mediocre. This place is fine for the price and selection, but I doubt you're coming here for quality.  Next time, spandex pants.
Tapas Papa Frita=Decent if you're jonesing for tapas. (This is not a paella review. Yet.) I apologize in  advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and PR firms cringe. I know you can't do authentic tapas in Southbridge/Waterfront and stay open. But I have to rate it honestly, or not at all.I remember the original TPF on Camelback, I think where Sportsmans or Tarbell's is now. I recall it being exotic and delicious, with the right intimate atmosphere. My memory could be clouded by lack of experience at the time. But overall, *this* place is a little too big, clean and corporatey to match an authentic tapas experience like you'd get in Barcelona, or Basque Spain, or some of the real deal places like in NYC. I don't think you can be located where they are and pull that off. So it's dumbed down a bit for the market. I think if you're not on the search for a super authentic, intimate experience (small bar, communal tables, etc) it will fit the bill.ATMOSPHEREBig, open, lively and trying a little too hard, IMHO. The uniforms look like Halloween costumes. It comes off a bit too kitschy. Staff all seemed pretty friendly, if a little harried. The live music is a nice touch, even though pretty low energy when we were there. I'm anxious to catch some Flamenco though.SERVICEOur server, Timo, was the epitome of charm and enthusiasm. Big thumbs up for him. But timing was all over the place. First round of drinks took  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. We saw other tables clearly looking around for their servers. Not sure if the bar is the hold-up or what. Food took much longer than expected as well, since we didn't order paella or anything that was likely made to order. Once the food started coming, we got it all pretty quickly.DRINKSMan. Do not order the mojitos. I admit I'm pretty picky about them. I love making them at home. I want them muddled fresh and I want to taste all the ingredients. They have a "pitcher approach". It's like they have mojitos on tap. I asked for a fresh mojito, not a whole pitcher. I just wanted to try their mojito, and then move on to an Albari√±o or some other wine. I got the pitcher anyway. And what came out was refreshing alright. Much like ice water is refreshing. Basically clear liquid with some rum aftertaste. No detectable lime. One sad little shred of mint in each pour. Very little sugar. The pitcher approach works well for sangria, obviously. But do not do this for mojitos. Doesn't do them justice. My wife's red wine choice (a pintoresco by the glass) was very good. A friend who tracked us down there after a Yelp check-in said the sangria was very good. So there you go.FOODI'll point out the stand-outs:BoqueronesFresh white anchovies in light oil. Delicious. Smaller than I've had elsewhere. A little more body to the fillet is nice. But a great light dish.Rabbit StewThis one gets you bang for the buck, if you're not averse to eating cute little bunny rabbits. Lots of tender delicious sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it. Bone-in meat ensured lots of flavor.Shrimp a la Plancha (or whatever they called it)Head-on, shell-on shrimp. Messy to eat unless you crunch the whole shell. Not quite crispy enough to allow for that though. So mostly we peeled them. Quality white shrimp with real shrimp flavor. Not the rubber you so often get with grilled shrimp.Oxtail StewThis should be so up my alley. Classic mirepoix dark stew flavor. Did I detect a little store-bought demi-glace starter? But it could have been braised a bit longer. Like a couple more hours. There was still too much un-rendered fat and connective stuff; not enough meat.Basque SausageNot memorable. If you've ever gotten the Spanish Chorizo from Schreiner's, or LaTienda.com, you'll know what I wish it was like. When we get the Schreiner's, it never makes it through the car ride home.Mix of Snails, Sausage and something elseDidn't do it for us. No individual character to each of the proteins. Just a mash-up of savory chewy bits. Be a pretty good starter bread dip if you were hungry, but not a great dish.Pan con Tomate (pan boli?)For me, this is a benchmark item. This would have been better if the bread had more chewiness and structure to it.And of course they have all the stand-bys like Potatas Bravas, Fried Squid, etc. And Paella. Next time, I'm trying the Valenciana for sure. That alone could add a star if the flavors are there. But there better be smokiness, bone-in dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispy on the bottom of the pan.So, just A-OK for now.I could see an updated 4 star review once... a) I've further explored the menu and know what all the gems are, and learn what to avoid, for my taste. b) they fine-tune the service and hopefully work on the authenticity. the crowd that was there and the location don't give me much hope for tuning toward the more authentic. if anything, i fear it being dumbed down even more.OK, realllllly did not want to write a poor review of this place.  I even thought about it for week before I did, but they have done themselves in here! My honey and I went last Saturday for "happy hour".  I love tapas and haven't been able to find a great spot since Sol y Sombra shut down, so we thought we would give them a try.  It was a beautiful evening, and they offer a 2-4-1 happy hour on the patio or in the bar.    So we spent two hours enjoying their delicious tapas, wine, sangria, and even dessert and coffee.  Food and drink were both amazing, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Sadly, thats as glowing as this review is gonna get because they have royally pissed me off.  Where they really went wrong was with what happened after.  So we got our "happy hour" tab, signed the receipt, and left.  I have to admit this was partially my fault because I tend to sign credit card slips with reckless abandon and utter disregard for the total(denial is not just a river in Egypt people), which was in this case, $93 plus a $20 tip.  So we get home, still talking about how delicious everything was, and I casually throw the receipt on the counter.  The sangria has now worn off.... $93? For happy hour? Yikes.  So apparently our server neglected to price our drinks out at happy hour pricing.  And the servings had been pretty small, even for tapas, certainly not the double portions that are supposed to arrive between 5 and 7.  So I called the restaurant immediately.  Having worked in restaurants before, I usually pick my battles, but since we had gone for happy hour intentionally based on what we read on Yelp, this called for attention.  SO I called the restaurant right away, and was apologized to profusely. Yes, I was correct, we had not received the happy hour portions that we should have ( which was probably why we ordered so many tapas) and we were charged double what we should have been for our drinks.  The sweet guy on the phone informed me that there was no manager available as it was a busy time on Saturday night, but that they would certainly make this right, and a manager would call me tomorrow.  Seemed reasonable so I gave them my number and waited.  Sunday, no call.  So Monday I called and left another messgae. Tuesday, still no call.  So I emailed them.   So a week later, no call, no email, nothing.  Like I said, I really don't want to give these guys a bad write up, but this is just about the worst customer service I have encoutered in a while. I personally will not return, despite a craving for their crab stuffed peppers.  If you want to chance it, go ahead, you will have a great time but will certainly pay for it!  It's really a shame because stuff like this is why otherwise great places seem to cycle in and out of this area way to fast.I arrived expecting a great night here but due to the horrible Sangria and Paella, mediocre tapas, and lousy service, I left extremely disappointed. I have walked by this place a few times before and seeing all the people on the patio enjoying the beautiful sunset and listing to the Flamenco music, it just seemed like a cool place. Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and so although the patio was complete empty when we arrived, we were told by the host (owner?) in a very condecending way that all the tables on the patio were reserved and so we would have to be seated inside. That dampened my spirits a little but I was still anticipating an enjoyable evening with my hubby and some good food. To start off, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share and some soup. Sangria arrived first in a surprisingly small pitcher. I could not believe that small pitcher was $22!  It turned out to be a good thing since it was so bad, neither one of us wanted to drink it. It was by far the worst Sangria I have ever had. It tasted like it was 1/2 cheap red wine and 1/2 club soda. Not sweet, not fruity. Instead of bright refreshing slices of citrus and other fruits there were a few bits of orange rind and a couple of pieces of some other fruit that had been diced so small it was unrecognizable. I ordered the gazpacho which was pretty good although I prefer it chunky rather than pureed and my husband got the seafood stew. That had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was very overcooked. We decided not to order any tapas with seafood in them after seeing the quality that was in the soup. We selected three Tapas to start with: the beef tenderloin, the leek tart, and the potato tortilla. The beef was pretty good, nothing special about it but it had a good flavor. The leek tart was not so great but the sauce it came with was delicious and we mopped it up with the bread in the bread basket. The tortilla was disappointing. To me this is the quintessential tapa dish so I was expecting it to be great but it was rubbery and tasteless as if it had been prepared hours earlier and then reheated. We had intended to start with only 3 tapas since we had already had the soup and told our waiter that we reserved the right to order more. He pressured us into ordering some paella as well so we did. Now I absolutely love paella, it is truly one of my favorite dishes on earth but since other Yelp reviewers had said to stay away from it I ordered it with some misgivings. The paella arrived about 20 minutes after we had finished the rest of our meal. Our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepare but I was not expecting it to take that long. As soon as we tried it, I realized that it was not worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned it was way too watery and very bland tasting. In addition, the vegetables tasted like they came from a bag in the freezer section. And the seafood was the same rubbery stuff that was in the soup. The rings of calamari were so tough, you could not cut them with a fork, I had to use a serrated knife. The shrimp had lost all of its sweet flavor and was just as tough. The entire dish was so awful that we didn't even finish it. So, they were already down two stars for the horrible Sangria and Paella... Also while waiting for the Paella, I visited the ladies room which although beautifully decorated was filthy. Dirty restaurant bathrooms are a personal pet-peeve of mine so that had knocked them down a star as well. Also, the cheesy outfits the servers wear and the overall poor service (we were brought the wrong dishes initially and had to ask repeatedly for plates since we were sharing) had knocked them down another star. The final straw was that as we were leaving I counted four empty tables on the patio that we could have been seated at.  Overall, just a horrible experience.  I strongly recommend staying away from this place.A few of us stopped by here after work for a little food and drink.  We went buck-crazy and ordered a ton of Tapas.  Here's what we ordered:Patatas Bravas ~ Spicy Potato wedges (Burgos) $4.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=DV0lG3c-DobjZ-UM8BEDcAChorizo ~ Red Pepper Sausage (Rioja) $5.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=-tlRkoU8fGBUo5bVD3Qj3wTigres ~ Steamed Mussels in a spicy Hot Sauce (Basque) $7.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=E8OEfJMGBtMyKtoSXpIJjwRabas ~ Tender Calamari Rings, club soda batter (Basque) $6.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=RiaeNcPUtildRkOQqeA59wAlmondigas con Tomate ~ Spanish Meatballs in a roasted Tomato Sauce (Murcia) $6.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=8qlVvEGJxw-6QemgDHVfmwCroquetas de Jamon y Queso ~ Ham and Cheese Croquettes (New Castille) $5.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=FeupOhh6i0_GnWGhIZHlowRabo de Buey ~ Oven roasted Ox Tail with Carrots, Roasted Peppers, and Tempranillo Wine Sauce (Basque) $19.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=PbyX24hx_F7Sb7Ad3WBMWAChuletilla de Cordero ~ Open flame-broiled Lamb Chops with Herbs (Old Castile) $10.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=oZmbtFxxvewV23e-9V2KoQGambas al Pil-Pil ~ Saut√©ed Gulf Shrimp, Garlic, Guindilla Pepper, White Wine (Andaluc√≠a) $8.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=RXyMMgvjf8e2wYkILDXmlgCordero Burgales ~ Lamb Ossobucco, castille style (Castilla la vieja) $24.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ?select=gSq_8nXnfonJmDa5u5mj9wWe grubbed and drank Wine all night long.  What a great after-work dinner!  Good thing I didn't pick up the bill that night!Return Factor - 100%This place has the slowest service ever. I can't actually review on many plates because we saw our server maybe 2x. We couldn't even get the check from him and had to rely on the hostess and a bus girl to help get us the check, take our creditCard and return it to us so we could sign it.   We had the tuna, lamb, asparagus and we would rate them all as ok. They could've used a drink to wash them down with.One of the best meals I've had ... with the *worst* service. Quite possible in my life. (Attributed to the rudeness factor of Dino, our perpetually annoyed server.)This is a beautiful restaurant, with sky high ceilings, offering dignified dining in Old Town Scottsdale. The patio space reminded me of a street in Europe. The food is exquisite. In a heat beat I'd recommend every morsel that touched my lips.- Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine) - Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo (peppers stuffed with crab) - Patatas Aioli Verde (potatoes, cilantro, ham)- Pastel a la Porrusalda (leek tarte) - Boquerones (anchovies in garlic)I was "eh" on the flan. (Very eggy. Too much air involved.)I had been very curious to sample the fare as this place is across from The Herb Box. With International Supper Club UYE here I gleefully perfused the menu. (Thank you very much for organizing Ursula!)I'll probably never visit this restaurant again. EVEN THOUGH the food was spectacular. EVEN THOUGH the decor was wonderful. EVEN THOUGH they have live flamenco music and a happy hour.Note: They would prefer if the check wasn't split. (Even for parties of five.) Come prepared to share wine menus. There appears to be an inexplicable shortage of these.Pls forgive short-hand use; Review would be too long, otherwise.SERVICE: Reserved through OpenTable wks ago.  Checked in w/ host & she told me about a great spot for us where friend & I could hear each other talk & where one of us would have a view of the stage, & told her I appreciated the gesture, but could we both see the show?  She sat me @ a table across the stage & two-steps from the bar.  A great spot, 'til I noticed servers & busboys entering & exiting behind me (front patio dining area).  Soon got used to the clatter, but what eventually annoyed us was that people would block the stage view on their way & back from the kitchen!  (Restrooms were next to kitchen, too.)  It would behoove managers/owners to move the stage to somewhere with less foot traffic.Was here months ago w/ a group (Irene V. incl.) so knew service could be rude.  Hoped tonight would be better.  Denzel came to greet me & asked if I was going to wait for my friend, or would I like to order anything to drink?  Told him I was going to do the Restaurant Week menu ($44 pp excluding tax & gratuity) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapas-papa-frita-scottsdale#SPCe2DEC5YvywwjqA1h1jQ & asked to confirm that it came w/ a beverage (glass of Spanish Moscatel), & he immediately became excitable, w/ hand gestures, leaned in & said that it was an after-dinner drink that would arrive w/ dessert.  This was when I noticed he had bad breath.  (If you're in an industry where you have to interact w/ guests in person, you better have ways to keep your breath fresh, yes?)  Friend arrived & soon after, Denzel appeared again.  Already had an idea what to order, but she didn't, so we asked if he could come back in a few.  He came back after 15 minutes & friend proceeded to choose an app & a dessert to be brought together & was looking for one more item she'd spotted online, & while she was searching, he seemed like he was getting impatient, so I said "How about I place my order while she looks?" ("Good idea" said friend), & Denzel didn't seem to like this for he made a "whatever" gesture w/ his hands.  Had previously confirmed w/ him that I could sub out allergenic appetizers (1st course came w/ five items- shrimp, mushroom, beef tenderloin, rosemary goat cheese-stuffed date wrapped in bacon, & crab-stuffed piquillo pepper) for something else, so I told him I'd go for a 2nd stuffed date & the potato wedges he suggested.  I then asked for the pork tenderloin entree & chocolate churros for dessert.  My friend couldn't find what she wanted, so ordered a second dessert- banana-apple bread pudding.LIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Classical Spanish guitarist already playing onstage @ 6:50p.  Very petite female dancer was a joy to watch (dramatic arm posturings, spins, tap-dancing & rhythmic stomping), but when it came to her partner's time to dance, while entertaining & footwork impressive, he was @ least two & a half times heavier than her, which meant his footwork taps & stomps were many times louder than hers.  My ears hurt every time he did his solos.  Take note & bring your earplugs if you want to keep your hearing intact!FOOD: Didn't think I ate well for $44 plus tax.  Initially was going to order coffee w/ dessert after persuading Denzel to serve the Moscatel first & coffee w/ dessert, but he didn't come back to take my coffee order ($4-$9) & indeed forgot to place my churros order.  Friend's bread pudding arrived long before my dessert did, & my dessert was given to me by head chef who said that w/ the advent of the dropped plates of food in front of our table, our server didn't know I wanted churros (??).  Of all the 4 different apps, I liked the stuffed pepper & dates best.  The spicy potato wedges were good & the beef skewer was the worst- bland and unappetizing texture.  Puff pastry-wrapped pork entree was delicious, the meat tender, & the rice so fluffy & soft- almost like risotto w/ the saffron & cuttlefish sauces.  Churros weren't good.  Bit dry, heavy w/ sugar, came w/ a caramel filling, & minimal chocolate.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL, so even good food can't make things right for me.  My friend enjoyed her 2 stuffed piquillos & Catalan creme br√ªl√©e.  Tasty bread pudding arrived cold, w/ ice cream, so that was a disappointment, since we expected hot pudding.We asked for boxes to take our desserts home, & Denzel arrived w/ what appeared to be a bowl & a lid & placed them in front of her.  When I tried to stop him from leaving so as to avoid  flagging him over for another bowl & lid, he made exaggerated motions of separating the bowls & lids & placing them in front of friend & me.  Friend had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing!  Why didn't he do this in the first place?  Ugh.Stay away from here if you value service!Well nothing takes you back to Spain like getting on an aeroplane and flying there when the finances are right. But here in Phoenix, if you can settle for watered down sangria for $8 a glass, no bullfight, and no cigarette smoke then dining at Tapas Papa Frita is recommended. On weekends you can enjoy entertainment with dinner.The menu is large and heavy and of a reddish background color, so it was a bit annoying to read through. But of course being from the Yelp community I pre-read it online and already had an idea of what I would get. Go figure I was asking everybody else if they were ready to order yet.Other reviewers have complained about the lack of service. That wasn't my experience. In fact I feel like we were over served. I had to give our waitress the evil eye for popping over every two seconds while we perused the menu. And at meals end she insisted on taking our leftovers to wrap them herself instead of bringing containers to the table.There were several selections of vegetarian tapas. Few were vegan, some prepared with cheese or type of crema, one had ham (which I'm unsure why it would be listed in the vegetable section). Having tapas is kind of like building your own tasting menu, and we didn't hold back. Here are the uniquely tasty morsels we tried. 1. Pastel a la Porrusalda: Leek tart in a pastry - 6.50Liked it, but the dough was a bit chewy2. Champi√±ones al Jerez: Braised mushrooms with garlic and sherry - 6.50Liked it, but not too flavorful3. Pimientos a la Riojana: roasted peppers with olive oil - 7.50Liked.4. Patatas Bravas: Spicy red potato wedges - 4.95 Liked them, but they had crema on top and were not spicy at all.5. Tortilla de Patatas: Spanish potato pie - 4.50Liked, but it was dry.6. Escalivalda: Peppers, onions, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic over bread - 7.00 The veggies were good, but had a tangy taste.Did not like the bread, it was hard and not garlicky.7. Cabrales con Menbrillo: Cabrales cheese with quince - 9.00So-so8. Setas con Queso De Cabra: Stuffed portabello with goat cheese - 9.00Recommended by the waitress. Liked it, but it was too small. I expected a burger sized mushroom, but it was about a third of what I expected.9. Pollo al Ajillo: roasted chicken thigh in lemon garlic - 7.00Having gone through the basket of white bread rolls and aioli and all these tapas, we were getting full. But entrees were coming. 1. Pollo con Jamon: Ham and cheese wrapped chicken breast with capers, and guindilla sauce - 16.002. Paella de Vegetales: Seasonal garden vegetables with saffron rice - 16.95 Although the paella was tasty I would not order it again. As a rice dish with cooked veggies the whole thing just had a mushy consistency to me. One spoonful was more than enough.And now for the sweetest ending. No spanish dinner is complete without some churros. But share one dessert? Not at my table! So we also ordered the Pastel de Pan: banana and apple bread pudding with ice cream - 6.00 There's no point in saying another word about the bread pudding. If you like bread pudding then try it. Cut to the churros. Oh dessert heaven...the churros! Churrrrrrrrros. I felt like dancing around the restaurant stomping my heels like a flamenco dancer and instead of clacking castanets, I would have churros on my fingers. Churros con Chocolate - 7.00Served warm, stuffed with hazelnut/caramel filling (??) and with a side of chocolate. Unfortunately they were coated in a lot of unnecessary sugar, but delicious just the same.
Icehouse=Oh noes, Icehouse. I was really excited to bring some out of towners to this new restaurant/pub seated in the heart of South End. The building itself is really neat - super tall ceilings, a nice patio facing South Blvd. and tons of super sweet flat screens inside. This would be a great place to watch a game...but not to eat...and here's why. Four of us were seated and ordered all different things off the menu - chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp and spinach quesadillas and I ordered the Thai beef salad. Even as we ordered, we thought that some of the menu items looked a little pricey as depicted. But, as this is a new restaurant we didn't quite know what to expect. The food came out very quickly - quite literally within 5-10 minutes, which was good. But the outcome was not. My mother ordered the shrimp and spinach quesadillas and upon tasting them, she put them down and asked me to try them. The spinach had a metallic, almost chemical taste to it. Within five minutes the waitress came over and she offered to bring her something else, later stating that too much oregano was reason that the quesadillas tasted strange. No offense, but I cook with oregano often, and that wasn't the odd taste. My husband's shrimp tacos were fine, but we took issue with the fact that for $12 - all he received were two small tacos with no sides. And my father's chicken tacos - $9 for the same. Even if these tacos were stellar (which per my dining mates they were just ok), that is a paltry amount of food for the price. The only decent item at the table was my Thai Beef Salad - the seasoning was nice, the mint was a pleasant touch, I just wish it had a little more spice. Portion wise it was more than enough. As a replacement to the spinach quesadillas, my mother ordered the Thai beef spring rolls and they were positively swimming in oil. Now, I don't mind a fried item, but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isn't appetizing to anyone. Needless to say, she didn't eat very much at lunch. On a brighter note, Icehouse has an extensive and affordable beer selection that would please just about anyone. Overall, I like the concept and the feel of Icehouse - plenty of brews and plenty of tvs. The food, however, fell waaaay short. I really hope that this place reevaluates its menu as the location and the concept have a lot of potential.I went into Icehouse after waiting tables tonight, grabbed a beer, half night pint night on Wacky Wednesdays. Yay, can we start meeting here on Weds for a Yelp Office Hours meeting? I ordered pork tacos and a White Zombie wheat beer, my tab was $9.90. What a deal.

Big Eye Sushi Bar=We have watched business' come and go at this location for a few years now.  When I saw that it is now a sushi restaurant, I had my reservations.  During the day you cannot see into the shop because of the tinted windows, but don't let that stop you from seeing and tasting what's inside.  We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted very warmly from the waitress and soon afterwords, the sushi chef.  It happened to be happy hour at the time with extremely reasonable prices.  Happy hour is everyday of the week from 4-6:30pm.  What great deals!  Sake bombers were only $6 and you can choose from a variety of appetizers; such as edamame, calamari, and gyoza, to name a few.  I had to have the edamame, and the calamari was scrumptious as well.  It was served with a yummy aioli sauce that paired with it perfectly.Not only were there appetizers on the happy hour menu, but there were some sushi rolls to choose from too.  We tried the shrimp tempura roll and wow, the shrimp had an amazing light batter that had a lovely crunch! Besides happy hour, we had to experiment more from the sushi menu.  The Surfer was amazing; that was one of my favorites.  The dynamite shrimp on top was delectable with it's spicy zing.  It was hard not to eat all the shrimp on its own without the roll!  If you like spicy, you would also like the yellow fin tuna with sauteed jalapenos.  It's served with a delightful soy garlic sauce.  It was a little misleading, because we thought it was going to be a roll.  However, it was extremely fresh and tasty, but a little overpriced for all that you got.On the adventurous side, the quail egg was phenomenal!  It was served in a shot glass and I have to admit, I wasn't sure how to proceed.  After taking the plunge into my mouth, I found that all the components went together extremely well and the creaminess from the quail egg only added to the delicacy of it.  I would definitely get that again and perhaps experiment a little more with what else they had to offer.  I am very happy to have found a sushi bar that keeps my taste buds wanting more.  Service was excellent.  My glass never reached empty, and it was never a nuisance to stop our waitress and ask for something.  The atmosphere was mediocre.  I felt that there could have been more charm, especially with the big screen televisions playing football.  Personally, I could have done without and maybe been more entertained with anime.  However, this sushi hot spot is off to a good start and I hope they will be around longer than their predecessors.
TJ's Homestyle Restaurant=We frequented this restaurant a lot over the past five years. In fact, there was a time we were going every other weekend. Unfortunately that changed yesterday. Since the restaurant was renovated, my husband and I have been there three or four times. I understand that now that they can accommodate many more customers, the service is going to be slower and the stress levels will be higher. However, what happened yesterday was inappropriate, unprofessional and unacceptable. I ordered what I order every single time I go there. My husband did the same. In fact, I joked with the waitress that she should make copies of the ticket so she can just have them ready whenever we come in. After my husband and I placed our orders, the waitress walked away, checked the window for other tables' food. Talked to the other servers. Got my coffee and my husband's soda and snagged some creamer off of another table for me. At that point, I asked if she could change my toast from dry wheat to raisin bread. She informed me that was fine since she hadn't even put the ticket in yet. Um......okay??? This particular server is new and I get that. However, you write the ticket, hang it in the window, then go do other stuff. After waiting another thirty minutes (again, I get they were busy and I was willing to overlook this) she brought out my eggs, bacon and grits. She told me she was waiting on the bread. My eggs were the consistency of rubber. When she came back over with my husband's plate, I asked her if she could have them remake my eggs as they were overdone. She took the plate, walked over to the kitchen and put my eggs on a separate little dish. She brought the bacon and grits back, along with my husband's food. She went back to the window and retrieved a new plate of eggs for me and brought them back over to me; by which time my husband had pointed out his eggs were not over-medium either, but were still clear where the whites were undercooked. He had taken his eggs and put them on his toast plate for her so she could just take them to the kitchen to be replaced. When she handed the cook that second plate of eggs is when the problem started. The waitress and another woman I can only assume is the manager stood in front of the window while the cook screamed, yelled and threw things (yes, THREW things) like a two year old child who was told "No." He yelled and screamed about eggs and "stupid people" and cooking for a good thirty seconds before my husband went and informed the owner, Don. When my husband and Don walked back, the cook was still screaming and yelling. As Don was walking into the kitchen, we heard a dish crashing and Don yelling at the cook. While this was going on, the waitress brought me my raisin toast which looked like it had been chewed up and spit out on the plate. Seriously, the presentation was just very poor and by this time, I was just over the whole thing. A few minutes later, Don emerged from the kitchen with two eggs, cooked over medium. He put them in front of my husband who thanked him. Don told him to "check them." My husband told him they were fine. Don insisted he check them again. So, my husband stuck his fork in them and stated again that they were fine. Then, the waitress shows Don the plate of raisin bread. She mumbled something and he yelled, "She ordered raisin bread and....what???!!" The waitress looked like she was about to cry, so I said, "It looks like someone chewed it up and spit it out on the plate." He took it and went back into the kitchen. By this time, I had just completely lost my appetite. I got the car keys from my husband and went out to the car. My husband advised that after I left, Don came back out with two new pieces of bread. He advised Don that I had left and Don threw it in the trash and exclaimed, "I TRIED! I tried to make it right!" My husband finished his eggs and was told there was no bill (I should certainly think not!). As he was leaving, Don told him, "Have a nice life."So, here's the thing: If you own a business in the service industry especially, there occasionally will be a complaint. However, you should realize that your customers are your source of income and the reason you even have a business. In the five years I have been going there, I have never once complained about the food...EVER. Yesterday it was completely warranted and I left there feeling as if I were the "bad guy." Well after five years of supporting this local business, I can honestly say I will never be back there. I'm a bit disappointed because it was our favorite place to go for breakfast, but I'm not going to be a patron somewhere that treats their customers as an annoying inconvenience. And, honestly, I would have been okay but not for the fit the cook threw. That is where it all went downhill. They're just eggs. You're not doing brain surgery, dude. Take a valium and chill out. As for me, I'll be going to Black Bear diner from now on.I will never come back here. I just witnessed what may be the rudest manager dressing down an employee not only in front of other servers but about 10 patrons as well. The waitress may have been doing something wrong I have no idea but you do not dress down employees in front of customers or patrons for any reason. The manager then proceeded to ask the other servers after the lady left if he was wrong. Well who the hell would disagree with you for fear of being yelled at. Also the kitchen is in the weeds and this manager or owner was more worried about going outside to smoke. In the 40 minutes I sat watching he went outside twice. I was so angry by the time I left I wanted to punch the guy for 45 minutes I had to listen to him yell at people from the cooks to waitresses
Mekong Palace=Mekong Palace is located off Dobson Rd. and Main St. in Mesa.  This food court eatery is located inside the Mekong Plaza shopping center.  Mekong Palace is a trifecta of a restaurant.  During the day they offer up Dim Sum, the evenings it's either classic Chinese dining or Hot Pot!Dim Sum is what I like to call Asian Tapas.  Dim sum, literally translated, means "touch of the heart." Traditional legend says that women would make dim sum dishes for their husbands before they went off to work.  For this reason, dim sum is very labor intensive, made up of small Bo-Bite-sized pieces (usually served in dishes of 2-4 pieces) with attention to detail; even going so far as lines on dumpling wrappings.  Dim sum is traditionally served for breakfast and lunch and is considered an art form amongst Chinese chefs. Modern day Dim Sum is served by the waitstaff pushing carts around and in between tables, while patrons view and select the dishes in the carts.  My family and I usually go on Sunday mornings like most Asian families.  I jokingly call this Sunday gathering Chinese Church.  Dim Sum is also called "Yum Cha" or drinking tea since tea is the choice of beverage.Mekong has all your favorite Dim Sum plates from Siu Mai, Cha Siu Bow, Nah My Guy to Guy Lans and Nai Wong Bows.  Yes, I know, it sounds so foreign, but it's the only way to order it.  No worries, the servers translate all these dishes in English well.   Make sure you bring a Chinese speaking friend.  Not only is it almost a requirement, but makes it more fun, as well.  I love the Dim Sum here not just because the food is great, but because of the atmosphere.  Mekong rocks out on classic Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Vivian Chow music playing while you enjoy a great meal with family and friends.During the evening, Mekong Palace pumps out great Chinese cuisine.  They have everything from your favorite Kung Pao Chicken to your Sweet and Sour Pork.  However, they also have some great classic authentic Chinese dishes such as Stir-fried Lobster, Mapo Tofu, and my favorite, Stir-fried String beans and pork.  Think that's it?  Well think again!  Mekong Palace also offers up Hot Pot style dining.  Here at Mekong you get your own pot of hot boiling stew and choice of flavor, while cooking your own ingredients made to order; fresh chopped vegetables, round eye beef and diced calamari.  I love eating Hot Pot here since it's very tasty and also very affordable.  At $2-$3 per plate, this place can get you full real quick at a very fair valueThe last time I had Hot Pot it was in Taipei and it was 2009. Clearly I was due for a repeat. Since my China days are over, I had to rely on my friends to take me where they thought the most authentic stuff was in Phoenix, so all 10 of us gathered at Mekong for some Hot Pot goodness.Here is my easy guide to eating Hot Pot at Mekong.ORDERINGSharing is Caring!!  Since Hot Pot is all about sharing, the hard part about it is the strategy. The bigger your party, the harder it will be to coordinate. Groups of 4-6 are ideal. 10 is just a mess. Make sure you all figure out what you collectively want to eat (everyone likes meat? Ok, a couple portions of meat. Only 2 like mushrooms, Ok only 1 serving). Otherwise if everyone fills out an order card with their personal preference you will end up with 1) too many leftovers, 2) a giant billPICKING FLAVORSGo a little past your comfort zone on flavors. A big/spicy/tasty broth is good as you will not be drinking it, but just dipping your sides in it. The stronger the broth, the better the flavors of your sides will be. Also, go above and beyond when making your dipping sauce. Mix and match! Spicy soy sauce mixed with satay, sesame seeds, garlic and cilantro is a good base. Again, you're not drinking the sauce, just dipping your cooked goods in it. The stronger, the better!COOKING YOUR STUFFThink like a chef. Not everything will take the same amount of time to cook. The meat will take 10 seconds (in-out-done). The taro will take the longest. Dumplings will take a while to cook, while bok choy, greens and some veggies will be faster. Noodles will also be pretty fast so check often. Also, don't over boil your broth! you have the temp controls under the table, so pick a temperature where you get steady heat and bubbles without making a giant mess and overcooking everything. Experiment! EATING YOUR STUFFShare Share Share. Pass along the sides, try everything (coagulated blood, tripe, fish balls, you name it). If you really want to take some leftovers home, I suggest you cook them prior OR take some of the broth home to cook later. Most of the stuff really don't make good leftovers, so I wouldn't particularly bother unless you went overboard with the ordering.PAYING YOUR STUFFBased on the whole sharing technique, I would just split evenly (except for drinks). Since sides get passed around, splitting according to what you ate might be a giant pain in the ass- for both you and the server. Expect to pay around $20 including some drinks.Overall experience was fun and worth returning. The list of options is large and the quality is A-OK. Doesn't compare to my Taiwanese experience but hey, this is Phoenix after all.Mekong Palace is definitely my choice for dinner and dim sum, ALWAYS.  While there's no solid walls perse, the decor and ambiance is decent.  How can you not love the cleanliness?Dim sum:  The prices are a steal for the quality that you get.  Food is fresh, dumplings are big [that's what she said], and the food is just downright amazing.  It doesn't matter if you're the first for dims sum or the lat, the food is always fresh.  Service is always superior and your tea pot is never left empty for more than a couple minutes.  Those kids are on the ball about keeping the pot filled!  I love their seasonal items like the little fried sweet potato balls of heaven and their special items are always exciting to try.  Food is genuinely authentic and I love it here!Dinner:  Dinner is just as great.  Mekong Palace is the only place to go for Peking Duck.  While other places makes a delicious bird, they usually just give you the skin only with the buns.  At Mekong Palace, they hook it up.  You get the skin for the buns of course but they also prepare two more little dishes with the price of the one dish:  You get lettuce wraps and the duck meat itself.  It's DELICIOUS!  Food at dinner is just as amazing and the portions are gigantic.  This is definitely my favorite place to go when I want some Chinese food [well, here and my mama's house].Came to Mekong Palace for February's Breakfast Club UYE to try some Dim Sum, we were a party of 10 and were seated right away.  Even though the restaurant itself sits in the back of a shopping center, once you are seated you sort of forget that you are in a shopping plaza.We tried at least 15 different items, everything was delish, my son really enjoyed the shark fin rolls the roasted duck, we also tried noddle dishes, a chicken and rice dish, steamed bbq pork buns, oh gosh we tried everything,  every dish offered a new flavor and everything was very yummy!Like I said we were a party of 10, and tried over 15 different styled dishes and the total bill for each of us with tip included: $13 bucks! That's right! Great meal for an excellent price, but have to be honest, none of were thinking with our wallet when picking items, we just wanted to tried all the things we could and I was quite shocked to learn it was just 13 per person. It was a great time had by all, and I look forward to coming back!This is as good as dim sum can get in AZ.  you'll need to wait for a seat as this place is quite busy.  You can also order classic Chinese dishes off their menu.
El Pollo Loco=I gotta give them props and bump them up a star. El Pollo Loco is still my healthy lunch of choice in this armpit of the city. It's kinda like a shaved armpit now instead of a musky, hippy armpit. At least in regards to EPL that is. They have booted the homeless crew who use to reside here AND remodeled the interior of the restaurant which created a brighter and more spacious environment for grubbin'.*Salsa bar is clean and full (until I get a hold of it)*Staff is on point even if they still say," Hi-Me your order is ready". I'm cool with that. Makes me feel all Bon Qui Qui inside. *Food here is consistantly delicious and fresh. *They have a loyalty card that seems to equal a free $5 salad for me once a month. Boo ya!!!!Yeah, they are on their game right now and I'm likin' it. Only thing I don't get is this. They started selling smoothies and slushy coffee drinks. Why don't they have a Horchata flavor ice-blended drink? Wouldn't that make more sense? I know this Ranchero would be all up on it on Cheat Day.Love Love Love the new healthy menu! So much to choose from. I'm glad they are next door to my gym location.The drive thru is hardly ever busy and the staff is always so nice and answers any questions you have about the new menu.I ordered two shrimp tacos with avocado, two for 7$. So delicious and healthy with the wheat tortilla and cabbage. I was full after just eating one. And the shrimp are medium size(not bay shrimp!), and so flavorful.Definitely give it a try if you don't have time to sit down for lunch and want a fresh healthy option.
KGB: Kerry's Gourmet Burgers=I went to KGB for a really late night snack at around 2:30am.  It was actually a tough decision for me to eat here considering that at this point of my trip, I already had eaten Burgers at other spots on the Strip and didn't really feel like having another one.  I looked at their menu and did see something that caught my attention..... their Bacon Waffle and Fried Chicken Burger.  What the heck??I've had my fair share of Chicken and Waffles from Roscoe's, to FarmerBrown, and Hash House A Go Go, and even Bouchon, but I've never had them in the form of a sandwich.  So when they brought it to my table, I couldn't help but crack up because it just looked ridiculous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw?select=uznWQt-KgYXi3OEBfGbXJw).  Basically, you get two Bacon Waffle "Sliders" with Fried Chicken that comes with a funnel of Tater Tots and your choice of either Maple or Jalapeno Syrup.  I opted for Maple because I thought that Jalapeno Syrup just sounded so weird.  Maybe I should've opted for it though since the dish was strange enough already.  I really didn't know how to eat this thing because once I put the syrup on the Waffles, I was no longer able to eat it with my hands.  I ended up taking it all apart and just knife and forking it.  I think the execution fell a little flat since the Bacon Waffles were a little overdone and the Chicken was dry.  The Syrup only helped just a little bit to counter the dryness.  I do applaud Kerry Simon for trying to be creative with this dish though.  At least the Tator Tots were good!! I guess it's not really fair to judge this spot based on their interesting take on Chicken and Waffles since it's a burger joint after all.  I do appreciate that they're open really late (till 6am).  I'll probably drop by again so I can try their burgers or Kerry Simon's famous Iron Chef Sliders and hopefully have a better experience.I like the concept of KGB and it's riff on the Soviet era.  Being at KGB, however, is not like being at the Lubyanka in Moscow.  There are Soviet era knock off posters of the proletariat.  Most of the female servers had short, leather shorts that evoked a police state couture.I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I messaged a good Yelp buddy and asked if he wanted to join me here before our Yelp event last night and use the Groupon.  He has been there before but this was my first visit.I ordered their southwest burger which the menu describes like this:   avocado, cilantro, lime-marinated peppers and onions, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, avocado cr√®me fra√Æche, jalape√±o-Cheddar bun.  I ordered it rare.  The burger comes with fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and it was very juicy but none of the avocado was there.  Pico, yes, and cheese, but there was no taste of avocado.  Service was good during our visit.  Since the place was almost empty, it should have been.  The price was in line with Strip prices.  At first I thought the burger was over-priced but when you factor in the fries served with each sandwich, it is comparable to other burger joints on the Strip.I went to see the round semi-private dining area on the side of the kitchen where they have the hammer and sickle light.  I got a photo of it and I could almost see Felix Dzerzhinsky having dinner there.  KGB is A-OK!Hubby was craving a burger and heard they had decent ones here, so we came here for dinner. There wasn't a wait and we were seated right away. The place was maybe half full and I liked the vibe. We were sat at a roomy and comfy booth. Our server was nice and checked on us right away at first taking our drink orders and then our food order, but didn't check on us for long periods of time after that. Priced at $10 I ordered a "House Salad" and asked that the balsamic vinegar be replaced with extra ranch dressing. It took a while for our food to come out. When my salad did arrive, it was a big portion. They forgot to give me extra ranch dressing instead of balsamic and when I mentioned it to our server he went and got the ranch. The salad had a mixture of greens that I personally didn't prefer, tomatoes that were sad, 3 dinky little cucumber scraps and shredded carrots. It just wasn't a salad I'd eat again. For dessert we ordered a "KGB S'Mores" and was presented nicely. The rice krispies treats were rock hard making them tough to eat. The marshmallows on the top and chocolate sauce that was underneath tasted good and the single strawberry garnish, but that's about it. After dropping off dessert, our server took a while before coming back to check on us or bring the bill. My hubby did enjoy his burger even though it wasn't cooked the way he requested at first and the burger had to be remade, but nothing stood out enough here to come back.
Paco's Tacos & Tequila=Jalapeno margarita + kick ass salsa = one happy Nikki.I have always loved the food here, but the service has pushed this from 4 stars to 5 stars.Let's begin with research I did a few weeks ago for the Weekly Yelp. For my Yelp Flips The Bird issue, I called on a super busy night. The nice young girl on the phone answered all my odd questions (I never told her who I was or why I was asking all these questions). So nice... so helpful. This past weekend, I took my buddy Steve to bust his Paco's Tacos cherry. The bartender was our server. She was fantastic. Super friendly, so good at her job. She knew the menu by heart. And when she got tied up with to-go orders at the bar, another nice girl jumped right in to bring us boxes and the check. During the meal, the manager walked over to ask how our lunch was. I wish all restaurants did this. It's such a simple gesture, but it really does go a long way.Okay now to the food!Chips and salsa: I love the salsa here. Perfect combination of spice and flavor... plus the chips are so light and fresh. I could easily crush multiple orders by myself.Firestarter margarita: Jalape√±o infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had. Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high. Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side. Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals. I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit. Cheers Paco's! :)
Salt of the Earth=I've been to Salt of the Earth 3 times, most recently with my brother and his friend.  We sat in the common tables downstairs, but I've sat upstairs as well.  The large space and open-air environment are vibrant.  It's the kind of place that you'd be just as comfortable in a shirt & tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  People like to say that this the kind of place that you can find in "fancier" cities than Pittsburgh.  I've eaten in many fancy restaurants in much larger cities, and I can honest say that I have been never been any place as unique as Salt.Kevin Sousa has been serving outstanding food in Pittsburgh for years now.  His current restaurant is no different.  They unusual nature of the preparations and ingredients are highly unique, but are wonderfully harmonious in the execution of the dishes.  I recently started off with the Vodka cocktail made with local Boyd & Blair and Creme Yvette.  Yes it was girly, but it was delicious.  For appetizers, we had the cockscomb and escolar sashimi.  The cockscomb was combined with cheesy grits and collard greens that gave it a theme of Southern soul-food.  The pink escolar was beautiful in its presentation.  The slices were thick and the the flavors were outstanding.  It was a perfect appetizer to share (and not just because eating too much escolar isn't a good idea).  Sharing the appetizers is a great way to experience the vastly different variety and preparations that the kitchen produces.Our entrees were likewise outstanding.  I had the Bluenose bass, a fish and I can't say that I've ever had before.  The preparation with coconut and pomegranate was tart and flavorful.  It was unusual, but it really worked.  Chef Sousa is a master of unusual flavor combinations that challenge your imagination.  Likewise, I never would have thought bananas and duck go so well together, but they do beautifully in Salt's duck entree.  Compared to when the restaurant first opened, the dinner portions seemed noticeably larger.  The restaurant clearly acted on the early feedback from its diners.  I was perfectly sated at the conclusion of our dinner.  We didn't have dessert on this occasion, but it wouldn't have been necessary to leave full.Service was outstanding as always.  I keep hoping to see Kevin's old waiter Jim who literally is the best waiter ever (as anyone who went to any of the Alchemy dinners knows), but our sever was very friendly, knowledgeable, and all of our food arrived quickly.  The young woman sommelier who served our wine was also equally friendly and knowledgeable about the wine.I believe that any potential criticism of Salt of the Earth has to take into account the overall vision of the restaurant.  It does not offer a conventional sit-down restaurant experience (amuse-bouches, fresh baked bread, etc.).  What it does offer are incredibly unusual and high-quality ingredients at a VERY reasonable price.  Some say that the cocktails are too expensive at $10.  For the ingredients they put in them, I think they're a steal.  The "house" cocktail at Fleur de Lys is $24.  Salt of the Earth is a modern bistro for the 21st century.  It is especially appealing to the new generation of foodies & gourmands that are huge fans of shows like Top Chef (of which I count myself one).  I remember one of Kevin's blog entries, before the restaurant opened, said he didn't want to create a "destination" restaurant.  Personally, I would love to see Kevin's version of a "destination" restaurant like Moto or Alinea in Chicago.  Heck, I'd be want to be one of the first people to invest that that venture.  Amazingly, by not setting out to make Salt of the Earth a "destination" location, Kevin Sousa created a place with such outstanding food, service, and atmosphere that Salt has itself become one of the top dining destinations in our region.(To the "DuckTales" tune):Life's smooth as a Hurricane here in Pittsburgh.Spirits, bitters, sugar cane - it's a bar blur.You might solve a mystery or rewrite history.CockTails, woo-oooo!Every night they're out there making CockTails, woo-oooo!Tales of derring-do, these ain't no mocktails.D-d-d-danger, watch behind you - there's a work week out to find you.What to do? Just grab on to some CockTails, woo-oooo!Every night they're out there making CockTails, woo-oooo!Tales of derring-do, these ain't no mocktails.Not pony tails or cotton tails but CockTails, woo-oooo!I floated out of dinner at Salt of the Earth belting "CockTails, wooo-ooooo!"...which *could* have had something to do with the six premium mixed beverages husband and I shared over dinner.  We couldn't help ourselves: once we'd sampled one we needed to taste all six, not wanting to miss one taste of the most imaginative, high-quality, and subtly nuanced beverages we've imbibed in a long, long while (I refer you to my pictures for more detailed descriptions of these beauts).  In fact, I gushed about them so much and so frequently to our server that she eventually just went ahead brought one of the mixologist geniuses behind SotE's elixirs up to our table to introduce her -- Maggie -- to her newest biggest fan -- me.  I was giddy as a school girl.  Again, I'm sure this had nothing to do with the alcohol consumed. I would have been perfectly happy if our experience ended right there, but SotE also serves food, and that had been our main impetus behind coming.  So order we did, and the food that came out of the kitchen was as exceptional as the libations, rivaling some of the best, most inventive restaurant meals I've had.  An appetizer of scallops dazzled with perfectly caramelized shellfish and a velvety uni emulsion.  Husband was taken by the snails with orrichiette, rich sweetbreads, and chicken skins fried to potato-chip-like crispness.  I wasn't as impressed with my soft shell crab entr√©e; the crab was wonderful, but the seaweed and the potato salads felt uninspired.  Husband's wild Copper River salmon was stunningly prepared, however, leaving me jealous.  And I've never met a salmon I *liked*.  The care put into the food considered, prices are surprisingly reasonable (especially coming from inflated and overpriced DC).Service -- provided by the adept Alison -- was excellent and attentive, and the pared-down, minimalist d√©cor more appealing than one would think.  I love the concepts of family-dining on the main floor, more private tables upstairs, and menus penned on enormous chalkboards rather than brought to the table.  SotE is an all-around wonderful and well-thought-out experience, a real breath of fresh air.The trip here was LONG overdue!  I felt like it was one of the restaurants in the city that I was embarrassed I hadn't been to yet.  Well, embarrassment no more, I made it it!I actually almost passed it up, as it's at the very edge of Bloomfield and the very beginning of East Liberty.  It's incredibly unassuming with the name only shown on a tiny part of the window in the corner.  Almost like they were trying to say, "are you curious about what we're doing in here?  Why don't you stop in!"The atmosphere is incredibly unique.  The downstairs portion is all communal style dining with long dining tables and chairs set up like a kings feast.  The kitchen is out in the open, like it's your own kitchen, except you have expert cooks living in your house (wouldn't that be nice?!).  I love the loft type feel of the second floor dining area that looks out onto the first floor.  Again, I felt like this was designed after someones super hip loft apartment.  I'd live here and get fed all day...no complaints!  The hostess told me that the upstairs seating is for reservations and the downstairs is for walk ins.  I like that set up because more than likely you'll always be able to snag a seat.Every ounce of this place just screams unique.  The menu is on a chalkboard on the wall...so thank gawd we were close...because I'm totally blind!  The drinks are set up by what type of liquor you'd like.  Simple idea, but very cool presentation.  Since it was approximately 120 degrees outside I opted for the refreshing sounding Punch, which had DonQ, Anejo, Benedictine, falernum, pineapple,  and angostura in it.  First sip I was taken aback because it was definitely a kick in the booty.  The next couple sips settled in nicely for a pretty delectable drink.We decided to go adventurous and order the Cockscombs app.  It was  described as the fried part of the Roosters little red hat type thingamajigger (technical term, I know).  At first thought it sounds incredibly weird...but we eat the chickens wing and leg....so why not little red part.  Total southern comfort food, with grits and greens.  It was tasty but incredibly fatty too, so it wasn't a fan fav among my table mates.  The other app, the Sashimi, was incredibly fresh with prickly pear and wasabi coating the outside.  That was the winner hands down.For the main dish I choose the Tomato-braised Eggplant with soy protein and tahini.  The Eggplant were in little cubes of light and crispy joy!  I just wish there were more because I enjoyed it so much!  The soy protein and tahini mixed well together for a perfect side.  The biggest observation I can make about this place is that the chef and owner put a lot of thought into the concept of this place.  With careful consideration you can tell the specific ingredients are put together to make a spectacular dish.  And for that, I admire them.  It's refreshing to have a place that's so inventive that it will just keep you coming back for more unique tastings.  I for one, will get my eat on here again very soon!My brother, who lives around the corner from here, refuses to admit that this is his favorite restaurant in the city. I have no such qualms. Of course, you've got to take that with a grain of salt (get it?!!) since I've only been to a few places, but Salt is easily my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant to date.While the communal tables were packed and lively on a Friday evening, we were able to sit down at the bar immediately. I would've preferred a spot watching the open kitchen, but I'll never be sad about sitting at a bar, especially one manned by such talented ladies. Both of us jumped on the bourbon cocktail of the day; with Green Chartreuse and hickory, it was a bit on the sweet side for him, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.The menu on the wall (and only on the wall, no printed copies anywhere) was appealing from top to bottom, and we went meat-heavy with our orders. We started with the steak tartare; a bit of bone marrow, cornichons and a silky quail egg punched up the quality cut, and it was flawless. However, it still paled in comparison to the crispy gnocchi, served with chunks of astonishingly tender beef cheek, all atop an unctuous layer of beef tongue. The light touch of a papaya sauce, along with a bit of the braising liquid, culminated in nothing less than culinary genius. I loved every bite, and if he wasn't my brother, I probably would've broken his face for eating almost half. Since three types of beef weren't enough for him, he also opted for the hanger steak as his main. Served with broccoli kimchi and a wild rice porridge, the beef was once again a winner. The dish was a bit soupier than anticipated, but the dark porridge was a perfect vehicle for the medium rare meat, once again tender as can be. I chose the duck. The perfectly cooked slices of breast were laid over a parsnip puree and accompanied by halusky with onion and apple, a few roasted brussel sprouts and what appeared to be even more braised duck. While it might not be an affordable entree by Pittsburgh standards, you absolutely get your money's worth with each order here. It was a MEAL, and a damn fine one.Throughout dinner, the service was excellent. Our beautiful bartenders were kind enough to keep us in cocktails (a Manhattan for me, complete with a huge, round ice cube) after we finished our initial offerings, and didn't rat me out for stealing huge pieces of steak while my brother was in the bathroom.If I had a complaint, it would be that it's gonna be a bitch to hit up the 'Burgh every time I want to eat here, but I'll be back.***Some of the dishes I had at Salt of the Earth were a little underwhelming, but there were still good things on the plate and the ribeye and salmon (with the skin on) looked very good***Salt of the Earth is a popular and relatively new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Salt of the Earth is in a great space.  There are two floors of dining areas and this combined with the high ceiling really opens up the dining room.  The downstairs dining area is very simple and comfortable, but it is also sleek and modern with a good use of blonde colored wood.  There is a great chalkboard on one wall, which lists up the menu (the menu seems to be very spontaneous with frequent changes).I really like the upstairs dining area because you get a great view of the downstairs dining area as well as the kitchen as they both cook and plate.The menu features a lot of good ingredients with several interesting flavor combinations.  I started with the octopus, which was served with white bean puree, chorizo, crisp radishes, crunchy almonds, a cilantro pesto, and oranges.  The octopus was very nicely done.  It was incredibly soft and had a very interesting texture.  The octopus almost shredded like crab or braised meat.I did not like the chef's choice for the other ingredients on the plate though.  Everything was fine, but I was just not sure if all the flavors went together that well.  The white bean puree was also a little cold.Next came pork loin with a poached egg, farro and chorizo risotto, green tomato jam, pickled okra, and mustard seeds.  Like the octopus, the cooking of the pork was very good.  The pork was very tender and had a good amount of juiciness.  Once again, I was not a huge fan of all of the garnishes, which kept this dish from from being exceptional.  I also did not like the color of the dish.  Still, the plate definitely showed the talent in the kitchen.I did happen to see their ribeye special and salmon special and both dishes looked excellent.  The skin on the salmon looked crispy and flavorful while the ribeye had a great thickness and color.  The garnishes there also looked more traditional so those two dishes might have been better representations of what the Salt of the Earth kitchen can put out.For dessert, I had zucchini bread, which came with crunchy sunflower seed brittle, rhubarb sauce, brown butter powder, and fennel ice cream.  The zucchini bread was good--nothing exceptional but good.  The brown butter powder was interesting and I really liked the fennel ice cream--good, unique flavor and very creamy.  It was not my favorite dessert, but like a lot of the dishes at Salt of the Earth, it really shows the potential of this restaurant.Service was great--very personable and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.Prices were very reasonable given the high quality ingredients used and the generous portions.Salt of the Earth shows real potential.  There were definitely elements in each course that I really liked and I think if you order right here, you could probably have a very good meal.  There is definitely good sourcing of quality ingredients, a seasonal approach, talent in the kitchen, and a contemporary approach to the menu.  All of these pluses make Salt of the Earth one to consider for an upscale but still casual dinner in Pittsburgh (while I did not love Salt of the Earth, I would definitely give them another shot if I lived in Pittsburgh).You can find metered parking on the street.Never again! The name of this restaurant is so untrue: "NOT of the earth" is more like it! After last night's meal, I feel like I was mugged while being smiled at.In short, two glasses of wine, a main course, and a split dessert set me back $61 + $12 for the tip (can't punish the waiter for the cruddy food). The entire bill was $122.In general: when I called to make a reservation, I got a lot of push back for requesting the time that I did. However, upon arrival, the place was ~25% full. What gives?the waiter, when asked for recommendations, without fail suggested the most expensive thing on the menu. From the wine to the starters to the main course. That feels like check padding to me. Our table was in the darkest, further corner of the second floor, above the kitchen. Aside from it being near impossible to see either menu without standing up or requiring binoculars, the table pulsated the entire time; I assume that this is because we were located above the exhaust fan of the kitchen. I felt like we were an after thought.My girlfriend ordered the soup. It was lukewarm upon arrival, they only gave us one spoon in spite of the fact that she had announced that she would share it, and the chestnuts in the soup were a soggy, chewy mess.Main courses. I ordered the pork. Let's just say that what arrived at the table appeared to have been cooked at approximately 4 pm, then was allowed to sit under a heat lamp in the intervening three hours. The pork belly slices were like petrified logs, chewy, hard, crusty. Not melt-in-your-mouth at all. The broccoli bits were dark, shriveled, and pathetic looking. The fried rice cakes - the highlight - were so hard, i couldn't stab them with my fork, so I had to eat them with my fingers. Classy. Finally, the blood orange/soy reduction had no tartness or sweetness, and was so salty, it burned upon contact. TOO much reducing! It was a disaster from top to bottom. Oh, and this is just my personal preference, but the crumbled pork was probably from Parma Sausage in the strip. Glad Salt buys locally, but I personally do not like the spicing mixture Parma uses, so that was a fail for me, too.My girlfriends dish, the short ribs, was much more palatable to look at, brighter, fresher, and more moist. Dessert was the "chocolate". This was the highlight of the meal, but for $9, a half a scoop of ice cream and a silver dollar of chocolate mousse seems...again, like I was being mugged! Come on guys, splurge a little! More than four bites for dessert, OK?At least they were good about refilling the water glasses, which about 98% of Pittsburgh restaurants neglect to do. The one star is for the water. Honestly, I feel like this place markets itself as so upscale, and it sure is lovely to look at. But peek under the hood and it's just a fiasco. I would like to think that this was an off night, but I don't want to get ripped off again to be proven wrong. Shame on you, Salt.Every time you move to a new city and ask about the places to go for good food, there are a few names everyone rattles off.  Salt is one of those in Pittsburgh.If this were a quasi-French restaurant I might understand the price point, but no such pomp and circumstance.  The decor I think is great for a casual dinner, and a fancier date that you don't want to feel too stuffy.  I don't care that you have your own place setting and fancy silverware-- it's at a communal table (unless you reserve upstairs).  The service was no different than anything you'd expect at Elbow Room, it's fine.My barometer for any restaurant is a simple protein.  It says a lot about how they pick ingredients, their philosophy about bringing flavor out vs. marinating, timing in the kitchen.  So I got a hangar steak. Why? No idea. This is a cut closely resembling flank, the stuff people use in fajitas and beef stir fry (read: marinade the shit out of it to make it taste good).  The dish came out looking like an art piece, but the meat was so thin it didn't retain any heat and it felt like eating the steak off the top of a fancy salad... without the salad.  To their credit, it was cooked well and I could see the idea behind it, just didn't taste good because the cut itself was lacking.  Scallops were the same story.  Good ingredients, great plating, light fluffy flavors and not too buttery.  We had two drinks a piece. I don't tend to get fancy cocktails but two Hendricks tonics and two Rieslings brought the total to $130 with tip.  Humbly two stars from me because feeling "fine" after leaving a place like that is disappointing.  Went straight to Wendy's afterwards and got some chicken nuggets.
Home Team Sports=Stopped in here to grab a Beer while I waited for my flight out of Gate B-19.  It's a medium sized bar with around 14 seats and a dining area that seats around 50 people.  It's located near the B Gates where it splits into a fork.I ordered a giant (see pics) 32 oz Stella ($10.99)....not a bad price for an Airport Bar, right?  How could I resist?  It's going to be a nice plan ride to San Diego.....ha!Will I return?  Next time I depart out of the B Gates, you know where you'll find me!FOOD: BYOF! Yes... Bring your own food to this sports bar. They only sell bags of chips and pre packaged sandwiches. So don't be the 100th person to ask the poor bartender if they serve food because they don't. And he will tell you to get food else wear and bring it back. Too bad not many choices on this side of the airport. But do what you gotta do. Then you can order alky to your liking here. INSIDE: plenty of Tvs and tables and chairs.Sports jerseys in glass cases along the walls. Sports bar lounge feel to this place. DRINKS: they have some beer on tap.STAFF: bartender was friendly and joked around with customers especially nice to hear considering he had to repeat himself so many times about where people can buy food and bring it back.
Old Country Buffet=Allow me to break it down.Arrive at a boofay and pay at 8:37pm (per receipt).  After taking a seat and gathering drinks, proceed to boofay tables to commence face stuffing selections.  Notice a lot of usual items absent or severely depleted.Ask Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy at cash register what time is closing time.When he replies 9pm, but you may continue to eat until 9:30, I confirm that they will continue to replenish food items up until 9pm, otherwise I want to get refund and forget it, there's not enough time.He assures that they'll continue cooking and asks me to simply inform him of any missing items.  I do -- two main entree items that they advertise as 'signature' items.I wait around for the items they're supposed to be cooking, all the while watching as other dishes become emptied and are not refilled.  I ask about the original two, and one of these other dishes, and Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager goes in the back and comes out to tell me they aren't cooking anymore. I relay to him my previous convo with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy and say what gives?  After checking with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy in a mysterious back office location, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager informs me that it has been decided that it's not appropriate for me to receive a refund in this situation and there's nothing he can do.I remind Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager that I paid by credit card, and if I truly have not received the goods that I paid for, I'll just file a dispute with them.  He goes in the back again. (am I buying a car, here, or what?)Upon return, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager presents me with a business card, on the back of which Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has hand written a note entitling me to one (1) free adult boofay at any time of day.There were three of us in the party, and apparently Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has decided that since I'm the only one complaining then I must be the only one who deserves a free meal credit.Poor customer service has made me second guess my love of cheap ass boofays.  I guess i'll just stick with my nasty indie china boofays and avoid this WalMart of Culinary Mass Volume all together.
Restaurant Su=I have noticed that there seems to be a huge problem in classifying, identifying and experiencing Middle Eastern food properly.First off, there are huge regional differences and varieties in the food from the Middle East or the Levant. It's not all just "Arab" or "Islamic". Turkish, Afghani, Persian, Lebanese, Syrian and Moroccan all are very distinct cuisines, where the ingredients and spices they use are often a reflection of their geographic, cultural and historical reality.Turkish food is not heavy on spices but places a huge emphasis on the freshness and quality of it's ingredients, where the natural flavours are allowed to shine through. Add a little bit of Greek, Roman, medieval Venetian, Persian and some Arab influences along with a verdant Mediterranean climate and you have one of the most overlooked cuisines in the world, which hopefully will change soon.If you're not sure what to order here on a visit, for mezes, (appetizers/tapas) , try the Kirmizi biberli ezme, an extremely flavourful dish with pureed red peppers, walnut and herbs. Other uniquely Turkish dishes are the Yaprak Sarmai (stuffed vine leaves with berries) , Sucuk (spicy sausage) and the Kasar Pane (Shepherd's cheese from eastern Turkey). For mains, try the Karniyarik (meat stuffed aubergine) or Manti (ravioli pasta in a yogurt and garlic sauce).I lived in Turkey for 3 years and miss some of the dishes there terribly, but at least coming here gives me a small taste of the true thing. While Su is great overall, they don't have much in the way of desserts and wish they offered some of their home grown classics like Tavuk G√∂s√º, a chicken pudding based on "blancmange", a Medieval European pudding typically made with chicken, almonds and sugar which was a very popular sweetmeat in the medieval royal courts of Europe which the Ottomans picked up. Sounds gross, I know, but once you have it, you'll never forget it. The only place you can get it now is back in Turkey.Another wonderful dessert which is absent here is Ekmek Kadayfi (almost drenched Bread pudding), smeared with kaymak, especially the fresh kind from Afyon. The cows are fed the remaining stalks of poppy plants, making them, um... very happy, which allows them to produce the thickest, freshest clotted cream you can imagine called kaymak.I think I have to buy a ticket back to Turkey soon...
Satoya=I was on my way to try Thai food from Archi's after an earlier appointment, however as I drove past the intersection of Rainbow and Sahara and looking for the name of a Japanese restaurant that I have wanted to try but somehow never did, I noticed that it has been replaced with a new Japanese restaurant and a big Grand Opening banner.  This restaurant is Sato-Ya.It is literally a family run business that has the dad working at the sushi bar, the mom and other Japanese cooks working in the kitchen and I believe the son running the front as the waiter and cashier.I decided to try their lunch combo and picked Yakiniku and Pork Cutlet and also Salmon Roll out of the available options.  A House Salad dressed in Miso dressing was quickly served (it was nice but a little too much dressing, as there were still a lot left after I was done with the greens).  The Miso Soup followed shortly and it is comforting.  After a short wait the main entree was delivered to the table, which I took pictures of, but have to quickly devour so I can be on time for my next appointment.  The Yakiniku was okay. It tastes fine, but the thin slices of beef was overcooked for my taste, but the tonkatsu was good.While I waited for my meal to be prepared I also checked out their dinner menu, which has a larger selection and also a Dinner Special section.  They also have Happy Hour from 8pm until they close at 10:30pm, which serves 1/2 items from the HH menu.The thing I was most impressed with is the fact that it is actually run by Japanese, and not Koreans, Chinese or other ethnicity, and in a subtle way you can taste the difference if you know what to look for.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with those other Japanese restaurants, but when you are looking for pure Japanese, especially with an Okinawan flavor, Sato-Ya is the place to be.Plus the service was impeccable.  The waiter checked on all the tables to make sure we were okay, and bring out whatever we ask (more water, tea, etc.) in a timely manner.  And when you pay your bill and is on your way out, he walks quickly ahead and opens the dorr for you.  Now you don't see that everyday, and certainly not at a non-Michelin Star restaurant.I will definitely be back soon to try more of their menu.  So stay tuned for the updates and the photos of the menu and the food to be uploaded after my class.4 Stars for the overall dining experience, especially on the account of the superb service.-- Review of Dinner on 9-22-10 --Leos called me about doing dinner at a new Japanese restaurant, and it turned out to be Sato-ya, where I ate lunch earlier in the day.  So we agreed to go after our class, and I can check out their other items.  We ordered off their HH & Daily Specials menu and also an Okinawa Soba Noodle (looks like udon, but tastes different, and the meat is really tender) and I thought it was good.Albacore - good and expert attention was applied.Goyo Chanpuru - Okinawan Bitter Melon sauteed with Spam and egg. Homey and I enjoyed it.Futomaki - A little different from what I have had (no spinach), but still good.Chicken Tatsuta-age - Fried marinated chicken breasts. Alright.Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna - Sushi rice that is fried so it is crispy topped with spicy tuna.  Different from your typical sushi places. Reminds us of MOS Burger items.We spoke to the owner and sushi chef "Habu" (a poisonous snake in Okinawa) and you can tell he is very passionate and an artisen in his craft.  Totally cool in my book! And he made a decorative Japanese Stork (C. Boyciana) out of 1/2 an orange! Plus showed us his avocado seed carvings!!! - again didn't know you can do that.  I eat at a lot of AYCE sushi places, but you almost never get that kind of connection with those sushi chef like we did with Chef "Habu".We will be back for more.After reading Tony T's review, I had to venture this strange westward direction, manifest destiny for good Japanese food.  I entered Sato-ya and sat at the sushi bar.  Chef Sato greeted me and explained that "ya" means house so essentially I was eating in his "home."  That sounded nice already!  The window of the restaurant has a flat screen showcasing their food (pretty cool).Inside there were specials listed.  I immediately noticed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel) and ordered it first.  Chef Sato did something Teri C. would appreciate - he carefully placed ginger and scallion on the fish with a long chopstick.  The Aji was awesome, so I next ordered shimesaba (Japanese mackerel).  The chef was surprised - an American likes mackerel this much??? ahh yes I am weird.  The saba was delicately cured, moist, and perfect, topped with a piece of kelp.  I also enjoyed agedashi tofu (good broth, crisp on outside, soft on inside, daikon and scallion) and endless hot tea as my comfort on the cool night.  Green hot tea is FREE and unlimited!  (free edamame too) Next I ordered yellowtail, and immediately noticed Chef Sato gave me belly cuts.  I thanked him and he smiled, noting that I liked fatty and oily fish so he gave me the best cut.  A regular joined me at the bar and talked about the great food.Then I had a salmon skin handroll (on special as well) complete with gobo root, bonito flake, and kaiware sprouts.  It was a bit small but less than $3.  Chef Sato blowtorched whole scallop sushi for me.  He left the abductor muscle on, so I removed it (that only seems to happen at Japanese establishments and not Korean-owned).  He topped it with yuzu pepper - a zingy heat for sure!  I finished the meal with uni, and it was succulent and fresh.  They had the Wednesday night college football game on, Chef Sato taught me some Japanese, and a couple at a nearby table just moved back to LV from Okinawa and were telling me about Japan.  Before I left, four Japanese friends sat at the bar.  The lady gave me suggestions for my honeymoon in Japan and told me Sato-ya is her favorite authentic place in town.  I can't wait to return! *Happy hour starts at 8PM****Happy Hours from 8pm-10:30pm*** **closed on Sundays** After reading Lisa L & Tony T's reviews, I decided to try this place right away... I absolutely trust their taste of food :)  I am very pleased to find this cozy place run by a nice Japanese family that I can enjoy the tasty Japanese dishes all the time.First of all, the service is fantastic!!! The servers are very attentive, always smile, and knowledgeable about the menu. Whenever, I am at this place, most of the customers are the local Japanese. They casually dine at the sushi bar and seems like they all enjoy having a conversation with a sushi chef, Sato :) They always talk quietly... I have tried.. asari miso soup(not salty at all, tasty clams were served in the soup), assorted sashimi dinner entree, all kinds of nigiris(very fresh), Japanese ceviche(if you like the taste of citrus ponzu, you will like it), crispy rice with spicy tuna(well blended taste of mayo spicy tuna & sliced jalapenos on top of crunch rice,, It's so delicious that  I always end up ordering more), spicy muscle roll(one of my favorite rolls), saba nitsuke(makerel seasoning with sake & dark soy sauce,,able to taste of sweetness & ginger,,love it!), seared tuna sashimi with salsa(the salsa was the bomb-avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber & the chef's secret sauce), nabeyaki udon(the broth was really good), the lunch box, and more. I definitely can say it is a great local Japanese restaurant that you can quietly enjoy your meal with your company or by yourself at any time of the day.I hate to be one of the only bad reviews but.... I was completely and utterly dissatisfied with my experience here tonight. First and foremost the service was great. Our server and the sushi chef were both attentive and informative. But that doesn't come close to making up for the food...We ordered two of the 14.95$ deals. They came with a Nevada Roll, Alaskan roll, white tiger roll, calamari steak, crunchy rice with spicy tuna, and baked mussels. The only thing I found edible was the white tiger roll. Everything else I couldn't even attempt to eat. The Nevada Roll was soggy and the Alaskan roll was drenched in mayonnaise. The calamari steak was so rubbery and the baked mussels weren't even warm... They too were rubbery.Like I said I hate being one of the bad reviews on here but I will never return. Not to mention I'm totally horrified I may have gotten food posioning..  I've been sick for the past hour.
Los Tacos=Sometimes, it's hard to write a review because you have to talk about food. Right now, I am so fucking full, that I have no choice but to write this review with a full stomach, and a happy heart.My coworker suggested this place for our Work Family Dinner, and we all obliged.From the outside, it looks like your typical hole in the wall Mexican/Taco joint, but when you walk in, you are surrounded by a clean habitat for the most bomb-ass Mexican food ever.I ordered one taco (cabeza...brain for you weaklings), and one quesadilla (chicken). Both were perfect.The taco, perfectly cooked on fresh tortillas, surrounded by onions, and guac. The quesadilla was PERFECT!! Chicken that melted off the fork, and so much flavor, it was as if the chicken was born in the sauce and spices it was cooked in.Will I come back? Hell yes. Will I feel bad about it later? Probably, but who cares. YOLO. hahaha Hint...be adventurous, and not a food wuss. Don't ask for things "healthy" or say eww just because the menu items have cabeza, buche or lengua. Man up, and be the adventurous person you claim you are. Otherwise....you are a poser. And no one wants to be a poser.This was a stop on a taco trek UYE and I was glad because I always see it, but never go because Tacos El Gordo is next door. This place is pricey! I was shocked at the prices for being a fast food place with a drive-thru. The tacos are $3 each and that is before toppings. If you want cheese, avocado and sour cream it will cost you $5 per taco. The tacos tasted somewhat OK but some of my asada meat was cooked crispy and it seemed the tacos were filled with more salsa and junk then meat. It was a hot damn mess to eat. I just don't like getting ripped off when the taco doesn't even taste authentic and the tacos are overpriced. If you see the picture of my 2 tacos you will think it looks good but are you willing to pay $10 plus tax for them? After buying a drink my total was almost $14. Like I said it didn't taste bad but it wasn't anything close to Tacos El Gordo which is in the same parking lot and right next door! Just go to El Gordo trust me!This is one of my absolute favorite taco shops. I wish there was one closer to my house, although it would really effect my waistline. The tacos are huge. I highly recommend getting them fully loaded... Price usually works out to be about $5 with everything, but it's worth it. AI love the green sauce... I love to smother my taco with it. I've also tried the ceviche, and it was pretty good. I also love the corn quesadilla with carne asada. I love the ease of the drive thru.
PBR Rock Bar & Grill=I wish I could give them 0 stars.We made a point of visiting PBR while NASCAR was in town (March 9-11, 2012) only because of their PBR promotional flyers & website ads which read: Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.I was in charge of picking the bar to enjoy the Saturday (Nationwide) race. Out of all the sports bars (or bars for that matter) in Las Vegas, I brought our group of five to PBR because of the promotion. We planned on eating and drinking for two hours and then enjoy the free drinks an hour after the race and then take 10% off the dining portion of our bill. Unfortunately things did not go that way.I made a reservation via OpenTable for five, and when we arrived I asked for the hostess to seat us so we had a tv with a view of the race. She replied, "we have tvs everywhere, I'm sure you'll see the race." She proceeded to sit us at a booth that fit five people comfortably, yet NOT ONE TV HAD THE RACE ON - all were on college basketball. Before the hostess left I said to her, "can we change a tv to the race?" She replied, "only the manager can change the channels - I'll have him come over."The manager does not arrive, but our waitress does. She gives us menus and takes our drink order. I tell her our predicament and she replied she'd send the manager over. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we still hadn't seen the manager and were missing our sporting event. Our waitress apologized profusely and said she didn't know what more to do - she had asked the manager to come over multiple times and change the channel for us. Just to be clear, no one was watching the tv we wanted changed. Upset I was being ignored and missing the race, I got up, took my bucket of beers and walked over to a table near the bar which had a view of three tvs showing the race. Next a bus boy walks up to our table and says, "you can't sit here - that table has been assigned to someone else already. You need to visit the hostess to get a table." I replied to him, "No, I am sitting here because I asked to be seated in an area with the race and was not, and your manager is too busy to come and change a damn channel for us - so I am sitting here." Of course he didn't like my answer and went to the hostess. Now the hostess comes to our table and says, "you can't sit here I have this table booked for another party." Not only did I repeat my comment, but my husband was even louder. She turned and walked away.Our first waitress came over to our table and introduced us to our new waiter. In front of us she explained our predicament and told us the bucket of beer would be moved over to a new ticket and apologized she couldn't get the manager to change a channel for us. We told her it wasn't her fault and we would be happy now that we could see the race. She was not upset and our new waiter was happy to serve us. We thought all was on the right track.Well, we won our bet on the race (YEAH!) but as soon as they waved the checkered flag we asked for our free drinks per the promotion. Our waiter told us the only beer selections were Bud or Bud Light. We don't drink Bud or Bud Light - so we had a well drink. It was healthy and we were happy. As soon as we finished the first drink was asked for a second. Again, we figured since the promotion was an open bar for one hour - the service would be slow and we would get at most three free drinks. Well get this: upon ordering our second well drink our waiter tells us, "oh, it's just ONE free drink." And I said, "WHAT?!"Again, promotion read:  Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, ***as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.*** Where does that say ONE DRINK? BULLSH*T!At that point I ask for the check because I was through with crappy establishment. And when I asked for the bill I reminded them of the 10% dining discount. This time our waiter said, "Oh, that discount is if you don't get a free drink - it's either one or the other." My husband came unglued! I think I cursed. Our waiter said, "Let me check though, you are my first customers asking for the discount."'Fuming, I sat at the table thinking about all the other bars we could've enjoyed the race as well as spent our out of town dollar...the food was barely average (I had a salad and my husband had a burger) and the service was horrible from the hostess & manager (waitstaff worked very hard). Our waiter returned and said, "Sorry, I was wrong, you do get 10% off your dining portion" as we all made some sort of comment about actually doing what your promotion says.I am also going to review this horrible establishment on OpenTable too. Seriously people - this place sucked. STAY AWAY!I have never had the urge to eat here but my friends didn't want to wait in line for food, so we ended up here because they had no wait. It is good as a bar environment, if you want a bustling atmosphere where you can cheer for your favorite sports team, watch some people attempt to ride the mechanical bull, get drunk and eat a bit of appetizers. Don't come here if you are looking forward to a super appetizing meal. It is essentially just bar food that is served. I ate the Chili Cheese Taters and the PBR Burger. The food is heavy and there is nothing special about it. Most of our stomachs felt unsettled after eating here. Additionally, our waitress was grumpy and didn't do much to ensure we were having a good experience. I would rather eat elsewhere but if I were into sports I would probably go back for drinks during a game.There is no guarantee of tomorrow. It is so important to make the most of each day and night. My dear friend Christie and I made the most of last Friday night when we met her lifelong friends at PBR Rock Bar.   From a local's perspective, driving to PBR Rock Bar is a nightmare. It is not like the Voodoo Lounge or Level 107 Lounge where you pull in from a 4-lane arterial into a well designed parking garage. The local has to maneuver through the mayham of the Strip area traffic. The worst part is maneuvering through the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile parking garage. It is a poorly designed parking lot without notice that the motorist is driving the wrong way. Once the local finds the parking spot, it is a walk through the corridors of Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood to reach PBR Rock Bar where the mall touches the Las Vegas Strip. Now, If your vacationing on the Strip, PBR Bar is a short walk off the sidewalk.  PBR Rock Bar is really two different bars under one business. You have the indoor bar and nightclub overlooking the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlooking the mid Strip. This is where the high energy is. When you look up you could see the Cosmopolitan tower, when you look straight you see a Las Vegas Strip bordered by Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan. In the near distance the intermittent Bellagio Fountains dance and the Eiffel Tower stands tall. In the near distance, the sidewalks are prime people watching. Looking into the bar, there stands the mechanical bull. The mechanical bull is really a symbol of their business practice. They really take the customer for a ride by charging different prices for the exact beverage. That is bull!  In hindsight I regret not riding the mechanical bull. I think it would of been a lot of fun. In reality, my eyes and attention were on my company. The volume of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one another. Christie and I started out in the indoor bar. When you arrive from the Planet Hollywood parking garage, you enter through the indoor bar. From this angle, the outdoor patio is camouflaged by a wall and dim interior. After Christie's friends called her we'd find our way to the outdoor patio. This is where we'd spend around 3 hours of our lives.    There is an admission price for guys. Even guys who drink girl drinks :-). The admission is $10. But it includes a drink. For the Las Vegas Strip this is a decent deal. The average drink on the Las Vegas Strip is $12. And if I'm not mistaken, a 22 ounce beer upstairs in Twin Peaks is $10. Once your in the bar, a click on the Yelp application illuminates the buy one get one free drink check-in. The average drink is around $12. By the conclusion of the 3 drinks, people ought to be up in Space Mountain-a state of a nice relaxing buzz.    By the time I drank the three drinks, I was up in Space Mountain enjoying a nice relaxing buzz. I enjoyed two Blue Hawaiins and a Bahamas Mama. Supposedly they are girl drinks. But I got to be a man and tell the truth. They were delicious but nothing spectacular. The bartenders didn't even bother to add a maraschino cherry. They came in a plastic cup. They were a delicious route to get to Space Mountain. They taste like fruit punch with alcohol. Now high up in Space Mountain,  I thought I was being funny and managed to drink Christie's Whiskey Neat. I am no connoisseur on whiskey, but it was decent and put me to the summit of Space Mountain. When I brought Christie, a replacement Whiskey Neat I was incognizent to the idea that the bartender charged different prices for the exact drink. I'd end the night with the least expensive beer. It was PBR. Although I was in no state to keep track of the price, I think it was $5.  Now back to Earth and off Space Mountain,  when I reflect on PBR Rock Bar, I see 3 stars. I dislike the inconsistency in price. However, there is a high energy level to the place. Its setting on the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of the Cosmopolitan Tower and in the sightlines of The Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower is high energy. $25 for a nice buzz is a good deal. Most of all I enjoy the memories of spending three hours here with my friend and her friends.After coming in last year and having a good time to stopping in again and having the worst service ever I've gotta change my rating. Seriously. Service was really bad. The server repeatedly forgot drinks we had ordered and then would disappear for what seemed like forever. The worst thing was, my food sucked. I ended up scarfing down some of my friends BBQ chicken pizza because my buffalo chicken pizza, that sounded so good, in reality was not. It just tasted hot. Like burn my mouth hot. But no buffalo flavor. Does that make sense? It just wasn't good. I'd probably still buy the cheap drinks at their bar or counter in PH, but i wouldn't come and eat again. Stick to the drinks! Don't tell me I didn't warn you!Fun & loud place filled with lots of interesting people...This place has a great design to it and a fun menu with really delicious creamy deviled eggs, mac & cheese coated with Doritos (wrong in all the right ways), fried pickles, decadent nachos, great spinach & artichoke dip and so many more fun plates! We came here as a large group and it was perfect for sharing a bunch of appetizers and delicious cocktails! They have cocktail bowls here that are massive and will f@$k you up! The Caribbean sunset one was my favorite, Malibu coconut rum, Bacardi and orange & pineapple juice! A tropical paradise in a cup or bowl...If you want a loud spot with Rock & Roll blaring this is it! Bull riding anyone? This place has you covered. One cocktail bowl and you'll find yourself in Urban Cowboy! I love that movie...The PBR Rockbar was the neutral meeting spot for my party. I checked-in here with Yelp so I got the buy one drink get one free deal, that was cool; but the drink I ordered had pineapple juice in it, and I believe it was bad or the cup wasn't clean I don't know which but I swear the drink tasted like ice cold vomit. When we took the drink back to the bartender all she said was oh no the pineapple juice is good, smh it was soooo disgusting.  Where in the hell was John Taffer when I needed him!?!?! I can't believe I even tried to force myself to drink that sh!t. She took our drinks and threw  them out and said if we wanted new drinks we had to pay again,yeah right. Fxck these drinks. The first drink was just ok, and the second round tasted like vomit, umm pass. Probably would have tasted better if I was already drunk, but vomit flavored is very hard to ignore. There were some guys there playing beer pong, and they had the ball flying all over the damn place. A few times the ball was on the floor in the corner where the "VIP" couch and main window/wall is, if you look on the ground and see the filth build-up smh, I was thinking these MF'ers are gonna have Hepatitis A by the end of the night. Beer or alcohol doesn't kill everything, but good luck guys! What I was really surprised about was the music though. With the name of it being PBR Rockbar I expected to hear mostly Country or Rock, but they had a mix of Hip-Hop playing, old Hip-Hop but still. Anyway this wasn't a great experience for me and I don't feel like this is my type of bar anyway, so more than likely I would personally not come back here to spend money.
Pizza Hut=Pay attention.So the Mrs. placed an online order. The process was easy. Instead of delivery, we decided to have it picked up. Called into the location and told them I wanted to come in myself. After giving me and my wifes name the order was found, ( wow not organized at all ) . "Yes you can pick it up." Mind you, the new order total at the time with delivery charge is $19 and some change. 1830 I showed up to pick up. What do you know, couldn't find me again, so I looked up the confirmation. Yup there I am, and guess what, the driver is on his way to deliver the order.WOW REALLY?!!So I waited for him to come back. "It's Sunday, so stay calm Mikey." So the driver comes back and I'm shown my ordered pizzas. Ok they're good. Time to pay.  $32 and some change is the total. !!!!!WHAAAT!!!!? Ok explain. "Well the previous total was for delivery only. Since it was changed to pick up, the deal does not apply." GEEEZ!! RAAAAGE!!! PEE OWED!! is whats going on inside of me, but in the outside, "So then thats it?" Yup pretty much. All I got was a "I'm sorry that happened." When all they had to do was honor it. You couldn't find the order, you had me wait for your driver, and you upcharge me for coming myself to pick it up?!! REALLY!!!?? .. You know what, I'll cook. There's a reason why your customers are not happy or satisfied with you guys. Check the reviews. Pay a freakin attention. Waste of time. There's a Domino's down the street, or even Rossotis. It's bad enough I saw one of your cooks dropping food in the back kitchen area. Yes, the one with the bangs hanging from the front of his hat. Dropped a chicken wing while putting it in the order basket. Ask him what he did with it. Sorry I can not give 0 stars. They deserve it.
BRGR=Poor Brgr! I went here about a week after I went to the new Wingharts burger joint down in Market Square. I think Brgr would have held up in the bigger better burger contest if I had tried this burger first. Since it was after Wingharts KILLER char-grilled burger deliciousness, it's sadly going to get a much lower rating. Don't get me wrong, the shroomz burger at brgr (I had to...) was tasty, but it just doesn't hold a pickle to this other burger. And by pickle, I mean the tiny little gherkin they perch on the top of Brgr's burgers. The thing I will rave about was the boozy milkshakes. I wish it was humanly possible to slurp down 5 of these like you can any other delicious cocktail, but really, that's not humanly possible without feeling like you're going to die. I got the boozy Almond milkshake, which had Ameretto and Kahlua mixed in with ice cream. To top that off, there was sugary almond treats at the bottom. My heaven would include these milkshakes being served at the pearly gates entrance! The service initially was so so. I had called earlier in the day to try and reserve a table for our party of 15. The person on the phone was a little pissy and told me they don't take reservations. I said, well I just want to let you know then that we have this large party coming in. He said, and I quote, that they only had 70 seats, with some being couches and two tops. Those 15 seats would take up most of their seating. I'm no mathematician, but really dude?! Do they not understand that we'll be spending a lot of money, especially with the part of the crew that likes to overindulge on the booze. So we get there and the hostess, and what I assume are the manager, are just walking back and forth around an L shaped area of seats and a longer set of seats. I went up to them and was like....we'll squish, just put that long set of tables together. I worked at a restaurant for 5 years, I picked a thing or two up I suppose. After that, service was just fine! I would totally go to Brgr again and space out my boozy milkshake intake after a meal, but I'm not sure I would come back JUST for a Burger. So for Brgr I say no burger but a round of boozy milkshakes for ALL!!The burgers are outstanding but, the customer service could be better. My wife, daughter and I decided to give this place a try. I must say I really dig the decor. It is very manly with lots of TVs on the walls, nice shades of blue and grey. Two huge all glass garage doors that open to let the warm weather in. There is a decent size bar area also, There is even a outdoor level on the second floor. We were seated promptly and handed menus. We order our drinks. My wife and I got Cokes and our daughter got a chocolate milk. When our drinks came my daughter tasted her milk and said it tasted funny. My wife smelled and tasted it. It was spoiled! I'm glad I didn't get a milkshake if they are using spoiled milk! We flagged down the waitress and told her that our daughter's milk was spoiled. She apologized and said she tasted it before she brought it out. You tasted my daughter's chocolate milk?! Are you going to taste our burgers too? I knew she was full of it because if she did taste it she would have know it was spoiled! She replaced it with a Coke and all was well. We already knew what we wanted as we looked at the menu already online but, the burgers we wanted weren't on the menu. Maybe they change ever so often. They do offer kids meals. Don't ask me why they are not listed on the menu. For kids meals they offer a cheeseburger, grill cheese or hot dog which includes fries and a drink. My daughter got the cheeseburger and loved it. I believe the kids burger is the same size as a adult burger as she could only finish half of it. My wife got the "Cease & Desist" which consists of a burger with American cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 island dressing. Pretty much their version of a Big Mac. I had the "Button Buster" which consists of a burger topped with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar cheese, b√©arnaise aioli and crispy onion rings. It was outstanding! I especially liked the bun as it was coated with butter and then lightly toasted. My wife and I shared a order of BRGR Fries tossed with parmesan and herbs and topped with cheese whiz. They were really good as well. Our waitress came over with drink refills without being asked I might add (which always gets you a few extra bucks in your tip from me), as we were eating to tell us that her shift was over at BrGr and she was going over next door to Spoon to start her shift there. And that we would be taken care of by her replacement. We sat waiting for a good ten to fifteen minutes for our check and a doggy bag. My wife flagged down a waitress would then got our replacement waitress to bring our check. Other then our daughter's spoiled milk and taking forever to get our check we really liked BrGr and would have given it 5 stars. We will defiantly be back!We had a catered event by BRGR in the top deck of the restaurant this week and I have to say it was really nice! The deck is pretty and has a nice view of the church and city. They had a variety of half burgers from the menu available. Because they were half burgers you have the opportunity to try a few different burgers. They also served their special crack dip ( it's a chili-esque, thin dip) served with tortillas. My favorite part was the potato salad. It's filled with fresh dill, and absolutely delish!The only improvement I would suggest is that they don't have capabilites to have a full bar upstairs. Soooo, they had to climb up and down the stairs to get drinks and it took forever....
Capital Tap Haus=My wife and I stopped in to try some beers on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. We waited probably 10-15 minutes for a small high-top table next to the packed bar. We both ordered a couple beers which were OK but not great.Our server asked what we'd like to order and we told her we just wanted to try a couple beers, we'd already had something to eat earlier. She responded saying she'd "have to ask us to leave" because they only allow people who are ordering food at the tables. Being that the bar was packed and there was a perimeter of 2-3 people standing around it, that didn't really seem like such a great suggestion to a paying customer. I seriously couldn't believe I'd just been told to leave the establishment because I wasn't ordering food. That was a 1st for me and the last time I'll ever visit or purchase anything from that brewery. Luckily none of their beers are that great anyway...
Orient House=My favorite reviews are those where people actually name the food they ordered , that makes me happy and helps me when looking at the menu. Yelp reviews swirl through my mind and a lot of the time I order based off of  Yelper's reviews whom I trust have similar taste and expectation to my own.Orient House  has two styles to offer, the Americanized and the more traditional. I tried both. I had the chicken and snap peas, and for dessert the red bean paste bun. You get a lot for the price. I thought my entree was great, the sauce was light and the peas crunchy not overcooked. They gave 10 red bean paste buns! That's a lot! Also, I ordered delivery at 9:45pm from their online ordering on their website, and Yelp says they close at 10pm.... They delivered to me by about 10:30pm, so one can order all the way up to closing. My new delivery spot when I don't want to spend too much.
Naked City Pizza on Arville=Note to self: next time I go to a place called a "sandwich shop," maybe I should order a sandwich?!Actually, my "Naked Chop" aka a chopped salad with turkey, greens, carrot, tomato, onion, and avocado wan't bad... it didn't blow me away either.  And it took awhile to make!  I was with Misti Y and we came here straight from the airport.  I must've worked up quite an appetite flying in from LA, because I was pretty hungry when we arrived... but I felt like a salad, so that's what I ordered.  It just wasn't the most filling salad around.  Hence, my "note to self" above...I'd give this place another shot and I suggest you do if you're in the hood, but take my advice - order a sandwich, not a salad!I was very excited to hear that one of my favorite sandwich shops was opening a Pizza joint.  So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!The restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.The Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.The second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.The third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.The last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.Moondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)Will I return?  You bet your Naked Heiney I will!!! I want to try some of the other Pies and definitely the other Subs that they don't have at their Sandwich Shop.I love the Naked City Sandwich Shop on Las Vegas Blvd, but we went there last weekend and discovered it was closed and had now "merged" with the pizza place inside of Moondoggies.We went there today and placed an order for 1 sandwich and a 1/4 sheet pizza at 11:15.  25 minutes later, my husband went up to ask if we could have the sandwich out first if the pizza was taking a while to cook.  The only lady working in the kitchen replied, "I'm trying to get it all together."  20 minutes later, we still had no food.  We waited 45 MINUTES for a sandwich and a mini pizza.  Ended up just leaving because we were so hungry and frustrated, and the lady ran after us into the parking lot.The loooonnggg wait time, not to mention the fact that it's now inside a dirty, dark bar with people getting plastered at 11:15 in the morning makes me not recommend this place.  Sorry, Naked City...you have fallen from my good graces."I didn't know it was a take and bake pizza." I took a bite of the crust as I love a good crust and that bite was really yeasty/doughy. I looked at the dough where I bit and was still translucent so therefore still raw. I grabbed from the other side of the pizza my 2nd slice, without crust. That was cooked, but still needed to be baked for a better consistency. I looked carefully at the pizza and the dough was rolled unevenly so the sloppy base made for the uneven cook. Like Angela stated about the sauce- she had a slice with no sauce and I had a slice that I could see the sauce present without digging for it. Shouldn't have to re-bake or watch each bite for raw spots when Angela H and I were plenty happy to wait 20 minutes to get a 'za but could wait longer if it meant not rushing to get it done. I looked at the crust on peoples pictures and can see those are brown and toppings like pepperoni are crisping at the edges. Just so people don't think I'm just looking for something to hate (though my review pattern is rarely negative) please look at the pictures. I posted a piece of pizza with all the toppings off so you can see the crust thickness change and the pale pizza crust and bottom. I'm sure some people will say "it's just a bad day" but uneven pizza dough and sauce is careless and seeing the crust isn't even brown but choosing to box it up anyways isn't the pride and quality control I'd expect from a raved about place. Yes, I cook some shit wrong, made a new recipe and it sucked- not for lack of care but inexperience. I've cooked certain things over and over (like you do at a restaurant) and can keep a decent standard on such items because I baby it and won't serve what isn't at least cooked well.  It LOOKED good, SMELLED good on the drive back home, the toppings were quality, but if you don't have the dough down right, cooked right then it isn't a fucking pizza. Might as well put those toppings on some sandwich rolls so I can enjoy the nicely spice-y sausage bits, red pepper, olives and pepperoni. Grease doesn't bother me too much, but just a note there was a good amount of it to dab off. $17 for a large and the only consolation I suppose is the groupon. Also we got cheese bread which gives me visions of dough bits with cheese. We got a sandwich roll stuffed with some cheese, mostly spinach and chopped garlic. I'd be cool with a spinach sandwich but it needed more seasonings other than the garlic so it was just A-OK. The settings really don't help. Neither of us was aware of what Moondoggies was about and partly wasn't sure if we have the right place without any pizza indicators on the outside. Odd that there isn't even a little sign... Alright, odd that it's in a bar, but I can dig it like how some  PTs have Robertos tacos attached. It's not quite separate but connected to the bar situation, but just a window on the wall of the bar where you can order.  It was just an odd vibe for two ladies to walk into a bar full of men with a few stopping to look at what we were doing. Odd vibes and no real seating aside from the bar or pool table, we hightailed our plans of staying in and took it to-go. Takes a lot to make two loud, social with all kinds of people kind of bitches want to just go home instead of stay in a environment. It wouldn't have been a place we could have comfortable conversation. I don't get the hype. I don't know about second chances with this one.Groupons FTW! I'll make this clear right now. I have not tried their pizza. I was there specifically for the Poutine.After zip lining down Fremont Street, we decided to hit up Naked City to use up my $20 Groupon. That got us a large Poutine ($5), 20 Hot Chicken Wings ($13), and a slice of cheese pizza ($2). The pizza slice was for my friend. I had no interest in trying it.So how was the Poutine? I can't compare to the Poutine I've had in Toronto because it's been a couple of years. For sure, it was Freakin' Huge. That's actually the size designation - Freakin' Huge (not "large" as I stated earlier). I'm not really sure if they use cheese curds, but it was yummy and gooey, albeit slightly salty after a while. It's definitely something you could share with a few people.The Chicken Wings were also good. It's not hard to make good wings, but I suppose it's not hard to mess them up either. My cousin said she really enjoyed them, but she admitted that she's been craving wings recently. I give them the thumbs up. They were pretty large too.Moon Doggies is not really a place I'm in a hurry to revisit, but if I'm ever craving Poutine again, I know where to go.Groupon alert!As a Groupon addict, I'm always excited when they offer one for a place I've been dying to try. We decided to order a pizza for takeout, since we were feeling pretty lazy after an exhausting weekend of doing nothing. I decided on a Not so Wee Royal and a Wee garlic fries. I was tempted by the Poutine, but I'm just not a big fan of gravy and cheese. I ordered the pizza on the well-done side based on some previous reviews about the pizza being under or unevenly cooked. When I got the pizza home, I was excited to take a bite. I didn't find any of the crust or dough issues that previous reviewers had mentioned luckily, so I was happy about that. I adored the texture. It was chewy and I really enjoyed the sauce. The added touch of ricotto was delightful and added a sweet flavor to accompany the savory. I was very happy with this pizza. My fella, on the other hand, wasn't as impressed. He stuck mainly with the garlic fries, which were much more garlicky than I would like. If only they used real garlic instead of garlic salt and I would've been sold!All in all, I was very happy with my meal here. I have a feeling I won't be eating here too often, unless I go with a friend. Hehe.I look forward to trying more menu items here sometime soon.I have to remind myself that this is bar and I am rating bar food. So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them.This menu is a fat kid's dream come true!!!!!!  Just look at some of the combos and toppings they got on these pizzas!!  This comes pretty close to last meal/end of the world type food for me.  If you have a "cheat day" on your schedule, you might want to make it a "cheat week" after ingesting all these glorious calories, saturated fat and cholesterol at one sitting.  We ordered a full Royal sandwich and the wee (smallest) Guinea pie which is really not wee at all could feed 3 Japanese people for lunch alone.  I now know why The Royal was rated one of the best sandwiches in Vegas last year by LV Weekly.  I loved how they just made the Italian sausage into one huge patty layered with all this cappicola and mozzarella.  A total flavor explosion!  The Guinea pie was equally as awesome with meatballs, spinach and cheese, cheese, cheese.  I really liked the thick crust.  We had no shot at finishing everything but they made for some great leftovers the next day.  Tons of other menu items I look forward to having like "The Stinger" which features chicken fingers, steak, three cheeses, hot & sweet peppers, blue cheese and lettuce in one sandwich!!  What??????  That's Man vs Food type shiznit right there!I also dug all the rock music they played in the bar.  Service was very friendly too.  This is also a Buffalo Bills bar so be warned.I don't really understand the great ratings for this place, I'm hoping I caught them on a bad night.I'll be brief.The pizza was nothing special and the service was God awful.  The people watching was great, if watching a couple dry hump is your thing.  Most of the bar patrons were DEEEEEEEE runk.  Note that I had been drinking and was pretty far from sober myself.I'll be back in the area to eat next door at Desnudo Tacos, but doubt I'll eat here again.  That is all.EPIC pizza hidden inside Moon Doggies off Arville And Desert Inn. Pizza Aficionados welcome, and bring an appetite. I nominate the Guinea Pie for best white pizza of the year. ''Please cast your vote by clicking the cool icon''. The Pizza here is made from scratch down to the meatballs, and the quality is noticeable. Due to this added quality assurance protocol and time honored method of ''Freshly prepared,'' you may have to wait for your food. Be prepared for a lengthy wait, though it is well worth it. Prices also reflect quality, but again the increase is worth it, and I will say a mediocre increase considering the taste and quality are exceptional.  Here you order your pizza by the sheet. 1/4 of a sheet was more then enough to feed 2 friends and myself, and half a sheet should keep your fridge well stocked with delicious cold pizza leftovers. A whole sheet? I dare not order it. That's cold pizza for a week! Think of it as the birthday party pizza. Suicide Fries = HOT FRIES. I like hot, and the sauce on these should not disappoint unless you inhale Ghost peppers by the handful, then you sir are the exception. The added plus of being located in a bar is the drinking options. You have plenty of beer and hard liquor choices to cover all bases. Enjoy your epic pizza!
Janey's Cave Creek=There are a remarkable number of indie coffeehouses in Cave Creek/Carefree for such a small area, but Janey's is hands down my absolute favorite. The coffee is superb - beans are supplied by The Roastery of Cave Creek - and always hand-crafted perfectly to your specifications. The food is delish, always fresh and made when you order, not before. They have a lovely, well-edited wine selection, including a Riesling I was pleasantly surprised to also see offered at Zinc Bistro, and some great beer on tap. Stop by Thursday nights for local music, or weekend mornings to enjoy chats with the locals around the outdoor fire (in the winter, of course!).It is important to me to spend my money in locally-owned, family-operated business whenever possible, and that's another reason why I love this place. It is truly a family labor of love - all of them work here, and you'll see them all circle through if you sit there long enough. You're apt to be there all day if you sink into one of the overstuffed leather armchairs... Free wifi so you can work if you're so inclined.The highlight of Janey's, other than the great coffee, food and bar, are their two affable Afghan hounds, Moses and Ghandi. While some people come by just to play with the dogs, I suggest you at least enjoy a cup of coffee while you do so : ) Bring your own pooch too - Janey's patio is a great doggy hangout!Yoga Breeze was doing a full moon yoga session on the patio in warmer weather, and hopefully that will resume when this Arctic freeze we're experiencing ends.And by the way, if you can't handle a little dust on your car a la the dude from Glendale below, you probably shouldn't be coming to Cave Creek. But I think if dirt parking lots don't bother the owners of the multi-million dollar homes in town with vehicles to match, you could probably let it slide, too. If not, there's a $5 car wash up the road.
Holstein's Shakes & Buns=It all started with The Drunken Monkey which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. Hands down the best milkshake I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's Malted Banana Gelato, Peanut Butter Crisps, Frangelico and priced at $11. Whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. Genius. It is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by the booze. On to the grub. Starters: Philly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls with udder sauce $11 They were alright, but could have used more seasoning. The meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. I did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. For the beef and fake beef selections we had: The Classic with Two Dollar Cheddar (ridiculous) $15 Urth Burger with One Dollar Swiss $14 New Delhi Chicken $14 All served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. I ordered Ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the Monkey Shake. As far as the burgers go my burger was ordered Medium and came to me very well done. I ate one third of it. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. The veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. Pretty good. The Chicken burger could have been executed better. The chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. Overall I will absolutely be back because The Cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. The menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as Bull's Balls, Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Duck Confit Street Tacos. I will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!Gonna start with desert.The adult shakes are incredible espicaly the orange creamsicle (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a root beer float with pop rocks and rum).  The food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new American fusion.  You are rewarded for being adventurous.  The "Street Tacos" are made from duck confit, foie gras cranberry relish.  They are incredible.  Other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. The crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  Served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.Meat in a tube is well represented.  Try the Greek touri.  Different but very flavorful.Finally, the burgers.  Although I'm still partial to the Burger Bar, Holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  Cooked perfectly to order.  The "Rising Sun" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.Service is fast and efficient.One final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the Strip.Passion. Many of the earth walkers lack this. Many proclaim to have it. They're just lying to themselves. Being a die hard Rage Against the Machine fan isn't passion. That's just plain old shitty taste in music. I, on the other money clenching hand, have passion. In fact, I have many of them. The Filet O Fish passion being the strongest and most lucrative. Another of them is, that I am/was chomping at the bit to turn Osama Bin Laden's head into a canoe. That one can be let go of...maybe. Another (the list goes on and on), and probably more important, cheeseburgers. Warmly situated in The Cosmopolitan, where I can be my usual mogul self and drop $17 for a burger and cutesy mini bucket of steak fries, enjoy them, and not be hounded for autographs and paparazzi. I have grown tired of putting my sharpie to bare supple breasts and cheeks of the buttocks of attractive, but morally questionable women. I don't quite remember which burger I ordered, but I do recall letting out a, "Mmmm-mmm, that is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?" Blame the torrential down pour of Goose and Tonics from the the previous night for my lack of memory. However this review is more than fuckin' helpful. The duck fat fries are no longer on the menu. So you novelty food seeking bastards are in for a rude surprise. See, bishes....helpful. Suck on it. The kimchi quesadilla is good and spicy, but you might be hard pressed to find it worth the $14. Not me, I just refinanced my 1995 Maserati. So I'm good with the loot.Excuse me, I have to go water my passion(s).Rule No. 1:  Don't piss me off before I even get seated.Rule No. 2:  Refer to Rule No. 1Fresh from a Cosmopolitan Event at the Yard, their fourth floor pool, with ThreeKindsOfRumAndMangoPuree powerhouse drink in hand, my husband and I descended from up above for a burger at Holstein's.  Having attended a lot of beautiful, upscale, free functions at the Cosmopolitan, making it my favorite casino hotel, it was time to give back and actually patronize and pay for a meal there. Now I've traveled a good part of the world and most of the United States, and almost always have something drinkable in my hand, usually a Starbucks cup but, in a casino it's more likely a glass of wine after I've been gambling for a while.  Never, ever, ANYWHERE, have I been told that I can't bring an outside drink in.  This forced me either to leave the drink or chug-a-lug it.  Guess what I did?  But I wasn't happy.  The manager, when asked about their policy, was completely lame.  "We don't want anyone to get drunk."  Duh, is that why they have a full bar, complete with multiple flat screen TVs showing all manner of sports programs???  Bad beginning.  But I have to tell you that my burger - the California Turkey burger - may have been the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Moist.  Perfectly seasoned.  On a bun that was dense, so it didn't turn to mush like at all the other burger joints.  With all the other good stuff, too:  guacamole, pepper jack cheese, a huge tomato slice that was actually red and ripe, and a bit of slaw.  The steak fries were crisp, hot, and stayed hot, probably due to the little metal pail they're served in.My husband had Brisket Burger, a beef burger with a topping of juicy brisket in barbecue sauce.   He loved it.  He also loved his sweet potato fries, which were presented as one of the four potato options to accompany the burger.  But he wasn't told that there was a two-buck upcharge for them, which is a no-no in my book.We didn't try the shakes, because we were too full from all the drinks and chips we stuffed ourselves with upstairs, but they look great.  Our waitress was efficient, but not all that friendly, until she delivered the check.  Then it was all smiles and profuse thanks.  And we did appreciate the 15% discount for locals, though I'm not sure if it's a regular policy or because we bitched about the drinks.Given the quality of the food, we'll definitely go back.  Hmmm, if I pour my drink into a Starbucks cup, I wonder...It's almost hard to believe that Holstein's is run by the same people responsible for LBS at the Red Rock. I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.What that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.The Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).My wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.Each burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.Our son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.Even after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.Despite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. I'm not sure if I'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.Hands down the best burger place in town. I am writing this review after the 2nd time coming here...forgive me...I am a very busy person with 2 crazy monkeys to raise...Yelp kinda takes a back seat. I was lucky enough to come here a second time with my BESTEST FOODIE FRIEND, Rob M. (LL Cool Mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (I told you I was a busy girl). It wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. On our way back to our table I spotted the server we had last time...The lovely NOELLE. Noelle is what every server should aspire to be. She is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. If you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). We had the most amazing food:-New Belgium Hoptober beer-Lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a MUST...you will be licking the plate clean)-Mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a wild mushroom demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)-The Gold Standard burger (what they are famous for...I can see why)-The Drunken Monkey adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. They loved it)-Maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow I died and went to heaven).Now the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. Good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. I appreciated the wait time in between courses so I could digest and really enjoy all my food. If you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. Also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. You are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. If you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. I will be back soon and hopefully Miss Noelle will be our girl again.Came here on a Saturday night about 9 ish with 2 friends. We couldn't find any place to eat without a long wait or prior reservations, so we popped a squat in the lounge area. A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.We ordered simple little meals as follows:Red Stripe - $7Dragon Fruit Drink - $10Black and White Shake - $8Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9Truffle Lobster $16.50Pizza Twinkies $12Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack. I tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.The colorful graffiti art is a little in-your-face & is so trendy, it'll be out of style by the time I post this review, but it fits just right into The Cosmopolitan. Glamourous-sounding burgers, shakes with a shot of alkie (because last night's bender was not enough) & fashionable items like pork belly & lobster rolls...it's so been there, done that. The menu is so unapologetically predictable but I can't say I'm disappointed. Our meal before flying home consisted of:-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating.-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy! -- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right. -- 'tiny buns' Maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. Loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns. -- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): I wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, I couldn't do it. Yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: BF prefers chairman bao.) Four stars because I love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because I want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu. Like I said, predictably trendy, but it's got me interested.Out of all the places we experienced this trip to Vegas, this was by far the most memorable, happy and delicious dining experience we had!    Let me just say I'm a huge Top Chef fan.  Also a huge Yelper.  So I had done a lot of research before our trip to Vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  Having been a fan of Carlos on Top Chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), I really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.   So, early on a Monday night, we stepped into Holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  Waitress was quick and friendly.  Service could not have been better.  We were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...I ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but I knew I could count on Husband for that and he did indeed order the Birthday cake one).  Having eaten at Wicked Spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger.      THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER* / 16.5BEEF PATTY CRUSTED WITH BLACK PEPPER, HOLSTEINS CREAMY STEAK SAUCE, MARMALADE ONIONS, TOMATO CONFIT, WILD MUSHROOMS, SWISS CHEESE.    I asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as I don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  He chose shoestring fries for the side.     I asked the waitress if the "Top Chef" happened to be there on a Monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  She said she didn't know but would check.  Next thing I know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  What a delightful friendly guy!  AND he informed us that he had hired Craig from the same Top Chef series.  Yep.  A little while later Carlos came out with Craig!  Husband took my picture with both of them!  Oh my gosh, I'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and I so respected them and appreciated them for it.  And now I was not only meeting them but eating their food!  This burger was the best burger I've ever had (sorry Bobby Flay, you've finally been surpassed).  And fortunately Husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of the burger so I got it.  (waitress later told us that it had FIVE scoops of ice cream in it).    So, full, dessert was mentioned.  I said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  No they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  I expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  Next thing I know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and BACON.  YUM YUM YUM.    THANK YOU Holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to Vegas!  Excellent waitress (sorry I can't remember your name), thank you too and Carlos and Craig, please know you MADE our trip to Vegas this time!We dropped into this Las Vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean "Bull"Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.My friend told me this place was yummy. IT WAS NOT YUMMY!Sunday before checkout and we decided to eat here. It was filled with testosterone filled men watching football and yelling at the tv. Not my idea of dining out. Lobster Mac & Cheese was not good. I could've made it better. The macaronis were tiny little noodles. Chef boyardee style noodles. Not enough lobster and def not enough cheese.Fried pickles were exactly what it was. Not a fan.Calamari was actually tasty. Not the traditional with sauce on the side. It was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalape√±os!The gold standard burger was ok. Supposedly the best burger in Vegas but not to my standard. I asked for medium and it came out well done. It was too charred. Only tasted the burnt meat. The idea of the burger was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that's it. Just the idea was great. I wouldn't dine here. It's not worth the money and experience.The shorts on the girls were cute. It said "soft buns" or "perfect buns" on the butt but trust me, their buns with neither.While the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and I decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around Fremont Street.  I originally wanted to check out Holstein's after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!Although some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean "Bull"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ).The patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.All things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than "shoestring").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  Now I just have to go back and try one of Holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.After objectively evaluating this place in my head, I gotta stick ya with a three... maybe I'm a burger snob... maybe I'm too spoiled by the absolute majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory here in Seattle... but when it comes down to it... the burger was just good. Nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.Their spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.The ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?I don't believe I'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad... I'm just spoiled.3 one-nom-...-just-one stars out of 5As I walked through the front door...House music was blasting.The DJ was spinning.Girls in stilettos and slinky dresses were dancing.Boys in button-down shirts were standing and posing by the bar while sipping Manhattans.You'd be forgiven for thinking that I had just wandered into some Vegas nightclub, but no.  This atmosphere is par for the course at Holsteins, which may be the most self-consciously hip burger joint in America.Normally I'd be more cynical about the goings-on at Holsteins, but they're forgiven because they put out an excellent product.  Despite the crowds and clubby atmosphere, the hostess quickly found us a (relatively) quiet table in the corner, with a nice view of a staff artist making a new cow-themed painting to add to the dining room's already-extensive collection.  After we sat down, we knew we made the right decision by coming here, because absolutely everything on their menu is mouthwatering.  Holsteins has a pretty extensive menu, but ordering anything other than the burgers would be silly here.  I ordered the nom nom burger, which is Kobe beef, cheddar, Thousand Island dressing, and potato chips.  My dinner companion had their California turkey burger, which comes with sprouts, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepper Jack cheese, and a dollop of Russian dressing.  All of the burgers come with your choice of shoestring or steak-cut fries.I *loved* the flavors of both of these burgers.  They easily rank among the best in Vegas.The only place where Holsteins slips is service.  I asked for my burger cooked medium, and it was definitely cooked beyond that.  Ultimately, though, the Thousand Island dressing provided more than enough the juiciness for the burger.  My dinner companion also ordered steak fries, but received shoestring fries instead.  Again, this was a tiny problem that didn't affect our experience much.Holsteins definitely warrants a return visit.  I'll let their scattershot service slide, if it means tasting more of their meaty and mouthwatering creations in a sleek and stylish atmosphere.'Til next time, Holsteins.I came here specifically for the Urth Burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. But somehow my eyes were caught by the words "Guava Float."Damn, that sounds good. Skyy Citrus Vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! I just had to order it. Damn... http://su.pr/1OTBxJSipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http://su.pr/2KKpvMThe artwork in here, which I think is created by a local artist, is kickass! One of my favorites: http://su.pr/6tjK9nAs good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. Thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in Vegas! And yes, next day Urth Burger with skinny fries are still good!Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! Viva Las Vegas :)I decided to try this place out after work & what a lively, happening atmosphere I walked into. You can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the East side area. Once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says Wicked Spoon and Convention Center. When you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.I checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. Quick & prompt just the way I like it ;) I sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. It was literally a money spot. Front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. I like this spot.. oh yes I do.My server, Jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. Giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which I felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. A more personable approach I would say... I asked him if there was any way I could take my food to go, since I explained that I would like to share it with my Family and he was more than willing to oblige my request. He went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item I was interested in trying. I appreciate his honesty on how I should get my Salmon cooked and what I could possibly add if I would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the Turkey choice that I ordered. Jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. Kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & I gave him his well deserved tip. I think he even bowed & said thank you so much. Wait.. I think I bowed to him first?!?? Eh it's in my culture to bow when I appreciate & respect someone. Koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. Don't mind me.. I'm just being ME.Tom Turkey Sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the Tiny Buns Section - When you first glance at these trios... Adorably cute. It consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & Russian dressing on the side. The dressing itself is between a hint of Horseradish & Thousand Island Dressing. It gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. The tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, But I ended up liking the chewy bites. I generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. I was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy. Crispy Pork Belly Bun - ( comes in 3's ) Think of Peking Duck Steamed Bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. I swear there was cilantro in the mix too. The hoisin sauce is more like a Chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. The steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. The pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. A combination that anybody would love.Captain Hook - I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. I would say this is a good looking burger. Succulent and vibrant. Marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. Together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. This was definitely a Hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. I chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. Thin, crispy, and tasty! I have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. I'm Hook'ed!My Family and I enjoyed all the burgers. The music at Holstein's is fresh. Even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped Both of my feet to the beats. Friendly staff and wonderful service. I would recommend Jonathan again to be my server. I did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. He was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. I even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. I did skip on the shakes this time, but the Oreo is my favorite! The artwork here is uniquely admirable. I like the way they hold this place down with colors that will tickle your sweet tooth. Great location for people watching and even mingling :PEverytime I'm in Vegas, I always make it a point to stop at Max Brenners for one of their frothy, calorie-enriched shakes; however, this time, my resident-friend suggested I try Holsteins.  It isn't the same type of shake, but thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.Yeah I know they have alcoholic shakes, but it was 2pm, and all I really wanted was a milkshake. The shake menu looked pretty interesting, but I gravitated towards the cereal bowl, primarily for my love of capn crunch cereal. She ordered the smores which was cool cause I'd get to try hers too.Anyway, upon my first sip. WOW. I was blown away. That is one f@cking good shake, amongst the other complimentary profanities that erupted from my lips. Damn Holsteins. Now I'm excited to try your burgers n things.**** 4.5 stars ****One of the great miracles of Las Vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like "Sexy And I Know It", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. Holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as Public House, where I had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. The d√©cor here is also just dope. I love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. If you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so I suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.But, since it's Vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). Brian and I both took the luxury route on the menu here, although I passed on the Billionaire Burger with Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because I've already had half a dozen burgers like this across America and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. It was honestly more difficult passing up the Rising Sun burger, a truly unique combination of Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if I had been dining with someone I was dating I likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. Somehow I managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.I finally wound up deciding on the Gold Standard burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with foie gras. The result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers I've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done sweet potato fries (for a supplemental charge). My biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer the burgers with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. Eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a fried egg as I do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.Just make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.As for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese's, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.As for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  Overall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  "That's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. I don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good."HEFTY 8 OZ burger in the cosmopolitan!you can get your burger on a white OR wheat bun---gold standard burger: pretty good! i liked the strong cheese flavor & char-grilled smokyness to the patty... ALTHOUGH my patty was unevenly cooked, which was a bit of a bummer---burgers come w/ steak OR shoestring fries... shoestring were definitely yummier! NOTE:you can ask for other sauces besides ketchup & mustard, but the chipotle mayo sauce we had wasn't too impressiveFREE house beer OR house margarita w/ a foursquare check-in!Before hitting up Marquee Night Club (on Party Rock Mondays) we decided to stop by this burger joint.  I have been here more than once and though I enjoy the food the service not so great. It was a pretty slow night and not a lot of people were in the restaurant but the service was just just sad. PROS:Black & white milkshake was excellent! (It is a must try)ordered the Hen House burger (Beef w/fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & onion w/ mustard & ketchup).  -- I really enjoyed the taste and it was perfect.CONS:fries - blandservice - was slow & our waitress was not very friendly.the place was too loud - but then it was club night. I dont know if I am willing to come back, but for the milkshake i probably would.So I was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans. I was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. We made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. Soon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. Our burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. Another plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! A third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!A fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. Let's work on that self-confidence, shall we?Who would have thought I could really crave for a burger? I had been wanting to try this new burger place in the Cosmopolitan for some time. I didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, I did. After Marquee Day club, my friends and I headed over and waited about 25 minutes. When we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. For all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. The milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. For many, that's way too less. But for me, give me my Peaches N' Creme! I'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. But I love the fact of knowing I'm drinking in Vegas, still. :) I got the Rising Sun burger. It was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. Avocado always makes the burger better. They gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. Uhh.. SHOESTRINGS FRIES of course. I absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. On top of that, I also ordered the Holsteins cobb salad. I have to make sure to keep my food light if I'm going to all these pool parties, you know. I like the cobb. I'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. I did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. We had decent service. Could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. We actually waved down our waitress a couple times. But, it was a busy afternoon. The food was good and convenient being right across from Marquee on the 2nd floor. It's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected.Well, just a few days ago I learned that Holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior Chocolate Shake!  After being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped Popcorn.  It was unnecessary but good.  Next came juicy Fried Pickles with a really good Caper Mayo Dressing.  A hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  Meanwhile, I had a hard time deciding whether I preferred the delicious Chocolate Milk Shake with Chocolate Syrup or the thick and sweet Whipped Cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  I even lamented to Diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  And, so it did!    Then the burgers and fries arrived.  For me, a Classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  There was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and I had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty Shoestring Fries that accompanied it.Meanwhile, Diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare Nom Nom Burger with Kobe Beef and Cheddar Cheese, as well as fulfilling Fat Fries.  Our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. It was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which I expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.I really enjoyed my meal at Holstein's when we visited Las Vegas last week.  It is one of those places that executes both substance and style very well.  I loved the theme and all of the art and design elements here.  I also really liked the food too.  It was just a good all around dining experience.My order consisted of the Nom Nom Burger (Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing) and sweet potato fries.  Both were good, and I was very happy with what I chose to order.  The only thing that was not good was the complementary can of popcorn that was brought to our table while waiting for our food.  It had an excessive amount of sauce on it that tasted like butter mixed with vinegar.  Otherwise, I was very satisfied. There are lots of choices of places to eat when on the strip in Las Vegas, but I was glad that we came across Holstein's.  I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch, and I would love to eat here again the next time I am in Las Vegas.After passing by the restaurant in the Cosmopolitan hotel on many trips I finally decided to eat there. I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The don't take reservations on weekends but we arrived at 8pm with a group of 5 and were seated immediately. The atmosphere and decor was fun, the restaurant was clean, and the waitress was very friendly. I ordered the Carbonara Chicken burger with Grilled Chicken Breast, Bacon, Mushrooms, Sweet Pea Aioli, Fried Egg, and Provolone Cheese. This was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that I have ever eaten. They have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the Drunken Monkey shake and it was also delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!This place has been on my bucket for a while, going back to when I lived in Vegas.  When we had the opportunity to eat her on a recent visit, I couldn't say no.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with the The Longhorn (Burger, Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Cole Slaw, Pickle), $16.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q#l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg#GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtgI took one bite of the Burger and fell in love with it.  The combination of Beef Brisket with the Burger was awesome.  The BBQ Sauce gave it a tangy flavor while the Slaw softened it up with a sweet, creamy flavor.....yum!One thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.  The floor wasn't wet or anything like that, I think it just gets slippery when it's clean....probably over-polished.Despite that danger, we'll be back.Return Factor - 95%Despite the choice location and the cool decor, as well as the numerous glowing reviews, I have to say that I was disappointed in my trip to Holstein's. The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something. Actually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had. Those who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.It's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections. I wouldn't completely rule out giving this place another try because I feel like we may have just gone on an off day, but honestly there are so many choices in Vegas it's hard to overlook a bad experience.Thanks to Holsteins yummy Bam-Boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), I can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.After polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening. The first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins; Drunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico LiquorCereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla VodkaCampfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham CrumblePork Belly BunsSalt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary)The Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura AvocadoGold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive AioliThe Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill PicklesI do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins. I can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. From what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.  I will definitely try Holsteins again. Next time I'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so I can fully remember my experience. Till that day comes I'll give Holsteins a solid 4 stars.First thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous Cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. At first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti d√©cor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! We decided to stop by and try this place out before we left Vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). The hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! We were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. The lounge/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. We settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. This place has almost everything you could ask for:Shakes (bam -boozled shakes)IPA'sBeerWineOne of a kind cocktailsBut what I liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. Who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!All their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!With so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. I decided on the Nom Nom Burger- No bun, Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island DressingI have to admit I was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. I use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! But screw that though I told myself I'm going in!After ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! And believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  One guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. You would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in Vegas! He tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. Still the look on his face was priceless!Our burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) I had to try some of Minh's onion rings (which were delicious) I could have ate them all except I was given the "eye" so I swiped two more and went back to my burger! It was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! The burger was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!Be warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though I opted not to have the bun I got full half way through! I forced myself to finish this epic burger, which I am 50/50 that I did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy! Service was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!Hostess: friendly and prompt, she took down my info and told me they would text when a table was ready. That's an awesome feature. Who wants to stand in front of Holsteins for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sports book?! I received the text, although we snagged a spot at the bar before it came. Food:Truffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w/ Maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. Two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. It tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. That first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. Boo. We left half of it there and I refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not trueNom Nom Burger ($16.50 - Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. On one hand, the beef was realllllly good. Flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. On the other hand, the toppings added 0. My theory is they need to triple what they put on top the burger. When you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. Conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.Drinks:Ginger Julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite. Rhubarb Pie Bam-Boozled Shake ($11 - Absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. Should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? Probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!Would I come back here? Yep. Would I order differently? Yep. Will I finally end this review? Sure.I had to write an update to my review of Holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  Everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  Even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  What really stole the show for me though was the Rising Sun burger.  It was the best thing that I ate in Vegas during my most recent visit, and I am salivating just thinking about it as I write this review.  I also shared sides of sweet potato fries, onion rings, and fried pickles with my wife, and I loved them all.  I was so glad that we came back to eat at Holstein's again when we were in Las Vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  I can't wait to come back here again soon!Burger #267: Roll of the DiceI can't believe it's been over four months since my last burger review, sorry for slacking but this pace won't pick up soon. Anyhoot, Vegas, burgers, cheat weekend, let's go. Holsteins was my pick for the start of my carb filled weekend, and what better way to indulge in all things anti-paleo than lobster mac and cheese;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg#F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIgFlavor was spot on, noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, there was a nice crispy layer on top, and loads of lobster. But of course there was a "but," a very big butt; the sauce was like water. No creamy gooey goodness to be found here, just a soupy base to the above perfection. So close this was to being a perfect mac, but someone forgot to reduce the sauce or add some flour? To wash all that down, what could be better than a nice refreshing milk shake, the fat boy;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_g#qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_gNamed after my favorite Harley style, this obese child contained no less than the following; Stoli Salted Karamel Veodka, Reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. All I tasted was ice cream and a hint of caramel, it was damn tasty though.And lastly was my first bite of bread in a month, the gold standard burger; dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli, to which I felt it imperative to add a fried egg;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3Ung#a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3UngOverall, meh+. The sum of the parts was better than okay, not quite great, but somewhere around good. Once I began my dissection, I found the beef patty itself to be under-seasoned and without a nice crust. The bun could have used a few minutes on the grill to get a nice crust as well to protect itself from the toppings. Flavor-wise the meat was beefy, but it completely depended on the bacon for salt. I am happy to report that it was cooked to my order of med-rare;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQ#A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQBeing my first proper burger in months, I was a little let down that it wasn't mind-blowing, but overall everything was a-okay.Came here on a whim because my friends wanted drinks and food. We must of been really lucky because there was no wait and we were seated right away. My girlfriend and I each ordered a lemon drop, my boyfriend ordered a light ale which he really enjoyed. We also got the Holstein burger and a side of onion rings. The burger was less than average (dry and flavorless)  but the onion rings stole the show. They were a little but salty but in our drunken state, they were perfect! Next time I'm at cosmopolitan, I would love to come back and try some of their shakes and gourmet burgers out.Upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a "short" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!Most of us decided on selections from the "Big Buns" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the "Gold Standard" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.With your "Big Buns" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!*** Mmm-mmmm ....       That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it. *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers?        Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?      Ah, hit the spot.Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Cr√©me Br√ªl√©e, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.As a local I can give you the inside scoop on how these casino/resort restaurants work:1. A talented chef designs the menu and recipes.2. The restaurant serves amazing food for a short time.3. Accountants find ways to cut cost.4. The food goes downhill.Sadly, such is the way with Holstein's.  The first time I ate here the burgers knocked my socks off.  The second time, I wished I had just gone to Applebee's.  It's easier to park at Applebee's, the food comes out faster, it's cheaper, and THE FOOD IS BETTER!The saddest part: the resort restaurants keep getting away with this.That is all I have to say.Items Selected:Buttered PopcornTiramisu Shake - Mascarpone Ice Cream, Ladyfinger Crumbs, Patron Xo Caf√©, Chocolate Syrup, Cocoa Powder, Espresso BeansBanana Cream Pie - Bananas, Vanilla Custard, Nilla Wafers, Caramel, Cr√®me de Banane, Licor 43, White Chocolate Covered Nutty BananaCrispy Pork Belly Bun - Chinese steamed Bun, Hoisin Sauce, Cucumber, Pea ShootsRising Sun Burger - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado with Onion RingsTruffle Lobster Mac n' Cheese - Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce, Maine Lobster, Black TruffleShrimp & Grits Hush Puppies - Rock Shrimp, Andouille, Cheddar, RemouladeUn-Birthday Cake - Confetti Cake, Vanilla Frosting, Berry Crumble, Sugar Spirals, Cotton CandyAnother concept restaurant from Block 16 Hospitality that has generated raves since its inception at The Cosmopolitan I'd frequently entertained a visit to Holsteins but it was not until nearly three and a half years after first visiting the property that I finally sat down for lunch, a $130 meal for two at a casual 'shakes and buns' place rather absurd in retrospect even though much of the experience was admittedly quite good.  Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new "Un-Birthday" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.I was skeptical in trying Holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so much, I wanted a different burger place. Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!The decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. My bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchiesBamboozled Shakes:Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes. Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. Banana Creme Pie - My bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!Apps:Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshingCrispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari ringsMaine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot onBurgers:Rising Sun w/ onion rings(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divineFun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over Rising sun because he prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(Gold Standard w/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!Note: Try and get a girl server. The first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. The 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmedThe unexpected touches are what elevated this from a 3 to a 4 star experience for me. I'd read the reviews, so I already planned on getting a boozy milkshake, skipping the sliders, and ordering the Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado) - all of which were fantastic recommendations. (Thanks Yelp!)But I wasn't expecting the complimentary popcorn (that our group quickly renamed crack-corn), nor was I expecting the complimentary nitro meringues to finish off the meal. It was clear that the servers, even on a busy Saturday night, were eager to make our experience memorable. And from start to finish, that's exactly what it was.Way Over priced for small portion and terrible costumer service! Would never return. $70 lunch and they automatically add the tip which they don't mention for a server who stopped at your table twice and was to busy to refill your water glass! Thanks but no thanksAfter spending an hour at Louis Vuitton at Crystals, I came here for dinner.  The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalape√±o, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  A note to the parents--leave the damn Webster's Elementary Dictionary in the room.  You don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.A pleasant meal.This place sucks so hard, you're better off going anywhere else for a burger.  The wait was super long not because they were busy but because service is extremely slow and inattentive.  Our waitress was no where to be found after she took our order and then our burgers took forever and a day.  The only thing I liked about this place was the cute wall art.  I got the Urth burger and it was bland and dry.  Took a bite of the Rising Sun and the patty was tasteless and dry also.  The tempura avocado did nothing texturally.  The fries were the worst fries I've ever had at a sit down burger restaurant.  I'm seriously confused about the 5-star reviews but chacun a son gout.Meating time.There are burgers, and then there are BURGERS.  Holsteins serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. and overall I had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.LOCATION:  Second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.On my recent trip, I visited Holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  We decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  Thank goodness for being early.  In this case, the early diner gets the burger.FOOD:  There were three of us and collectively we ordered the Gold standard burger, the California turkey, and the Big Fat Greek.  All burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  I was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, I decided on their award winning Gold Standard Burger.  The Gold Standard Burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  This has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  This dry aged beef sirloin (smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  I thought all the condiments served complemented the burger well.  My taste buds were quite happy indeed.  The fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  The burger was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.As for my two friends, I believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    Overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.SERVICE:  The hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  The server was a friendly and polite young woman.  She greeted us and took our drink orders.  She also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  As previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the Gold Standard Burger, and I thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  She  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and great company.  I strongly recommend the Gold Standard Burger.I've heard a lot of good things about this place. I wish I didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while the burgers here are pretty good, I wouldn't go wild over it. The manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 PM on a Saturday.  That's definitely a star well earned there.  The service was very good.  Warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. I loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  There's another two star there.I ordered the Gold Standard ($18) and added a fried egg ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for sweet potato fries ($2).  I ordered it Medium Rare because I love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  My expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall I say udder disappointment), my burger came out Medium Well.  Ewww.  Ground cardboard.  While the burger was still good, having it medium rare could have made it THAT much better and probably one of the best burgers.  So it was just good, not amazing.  I was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  At least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out Medium well to Well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  Um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  For $21 I was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.      I didn't have any shakes because I'm not into shakes, but I had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.   I would rule this place completely out, but I can't give it bragging rights either.  I still prefer Red Robin  burgers over my experience at Holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  Good burgers but poor execution.  I would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, I'd still with Cheeseburger in Paradise or Red Robin.  We'll try again later, Holstein's!I had this bookmarked for awhile! Finally had the chance to try this place. There was no wait at 7:30PM on a Friday night. We were seated right away. I ordered the one that yelpers raved about, which was Gold Standard and the Cake batter alcoholic shake. Don't judge me, it's Vegas! My friend got the Rising sun and Maple Bacon shake. The burgers and fries came out faster than the shake which was kind of strange. Unfortunately, after taking the first bite out of the gold standard, the word "MEH" popped in my head immediately. I took a bite out of my friend's Rising sun, and felt EXTREME JEALOUSY. That burger had more flavor and deliciousness. I loved my cake batter shake though, I love cake batter anything and if you have a sweet tooth, then you're good to go. You can definitely get the shakes without alcohol. Overpriced for a burger joint, but it's in Cosmo so I didn't expect any less.Reminiscing about my childhood memories is like the anticipation of a first kiss; it's (usually) messy, exciting, and puts a smile on a face. That is how Holsteins shakes made me feel, and their grown up version added a tinge of a twist to remind me that I am not 5 anymore, and I am okay with that.Holsteins is known for their milkshakes so I was curious to know if they met up to that prominent expectation. We sat at the bar and were greeted instantly; it was nice that the bartender gave us his full attention even though we were only looking for a taste of a milkshake. I'm not an ice cream or milkshake devotee, but I was taken away by the intriguing menu of unusual paired milkshakes, such as the Frozen Grasshopper (Peppermint, Chocolate, Cr√®me De Menthe, Pinnacle Chocolate Vodka), Cereal Bowl (3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch), Red Velvet Cake Shake (Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie), and even an all year around Pumpkin Pie (Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, Pepitas Brittle) shake! Although I was hesitant at first at the idea of an alcohol infused milkshake, they prepare virgin ones as well. I stay far away from hard liquor unless the social gathering is right, and this night was one of them. The bartender assured me that I would hardly taste the alcohol anyway, is this a good sign? C E R E A L  B O W L  [ $ 13 ]We decided on the Cereal Bowl; 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch in a vanilla ice cream base, yum! This milky concoction masked the alcohol so well that I didn't taste anything but the abundance of one of my childhood favourite cereals, Cap'N Crunch! So light yet sweet with a just-right cereal texture, this treat was more than the best milkshake I've ever tasted.I certainly see myself visiting Holsteins again, perhaps to try the Red Velvet Cake Shake or the Moscow Moo; it's difficult to say no when these milkshakes are completely inspired by cake ingredients to childhood inspired creations xReview #1000 goes out to Holsteins Shakes and Buns!The roommate and I were staying at the Cosmopolitan. Having to catch a flight a couple hours after we checked out, I wanted to fit one last meal into our trip. Thankfully, Holsteins was right downstairs!*Holsteins special lager (4.8%) nv, usa ($5.50 for 12.5oz)Having a meal without a drink in Vegas is weird to me. So of course I ordered a beer. This was super light and easy to drink.*Billionaire burger: kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo ($32)Yum! I'm a foie-aholic, so this definitely hit the spot! A huge tender piece of foie topped this beautiful burger. Great flavor. The kobe beef also melted in my mouth. I was in heaven.*The steakhouse burger: beef patty crusted w/black pepper, greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato, onions, mushrooms, cheese ($18)The roommate's burger. I took a bite. But after eating the kobe beef, this seemed tough. The roommate seemed to enjoy it and finished the whole burger.So is the billionaire burger worth $32?! Absolutely! One of best burgers I've had in a while!I've said it before and I'll say it again--it's hard for me not to love a burger place.  Throw it in a trendy location such as The Cosmopolitan and ba-bam, I'm all in.  Holstein's was the perfect way to end a LONG day of drinking by the pool. The fries were stand-outs and my hamburger was completely yummy.  Piggy/hungover me asked for extra non-clean/processed american cheese and extra crispy bacon on my burger...that could have been the booze talking, but nonetheless, it was delicious!  The Oreo shake could have been a tad more chocolatey for my taste, but rest assured, every last drop was consumed without sacrifice.  The service was great, the vibe was great, the people watching was top notch and all around, I'm a HUGE fan.MMMMM, Now that's a tasty burger, what was that called again?A bit pricy for a burger, but it is the Cosmo.Drinks at the bar, where we were not allowed to order a milkshake for one of our dining companions that does not imbibe alcohol was extremely annoying, but not as annoying as the gal that said it. Attitude much? Uh hello, this is a burger joint..Anny who, food was good, fries are amazing, super yummy onion rings, and that milkshake was flippin huge (when it finally arrived at the table)..Ignore the attitudes and enjoy the food..This place was okay! I was hoping for better! We got the ahi tartar sliders which were lacking flavor and super small, got the black/white malt which was good and a great sharer. I got a burger but it wasn't that good, it was okay and it wasn't hot it just came out warm, the onion rings were good. It's pretty cool inside and a chill place to hang out but the food was average. I wouldn't come back. Oh and other reviewers mentioned they bring out popcorn unfortunately we didn't get any. Boo =(Would come back for the shakes/malt which seem to be their speciality. Service was good too till the end till it took 15 mins to get our change back for the check. =X
Les 400 Coups=Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Price: 4/5We easily made a reservation for lunch through Opentable as we usually do. Lunch reservations are much easier to grab than dinner! When hubby has the time, I tend to grab the opportunity to try restaurants during lunch time: easier to grab reservations, more affordable prices, but still very delicious food!Prior to arriving, we were originally opting for the √† la carte menu as we thought that was the only menu available. But no, we were greeted to a prix fix√© after we were seated! As I looked around the restaurant after ordering, it was very chic and beautifully decorated. Tourists, business professionals, locals like us were all having lunch (probably the prix-fixe) and overall it had a quiet atmosphere.3 courses for less than $30! When it is ever that affordable? This is why Montreal is such a great foodie city to be in :). It didn't take very long for hubby and me to change our minds and opt for the prix-fix√©; we might come here more often for lunch now that we know! The √† la carte is of course still available.We skipped drinks as it was lunch time and just ordered sparkling water to share. After complimentary bread was brought and it was oh so delicious! I didn't feel the need to butter my bread that day because it tasted better without it in my opinion. Wish I had some right now!My first course was more or less vegetarian, although I didn't intend to. I was very delighted with how the dish was presented - so pretty! The beautiful plating was kept all throughout our lunch and in my opinion, got better with each dish. I found the appetizer very refreshing and light, just how I wanted. It definitely doesn't fill you up but there are more courses coming your way anyway. Overall, it was a great Summer dish (I visited before Labour Day)!My husband's main dish was extremely delicious! It was extremely well cooked and presented. The yogurt sauce complimented the sausage very well and overall, the dish was enjoyable; however, the portion of the dish seemed a little small.Lastly, our dessert. Hubby didn't order one (so opted for the 2-course) while I chose to have dessert (3-course). The honey panna cotta I had was incredible! With the strawberry sorbet and sabl√© breton, it was a sweet party in my mouth. Everything was so incredibly well balanced and overall not too sweet which I really liked. Again, beautiful plating and personally, some of the panna cotta I've ever had!Overall, our celebratory lunch at Les 400 Coups was very enjoyable. The prix-fix√© menu was definitely a plus, as we were able to enjoy a great course lunch at a much affordable price point. The restaurant did not disappoint; every dish was not hurried, well prepared, and as the consumer, we could easily feel how much the chefs cares about their cuisine. Read more about them here - you'd be amazed at how dedicated and passionate they are about their work! Whether you're a student, business professional, a local, or a tourist, Les 400 Coups is for you! I truly recommend the restaurant as it is one of the best in Montreal (see their Press tab!) in one of the hottest areas of the city. Reservations are definitely recommended, especially if you're looking into going to the restaurant for dinner!
Pho Van=I came by for lunch last weekend to try the pho, since it was cold and I was craving a hot, brothy, noodly dish.  Because I was in the Strip for shopping purposes, this place was more convenient than the other Pho place further down Penn.  Since they both have similar ratings and each seems to have its adherents, I figured I'd try here.Since I'd never had pho before, I was excited to try it for the first time.  Because I don't eat beef, I ordered the pho ga (chicken pho).  It was served promptly, about 5 min. after ordering, piping hot with all of the usual accoutrements (sprouts, Thai basil, lime, peppers).  I added in the first three, gave it a stir, and dipped in.  The soup was very pleasantly savory, and had a nice balance of flavors and textures.  My only major criticism was that I felt that the amount of chicken included was a bit on the light side--but then again, as a first-time pho eater, I don't have a good feel for what's typical in terms of the amount of meat included.  Nevertheless, I ate the whole bowl with gusto, savoring my first pho experience.While I agree with other reviewers that the interior decor is a bit sparse and bland, this wasn't a make-or-break issue for me.  Service was fine, if unremarkable--exactly what I'd expect in this type of establishment.  Overall, I was pleased with my meal here, and I wouldn't hesitate to return for another bowl of delicious pho.
Niro's Gyros=Ratings on scale of 1-5 (last visit)Tastiness.................................................... 4Greasiness................................................. 5Management yelling at employees......... 5  (including Greek accent)Ambiance (aside from yelling)..................3Price/Value....................................................3Ok, that's the best I could do to replicate Sean's impressively objective rating system without committing all out plagiarism.  It's just that I've chosen to include slightly different criteria.The fries are indeed cooked in grease from the heavens, and then served in a big greasy brown paper pouch.  They were so much better than most I've had, especially from such an apparent hole-in-the-wall place.The gyro was heaping full of flavorful, salty lamb/beef (at least I assume that's the mix, even though the menu doesn't specify).  It is then drenched in a creamy tzatziki sauce and topped with onions and tomato.  In all, very good.Another plus was the fact that the manager/owner told me he would have my meal ready in less than five minutes from when I ordered over the phone.  While I was at first a tad suspicious that quality might suffer from such hasty preparation, I decided to happily roll with the welcome comfort of an immediately sated appetite.And sated I was..... I now feel like I'm moments away from a food coma as I digest this big gut bomb.  The only comfort I have is that I got to chuckle a little bit about the owner/manager interrogating and berating his employee (family member?) in front of me as he inquired about how I discovered his restaurant.  When I said that it was from an ex-employee having left a menu and not from his guys dropping one off, he decided that maybe he should go deliver the damn menus to area businesses himself!  I agree that this is a sensible idea -- he sounded like he needed a break from the restaurant.Overall pretty good.  I just might be back again soon.  But I do think the prices could stand to drop a buck or so.
Soi 4 Bangkok Eatery=Sleek setting, somewhat slow service, and some of the best executed Thai in town.  Many might complain that it has been watered down to better accommodate the Western palate but I don't mind.  The food is light yet filling and the freshness stands out.it's not every day I eat Thai food, but it's pretty much amazing here. at least the catfish meal I had was. so much more than flavorful. I was supper pleased. and my colleague's beef bento box meal was the same. I also had the fried mango and ice cream dessert - loved that too.and excellent service.I wanted to come here again before leaving but had to try as many different spots as possible while in AZ. I was with you again in spirit tho, Soi 4...
Maui Dog=I can't say that I'm a hotdog connoisseur but every once and a while I do get the craving for a good hot dog.   I don't eat beef or pork, so I can only eat chicken, turkey or vegetarian hotdogs.  My friend John and I were on our way to meet our friend to go bowling and I decided to stop by Maui Dogs and Slider. They  just had a soft opening, but I wanted to review them right away so people can find out about this place. The atmosphere, is very hawaiian and they have all kinds of   fruit relish with different   combination of mango, coconut, pineapple or banana. They have  a signature mustard being flavored with passionfruit. I tried their turkey hotdog with avocado and some sweet and spicy relish.It was pretty good. The only way it could get better is if they had beer on tap.  Maui Dog  is definitely a winner in the wiener category!Update: (6/9/2011)  I've stopped eating chicken & turkey for 8 months now, so I haven't been back.CAUTION: Maui Dog is Highly Addictive.The above statement should be printed on the menu, by the way.My friend has been raving about this place for weeks now...and last night I finally stopped in only to find myself waking up this morning CRAVING it again! Yikes. And it's on my commute home from work. I think I am in trouble...By my friends recommendation, I had the Lava Dog, Shaggy Style. Basically, an all beef hot dog, chili ("lava") - monterey jack cheese - Maui cole slaw ("shaggy"). The slight sweetness of the bun, bit of salt with the dog and chili topped with the crispness and freshness of the maui slaw creates the perfect balance. Now it's a "taste explosion" at a hot dog 'stand'? Better believe it.Next time, I want to try something different...like the Brat dog or Spam slider. They offer unique toppings for all dogs - maui style - chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, coconut and pineapple topping to name a few. I am going to have to go for the shaved ice next time too, especially Amy's recommendation of the "Tiger's Blood"Some inside SCOOP on this place, because I asked the owner John (who's super nice) a million questions. The Chili is Vegetarian. The buns are AMA-ZING and it's his own recipe. The buns are baked fresh locally. The brats are made especially for him as well. He was inspired by a place he visited all of the time in Hawaii - while he was surfing! A good enough reason for us Phoenicians to welcome a little ALOHA in our lives.SOME OTHER THINGS I LIKE?   - They DO take debit cards, it's NOT cash only.    - THEY ARE PET FRIENDLY (Patio, obviously)   - I love the surfboard painted out front, makes for some entertaining photo shoots for kids, pets and hey...even adults!I'm glad to support a locally-owned, unique business that offers a fantastic product. Mahalo!!!Aloha!It's been a couple of years since the Beautiful Carin and I took one of our vacations in the islands.Clearly, it's time to go back and "Hang Ten" (I told Carin I could "Hang Ten" when we first met, to get her to like me...by the time she found out I couldn't surf, she had fallen in love with me for my mind).Since we were on Maui last, it looks like they've invented an entirely new hot dog...the Maui Dog!Well, maybe not "invented" so much as "enhanced" the good old "Pooka" dogs that you find in the islands."Maui Enhancement"?OK, I don't know for sure that these bad boys (and since hot dogs are wiener related, I think it's safe to assume that they are boys) originated on Maui, but wherever and whatever fertile imagination created them deserves a hand-y!But we have always preferred Maui, when we visit the islands..."Maui No Ka Oi"...now, I guess I can add "Maui Dog No Ka Oi"I've seen a few reviews for Maui Dog on Yelp, lately...and I was watching Hawaii 5-0 http://tinyurl.com/yazfcs5 on the TiVo last night and that pretty much decided my lunch plans today (It's sweet of you to worry about my health but don't...I detoxed like crazy this morning, so I was ready and able to handle the nitrate/salt/fat onslaught at lunch today).I strolled in and looked over the menu...and I was momentarily confused (a hazard that us seasoned citizens learn to deal with by yelling at those younger than us, in an effort to confuse everybody and not feel out of place).The very nice proprietor came to my aid, briefly explained the workings of the menu, and off I went!I selected wisely and soon I felt like I was back in the islands noshing a tasty and satisfying Spam slider (Spam = Scientifically Processed Animal Material...I know, more for me)...so very, very tasty!I was also the proud possessor of a very satisfying Maui Dog!They started my Maui Dog with a nice big, beefy wiener (that's what she said!) and they put plenty of toppings on him...Spicy Maui Mustard (sadly, mayonnaise on the wiener just doesn't work for me) along with a sort of mango topping and dill spears...Maui Waui!The sweetness, the spiciness, the saltiness, the grilled flavor of the wiener...all coming through for a first rate Maui Dog experience!I know, seems like an awful lot of stuff happening on the Maui Dog, but somehow, it all worked for me...I haven't really been a fan of overly dressed wieners in the past, but these guys could change my point of view...a little, at any rate!So, I now have a Maui Dog "mahalo" card (no it doesn't mean "trash" in Hawaiian...it means "Thank You") and I plan to use that rascal whenever I'm back in town.That Maui Dog was delicious...good to the last drop!Aloha!This place needs some love, yo. Not the four to five star reviews saying "Yay!" and then never visiting the place again. I'm talking a serious customer base that will elevate this unique little Hawaiian joint to the level it deserves. It's completely different from any other Hawaiian food out there. Honestly, most of that island fare is kind of bland by my standards. Bland macaroni salad, bland rice, bland pulled pork. Blah, blah, blah.Maui Dog turns all these tired standards on their nose and tosses some wicked ridiculous flavor combos together. Who would have thought that a sweet pineapple and coconut slaw would have worked so well on dawgs and sliders? The aioli and shaggy-style island dog are also pretty fantastic. Plus they have Spam. SPAM! I love my pre-formed, processed pork products. Mmm hmm. Also a big fan of the fries and tater tots. (Everywhere should offer the far superior tot as an option in my opinion.) They are a bit soggy instead of super crisp, but I'm one of those queer birds that just loves soggy taters. Grease esssplosion in yo mouth!They have a drive-thru! They take cards! The guy that owns the place is hella nice and will chat your ear off! It's colorful! And different! But not so different that it's pretentious and annoying! I can't offer any more justifications. Get your ass to Maui Dog. Amazing doesn't do it justice.It's no surprise I write this, but I love independent restaurants. Don't worry, I'm not going to get on my soap box and preach about how they help the local economy by keeping more of their revenues in the communities they serve. Nor will I go on about the way they support other small businesses by sourcing ingredients and supplies locally. What I love most of all, they take risks that many corporation restaurants wouldn't dare.Take Maui Dog for instance, l mean really, who opens a restaurant specializing in Hawaiian style hot dogs? Ask owner John Stamatakis, who started his hot dog venture last year in the building that housed Ricky's Philly. The tiny structure has gotten the island treatment with tiki torches, bright colors and a warm friendly vibe. What they don't have in square footage they make up for in charm and of course menu offerings. The menu boasts a series of hot dogs, sliders and some serious toppings. There is one nagging question though, what's a Hawaiian hot dog? To be honest, I had no idea until I did some research. Ends up Hawaiian hot dogs are just like any other hot dog except for a slightly sweetened bun, some variation of garlic mayo and a laundry list of tropical flavors including passion fruit infused mustard to chopped banana and coconut. Before I go on about the food, I have to give you one bit of advice, ask them to make sure they steam the buns! On my visit this crucial detail wasn't fulfilled so what I ended up with were slightly dry and mostly stale buns. I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order, this is what I call great customer service. On first bite I felt deep love for MD's Lava Dog Shaggy Style ($5.50). Its a beef hot dog slather in lava, which is their house made chili, then topped with cheese and coleslaw, the later making it shaggy. I went further and ordered it Maui style, which means that it will additionally be topped with chipotle garlic mayo, Maui mustard, coconut and pineapple. I had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work. It's a whole lot of flavor but melds so well together. Fortunately the heat from the chili and hot dog also managed to make the extremely soft and what I love saying, squishy. Okay canned meat has a really bad wrap, nothing like congealed animal parts to make a person run for the hills. So bear with me when I say go ahead and try a Spam Slider ($1.25). Ordinarily I would have never ordered one but the lady at the counter assured me it was worth a taste. My only experience with Spam was my mothers doing, Span sandwiches, come on, you've had them too! Anyway, once you top a slice of grilled Spam with sweet mustard, coconut and pineapple, Maui style, I think you might have a different impression, sweet and salty is a great combo. If Spam isn't your bag, go for the Teriyaki Slider ($1.25), Maui style of course. This version replaces the Spam with a tender ground beef patty and a smothering of teriyaki sauce. If you love potatoes with your hot dogs and sliders, be sure to order a basket of MD's hand cut French Fries ($1.75). These are the real deal, tender with a slight crisp. If you want sheer crunch good times order up the Tater Tots ($1.75). These little chubs of shredded potato come out super crispy and well seasoned. Judging by the steady stream of diners, it seems like this indie resto is a hit with the locals. Just be sure to get those buns steamed.I ate a shaggy dog @mauidogs !  Or a fuzzy dog. I think it was shaggy. It had slaw and all sorts of other stuff on it and I liked it...alot.  I could eat another one right now.  And I would too, if I weren't writing this from a hotel in California.I also had a spam slider. It was good too.  I haven't had spam since I was, well, it's been a long time.I like this place...the food, the people, the vibe...nunui!'Oe pono he ekahi!http://hawaiiandictionary.hisurf.com/ALERT!!! ALERT!!!MAUI DOG IS CLOSING ON DECEMBER 29th.I had lunch here today and the owner passed along the news.  Landlord is hiking rent and he never made a profit so can't aford to stay and is out of the cash needed to move locations.A sad day for Phoenix.I have to say, SHAME on myself and the rest of the Phoenix foodies and Yelpers out there.  We all love this place, so why don't we go?  I work 2 miles from here and have only been three times.  AND I LOVE IT.  I've told people to go.  THEY love it.Alas...  Two weeks from today...  no more Maui Dog.Thanks to the owner for his pride and guts with this delicious concept.  I hope to see you pop up again somewhere in the valley.  If you do, I vow to be more supportive.I will definitly be back again before you close.  EVERYONE should.You know you have it bookmarked.  Change that bookmark to a Check In YELPERS!
Jerusalem Grill Las Vegas=Everything on the menu except for the sandwiches is overpriced. And the service needs a serious upgrade. For years, the consistency has been the careless staff and quite frankly, the food isn't good enough for me to put up with it more than a few times a year.Try to call in your take out order, but good luck getting them to pick up the phone.When you enter, if there's anyone else waiting, beware that you'll probably get ignored by all four employees who will inexplicably assume you are with the other customer- even though you guys walked in separately, minutes apart, and look nothing alike.Eventually you'll ask someone if you can place an order for takeout, and they'll act irritated that they have to give you a menu. They'll also give you the dinner-only menu that doesn't include the sandwiches, you'll have to ask again for it.When you finally get to this point, your pita sandwich can be made with falafel, shwarma, koobideh, or a couple other things. The first two are your best bet. Be aware that upgrading your wrapping to laffa will be an extra $2.50. $10 and a side of fries is decent for the wrap, which is packed with tahini, cabbage, Israeli salad, and the world's tiniest dab of hummus, but it's hella filling and can easily be your main meal of the day even without the fries.If you dine in, the all-you-can-eat salad for $3, added on to your meal, is a great deal...but be sure you will actually have room for it. And as others have said, the entire table needs to order it for you to be able to partake- if you're with more than one other person, it likely isn't worth it.
Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse=Underwhelmed, disappointed and regretful. Those three words sum up my visit to Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse. I brought a large group here on a Saturday evening (they weren't too busy when we got there) at the recommendation of a friend and I found it to be completely disappointing. We had 7 in the group. Everything about the place was disappointing. We weren't asked for a drink order for 15 minutes; our food order wasn't taken for 45 minutes to an hour; the food came another 30 minutes later; and the food was well below average. I ordered a 16 oz porterhouse steak with sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. The porterhouse was a little overcooked and had a mushy exterior with no grill marks or char as if it had been cooked on a grill that wasn't hot enough (or a Foreman grill). The sweet potato fries were decent but there were hardly any of them. The grilled veggies were mushy and served in a pool of what appeared to be oil...yuck. They did have a decent sample of beers here which is nice but I would never go here again for a meal. All told I left feeling like I had wasted 2 plus hours of my life waiting on food that I'd rather have not have eaten.
Cast Iron Waffles=If you've never had the opportunity of trying a Belgian Liege style waffle, A) You truly haven't lived and B) You're in for a treat. Cast Iron Waffles is churning these things out like they're going out of style and each one is a hit. My wife stumbled upon this place and fell in love immediately. Resting at the base of a town home in a strip of other small business (Connected to the same shopping center as Wings and Rings and Blink off of Ardrey Kell) it's a perfect little bistro-esque location for breakfast. It may be a bit difficult to find for first-timers and actually find a parking space (you can always park in the bank's parking lot) but the location is very quaint and houses tons of personality. For those of you who appreciate waffles, you may have to dash the idea you have in your head. These are Belgian Liege style waffles. They aren't pouring batter into a piping hot waffle iron and handing out faux eggo garbage. This is a brioche type dough that is hand-pressed into a waffle iron. Filled with tons of pearl sized crystals of sugar, each bite of waffle is crunchy at first, bursting with sugar crystals and finishes with a brilliant chew. Be prepared for intrigue as many waffle aficionados tend to be. You won't think "waffle" immediately, but rather "sweet bread." The owners have put a lot of thought into how these are prepared and their dough is no joke. There are different choices of toppings ranging from whipped cream, fruit, nutella, maple butter and powdered sugar. There are the occasional seasonal options on the menu but I have yet to be impressed by any. My recommendation is go au naturale. Just plain waffle to see what your taste buds will be up against. If you're looking for an added sweetness, go for the maple butter. Not too overt with maple flavor and just the right amount sogginess to add to those chewy waffles. Many of you may consider this spot as more of a "treat," than a breakfast joint. It all depends on who well you can handle the sweetness of the dough. These guys also do coffee and espresso drinks. None of which are a draw and pale in comparison to the lead singing waffles. One of the coolest aspects of the shop is the old school coke machine they have in the back. You have to get quarters from the register and then open the door to the fridge-style vending machine. Note: You have to pull your bottle of coke out REALLY fast for it not to lock down on your bottle. Ask one of the employees behind the counter. They'll be able to tell you more. Cast Iron Waffles is a must for anyone in the Blakeney area. The business owners are great to chat with and love to hear their customers' stories. Ask to hear theirs. What a great family. Love how they are operating this little joint. Hear, hear for Belgian Liege waffles in south Charlotte!For a Saturday morning breakfast, I can't think of anything better. Soon after this little joint opened, a friend said to me, "You HAVE to try this new waffle place!" But I was on my way just as soon as I heard the word "waffle."These are not, I repeat, NOT like Waffle House. They're Belgian Liege waffles. super dense, chewy -- they're made with dough instead of batter, and imbedded in the final product are crystallized sugar pearls. Your best bet for a top-notch waffle is going at a busy time...you'll have a bit of a wait, but tasting a freshly ironed(?) waffle is worth it. At non-peak hours, expect that you'll be served a waffle that was made a few minutes ago.They have an old-school coke machine that you put quarters in. It's a bit tricky, so take the advice of the staff and pull it out quick!! ;)Great spot for breakfast meetings, and they offer free wi-fi. Apparently their coffee is highly regarded by the readers of Creative Loafing. It's not my favorite, but when you need something warm and delicious to wash down your waffle, it's never a bad choice. There's a TV at the bar, so you can watch something if you're not keen on conversation. Outdoor seating is a plus, when the weather's nice. I always park in the bank parking lot and walk over. It's easier than parallel parking next to the shop.Definitely go for the "Extra Sweet" variety with maple butter, sans the powdered sugar. Nothing gets me out of bed on a Saturday morning like the thought of that waffle.
Laurita's Taco Shop=This is definitely one of my favorite late night, bad decision dining choices. I love the rolled beef tacos smothered in guacamole and cheese. Carne Asada tacos or tostada. The carne Asada nachos are awesome, but you need someone to share them. The green sauce salsa is my favorite. I could almost drink it. I eat here often enough but I never really thought about writing a review. I mean everyone knows what they are getting with a place like this, but the last time I was there, I changed my mind. The counter guy seriously washed his hands at least 3 times while I was there. I was the only customer. I was very impressed with this excellent display of good sanitation. He washed his hands before he took my order, after he took my order and again before he handed me my food. Cleanliness like this really makes me confident in a place.Ordered to go food. Came home and half way thru my son had a metal piece in his mouth. I called them to let them know and the guys response was What's wrong with that? Well that set me off! A simple apology would have sufficed but to say what he said?!? Is ridiculous! If you want a little more iron in your diet EAT HERE. WTF!  Wish I didn't have to put a star up but I wanted to post!
Renegade Tap & Kitchen=I selected Renegade for dinner this past Monday evening for our party of five... we were celebrating of sorts and I thought it would be fun to try something new together.  I also figured it would be similar to Roaring Fork based on the reviews that came in previously and the fact that it's a Robert McGrath restaurant.I was wrong.Renegade was satisfactory, but we all agreed that nothing about it would bring us back.  While the restaurant's decor is modern and sleek, the atmosphere was kind of dull; not like the fun energy at Roaring Fork.  Service was alright (although Helene who delivered my wine was super friendly even though she was not our server).  The food and the check seemed to take a while...We started with the Green Chili Pork Stew and the Shrimp flatbread appetizers... neither one was a hit.  Jared took home the leftover stew but half the flatbread went to waste. A few of us had a couple of rounds of wine but Lindsey thought her sangria was too sweet and it also sat unfinished.  Entrees at the table included an entree salad, a shrimp appetizer, salmon and halibut... all were decent but nothing to write home about.We passed on dessert... Bottom line - Renegade Canteen is a nice addition to the area but it will not be a regular on my rotation.  I'm glad we tried it though!
Pho Nam Noodle House=Pho Nam must be short for pho-nam-men-nal! Oh no she didn't! Oh yes I did!  I was here for lunch today and it was so good!  Though my visit was around lunch time this place was pretty empty which I would generally take as a bad sign but the glowing reviews this place has let me know that I should not judge a book by its cover. The restaurant is large, clean, and bright; it's sometimes hard to get all three of these things with a restaurant.  The hostess was pleasant as well.  She was very attentive and sweet.  I ordered the combination fried rice and my guest the spring roll and a noodle dish.  We both really enjoyed our dishes. I asked for my rice to have an extra bit of kick to it and I was not dissapointed. The portions at this place are also really large.  I pretty much stuffed my face and looked down and realized that I had barely made a dent in my lunch.  You know what I call that?  Lunch for tomorrow! Hey!Yes, I love this place and I will certainly be back!I live less than a ten minute walk from this place, so I thought I'd check it out. The spring rolls (fresh, not fried) was pretty freaking amazing; the sauce was peanuty, sweet, and savory (and pretty perfect after I added some siraicha). I could eat those spring rolls every day (and I plan to).I love pho, but the broth is a tad lacking; however, it's savory and salty after you add some hoison and siraicha. I had to add almost two handfuls of cilantro, all the basil, and a whole lot of sauce and additives before I got the broth to be absolutely delicious (but by that time, the noodles had been sitting in there for quite a while). But I enjoyed the pho and the experience nonetheless.The menu is large. You can bet you won't experience a meal twice for a while (unless you plan to). Oh, and the alcohol menu is very, very small: 4 beers and one selection of wine, so don't come here to drink.Service is so fast; you can expect your appetizer within five minutes and your pho in seven. They refill your water pretty frequently, but this is from experiencing the restaurant when it was completely empty.Take-out / Carry-out service is spot on. They include hot broth, sauces, bean sprouts, cilantro, the whole shebang in your bag. They also include another larger empty container if you don't have a bowl that can hold the dish.Overall, I like this place. Planning on coming back and experiencing more dishes soon.I've never been so happy to live so close to Pho Nam. I stopped by the restaurant to get some pho to go. I've gotten to-go twice here, and the service is phenomenal. I can guarantee that you'll have your pho, ready to eat, in less than ten minutes. The broth has deep and spicy flavors that make you dig for more; for the prices you pay, it's worth the visit and more.One of the best experiences I have had with carry out has been with pho Nam. A few weeks ago, I called on a Sunday around half an hour before closing time. I asked for two bowls of pho and two spring rolls for carry out, and I told them that if it was inconvenient, I would order food another time. The man I was speaking to was so kind and so accommodating, and he said that my order wasn't a problem at all. Made me feel so welcome, and I appreciated the food all the more.I believe I was serviced by the same kind man again today when I ordered my pho. He is just the nicest man with a kind smile, and I feel welcome when he took my order. I couldn't wait to come back.Amazing food, great location, great service, best take out, and still some of the best spring rolls I've had. I cannot wait to come back.
Tacos El Gordo=So one of my fav  ex-yelper asked where Los Parados was located since she was hankering for a taco.  After a couple visits there she felt great tacos were to be had elsewhere.  A day later she proclaimed victory in finding a better taco at Tacos El Gordo.  Hmm... i'll be the judge of that ( then again, she speaks fluent spanish, knows mexican food like i know burgers so the reality is SHE'S THE JUDGE  not me ! ) All the tacos are $2  - they have about 10 varieties.  other options are tostada's ( also $2 ) and interestingly, asada fries which cost $10 ...$10 ?!?!?   okaaaay.When you come in , a lil unusual method of ordering - basically 4 separate lines based on which taco you order - english is definitely the 2nd language so be careful how you order, but the employees are very pleasant and work with you.  So i order a spicy pork, pork, asada and cabeza tacos.  You stand there as they chop the meat, place the meat on the freshly prepared tortillas ( you see the tortilla lady cooking away ) They put a guagamole/avocado sauce on the asada - very good .  the spicy pork had a creamy sauce, too - not sure what it was, but tasted great.  all had cilantro and onions.  btw - they also give you a plate of grilled green onions and a chile - wasn't sure what i was supposed to do with them - looked around - saw a few people gnawing on them - sure why not !  The cabeza was just ok, the pork was a lil on the fat side.  The tortillas were delicious ! I don't think i'll try the beef brain tacos ( not cabeza ) but the chorizo tacos looked great - next visit .Is it better than Parados ...it's very possible.  Further tastings are necessary.  Interestingly, this place is in the same center as a los tacos ( not a fan ) pics postedI was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.Good thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.The menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.The food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.My cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!I jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)I finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.Then I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.I gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.The only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.Will I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!If I'm going to rate this place, it's for 2 sole things: their slow roasted, tender meat(especially the suadero and spicy pork) and their free unlimited refills of horchata. What!? diosmio. Really though, there are more pluses. Keep in mind, their fresca cheese. Their salsa is spicy enough to sucker punch me in the mouth but not as an anesthetic, and I can still taste the fireworks of sauce and meat and celantro all mixed in. They're cooking and prepping right in front so you know there's no silly hide & seek games, "where are they taking my food?" Believe me, these kids are authentic Mexican grub-lords. They're more than willing to sample you a piece of their carne. That's how confident they are- and they earned it.It gets better, the ladies that work here don't joke about a clean environment. They're so fast, when a group heads out, they're already cleaning the table for the next..  All the workers are always smiling. 5 stars all day, and in my next 3 lifetimes.Very excellent taco shop serving up yummy, made with love, authentic street tacos south of the border right here in Las Vegas.OperatingHours:M-Th 9am-2amF-Sat 9am-4amI am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest d√©cor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with "what can I get you my friend?" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.Tace de Adoboda - ("Shepherd's Style") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!Taco de Lingua - The "tongue" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars.The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.D√©cor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right?Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph.Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast.Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice!Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall.Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.4 Stars!WHERE: Charleston & a little passed Maryland (toward the East).WHEN: I believe it's open until 3 or 4am. If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!I tried:Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good!Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol.Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS!Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!I'd love to try other things! This taco shop is way FLAVORFUL, FUN, AND OPEN UNTIL 4AM! Ch ch check it out!If you like grease, check it out! They serve grease in all forms at this fine establishment -- glistening on the surface of shreds and slabs of quivering meats, whipped into a slime and drizzled atop grilled-flesh-covered french fries, plastered on walls and windows and employees' faces...you can even get your grease as a sort of lacquer coating on grilled onions and jalapenos! They serve ALL FOUR grease food groups here!If you're an unhealthful, grease-lapping fatass, you'll dig it. But if you're a fitness-obsessed health nut who happens to be drunk and stumbling down the street at 3am, you'll like it too... shamefully enough.The best thing here is the people watching. It's ALWAYS packed with an amazing assortment of Mexican families, couples, kids, chunties and cholos. Even at 3am, there are familias with little kids sitting around eating and laughing and bullshitting! Since I find the food so abhorrent, I prefer to do my watching from the street, looking through the giant plate-glass windows at the hordes of obese people shoving greasy strips of meat into their greasy pieholes. It's like watching the Mexican version of Caligula, without all the Penthouse Pets.On the plus side, the staff is VERY friendly, even to drunken gueras like me. But even that won't really get me to come back here...unless I happen to be stumblingly drunk and starving in the immediate vicinity. And I live right down the block....D'OH!YUP. THESE GUYS ARE SO AUTHENTIC, YOU MIGHT NEED TO BORROW SOMEONE'S ROSETTA STONE SPANISH EDITION.When I got in line, there were about 3 people ahead of me. Each one of them ordered in Spanish. When it was my turn, the first thing I asked was, "Do you speak english?" The guy looked at me, smiled and said "Si!" I know that sounds funny but whatever I ordered, he translated it to his fellow compadres that were putting the food together. Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.So for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling. The person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL). As I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said "Gracias!" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, "No habla ingles!". As soon as I saw the look on her face I realized I just told her that I dont speak english! So in closing, you dont need to know Spanish to eat good food here. But in my case, it probably would of helped!Can you say PORK ADOBADA?!! Baboy introduced me to this place. Hands down THE BEST tacos I have EVER had!! They have the right amount of spice, they have slab on a rotating THINGY and the freshly slice the meat off into your perfectly sized taco! Get the pineapple added on there... a side of their HOT PEPPERS --They will leave your mouth on FIYAAAAAAAH and I LOVE me some HEAT in my food! Those peppers kick my ass and I LOOOOVE it! Also, the Adobada Fries!! Get a half order and it's still HUGE! The dollop of fresh guacamole makes it MMMMM FREAKIN GOOD!!waited in line for my "Adobada Taco" and after eating it I was bummed I didn't get 2 of them! For me it was the clear winner! Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the "Asada Taco" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called "Crack Tacos". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!The tacos here are magnificent. But before we get started with the big review, some quick tips.1. The meats are divided into sections with INDIVIDUAL lines!2. There are two locations for Tacos El Gordo, the second one being near the Encore.3. This locations prices are a little bit better, but if you're driving from the strip, it's probably more worth it to go to the first location.4. Try the Adobada tacos, their carne asada tacos are equally good too!5. For the Adobada tacos, everything means all the fixings EXCEPT for the pineapple! Ask the guy making them for a tiny slice of tacos.6. The fries come in three flavors: campenchana, adobada, or ANY meat. Don't be fooled that the sign says adobada or campenchana only.7. The fries come in half/full size, a half size is more than enough for two people to share and just right for three to sample!8. Plenty of parking! Two entrances!After discovering Tacos El Gordo on our second trip to Vegas, we have gone back every single time to eat at their fine establishment. There are MANY meats to choose from, but by far our favorite is the adobada. My personal one that I really like is the carne asada.What truly sets apart Tacos El Gordo is that they grill up/fry up their meat right in front of you. You can watch them cooking up your stuff and making the tacos. Another thing that I really enjoy is the great service. Every single time we've been there, they've always been really nice to me and my girlfriend. I think it might because they see us as Asians in a Mexican joint who have no idea what's going on. But beyond that, the place is really clean. They wipe down tables after people are done and the cleaning ladies usually offer to take our trays for us when we're still sitting down and finished.The last thing is the price. For Vegas, this place is a steal. We usually get somewhere from 6 tacos, a drink, and a half order of adobada fries for $20.Awesome food, awesome service, awesome price! What more could you want?!Oh. My. Gordo.When I see a spit full of deliciously spiced and marinated pig slowly rotating and being carved by a dude with a machete, I get in line. Immediately. Here at Tacos El Gordo, there are lines for their different meats: carne asada on the left, lengua and others in the middle, and al pastor on the right. Let's cut to the chase: get in the line on your right. The al pastor/adobada is PHENOMENAL and worthy of an ALL-CAPS adjective. Perfectly seasoned, tender with just a bit of char on the exterior, it's served on a warm, freshly made tortilla. Don't forget to ask for grilled jalapenos, onions, and pineapple on the side. The lines are long, but they move quickly. After you have your tray full of tacos (or fries, mulas, sopas, quesadillas, or tostadas), go to the cashier and pay. You also buy your drinks here. It's your typical taco shop ambiance, casual and divey, yet clean and friendly. On our initial visit, my wife and I were wandering around trying to find  seats when one of the workers cleared out a space near the cash register just for us. Excellent service!Ignore the reviewers complaining about the $2 per taco price tag. Each taco is generously filled with al pastor that is much better than what you'll find at your typical restaurant or truck. In fact, I'd bet that these same reviewers would gladly pay $2 for 2 tacos with less meat (and of lower quality) because it sounds like a better deal. It only takes one taste of Tacos El Gordo's al pastor to know you're getting your money's worth and then some. Highly recommended.Greasy, carby food always sounds good after drinking. Actually, pretty much anything tastes good after drinking...except for more alcohol.We went here after a fun night at the club. The other location on the Strip was way too packed and we were way too hungry to wait 30 minutes to stand in line and find a table with other drunk people on the same mission. A 10-minute drive and wait at this location trumps that.We got horchata, carne Asada fries and tacos al pastor.Carne Asada Fries:Even the small portion was a lot. Warm fried potatoes loaded with cheese, carne Asada and guac. 4/5Tacos al Pastor:Spicy meat. Yup, that's all I can remember so, I'm not even going to attempt to be descriptive about it. 4/5We were the only Chinos in this area at 3am. It's all good.Vegas has tacos ya'll. I repeat, Vegas.. has.. tacos.. y'all.I'm not talkin' about your gourmet fish tay-co or the horrid generic ground beef. No, no, no..Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries. Thirsty? From horchata & agua frescas to my favorite.. Orange Bang, Bang.. Baby. Like a mother and her child, the drinks and food go hand in hand. Then into my stomach. Not the mother and the child, the food, you sicko.The staff is pleasant, usually smiling and constantly moving.. This place is well kept and presented in a welcoming manner.  It truly reminded me of a few taco joints back home in LA, and that's a great thing! Amazing food, fair prices, up-to-par service and an alright location. Tacos El Gordo has the Nevada taco game on lockdown!This place might be the most chaotic taco shop you've ever stepped foot into, but it might be the best you've ever had. Before you enter, know that there are three separate lines for food. Each line represents a variety of different meats - just take a gander at the sign in front of each window to see if your favorite protein falls under that category. The crappy part? If you want multiple types, then you need to stand in different lines. That's why the buddy system works wonders, especially if you all want a little of everything. Even then we still ended up consuming partially cold food because we were greedy and wanted stuff from each of the queues in the restaurant.I heard this is a step up from the previous location that had almost no seating. We came on a Friday night and it was definitely jam packed with peeps, but we were able to secure a table for four without any problems. Again, this is where the buddy system comes into play and everyone needs to do their due diligence - it's almost fun how you all need to work together to ensure you don't starve at the end of it all.I would run down each of the taco meats we had, but the spicy pork, chorizo and asada variations were all delicious. Not only that, they were STUFFED with meat and I had to eat some with a fork before trying to finish it off with my hands. No complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic. I do think the extra love and flavor comes from their amazing handmade, in-house created tortillas. Those things were perfecto in my eyes.One thing that is a must is their asada fries. You're able to get it with any meat, but the beef was fab. We got the large to share amongst four, full grown adults and we barely finished. We were so full after the various tacos we had just pounded that it took a lot of courage and energy to muster up the strengeth to finish this heaping amount of delicious fries topped with steak, guac, cheese, and sour cream. You're gonna feel like you're about to give birth when you're done, but every bite is worth the pain you'll feel after over eating.Parking is a cinch as they share spaces with a huge shopping center.If you're in Vegas, you have to check this place out. It's delicious!"What is cabeza?"  I stupidly question my bud (an American via Mexico)."It's you know." he says, using two hands to point to his crotch."What the?  I'm not eating penis tacos!" I say to an explosion of laughter."No, no, no." he chokes, now pointing to his head.Having been many times before with Spanish speaking buds who handle all the ordering and just watch me eat their handiwork, I decided on this fateful visit to learn for myself what it's about.That said, Tacos El Gordo serves up incredible, if not the best tacos in Vegas. House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).Outstanding  "normal" proteins including:- Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity.- Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.Offal selections include:- Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.  - Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture.- Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty.- Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness.- Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).In a word:  outstanding.Always dependable for late night tacos.This is really a nostalgic review this spot when it was right by the Encore. It was the best to see hot messes while you were devouring hot messes. It was always packed as all hell.For some reason it always amazed me that they took plastic.If you happen to be in Vegas, this is worth a stop, even in the daytime.
Rico's American Grill=Woo hoo! I'm a fan of Rico's. For starters: they've got a great happy hour and it runs until 7 so you can realistically hit them up after work without getting a speeding ticket on your way there. Happy hour includes a couple $2 drafts (and other drink specials), as well as, some half price "appetizers" which include a jalapeno, bacon, cheese burger. Hello! But it's also a great lunch option. It's spacious and you can have a private conversation with your lunch date without being squished up against other diners. Lighter dishes are available BUT remember this spot for when you're craving comfort food and get the kick-A meatloaf sandwich. It's open faced, piled high with onion strings and doused with their kitchen's secret spicy ketchup. WARNING: it's totally cravable!Expensive but VERY tasty breakfast buffet. Debbie was our server, but I felt she was cold - she was overly direct in her communication style and lacked warmth (which I expect from all servers). I used to be a server, and have admittedly high expectations for service. She abruptly asked  (almost barked) for breakfast vouchers "if we had them..." for all she knew we were locals.  She did the thing where you hurriedly hold your hand out and bend your fingers as if to say "gimme, hurry." The problem was we had a stack of $10 vouchers, and didn't know the total. We asked for the amount and she said "I don't know," almost annoyed. We had to tell her, ok... So go give us the total... She then tallied it up and told us the total over the railing. It was weird, and rude! I am convinced she pegged us as resort guests from the start, which we were, and just expected vouchers and an insufficient tip. We tipped her the full/standard amount on the total (pre-voucher price), but had she smiled, slowed down and showed some warmth, it would have made a huge difference and I MAY have given this 4-5 stars on Yelp. However, most of the overall experience when dining out is the service. As such, Rico's is left with a 3-star-rating from me. It's important to note we were one of three tables at 9:15am on a weekday - so it's not like she was in the weeds. I will add, to her credit, we lingered after paying and she checked back with us - and we asked for to-go cups for coffee, which she obliged. So... Let's talk about the details of the restaurant and the food. This is on the edge of The Squaw Peak Hilton Resort, and it's actually a mid-tier modern Mexican restaurant. It's nicely appointed and we were promptly greeted and seated by a nice young man. The menu was limited but had great options! Most entrees are $13, plus coffee and drinks are $3/each, while the buffet is just under $17. So if you get a drink, you may as well get the buffet because it includes your drinks. The buffet was nicely laid out with great FRESH fruit, yogurts, cottage cheese, etc. they have fresh squeezed juices, and cereal. Across from that there is an omelet station with a friendly omelet chef (not sure what else to call him.) I ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and very light oil, and asked for light cheese. He was great in accommodating my requests - sadly I had several pieces of egg shell, but spit them out and it wasn't a huge deal. I sort of appreciate knowing it was made with real eggs - but would naturally prefer no shells... They have hot syrup, fresh fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, etc. All of it frankly was fresh and perfectly prepared. They had the most incredible oatmeal - it had all kinds of stuff in it (oats, grains, quinoa, etc.). Add some honey, brown sugar and golden raisins and it's perfect! Oddly, it was SUPER tasty (I'm not usually an oatmeal person). They serve tasty Starbucks coffee - which I loved. Just check your cup... My first cup had a solid teaspoon of grains at the bottom! I dumped it in my water glass before she refilled me and it was fine after that. Then, there's the pastry station - yum! Super high quality and tasty muffins, croissants, and other carb-a-licious treats (plus fruit preserves). One person in our party had the eggs Benedict, and it was frankly delicious!  Net, breakfast breakfast was great (but pricy at nearly $17/pp), and our server was attentive/took great care of us, but wasn't welcoming/warm. The advice I would give Debbie is to simply smile, slow down, and exude some warmth and compassion. It would make for a better experience and probably increase her tips.If my review and photos were helpful, please let me know with the voting buttons... It encourages me to take the time to write these reviews.
Technique Restaurant=Food-wise, I'm definitely a fan of Technique. But like Big Wong, the price point just sets it over the top. $15 for a five-course meal? As Axel Foley would say... "Get the F outta here!"Before we even ordered, they brought each of us some salmon tartar on a cracker. It was a nice touch to start the meal as we waited for everyone to arrive. I had their Mango Iced Tea to wash everything down. It had a nice hint of mango and was very enjoyable.On to the courses...Cream of Mushroom (Soup of the Day) - Very flavorful and had a nice consistency. Solid start.Lobster Endive Salad - The Duck Confit was tasty and tender. Not enough of it (and the lobster), obviously, but pretty good salad overall.Technique Salad - A pretty basic salad, but the avocado was incredibly creamy and added a lot to the mix.Filet Mignon - My medium-rare steak was perfectly cooked, was a very nice cut of meat, and was very tender throughout. The radishes, beet, pur√©ed potatoes, and the b√©arnaise sauce were excellent complements to the filet. The spinach was pretty flavorless, though.Pumpkin Cr√®me br√ªl√©e - Didn't have a hard crust, but I actually welcomed that. My favorite part is the inside anyway. It was the perfect level of sweetness and creaminess. It came with a gingerbread cookie that was very hard - the complete opposite of the way I like cookies to come out.So with only the spinach and the cookie being detractors, I'd say Technique has their technique down pat. The service was on point. The wait staff was very friendly and my glass of iced tea never dipped below half. Well done Cordon Bleu. I will most definitely return.I came with the BF finally after wanting to try this but rarely having the opportunity on a weekday to be off together. We went for dinner on 6/20. They have gotten rid of the 5 courses, and now do 3 courses for $16. Appetizers we shared: Israeli cous cous salad with  cucumber carpaccio and pickled  red onions. It was very simple and not much to it, but it was clean and refreshing. Vegetable medley with apples in a light curry cream sauce served with pilaf in a tomato was actually really good. The vegetables were all cooked just right to where they are soft, but still have bite, the curry was really nice. It was actually pretty hearty and could be a meal in itself. Entree I had poached salmon, sauteed spinach and rice pilaf. The poach on it was done right, and the rice and spinach was seasoned but it was missing something. There was a bit of sauce bercy and the description said basil oil which I did not see so it may have been forgotten. The BF had herbed mustard pork loin which we thought was odd to have been thin sliced and battered since the description didn't really sound anything like how it was. It was a tad salty for the BF and my taste. the buttermilk cheddar mashed potatoes were good, the veggies were cooked well, and the parmesan roasted tomato was a nice tasty touch. Dessert the almond cookies duo (one plain, one chocolate) were nice and crumbly and were paired with a well done bright raspberry sorbet. The panna cotta though was more like just white jello. There was too much gelatin in it when it should have been just enough to set the cream mixture. Overall though the food was good and there was some pride in presentation. The service was alright. Our server was didnt say much at all and was softspoken to where some of it we didn't know what she said. I found it weird that she  never came up to ask us how everything was while we were eating, never checked on us if we needed anything, no thanks for coming, come see us again, have a good night, etc. at the end of the meal.  It's a open room and we can see a lot of the front staff is horsing around and talking including our server instead of doing their job. When walking out there was a bunch of servers and the maitre d by the door who did not greet people leaving because they were talking amongst themselves and have "checked out" already.  I get that this is still "school" but you're still serving real people who are paying money so this is just like any other business. Some people didn't seem to take it very seriously or learn much from school from how they presented themselves as servers. Maybe harsh, but if these are students that are going to graduate soon then I would think they would cover basic service points so I feel it's fair to call them out on it. Upon dining, I'm a bit surprised that there wasn't any comment cards for diners....if this is for the students to learn from, shouldn't they hear feedback on the good and bad? I know that maybe they don't want to hurt feelings with really ragey commentary but perhaps the instructor can read and use valid critiques into instructing the class. Hopefully the school reads Yelps at least! It's my first time and I know it changes with each class. I will be back as the concept is interesting and the general quality is good.
Snow Ono Shave Ice=SnOw OnO  is so ono!  The best shave ice I've had was in Hawaii, with all the imitators here in Vegas selling "shave ice" that has the consistency of a snow cone: chunks of hard ice that doesn't allow the flavor syrups to seep in.  Marianne of SnOw Ono starts with a block of ice, and shaves it to a fresh snow-like consistency, which allows the syrups to soak into every bite and makes for a very pleasing consistency!Speaking of syrups, there are plenty to choose from; 34 were listed on their menu today: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=BooUS55rP6XFtxwKzPOgNA  There are several add ons that you can use to customize your shave ice, some free and some available for only an additional $0.50 or $1.00.  Today I went with a small Li Hing Mui with Li Hing Mui powder: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=Gybt5eAcCrTM_VMPYnrD2w ; it was delicious!  Seriously, Marianne knows what she's doing (she's a self admitted shave ice addict, afterall!).  Definitely a place to revisit.  Be on the lookout for SnOw OnO at the local farmers markets, especially Fresh52 every Sunday!We love these girls and we love their shaved ice!SnOw OnO has been on our radar since the first mention of their truck and we finally got around to trying them a few months ago!  Boy, are we glad we did!For the Husband and I, we usually share a large with ice cream added.  Our favorite flavors are POG (Passion, Orange, Guava), Mango, Tiger's Blood, and Melona.  But there are still so many we have yet to try! They use those plastic flower cups (that are recyclable) that are often used in Hawai'i.  We think their version is powdery soft, just like Waiola's!  They have about 40 (give or take) flavors of syrups to choose from and you're allocated three for your shaved ice choice.  They also have sugar-free varieties too!Customer service - these girls are super nice!  Not only do they do their best to remember you, but they make a point to thank you for coming by again and again.  (And you actually feel like they really mean it too!)  On our first visit, they made sure we had enough syrup for our shaved ice and if we didn't, to let them know so they could add more.  This the real deal here!  No snow cone action!  Just real island style shaved ice!  The President would be proud!  If he can't make it home and has to stay on the mainland, he knows where to go now!  This truck will be waiting!Prices:Kids size $2Small $3Large $4Bowl $5$1 extra for ice cream, mochi, or azuki beansFree for snow cap with condensed milk, chocolate, caramel, sour spray, or li hing powder. Check out their website for their weekly schedule.  For the most part, they are pretty steady on certain days, but private and special events mix it up a bit!
Cafe325=This Cafe is located near the lobby of the Marriott.They have a full bar right near the hostess stand. The cafe isnt very big but they manage to keep the people moving in and out. We ate breakfast for 2 days and lunch other day. We did a buffet breakfast. They have the typical eggs, bacon, sauage, fruit you know the usual food. It was good though. We also had lunch and there burgers are awesome. I was happy that our hotel had such good food. If you an elite member at the hotel you get a free breakfast.
Segal's Oasis Grill=Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.I really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.They also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!I would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.You should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!!
Buzz BBQ=Finally a good BBQ place in the southwest! Buzz just opened up about a week or two ago. It's owned by 3 guys and this is their second location (the original place is off of Craig Road). I stopped by and ordered a brisket sandwich ($8.00) to go. As I waited I chatted with the hostess and one of the owners. Both were incredibly nice and raved about some of their specialties. The brisket didn't disappoint. It was a huge mound of soft and tender beef brisket on a sesame seed bun. The BBQ sauce that accompanied it had a little kick to it but was also a little on the sweet side... maybe a little too sweet. But, it was still a delicious and filling sandwich. Their fries are also excellent.I'll definitely be back to try some ribs and pulled pork. They had their smoker set up on the patio so the whole parking lot had that amazing BBQ smell.
Kalu=Ahh our second anniversary...we wanted to make it special and try out a few items at KALU to start the night off right. Overall, an B for effort, D for execution. Hubs and I made an 8 pm reservation on Monday night...yes, I expected it to be pretty dead on a Monday evening, but it was our anniversary so we didn't care. We drove up and circled the building for 10-15 minutes trying to find a place to park. After pulling into and out of a handful of different restricted parking lots, we chose the lot across the street from the restaurant. The sign said $5 after 7 pm but the closer of the two scary little boothes was "out of order." So, we rolled in to sit down.Upon entering we asked about parking - where the eff do you park around here? The lot across the street, for $5 apparently. And make sure you pay, because they do come often and check! So, hubs trekked back out to the working (scary) booth to take care of it. FYI - the booth takes cards. Overall, not an awesome start...and they don't have valet on the weekends either.On to the ambiance - it's lovely inside. Tons of modern Asian influences and big, BIG tables - which was a bit weird for us and we were sat at a 5-top with only two people. Not so romantico, but whatev. Our waitress, Lolita, was super sweet and offered a few different options to work through the menu...I will say, though, if there were more people in the restaurant we wouldn't have been able to hear her! She is incredibly soft spoken. Chef Bryan is also extremely hospitable and really made sure that we were comfortable with the menu and ensured that we enjoyed our dishes. And food...here's what we ordered:KALU Ginger Ale: 2/5: An interesting and super sweet combo of ginger ale and an assortment of upscale booze. A little too sweet for me. Wasabi Roll: 4/5 (on the house): Chef Bryan sent this out and made sure that we could "handle the heat." Indeed we can! It was a great start and completely cleared my sinuses! I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was different versions of wasabi, shiso and rice. Rock shrimp tempura: 1/5: Mah-jah bummer here. I was expecting something completely different...I read tempura shrimp and seasonal vegetables...what came out were huge clumps of french fries with a tiny amount of shrimp and scattered veggies. Pork Shu Mai: 2/5: Meh...I didn't like the flavor of the pork...but I know hubs did, though. Not a bad deal for the price...3 for $9. I'd like to try the shrimp next time. Wagyu steak: 3/5: (cooked on the rock): A delicious cut of meat, albeit extremely overpriced at $25. Instead of the pesto topping, it was made with black sesame - a really nice touch. So, will I be back to Kalu? Doubtful...especially considering the cost!Konichiwa! Kalu is located in the bottom of the Courtside building with little signage, but they now have a valet.  I had high expectations when making the reservations after reading a couple articles about it. Then I visited Yelp and say these very mixed reviews. When we first arrived they sat us in the bar area, which has a vibrant, loud atmosphere but there were a few drunk men making a raucous so we asked to be moved once our third person arrived so we wouldn't have to eat dinner in Animal House. Once we got sat in the dining room near the kitchen it was much more civilized. It looked like they had upstairs seating which I bet they use on weekends.The server who was very friendly said up front that it was tapas style, so it's made to share and it comes out when it's ready. In our case we got 5 things and it was perfectly timed to arrive as soon as we finished the course before.  We ordered:-Edamame to tide us over until the 1st course came. 5/5-Their "Chicken wings" - absolutely delicious teriyaki flavor with a lovely crunch from the potato starch they use as covering  5/5 - must have!-Hamachi sashimi on the lit ice bowl 5/5  I couldn't really taste the truffle oil which supposedly was on it but it was so delicious, fresh and almost melted in my mouth. I did study abroad in Japan, so I was really looking forward to seeing the quality of the sashimi. I could almost "cut it with my tongue".-Unagi, avocado and Japanese Peppercorn sushi - 2/5  Only 4 pieces came with this roll and I was thankful it wasn't 8. It was our server's fave roll, but it didn't sit well with me. First of all these kind of fancy complex rolls with lots of ingredients aren't found in Japan so this was really to cater to us. There was some sweet flavor that was a little funky and possibly they had Chinese five spice to the sauce. I love black pepper and usually I can never have too much, but these peppercorns had a totatlly different flavor. One of our party liked it. I couldn't really get to the quality of the eel though. As a result there was 1 unwanted piece at the end.-Wagyu skirt steak skewer with green onion and garlic chips.  4/5 Make sure this is at the end of the meal because it is really a distinctive steak that is very good but very garlicky. We all loved it-Chef's treat of rice with "truffles" but it was crimini and shittake mushrooms which was 5/5 - delish. One of our party was freaked by the crimini, but she's from the Midwest :) So the food was definitely what we all hoped it would be and the plating was exquisite.  So we were ready to cleanse the palate and dive into dessert but the server said that "japan isn't really into sweets" so they only have 1 dessert of the night and that night it was a citrus creme. I enjoyed it because it kind of reminded me of something from my childhood but the other two girls didn't touch theirs after the first bite. So given the selection (or lack thereof) and the group's rating, I have to give it a 2/5   Since Chef Emperor catered to American tastes of all the sushi rolls, I don't know why he wouldn't also throw a couple other things on the dessert menu like green tea ice cream, mochi or tempura ice cream,  or a nice citrus cake.  Maybe he should outsource his desserts to me :) This is the main reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Our total at the end of the night for food was $90 for 3 and wine was $75 which obviously we could have done without. I expected much worse for the food.Would I go back? Absolutely. Hopefully they've worked out all the kinks by now.  I am glad though that I didn't go on a busy weekend. Oishii desu.
Wok Bar=I must update this review.. This place is on the way out.. It went from 5 stars to 2!!! The managers and the best bartender have bailed and their service has gone to *beep*.   I knew they were trying to change into more of a bar than a restaurant but come on guys.. I have ordered the lettuce wraps multiple times here and they have always been excellent.  They brought out medium size raggity old spinach leaves and lower quality cold beef.. Twice..  Ughhh.. Im so disappointed.  Especially because it is in such a good location. Sorry guys. It actually pains me to write this.  I was waiting weeks to write this and gave it multiple second chances.. I even got ROTD for my 5 star review of this place.. Ugh!-Ian M.This place is a low down dirty shame. It's a shame that service and ingredients were not just in short supply, they were.........well, non-existent. I wanted to really to like the place because the food was really good, but dang, how can I when they don't even have rice?The special lil' lady threw a surprise bday dinner and I graciously thank her for that. The restaurant's been remodeled and a complete change  from the previous tenant. Also, the views are still pretty impressive. On top of that, the food was seriously really good. Best Chinese I've had in a while. Enough with the praise though, lets get back to reality. Let the rant begin shall we? There was only like two servers and one of them was the owner. They ran out of bread for banh mi. They ran out of egg rolls. Crab won tons were missing crab. There wasn't proper ventilation so the entire restaurant smelled like smoke, thus probably leaving you smelling like chow mein for a week, and to top it all off they ran out of rice. Yes you heard me, they ran out of rice. How the heck? So anyways, aside from all of those "slight mishaps", I can honestly say the scallion chicken was pretty dang good. I just wish I had some rice. With such good food, it seems they have a lot of potential. I just sure hope they clean up their act, because I do want to see them succeed. I do plan to return for lunch in the near future, and please just have some rice!
Nathans Famous Hotdogs=Was in a rush to get to my gate, then discovered my flight was delayed a 1/2 hour.  Since I was starving, I decided to grab a quick bite at Nathans before my flight.I decided to get 2 Hot Dogs, $5.98.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cQMhOnD_92IUwu9QaGIbrQ?select=_JjLNM3ygygx7PeI83b74ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cQMhOnD_92IUwu9QaGIbrQ?select=SCB50-WT-wbnEbUppmr1oQThey had a nice *snap* to them....just the way I like it.  It's Nathan's, which is normally very good....but for some reason, the airport locations aren't as good.  This one was just average....but it did the job and I was no longer hungry.Return Factor - 60%
Luna's Living Kitchen=Menu is totally vegan, some raw. The burger (not raw) was one of the best I've had since moving to CLT - pleasantly warm, smoky and satisfying, big dollop of guac on top. Super tasty bun. Microgreens everywhere. Like eating a tiny forest.Pastries and bread available for take away, lots of brekkie options. Good coffee, and for an extra .75, you can add a shot of homemade coconut, hemp, or almond milk. Tastes awesome.But the entrees are really where Luna's shines. Raw/whole/vegan art food. Prices are high - sammiches 8-9, entrees 12-13. Yes, it's worth it. Probably the healthiest dinner in town. Let's keep them in bidness, ya'll!While I don't think I could ever eat (and live) life as a vegan or even a vegetarian, Luna's Living Kitchen gave me a really nice experience with that potentially difficult cuisine! I strolled in for a leisurely lunch and ordered up Lunasagna and a lemonade, upon the nice staffer's recommendation. Price wise, Luna's is higher than you'll pay at many a local spot, but the incredibly fresh ingredients can't be cheap (my lunch came to $15). I snagged a stool seat and took in a bit of work for about 10 minutes or so before my order came out. My Lunasagna was so fresh and just gorgeous. Seriously - go check out my picture. The portions were ample and I was really surprised by all the flavor that burst out of the layers, sauce, strands of veggies and cashew bits. The greens accompanying the lunasagna were just about perfect, so much so that next time I'll focus more on a salad packed with Luna's delicious produce. For those who think that vegan cuisine is boring and bland, I recommend trying a meal at Luna's. It may not change your way of life or daily cuisine, but the flavor packed items will surprise you in the best way!Luna's Living Kitchen is an oasis amongst eateries offering comfort food to the extreme. Don't get me wrong... Fried chicken, buttery biscuits and calorie dense mac & cheese hold a special place in my heart (and stomach!). But you won't find any of that at Luna's Living Kitchen. Their carefully thought out plates of well executed (and beautiful) food proved to me that you don't need refined sugar, preservatives, eggs, dairy, or animal products to deliver delicious food. Raw food was a foreign concept to me. It sounded boring and dull. I imagined a vegans diet consisted of eating carrot sticks, celery, and salads all days. I left Luna's with a changed view of the vegan diet and an immense appreciation for how delicious vegan cuisine could be. My girlfriend and I made our way to Luna's on a Saturday afternoon. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful day. Our waitress was attentive and helpful in offering suggestions. I opted for the Fire & Brimstone veggie burger and she chose the Living Burrito. We both ordered coffee with homemade coconut milk. My burger (one of the few cooked items) was amazing. The chipotle sunflower hummus added a nice, subtle, spiciness. My friend really enjoyed her Living Burrito. She was amazed at how well the collard leaf worked as a wrap. The coffee was nice and strong and the coconut milk added a great flavor to it. I am really looking forward to sampling more of Luna's menu. The Iced Coffee with coffee ice cubes sounds awesome and so do many of the smoothies. Yes, the prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for. Fresh, high quality, local ingredients (we saw a chef walk into Atherton Market and emerge with a fresh bunch of Collard greens!!) prepared in a way that is sure to please any palate! I can't wait to go back!Nothing else like it in Charlotte.  The best juices and living food within 100 miles.I was quite dismayed when I pulled up today and Luna's was no longer there.  Then I turned around and saw they just moved across the parking lot.  A much better location with more outdoor seating.  Still the same love being put in to all the juices and drinks.So many amazing options to choose from, but this time I just went with the chillied chai.  I should have gone for a berry smoothie, after I tried somebody else's, but no complaints on my end.  My chai was smooth and almond milk creamy.  Just the little kick I needed to continue my day.Not to much to tell ya on this one as I didn't get any food, but will be back soon!
Rani's World Foods=Finally...my peeps have made it to Las Vegas. Rani's World Foods is an Indian Grocery Store/Chaat Stand that can hold it's own against the mega stores in California and Texas. This store has an amazing array of Indian groceries, frozen foods, produce and to kick it up a notch, they even offer Chaat (Indian snacks) that are served up in their in-house kitchen. We had gone for their opening today and it was a zoo...way too many people and the lines to check out were 20/30 minutes long. But...I had to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these guys have everything an Indian cook/home may need or want. Pickles, multiple lentil varieties, exotic Indian vegetables, flour, spices...everything was perfectly laid out and easy to find. This store is definitely bigger than any other Indian store in Las Vegas. It's well-lit, well-organized and well-stocked. The trifecta. Bonus points to them for their frozen food selections which were not unnecessarily marked up in price - something that the other Indian grocery stores seem to be doing that I frown upon. Gopal's for example, crosses out the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or two more. These guys don't (at least not yet). I haven't had a chance to taste their Chaat offerings as today was free food for all and so the lines were out of control. I hope to have a follow up report some time soon. An Indian store in Las Vegas that rivals Wal Mart. Wow...never thought I'd live to see this day :)The place is clean and very organized and it was nice to be able to find everything we needed easily...They also have serve food...different types of chaat and other snacks as well as mithai....The lady running the food section  is extremely sweet and welcoming..we went to order bhel puri and she offered us pakoras from a fresh hot batch she had just fried. I should never go to the grocery store when hungry cause I ended up also ordering a samosa chat. The portions are huge and I was full after eating some of the bhel! Also, they have free tea which is great..I was also impressed with their customer orientation...the guy at the cash register mentioned alternatives to some stuff we had bought. He even replaced a cauliflower we had chosen stating that it didn't look very good...I will definitely go again even though its a distance from home.We recently fell into an affair with Indian food. If they cook it, we have/will eaten/eat there! It led to a search of cookbooks with many spices I had no clue where to find locally. A little search on Yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants! The BF and I ate at the food booth in the back and shared a  vegetarian thali (comes with 2 dishes-among several choices, dal, rice, pickles, 2 bread:$5.99), samosa chat (I believe $3.99) and a paneer stuffed paratha w/ yogurt ($2.99). It was plenty of food for two and all very nice. I am a big fan of the samosa chat here though. The chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more. There is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area. If you're in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal, definitely drop in. Grocery side has everything we were looking for! They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you're not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not. I suppose it's hit and miss, but hey, it's packet food and isn't anything like the fresh. Eat, cook and be merry!My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, "International Market? That looks interesting."  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, "$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!"So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.The reason for the trip to Rani's was that a friend who lived nearby was looking for some special seasonings for a special dish to prepare. I decided I wouldn't mind going on a field trip and possibly discover some treats that were new to me. Neither one of us had lunch yet and were delighted to find that they had a little restaurant inside! Yay! A 2 in 1! Seeing that it was a new store to the both of us and how we LOVE to peruse international markets for hidden gems we combed the place. No aisle was overlooked. No shelf was neglected. We searched high and low for any and everything. He found the spices that he was looking for. The shelves were well stocked and the place was nice and clean. The place is obviously cared for in that respect. I did notice that things were higher priced here compared to what I have seen in other international markets around town. That was a bit of a disappointment. By the time we were all set to purchase there was no one at the cash register. We looked around and only saw other customers doing their shopping. We saw the bell by the register area and rang it once. The cashier came quickly and rang us up. She didn't greet. She didn't say anything actually. She just held out her hand for the money and practically threw the change at my friend. I thought it was quite rude. We tried to ignore it as we were plenty hungry by this time and wanted to get down to the grub!We made our way to the "restaurant" area. There was already a few people in line. We got in behind them as we tried to decide what we would order. The food that finally came to them did not look appetizing. Everything looked like leftovers just slopped on picnic-ware. It seemed to be taking an extraordinary amount of time for preheated food to be served. We decided to go across the street to find some lunch. I won't be returning to this place. With the overpriced groceries and poor service, it is enough to keep me away.Compared to a typical Indian grocery store, This place is very clean and organized. All the isles are properly marked and doesn't smell like a Temple(mixed smell of about 5 mil incense sticks)Kitchen looks very clean and some great items on the menu with close to homemade taste. Their inhouse sweets are just ok but they are fresh, not frozen for a week shipped from NY or Chcago.My only issue here is service. The lady at the front cash register is so rude, I don't even go inside the store because if her. Absolutely no greeting, no smile and if you ask her a question, lets just say you'll regret it.EDIT: Service has somewhat improved and I feel the review should be changed a bit. Changing from 1 start to 3 till my next visit. Keep up the good work.Anyways, here are my very accurate ratingsCleanliness 9.5/10Organized 9/10Variety 8.5/10Food/Kitchen 7/10Service 5/10Location/Parking 7/10Update!I went back here about two weeks ago to pick up a BIG box of tea...they were closed.  So, my friend and I were going to get back in the car to go kill time till they opened.The older woman who runs the kitchen knocked on the glass and motioned for us to come in.  She opened an hour early for us. THAT is grade A service.  The young lady who rang us up commented about me making "a cup" of tea in a joking manner, so we joked a little, but then I said how PG Tips is my favorite, and she AND the older woman made conversation with me about how its their favorite too.So personable, and spectacular!  :)An Indian friend of mine brought me here to purchase mixes for Indian desserts and I was so surprised by the variety of foods and grocery items this store offered. They had an array of spices, snacks and beauty items available. As for the prepared foods, they had over a dozen desserts made (I didn't get to try these,) but I did snack on chole bhattura (hot, fried bread with a side of tasty chickpeas,) and pani puri (puffed bread that you fill with cold chickpeas and potatoes and chutney.)They also had Indian chai tea (not your typical Starbucks chai,) that was available for hot food patrons. Did I mention this place is vegetarian? I'm an avid meat eater, and this place had the most delicious vegetarian Indian food for a reasonable price. I will be heading back here very soon.This city has a million ethnic specialty grocers: this one stands apart from the pack a little. In addition to a smorgasbord of Indian spices, rices, and teas, they have jewelry, accessories, and some kitchenware as well.Food sections also include  Mediterranean aisle and a British/English foods row. Unfortunately, the produce is not particularly fresh but they have tons of sweets from nearly every culture here.The food counter on the right hand side of the store sells vegetarian indian foods: mostly paneers, dosas, and chaats. The samosas are tasty and the chutneys and other sauces are no joke. Pricing is good, just wish they offered a bit more and weren't necessarily limited to a vegetarian menu.Insider note; they have 6 locations of Rani's, this is the only one in LV and there's another in Houston with the rest in California.
Le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins=Que ca soit pour un 5 √† 7, un souper entre amoureux ou un brunch d'amis, le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins est √† recommander.  Faisant partie du top 10 restaurants du Canada par En Route, le Comptoir offre bien s√ªr des charcuteries et du vin en plus de plats cr√©atifs et oh combien go√ªteux.  Leur charcuterie est absolument √† en tomber √† terre, vieilli sur place et utilisent toutes les parties du porc. Chacune d'entre elle se d√©marque par ses √©pices et assaisonnements soigneusement pens√©s par leur chef.  Les plats se partagent bien et sont simples tout d√©livrant sur la saveur! Leur desserts sont √©galement d√©finitivement √† essayer! Surtout leur riz au lait, soyeux tout en √©tant un peu croquant sous la dent avec leur pistaches caram√©lis√©s!  Et leur brunch est vraiment int√©ressant avec des choix qui sortent de l'ordinaire! Mon coup de coeur: leur boudin avec un oeuf pan√© et coulant √† l'int√©rieur... mmm... J'adore j'adore j'adore le Comptoir!!!
IHOP=I dislike chains, but its 1am on a Thursday night. After a horrible night I needed some good old fashion comfort food. Place clean, no wait, waitress on the ball with refills. Went with the tooty fruity breakfast platter. YUMMO. I feel full and ready for bed and to wake up in better mood thanks to my fabulous waitress.
India on Wheels=They are open from about 11 Am - 3:30 PM Mon - Fri in the winter.They are open from about 11 AM to about 6 PM Mon - Fri in the summer.  According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.  The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.  The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.  The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.    The Mango Lassi is good for only $1.50I think they make the food while you wait.  Call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines.If you happen to find yourself in Oakland and in need of a quick lunch time fix, walk on down to bigelow blvd and give one of the street vendors a try. I previously ordered from thai express- it was 2:30ish and they were out of pad thai already so I had to settle for something else that I can't remember so I guess it didn't leave that big of an impression on me. Id give it another try though.I digress,  it was around 1 and I had a craving for something, but couldn't pinpoint what that something was. I knew I wanted it spicy and I wanted it now so I drove to oakland from greenfield with $6 and got a whole container of fluffy white rice topped with spicy palak paneer. The cheese cubes held up nicely to the velvety spinach. It satisfied my craving and didn't put a hole in my wallet.  For $5 and 5 minutes of your time, you can't beat india on wheels.I hit this truck for lunch earlier this afternoon.  After glancing over the reviews, I called ahead to place my order.  I thought 10 min. would be sufficient, but the guy on the phone told me it would take 20.  So, I gave them 15 min. before heading down to pick up my order.Based on others' recommendations, I ordered a small chicken tikka masala.  Given that the curry I'd ordered from the truck next door had been unbearably spicy for my taste at my normal spice level of 4, I decided to play it safe and order my dish with a spice level of 3.  I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it, which I typically order with Indian dishes.  Both items cost $6 together, which is a bargain, even in Oakland.Both the presentation and quality of the food at this truck were comparable to that of the truck next door.  The dish consisted mostly of rice and curry, with a few large chunks of chicken on top.  The chicken varied in quality, with some chunks consisting of questionable quality dark meat, and one chunk consisting of white meat.  The curry had a decent flavor and consistency, but was rather bland in terms of heat, which was a surprise after receiving super-spicy curry from the truck next door.  As for the mango lassi, it was similar to the one I received from the truck next door in its thin and rather watery consistency.Although the food from this truck isn't something I'd go out of my way for, it's a convenient lunchtime option, esp. for college students and people who work at Pitt or Presby Hospital.  In addition to taking phone orders, this truck is on Tapingo.  Regardless of how you order, just be sure to allow enough time for them to make it, given that the food is MTO.
Tryst Cafe=It was definitely a pleasant surprise the first time ventured into Tryst Cafe.  Everything was so fresh, delicious, perfectly cooked, and the portions were substantial.   The restaurant has very spacious, wide open layout with trendy tables/seating in the patio area.   If you are at Desert Ridge, skip the chain restaurants, and head over to Tryst Cafe instead!   - Hummus Trio (traditional, cilantro, and red pepper) come with fresh Pita or cucumbers (Gluten Free).   - Tryst Ahi Tuna salad - Excellent portion and very fresh.  I would just ask for extra dressing on the side.- Portobello Sandwich - It was very juicy, tasty and satisfying.  The grilled bell peppers and Portobello will fall off of your sandwich. - Monte Cristo (two French toast slices, ham, Gruyere cheese topped with strawberry jam) - it is not greasy, and melted perfectly with the Gruyere cheese.  - Sweet potato tots are the best!  Try dipping with hummus dips if you have any left.  Skip the regular ketchup.What a deal!  All food and drinks are half off 3-6 everyday.  After 5PM receive 2 for 1 cocktails.Was here for happy hour once before with Mom- I'll have to search for the photos and add that review soon.I was looking for something sweet, something French, actually, and was heading to the Herb Box to see what kind of goodies I could find to take home to supply my brain w/ much-needed glucose (the organ's favored source of sugar!) when the Yelp app alerted me of the "seasonal" bread pudding at Tryst.  I called to ask which variety was available today and was told it was chocolate chip.As soon as the plate arrived, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=lmo2yH4mjOSzbhlZ0Vyi_w I remembered it was an item I had tried on the first visit- I felt disappointment at the sight of it, so I knew I must not have enjoyed it that much the first time around.  Well, I'm usually all about second chances, so I dug in.  It's alright.  I like the crispy-crusty bits that also had chocolate chunks the most.  The caramel and chocolate garnishes were just OK, as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=OPYRdqh1SVyR_nc7cWrWSwWas hoping the caramel would remind me of the wonderful goodness I experienced last week at Citizen Public House.  No such luck, but really, how could that even be a realistic expectation?I've just placed my order for the BBQ Bacon burger, minus the BBQ sauce (it contains mustard, and the gluten-free version contains corn syrup).  Happy hour (4p to close) subtracts $3 off all burgers on the menu!  Drink specials sound good, but I'm forgoing alcohol, as I've already consumed a lot of sugar by eating all the great bits of one of the bread pudding triangles.Stay tuned for my burger report (and photos).---------Update:  The BBQ bacon burger, w/ the BBQ sauce on the side, was OK.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=CFaFmlACU4OzZ7XVZt5flQThe pecan-smoked bacon added some flavor to what would've been an otherwise  bland burger.  Too bad I couldn't try the sauce, as server Ryan made it sound like it tasted really good.  I liked the brioche bun best when it had that toasted texture.  The beef is all-natural, no hormones added, but isn't ground in-house (the patties come from Washington, I believe).  No matter- it was good enough.  Ask for medium if you like your burgers tender and pink throughout.  I requested the accompanying sweet potato fries (you get a choice of side) to be extra-crispy.  I first found them a bit boring, but I grew to like them as I ate more pieces.  Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst, either.  The crispness was perfect.  As a Yelp friend noted, after seeing the photos, that the burger looked better than the bread pudding, and that the serving of fries looked a bit skimpy.  My sentiments, exactly.03/06/12My first breakfast at Tryst, and I cannot wait to go back!  (Especially since Tryst offers organic and local produce-- just say no to GMOs!)Arrived at 1pm and had only 45 minutes to spare-- good thing I already checked out the menu online and decided what I wanted to try: the Monte Cristo w/ a side of sweet potato tots, and a cup of organic coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=tYVvx24tyHyryZWgtiTVOg.  Was seated in Joanna's section- friendly server!  The Monte Cristo- two slices of French toast with ham, melty gruyere cheese, and strawberry jam, sliced into two halves, arrived nine minutes after I ordered it-- fantastic!!  The dish looked beautiful, and the plate hadn't even touched my table for two seconds when I overheard Joanna describe to someone at another table what I had ordered.  It was that striking!Looked so tantalizing, and I loved the sweet and salty combination.  I just wished it was heartier... I worked very hard to eat only one-half of the dish.  Same thing with the sweet potato tots (loved the crunch factor of these!)... It didn't take me long to work my way through half of the dish, and I still wanted more!  The Black and Tan organic coffee (black, no cream) was just OK.  I might try a cappucino next time, if only to check out the coffee art.  ;)I think I'm going to check out the Pineapple upside-down pancakes tomorrow!Note: Tryst offers "Tryst Around the World," and March is "Ireland" (I think last month was France).  Anyhoo, there's Potato leek soup (this sounds interesting!), and the salmon dish caught my eye. Tryst offers $10 off if you make a dinner reservation- something worth noting.7/28/11Took Mom here for happy hour, and the whole experience was just 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to three, since the cheese and charcuterie plate was solid, and I was given a second chance at a cocktail (when the first, the mojito, was not very good), so Mom ordered a Bloody Mary, but she didn't like it, either.  We couldn't wait to try the three-hummus plate, but we weren't impressed.  Even the sweet potato tots couldn't cut it.  Just the meat and cheese plate satisfied.  The chocolate chip bread pudding was a HUGE disappointment-- very dry, and not much chocolate flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMA#52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJg#uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJgI don't think I've been back for happy hour...
Dillon's On Top of Central=Maybe this place will stick? Over the years the building just south of Dunlap on Central has been many things, including its last incarnation a grill and steakhouse. But now things seem top be looking up for the location with west valley BBQ mainstay Dillons.Dillons opened its first location at the corner of Thunderbird and the 101 in 1999 and was at the time, pretty much the only thing out there. Since then they've become so popular that opening several more locations were inevitable. I've managed to visit each store and I have to say it's definitely the same experience across the board with a mix of BBQ, Southern cooking and some Tex-Mex thrown in to round the menu out. Fried Pickles ($6.99) are a favorite southern treat and are exactly what the name implies, dill pickles that are battered and fried. Be very careful eating these though because the juice from the pickles super heats inside and can potentially cause severe burns. I'm still pretty indifferent to these having never been blown away by them.You've probably already noticed that anytime there are wings to be ordered, I order them. These are one of the easiest snacks to make and also one of the easiest to mess up. Dillons version of Crispy Chicken Wings ($7.99) are served up juicy and meaty under a light crunchy coating. They also hold back on bathing the wings serving the sauce on the side for your dipping pleasure. The name may sound typical but the flavors of smoked the Chicken Quesadilla ($9.99) were far from it. Tender shredded smoked chicken tucked inside a grilled flour tortilla along with Monterrey jack and cheddar cheeses. Also served with sour cream and house made salsa, it's large enough to order as an entree. Piled high with thick cut bacon, smoked ham, melted cheddar cheese all resting on top of a crunch fried chicken breast, the Chicken Club Sandwich ($9.99) might give you palpitations but is worth every succulent flavor packed bite. The Turkey Club Sandwich ($9.99) is made much like its crispy fried cousin but instead uses sliced smoked turkey meat. After one bite though the meat tasted more like your typical grocery store cold cuts and not from the deli counter but the stuff that comes in bags, overly salty with little to no turkey flavor.Making matters even worse was the salt content on the Red Devil Pork Sandwich ($9.29). The pulled pork and smoked sausage was slopped up with a vinegar based red pepper sauce and then topped with coleslaw. It really should have been a hit but instead left me reaching for my water glass, a few sips and the salty pain was gone.Finishing off the meal was the surprisingly decadent Cinnamon Apple Dumpling ($5.99). A baked pastry wrapped apple surrounded by cinnamon and sugar tortilla chips then adorned with scoops of vanilla ice cream and gooey apple pieces. The dining room is covered with framed posters of old Hollywood. Who knew that Id some day dine with the likes of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn. Breakfast at Dillons anyone?Ain't nevah seen a rack o' ribs dat big, 'cept on a may-un I used ta date!I performed here.  The crowd was really supportive while they gnawed on them thar ribs.  Seriously.  I left that night, thinking of those ribs.There are a lot of regulars, which means a lot to me when I go to a new place.  I've known a couple of other restaurants in that location and they never last, but I hope Dillon's does.The service was super friendly and quick.  The menu is pretty big and I was quite surprised at that.  I'm sooooooo glad they've kept the decor from Central Grille.  I love the booths and brat-pack feel, as well as the dark walls.  There's a lot of wood, too.  That's not a pun, because most of the men were really old and, well, probably lacking in the wood department.
Kennedy's Premium Bar and Grill=Just wanted to update my thoughts on Kennedy's.The patio is still in my opinion one of the best in Charlotte. It's HUGE and they have added a nice little bar out there. It's a great place for day drinking. They also have live music on some nights. Plenty of heaters available for chilly nights.Mondays are still the night to go. Kennedy's has raised the price for all you can eat crab legs, but it still can't be beat. Great deal at $24.95. Thankfully, they did stop taking reservations on Mondays. This makes the process so much easier for both the restaurant and patrons. I haven't had to wait since they stopped holding tables.If the Kennedy's parking lot is full, you can park at the other lots by Jack's and Philosopher's. Avoid the lot across the street from Jack's where the sub place is. They boot cars there left and right.I have to add that owner Kevin Marcuse is one of the most stand up guys I've met in this Charlotte service industry world. I have watched him go above and beyond for patrons of his establishments. He cares about people and it shows.Ok, since I've already written a review for Kennedy's a few years ago, I'm gonna give you the low-down on this place from the start.  This is absolutely BEST PLACE TO WATCH A BOXING MATCH in the Charlotte area bar none!  First, there is no cover charge at the door.  There is plenty of seating both inside and outside on their expansive patio area, and the typical bar food is always great tasting and very affordable.Being a native of #Rochester NY, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that they offer a #Garbageplate - the only place where you can get such a dish anywhere in the Charlotte area.  The only and I mean only, negative I can think of when it comes to Kennedy's is that parking can be very tight especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Otherwise, Kennedy's has everything us Western New Yorkers need to feel right at home here in the Queen City!
The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar=In an alternate universe there will be more crazy fusion restaurants like this...fried chicken and pie...lasagna and hibachi...mole and milkshakes...ok maybe not. BUT, Cowfish does bring together two of my favorite foods - sushi and burgers and does them both surprisingly well!Since I've only snacked on hubs' burger, I'll focus my review on apps and sushi. Let's get to it...1) The scene: Super cool looking restaurant - very pop art-ish with custom sushi/Warhol esque paintings scattered on the red walls. Also, a huge bar and overall big concept (they took the Counter's space & the old Grape space - this place is magnanimous). Tons of tables in the bar area and general dining space. Make a reservation - it shall save you time! 2) The staff: Sharp, knowledgeable and friendly on both accounts I've sat down for a meal here. They are able to walk you through the gigantic menu and help you focus on a few things that catch your eye. 3) The menu: Huge. I mean Cheesecake Factory huge. Almost bordering on so large and detailed you can't take it all in. Think apps, burgers, burgushi, traditional sushi, creative sushi, make your own sushi, milkshakes, desserts, oh my. 4) The food: De-freakin'-licious. A few things I've really enjoyed here...-Crab Rangoon dip: Just as you would imagine, but better. Not for the dieting kind: fried wonton crisps, drizzled with sauce and dunkable in the crabby rangoony dip. Yes, please.-Tropical Storm Roll: super fresh, delicious and huge. *Word to the wise, if you want to actually fit a piece of a sushi roll in your mouth, ask them to cut the rolls into 10 pieces instead of 8. Trust me...your jaw will thank me.-Mango Tango Roll: Yummmm. I love just about anything with mango and this creative mixture is delightful. Plus - jalapeno! Nom.-Fried pickles: Tasty and crunchy with a delicious dipping sauce. -White Diamond: Normally I shy away from panko, flash fried rolls but this is pretty flavorful! I may ask for a bit more heat next time, too. 5) The prices: Honestly, pretty reasonable prices considering how much food you get to indulge in! Plus, the.sushi.rolls.are.huge. And the apps are pretty generous in size. Sharing is caring...share a few rolls with friends, you'll have plenty of food to go around. I also noticed that their lunch menu looks pretty slammin' and reasonable! So that's my long winded review of Cowfish. I really adore this chic fusion eatery and can't wait to go back!Sleek, modern, funky fresh and hip pretty much sums it up. From the Warhol inspired Godzilla painting to the burger "king" who I always found creepy; the decor is contemporary, atmosphere is live, and service is fabulous. Our waiter, Walter is a master of his trade. Prices are surprisingly affordable and if the name wasn't a dead give away - yep this place also has an eclectic menu. From the Burger bento box, to filet oscar roll to the Arnold Hamandegger burgah. It's all good in the hood. Fish is fresh with some traditional, some make your own and the ever so present specialty rolls. One point I must touch on is when the server brought out our food, she asked if we wanted anything else? I happily obliged and she had no qualms when I put in an order with her rather then our waiter. When we let our waiter know it was our first visit , he had the manager come out to introduce himself, greet us, and offered a free appetizer for the next visit. He was either: 1. Very personable, takes pride in the business, and delivering a great experienceor 2. Recognized my pretty lil' face from Yelp and wanted to bribe me ;)Before you leave, make sure you make a stop to the bano. Just as the crazy name implies, you will hear an even crazier recording of a phrase in English, then translated in redneck and lastly translated in Japanese.I could eat sushi every day but unfortunately the hubby doesn't feel the same way.  Cowfish is the perfect place for us since I can get my sushi fix while he can eat regular american cuisine.  Whoever came up with this concept is a genius!  The menu at Cowfish is very extensive including lots of tempting apps, a huge array of typical (and atypical) sushi, burgers, "normal" american entrees (grilled chicken, steak, etc), and plenty of milkshakes and other non-ice cream desserts.We started with a FREE appetizer by becoming a "cowfish junkie" online before dinner.  All you have to do is enter your email address on their website and they'll send you coupons.  We had the blackened ahi tuna nachos.  I thought they were incredible with lots of complementing flavors coming together in a perfect combination.I ordered a double salmon roll and the foreplay roll for dinner.  The sushi description says an 8 piece roll is big enough for an entree and I was a little skeptical.  Turns out, an 8 piece roll was more than enough to fill me up and I had to take 8 pieces home with me.  Each piece of the roll is huge and hard to fit in your mouth in one bite.  I would highly recommend asking for it to be cut into 10 pieces to avoid any awkwardness.  Both rolls were stuffed with fresh salmon and other ingredients and were delicious!  The sushi was definitely comparable to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant.The decor was modern cool with all red walls, black ceiling, and bright, colorful pop art on the walls.  This place could double as a decent date spot or a cool place to hang with some friends.  If you're cold-natured like me try not to sit next to the large garage-style retractable doors in the winter.  It gets a little breezy.Our waiter was excellent and he gave good recommendations for each section of the menu.  That was quite helpful and practically everything we ordered came from his recommendations.  At the end of our meal the manager came over to introduce himself and he gave us 2 more FREE appetizer coupons!  If I hadn't been sold already the extra free stuff would've won me over for sure.How many places do you know that serve sushi, burgers and burgushi (combine them both) in one restaurant? Exactly, none...for that reason Cowfish deserves a 5-star review. They back it up with their great food, menu and service. Been here at least 10 times and it's safe to say I've tried a lot of menu items. I usually sit at the bar because there's always a wait when I get there. Bartenders are knowledgeable and quick with their service. As for the menu. The sushi is really good. Not as good as some specialty sushi restaurants around town, but the rolls are unique and large. Recommendation...ask the rolls to be cut in 10 pieces vs. 8 so they are more manageable. The burgers are really good. This is my favorite part of the place. The Green Monster burger has avocado, pepparjack and jalapenos on it! They're also at least 1/2 pound...big! Choice of sides are abundant, but sweet potato fries are usually the norm. On a recent visit I went with the Ahi Tuna burger, which was very tasty and had a nice Asian slaw on it. But for something unique and light, go with the bento box...definiately for lunch. Comes with 5 sections. Small (4 piece) roll of your choice (think there's 3-4 options), a mini burger of the day, sweet potato fries, edamame and cucumber salad. A little bit of everything for those that can't decide because the menu is so BIG. My only two complaints are 1)the menu itself, as it's so big. Everything Ive had on it has been good, don't get me wrong...you just need a solid 5-10 minutes to look it over, hence the reason for multiple visits and 2) PBR tallboys are $5. From one who loves PBR, this is just a laughable price. I look forward to enjoying the large patio when the weather is warmer. This is the new hot spot of the Southpark area and it's well deserved.It was my last meal in Charlotte this go 'round, after another extended 5-day weekend visiting my parents, and I knew I really wanted something different before leaving. Having eaten my fill of Southern style specialties while staying at home with them, my radar began blinking frantically when I did a quick search for new (relatively) places in Charlotte since my last visit. Having worked in the area for many years selling wine I had already been to most of the more unique spots in the city, and then I stumbled upon what surely had to be a typo...The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar? Ummm, what? Then, my mind flashed to my last trip here over Christmas and some shopping that was done at South Park mall. I recalled riding past a place with a burger and sushi on the awning, and my immediate reaction at the time was a similar "what the hell?" Well, nothing more had to be said. I didn't even have to pull up the menu to know this would be my destination for lunch.When we arrived at our destination, which you would likely never find if you weren't specifically looking for it, it was a bit past prime lunch hours (somewhere between 1 and 1:30), but the restaurant was still surprisingly hopping for a Monday afternoon. I passed up the chance to eat outside, as you have no idea what the patio space looks like upon entering. This was a mistake, not because the inside was bad, but because after I saw the nice large patio adjacent a beautiful fountain I really wanted to be eating out there. Sitting inside did offer a vantage point of the strange and humorous wall art, half mocking half embracing the fusion of burger and sushi, along with an enormous fish tank and easy access to our server. A quick trip to the restroom revealed another of Cowfish's oddities, a foreign language "learn to speak Japanese" track playing, combined with what could only be described as "learn to speak Redneck" version. Hearing the cute little J-pop voice followed by Cletus was certainly a shock, and I made another visit before leaving just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating (and I had to rinse an obscene amount of grease from my beard).The real reason for coming here though is obviously the strange mix of food offered on the enormous menu. First are the appetizers, some of the best meal starters I've seen offered. This isn't your typical "hey let's fry something or add cheese to it" type of appetizer. They're all well thought out and incorporate a breadth of flavor profiles. Then you've got a page full of burger options, followed by several pages of very creative sushi rolls, and finally their signature item, a combination of burger and sushi they've deemed burgushi. It sounds like something the bumbling idiot Fabio from Top Chef would pronounce, but the concept is actually quite appealing when you see the menu descriptions.I began with a couple appetizers, hoping my mom would assist me in eating them so I would have room for a burger, and the "Mother Load" roll, which features a piece of every fish on their menu in one hell of a creative presentation. I wound up eating both of them by myself though, so I had to cut out the sushi. I started with the blackened Ahi tuna nachos, which are wonton chips topped with crab Rangoon dip, pico de gallo and avocado and some seared tuna. I thought the quality of everything in this item was superb, although the crab dip definitely overtook the flavor of the tuna. It really benefitted from just a few drops of added Sriracha to help balance all the flavors. Next up I dove into the Caribbean summer rolls, which have boiled shrimp, lettuce, mint, mango, cucumber and chive, and when combined with their spicy peanut sauce they were actually some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, anywhere. The size was huge too, definitely worth the $9 price tag if you're debating which appetizer to order.In between the appetizers and our burgers came the only real faux pas of the meal by Cowfish, and that was actually delivering our burgers just minutes after our appetizers had arrived. I had eaten literally one and a half of the big nachos, and not even begun on the rolls, when both our burgers were brought out. I decided not to complain and just go along with it, mixing bites from everything at once, but then I bit into my burger and realized that the medium rare I had requested was actually medium well, and produced no juice whatsoever. This I had to say something about, and it was promptly remedied by the chef, and comp'ed off the ticket by the manager. 1) Businesses take note, that's how you take care of a customer. 2) Yelpers take note, that's how you correct an error without bitching about it and deducting stars.As for the actual burger, I went with the Arnold Hamandegger (self explanatory), and when properly done was wonderfully juicy, with just the right amount of egg yolk seeping over the bacon and ham. The "Cowfish sauce" was pretty tasty too, and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly.Being a loyal fan of The Counter, I felt betrayed when it closed and this crazy fusion restaurant called Cowfish (what is a cowfish anyway?) took its place. Apparently, I am a weak-willed women because I eventually gave in to my curiosity a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I arrived around 9 o'clock and were shocked to see a flock hungry patrons sitting outside, beepers in hand, waiting for a table. We went inside to put our names down and were very impressed with the interior of the restaurant. I am not really one of those people who pics a restaurant based on the design or how 'cool' it is but this certainly worked in Cowfish's favor. After our number came up and our beeper started flashing, we were taken to our table and greeted by one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. We told her we had never been there before and she proceeded to guide us through the very large menu, answering any questions we had as she went. We proceeded to order the blackened ahi tuna nachos for our appetizer and we each chose the bento boxes for our entree. When the nachos arrived, I was in awe of how big they were. The 'nachos' are actually fried wontons and they are topped with their crab rangoon dip, pico de gallo, avocado, greens, and delicious ahi tuna. I took my first bite and literally fell in love. The tuna was fresh and all of the toppings tasted like they had been sliced and prepared to order. We scarfed them down in minutes and resisted the urge to place an order for more. Our bento boxes arrived soon after finishing the appetizer. I was amazed to see a huge selection of food with very generous portions. The box contained their mini burger of the week, the bib, which was served on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese and chili. The burger was tasty and fulfilled my desire for the comforts of The Counter fare. We moved on to the sweet potato fries (crispy and well-salted), Thai cucumbers (really delicious), and edamame (pretty standard). We saved the sushi roll for last, I selected 'Mark's Roll' which was spicy with jalapeno and siracha and very well-made. My boyfriend had the rainbow roll which was not as good as my roll but still very good. We had a great experience at Cowfish-- great food, great service, great atmosphere. I have been back since then and will continue to come back for fabulous food.It had been a while since I'd ventured into The Cowfish. Their long waits make it somewhat of a standoff for hungry Southpark goers. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were astonished at how fast we were seated. They make it happen here. Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass! For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries. Entrees:My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalape√±os. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat. I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!The Cowfish is worth anyone's time. Charlotte native, visitor, what have you, you need to stop in and sample their vast menu. Service is professional, fast and friendly. Warning: be prepared to wait on busy nights! That patio is hot to trot in the Southpark scene. Get in there fast!Cheers!Once upon a time, there was an amazing burger place right outside of SouthPark Mall: The Counter. This place was amazing, and when it closed I was devastated. Once it was replaced with The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, my grief quickly went away. The Cowfish is absolutely amazing. It's owned by the same people who own eeZ in Birkdale, and having dined there, I knew the food would be delicious &amp; inventive, and I was absolutely right. But then again, I'm always right =)The Cowfish has the traditional style rolls (Philly, rainbow, etc) and a huge list of wildly inventive &amp; exotic rolls to choose from as well. When Graham &amp; I visited the day after Christmas, I wanted to try something different than I had ordered on previous visits. We decided on three (although I wanted about ten...), one from each section: the rainbow (a traditional roll), the blackened tuna (a more unique/fusion style roll) &amp; the Doug's Filet Roll (burgushi).I'll start with the burgushi, because it's what makes The Cowfish stand out above other sushi restaurants (and Charlotte has a TON of them!). Burgushi is taking the elements of a burger and making it into a sushi roll, or taking the elements of a sushi roll and making it into a burger/sandwich.This was amazing. It was a Philly roll, topped with a piece of seared filet mignon, spicy sauce, scallions & masago. Absolutely amazing. I could even look past the blob of cream cheese (which I HATE in sushi). The roll was enormous, but everything about it was perfect, I really loved the spicy sauce and the very mild flavor of the filet. This is definitely my favorite item on the "burgushi" part of the menu, so far. The Rainbow Roll was, of course, my favorite. It was a California roll topped with assorted fish & spicy sauce. The fish was fresh & firm, the sauce was nice & didn't overpower the roll. I absolutely hate it when there is so much sauce you can't really taste anything else. I would have been more than happy to eat this all day. The last roll we had was the blackened tuna: Lump crabcake mix & cream cheese inside, rolled in temoura flakes, topped with blackened tuna, guacamole & a slice of jalepeno. While this roll was good, it didn't compare to the other two. The roll tasted dry & the slice of jalapeno was completely overpowering. However, the guacamole was a nice touch and absolutely delicious. I removed the jalapeno and added a different kind of heat with a little srirachia. It was a better flavor combination, in my opinion and I enjoyed the remaining pieces a lot more with this change. Not only was the food excellent during our lunch time visit, but the service was excellent as well. Our server took the time to go over every single aspect of the menu, and gave us a recommendation out of each category. The Filet Roll was one of her suggestions, and I'm so glad we went with that. My ONLY complaint here is that they are always busy, and they only take reservations from 11:00-6:00, which makes zero sense to me. Especially since most of the shops in the area (excluding the mall), close at 6:00 or 7:00. Lunch patrons can browse & shop while waiting for a table. Dinner patrons can not. I had wanted to eat here for our anniversary, but knew we would have to either wait forever or eat at the bar, so we changed our plans. We still had to wait, but 15 minutes isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things. Last time I went was on a Thursday night, and the wait was much, much longer so we ended up dining at the bar. Fine for a dinner with a friend, not as okay for an anniversary dinner with your husband. However, this place is worth the wait and I can not wait to go back on my next trip home.Is something really "hype" or "hyped up" if it fully lives up to its expectations?  Coming from out of town, I had not heard any "hype" about Cowfish. I was just in the area and as usual, let trusty Yelp guide me to a place that looked good.  I read a few reviews to get an idea of what to order, but it was not until I started to read more, that I realized that this restaurant had a reputation to live up to.We were intrigued that this restaurant specialized in two things our family loved: burgers (my husband & boys) and sushi (me!).  Starving, we made our way over for lunch on a Friday, only to be told it would be a half hour wait.  The wait was only about 20 minutes, which gave me a chance to explore the lengthy menu and look at yelp reviews for food suggestions. We were all ready to go when the very friendly server came for our order. Warning:  I think just reading what we ate for appetizers might give one coronary artery disease!  The two Moms and their teenage daughters (eating their salads) sitting at the next table looked at us in both horror and envy as we chowed. All I could tell them was, " Eating is different with little boys!"  They laughed and said, "We wish we got what you did!"We had:  Coconut Battered Onion Rings ($6), served with a horseradish aioli & Thai sweet dipping sauce. I am not usually an onion ring fan but i did taste these, especially because I love to dip. They were huge, crunchy,& delicious!Crab Rangoon Dip ($11) - great recommendation by yelpers! Unusual, creamy, yummy!Parmesan Truffle Fries ($8) - with Parmesan cheese & bacon. So tasty! Really sinful!  The apps alone left me stuffed!They have more unusual burgers at Cowfish than I have ever seen. Husband & 11 year old shared two: 1) the Hunka Hunka Burnin Love ($16):  Yes, a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas, & bacon. You could almost hear Elvis singing! It was good, but not as great as burger #2) the Arnold Hamandegger ($13):  cheese, ham, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions, cowfish sauce, onion roll. 9 year old and I each had our own Bento Boxes. These are combo meals with a mini burger, sushi roll, thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries, & edamame. It is really the best of both worlds and it was a fantastic choice!    9 year old got the Cowfish Bento Box ($9) which came with a plain mini burger and he chose a Philly Roll, which he loved. I got the Ultimate Bento Box. I really did not care much about the double stack featured mini burger. I thought it was somewhat dry and I just tasted it. I got the ultimate because I wanted to try one of the special rolls.  There are many unique rolls (as well as sashimi, nigiri). You can even create your own roll. I tried "The Boss" and it was original, satisfying, and delicious:  Spicy tuna, kani salad, cucumbers inside, coated in tempura flakes, topped with avocado, tuna, etc. Service was very friendly and efficient.  Our server even pointed out that Joey Fatone was in the house. Woo hoo!  The manager (possibly owner?) stopped by to see how everything was and I begged him to open a place in Fort Lauderdale.   Proof enough we loved this place?I think you can see from the number of times I've checked into this place that I love it hear. It's not just the food, it's the staff too. They're sweet as pie. :) The food is great too and the location is awesome. I know the wait can be long, but you can get a text and go to the mall. That's what we do. Now for food if you are a sushi love the rolls are huge. So thick you almost can't get them in you mouth and rolled tight! They also amazing nigiri plates, and burgers for non sushi eaters an then there's the filet mignon sushi roll. Yup and yes you can have that stuffed with lobster. So yeah, I come for the food stay for the friendly and fast service. It's a big ol bonus!:) timeI absolutely love this place. I'm not really sure how anyone couldn't fall in love with Cowfish. They have it all. Sushi, burgers, milkshakes, sake... they even have fried pickles! Yes, a sushi joint has fried pickles and they are damn good. First thing you need to know: there will be a wait on Friday and Saturday nights. A long wait. At least an hour. You may even wait on a week night. Scope out the bar. Grab a spot if you see one. Or, put your name on the list and walk somewhere else to have a cocktail or shop while you wait. They do not take reservations. Specials: Mondays- 1/2 price cocktailsTuesdays- 1/2 price martinisWednesday- 1/2 price bottles of wineThursday- 1/2 price sakeThe food: you can't really go wrong with anything here. There's a TON of options on the menu. You may get overwhelmed looking at it. Take a deep breath and dive in to the deliciousness.  I love to order the fusion specialty bento box. I go with whatever the slider of the day is. The sides are delicious. My favorite is the cucumber salad.Apps: do you like crab rangoon? ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON DIP. It's a deconstructed crab rangoon and it's delicious. It's worth noting again... the fried pickles are damn good. Big Al's Yellowtail, Tuna Nachos, parmesan truffle fires... all fantastic. Your biggest problem here may be narrowing down your order. Super unique and always worth the wait. This is a great spot for girls night or date night. I love to bring out of town guests here.Popular place where everyone can find something they like on the menu.I've been here many times and never realized I didn't review it. The concept is as odd as the name suggests. Cowfish...  You can get a bento box of sushi (really good) and your friend can be having a burger and milk shake.. it's great when you have friends who don't eat Sushi or don't want it and you are really craving some...Everything is great quality, but be warned when I say it is POPULAR, I mean you will have to wait to be seated on key nights.. and at lunch time.. but it's worth it.I find the parking situation for all the places in this center a bit annoying too, but it doesn't deter most people.
Stacks and Yolks=Vegas Yelpers!I'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!Came here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.This is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!I ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!I won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.Can't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.As for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.Casual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think.The custom omelette my wife got with bacon, avocado, mushrooms, and greenpeppers was good. As were the home fries it came with. My lemon blueberry pancakes, on the other hand, were too dense and thick. It was almost like trying to eat a wet dish rag. It was one of the most unpleasant things I've eaten in a while. The orange juice wasn't my favorite either. It tasted similar to frozen concentrate that was too watery. On the plus side of the dining experience was the friendly service. The two servers were busily rushing from table to table but always seemed to have a minute to chat.11:30 we walked in & greeted by the bus person. We ordered our food at 11:40 am.  I ordered coffee & asked the waiter for French Vanilla creamer. After waiting 10 minutes, I figured it slipped his mind.  So no biggie I asked the bus lady politely for creamer.  Our waiter over heard me asking her,  apologized & poured the cup of creamer. Now I'm starting to notice the people across from us had just gotten their food 35 minutes after we ordered. 12:15pm we asked the bus lady to check on our food she tells us the cook was by himself today.  Oh GREAT!  12:20 rolls around and they served my bf's french toast cold & set his side order in front of me.  So I didn't get my food at all. Lovely.  My bf walks up to tell them his food is cold & the waiter told us, "it JUST came out".  The food & plate were cold. So cold the butter didn't even melt! Ha, insulting our intelligence is strike 2. Then he says,  since we had not ate anything we could leave. My response was "GOOD!" Then come to find out they had a B grade by the health inspector & many demerits in the past.  They were featured on dirty dining (channel 13 news) before the name change.  Steer clear of this place to avoid food poisoning. I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes from what I could tell from my bf's order.  It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi. We're sitting down at The Cracked Egg on Sunset & Rainbow.  I waited 10 minutes & our food was up. They are reasonably priced for the huge portions. We've gotten coupons in the mail for our loyalty.I really wanted to like this place, because I love supporting local. However, I just didn't. First of all, the atmosphere is uncomfortable. There are a bunch of young kids working there that are really doing nothing. They kind of just wander around staring at everyone. It's not pleasant. It's not their fault they have nothing to do, but the owner should cut labor and save himself a little money. Secondly, the food was not seasoned at all. I am not sure why but our home fries had no salt at all and were only partially cooked. Lastly, over 30 dollars for two people to eat breakfast is pretty steep. I wouldn't have a problem with it if it was good, but it just wasn't.Sucks and Yucks. Where do I begin?Came on a Sunday afternoon, dined al fresco because the weather was beautiful and my party was starving and it meant we would be sat right away. Server came over quickly, teas and coffees arrived, menus were perused, then orders placed...ENTER THE VOID!Servers disappeared, bussers kept glasses full, but nothing... Our server was MIA and 20 minutes later a table that sat way before we did got food. Ours arrived about 20 minutes after that. I am all fine and dandy waiting for something to be cooked fresh (45 minute waits for Chicago pies is half the adventure), but what arrived came out lackluster, underwhelming, and just gross. I got my eggs poached. They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad. The ONLY redeeming thing about this visit was the pumpkin pancake I ordered. That ish was the bizzzz-ness!WORST. BREAKFAST. EXPERIENCE. IN. LAS. VEGAS. I could have had 2x the food and it been more palatable at Denny's or IHOP! This is a mom & pop that makes you remember why you HATE going home for the holidays. So much potential down the drain.Omg where do I start! This place is a hot mess! Joel and I were on this side of town for his job and we hadn't eaten breakfast. Since it was a Monday other places in the area were closed. So Stacks & Yolks it was. Right away when you walk in there is confusion. It's not a lack of staff either. There are plenty of people just total unorganization. When we were finally seated. (There was a hostess stand outside, but no hostess.) We weren't even given menus. We had to sit there for a while until we finally could flag someone down. They took our drink orders and came back to take our order. I had decided on the Crab Cake Benedict and Joel had the regular Corn Beef Hash with a side of sourdough toast. While waiting for our food I had to practically beg for a refill on my coffee and a water. Also, while we were waiting our waiter came over and asked if we had ordered something that we had not. Then he went around to all the other tables asking who's order it was. Wow. That was not a good sign.Our food came out and I was ready to dig in. The waiter not the original waiter asked what kind of toast Joel had wanted and he repeated Sourdough. The waiter said it would be right out. My Crab Cake Benedict looked kinda sad. The Crab Cake itself was crisp and tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was clearly old cause it wasn't runny, but congealed. The potatoes had no flavor and tasted like something they threw on the flat top for 1 minute and pulled off. Well, after 10 minutes Joel finally got his toast. It wasn't Sourdough however, but Wheat. It was so dry and cold that the fake butter wasn't even melting. It was some seriously sad toast. Talk about sad was Joel's Corn Beef Hash. We were both assuming it would be freshly made in house. We were very wrong. It came out of a can and was gross. I really felt we could have made it better at home. He asked for his eggs to be poached. Which they were, but  they were served in a little bowl that still had some water in it. Why not put them dried on the hash itself?  So we are done with our meal and I ask for the check. The waiter said he'd bring it over. 15 more minutes roll by and no check. Meanwhile, people were standing outside glaring at us because they are waiting to sit down and eat! The waiter comes back and asks "have we gotten our check?" I respond with a "no." He walked away. I was hoping to get the check!! By this time my debit card is out and I'm annoyed. Finally, some other guy brings us our check. I didn't even look at it. I just handed him my card and the response I got was a fist bump. Normally I'm down for fist bumps, but a fist bump is not an acceptable form of apology for bad service and bad food. Just sayin! I will never again return here. It was a total waste of my money and my time. Believe me heed my warnings and steer clear!! Run, run now!!!A popular breakfast spot! We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm and this place closes at 3pm so we were very surprised to see a line and we ended up waiting about 15 mins in the rain so I was really hoping the food would be outstanding. The small restaurant is very colorful and has a fun vibe so things started off well. We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of pulp. Next came our egg breakfasts, mine with bacon and his with ham. The portions are huge here and both plates were very delicious, no complaints and we would definitely order them again. Now to the disappointments. I ordered a single stack of the lemon & blueberry pancake and it was very dense, no fluffiness, no moisture and no lemon flavor. The portion was huge but I didn't want it :(Next came the single portion of the French toast which again was dense and covered in cinnamon which wasn't pleasing. Both sweets left us regretting we ordered them. The service was fantastic and our waiter was a funny one which I always love. I hope someone reads this who can make improvements on the pancakes & french toast. Overall we enjoyed ourselves except for the sweets.I loved it! The service was impeccable, the food was on point and I loved the decor. Saw that they had 3.5 out of 5 stars on Yelp but decided I was in the mood for a late breakfast and they were conveniently located. I don't know why they only have 3.5 stars. The waiter was attentive, friendly, informative and quick! We got our fresh squeezed orange juice immediately and perhaps less than 10 minutes after ordering our food was in front of us. The orange juice was delicious. Fresh squeezed yumminess. The poached egg on the eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked. Love when you cut into the egg and it drizzles perfectly over the Canadian bacon and English muffin. The home fries that they were served with were perfectly seasoned and the small biscuits and gravy I ordered were perfectly smothered in honest how gravy. Yum! I also had a bite of my fianc√©'s French toast and wow was it good. Fluffy, cinnamon, sugary delight! They cooked the side of bacon he ordered just as requested extra crispy! They were just on point. We're looking for a house in the area and once we move I think this'll be my go to breakfast joint.
Rock n Roll Sushi=When you're in the Vegas, it's all about excess, whether it's gambling, drinking, clubbing, eating, or snorting coke. Uh. Yeah. I meant drinking Coke. Caffeine is essentially a major food group in the Vegas.Anyway, if you enjoy other food groups and excessive eating, then Rock & Roll Sushi is as safe a bet as any in the Vegas. For $24.95 you get all you can eat made to order nigiri and rolls. Here are the rules of the game: you have a one hour time limit, you order a round of sushi at a time, and you are charged if you leave anything on your plate. I went two rounds. In round one, I had some miso soup, plenty of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, albacore, tuna), a fried spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll with shrimp tempura inside. For round two, I enjoyed more salmon, yellow tail, and albacore. The salmon was delightful. The albacore was tasty too. The yellow tail could have been better. I was not a fan of the tuna, but I have never been that into tuna for some reason, unless it is toro. My main grip with the nigiri was that in round one, the fish slices were very small. Look, I came here to eat and you're going to charge me if I leave food behind, so you might as well get my belly full early.As for the rolls, they were good (especially the fried spicy tuna roll), but were sloppily made. For an all you can eat joint, they held back on the rice, which was nice. The staff was cool. It was interesting to see a female sushi chef. I heard somewhere that you don't see many female sushi chefs because they have warmer hands than men, so it ruins the fish. I just think it's some urban legend that Japanese men spread around so Japanese women would have one less reason to wield a knife. I am not sure if my urban legend conspiracy theory is true, but I think other men in other cultures should try this too. I am sure John Wayne Bobbitt would agree.Great Sushi!!!! Great Chef!!!!! Horrible service!!!! Born and raised in these united states, I completely understand English and after 16 year of schooling I can definitely read a menu, for some reason I was treated by a server/ manager as if I couldn't comprehend... LolAfter leaving the nail salon in the area we decided to walk over to this place for a bit to eat. They have a special for "all you can eat sushi" for 25.00, so it was automatically assumed that we wanted the special..... So details about the "all you can eat sushi" were discussed right away, and that we had to eat everything on our plate before we could order more, and we needed to understand that an 18 percent gratuity is expected....and so on and so forth. I finally interrupted her and explained that we were not interested in her "all you can eat sushi" special, it was 1pm and we were just grabbing a couple of rolls (lady, please calm down). We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave a little giggle as we made comments about the manager/waitress being a lunatic. I ordered the dragon roll, it was sooooo yummy. My friend ordered the crunch roll and we kinda shared both of the rolls. My tab was about $14 which was not bad. We tipped the Chef and got out of there before she added a price to the water, pickled ginger and wasabi. Lol 3 stars for the Chef and the food only. My next visit to Vegas I will be sure to search for a place with better service.
Sandbar Mexican Grill=Love the new Sandbar at Desert Ridge!  The patio is so inviting, and a place like this is much needed in this area.  I'm pretty sure that this will be my new spot for strawberry margaritas during happy hour.  We came for opening night and tried the guacamole and mussels.  It was insanely busy, but I couldn't believe how quickly our order came out, considering it was their first night open and how many people were there! The guacamole was great- I'm very picky about my guacamole, at some restaurants it gets a stale taste to it.  At Sandbar, however, it was fresh and nicely prepared.  The mussels were phenomenal.  I've always been more of an oyster gal myself; mussels always seem to come out a little too fishy for my taste.  However, ours came out very well.  Overall, we had a blast.  FINALLY, a great place in the Desert Ridge area! Kudos!So here is the deal, I get that this is supposed to be like being at Manny's in Rocky Point, the ocean on one side, drunken slutty girls on the dance floor, and more booze than you know what to do with. But the thing is if I were at Manny's, I'd be wearing a bikini, some denim shorts and flip flops. Totally comfy and cool for a night of humidity, wind, sand, tequila, lots of sweating and bad decisions. Ok now I'm wishing I was five years younger and I could actually BE at Manny's right now. I digress, this environment just isn't conducive to a normal prissy girl's get up. I know I'm not the only one fighting the granules of sand in my heels, because that seems like it is the only thing my girlfriends and I talk about all night. "Ouch, I can't get this damn sand out" "Well take your shoes off" Shoes taken off, shaken, and placed back on. "Damn it! More sand!" ...yea. It's a vicious cycle. So, really cute guy with the GORGEOUS blue eyes, I really was interested in what you were saying...I just had little tiny pebbles cutting into my skin the entire time you were talking to me. Maybe next time you'll still think I'm cute in flip flops? Here is to hoping...+1 star for the street taco stand. Saves whomever is my DD a stop at Jack in the Box on the way home.Wow, so if you want to eat at a place that advertises Happy Hour specials on 4x4 cards and then charges you full price despite the fact that you are handing the specials card to the waitress, who then supposedly talks to the manager and comes back to the table and said it was a "printing error" and you still owe full price, than this, my friend, is the place for you.My five friends and I came here for happy hour that they had advertised as starting on Feb 12th. They have a DJ spinning some fun tunes, the sun is shinning, and we are drinking and munching away enjoying ourselves thinking we may have found a new HH joint. Our waitress seemed new, as she would have to ask the bartender every once in awhile if the offered the drinks we wanted, but she was really nice and apologetic to us and thus we have no qualms with her. It's the management that would not give us our happy hour prices that were literally laid out in front of us. It's not that we can't afford regular price, but who doesn't love a good happy hour. Poor business strategy. You lost five patrons. Back to Old Town for us!Whhyyyyyy?? Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much.Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude. One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me. I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad.Ugh.Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!! I love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer! This place has always been super friendly!! As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!! :)  Hope you enjoy it!!!My buddy calls me a week ago, he says: I reserved a cabana at Sandbar for next weekend, can you go? Not knowing anything about Sandbar, my first thought is: ... a cabana? This guy's known me for 20 years. When have I Ever given him the impression that I want to hang out in a cabana?  ... An effing cabana!? I answer: Sure man! What time?Fast Forward One Week...It's Saturday night around 9:30-10pm. I pull into the parking lot and I see Sandbar Mexican Grill. Oh ok, I get it. This must be a little Mexican restaurant that has cabanas and we're going to eat and make interesting conversation. This should be fun!I walk up and first notice the motorcade of taxis hanging around outside. Hmm interesting. Then I almost reach the door, and there are 3 door men... ok... that's a bit odd for a Mexican restaurant in a suburban outdoor shopping mall, I thought. The one guy who checked my ID was really nice. I told him I was meeting some friends but they hadn't arrived yet. He told me to go on in and grab a drink. So far so good, I guess. I opened the door and get bombarded with loud club music, in a dimly lit club-like atmosphere. I'll be honest, I went into fight or flight mode. I turned right back around and proceeded to walk outside, then told the friendly door man I'd wait for my friends to arrive. To my car I went, to contemplate ways to feign illness so I wouldn't have to go back into that awful environment. Then I got the call... We're here, where are you? Actual: I'm in my car hyperventilating. What I said: Cool, I'll be right there.We all checked back in with the helpful door man and were then escorted like some kind of VIPs to this coveted cabana area. The ladies sat down and us guys stood and talked college football... because that's what men do, right? A nice young lady came up and took our drink orders. It was at this time that I realized how old I am because I just called her a "nice young lady". We were fitted with wrist bands that symbolized to the other people in the bar that we were awesome, and only we could enter the cabana area. Only Us! Not You! There were even four tough looking chaps guarding the entrance to the cabanas so no "unauthorized" people could enter. I felt like such an asshole. My friends ordered some food. I didn't eat. It was way too late (another sign I'm old). The food looked okay. They seemed to enjoy it.We had a few drinks, chatted and stayed until about 12:30am. I enjoyed the time with my friends, but this is not a place I would generally choose as a hangout. At least not at night. It may be less... umm what's the word... douchey, during the day. The people bumping, the people grinding, the people making out in the cabana next to ours... this just wasn't my scene. If you're in your twentys and single, you may enjoy the night life at this place. I'm neither of those and hope I never have to come back.This is a generous three stars.I don't get it.  This restaurant has mediocre Mexican food but the prices are reasonable. Every time I've been here the service has been terrible and this includes going for lunch when they weren't very busy. On one occasion my chips and salsa showed up after my entree was served and I'm still waiting on that drink refill.They do have a patio. But, it's right on Tatum Blvd. If your idea of a beach style patio includes thousands of vehicles whizzing by then you have found your place.I guess the draw here is the bar.  I wandered in with some friends one evening and the place was hopping. It was loud, crowded and packed with 20-somethings. For me, it was too loud, too crowded, and I've outgrown that "go out and get wasted" phase.But, if you're into that sort of thing - go for it.I not sure what is worse.  Bad service, or no service at all. However,  taking a look at all the other reviews it seem the vast majority of complaints about this place. All revolve around their bad service, or lack thereof anything resembling service.Today, when I arrived with a group for a business meeting, we found ourselves waiting for a long time for anyone to come over, we eventually had to flag someone over to us.The kicker was, we had to do it many times before the "hostess" (don't say waitress,  it seems they get offended by it) came over.Once there, she lied to us. Saying, that we needed to wait to get seated, and that the place we had decided to seat our ourselves at, is a $200 reserved table. Yeah, I did not buy that. Especially seeing that this place is not exactly a high end restaurant and the table was located outside in the baking Sun.My boss decided what the hell, he will pay the $200 and it should not be a issue, since nobody is using this table anyway. Instead of accepting the money, the awful and very rude waitress... Sorry I mean hostess, made it clear she's not accepting our money and walked away. And there we sat.After, a few minutes we decided we're just gonna leave, seeing that we're not getting any service. However, before we did, my boss and a fellow co worker went to talk with the manager and found out, that they do not reserve those tables and that we are allowed to see ourselves wherever we want.I can only assume she had some kind of personal issue with us. Anyway - The damage was done .DANGGGGGGGGGGGG this place generally has terrible reviews. Why? I came here as a meeting spot to get on a party bus, and was actually surprised at how warm I was being that its generally an outdoor venue. My complaint: the bartenders werent very friendly. And we're very anti talking. Most bars I go to, when there's NO ONE at the bar, I appreciate not being rushed to order, here... They just want to talk amongst themselves as employees, very unprofessional if you ask me. The people that come here are pretty laid back, and a diverse crowd as well. I'd come back, but the drink deals aren't as impressive as other bars and their appetizers are mediocre. At least I can say I've tried it! Probably won't be back though, not unless I'm meeting friends who care for this place.Where do I begin...I guess I will start by saying that Sandbar Desert Ridge has lost a customer and the 12 people that came to celebrate my Birthday. I reserved a table for Super Bowl Sunday which was my Birthday on 02/01/15. My first issue was walking up to the door of Sandbar and the lady saying that there was a $5 cover charge. I tell her that I have a reserved table and wasn't told that I have to have a $300 minimum on top of a $5 PER PERSON cover charge. She says we just decided to charge a cover charge BUT it will be deducted from your tab. I say ok since it will be deducted. (Issue #1)When I called and talked to Justin the "VIP Host" over a week prior to my Birthday he asked me how many people am I expecting...I said probably 8-10 and he said ok. He never mentioned the amount of chairs allotted per table. I get there as planned at 2pm on Sunday and the table is all the way in the corner in the back. Barely no one was at the other reserved tables yet so I ask to move tables. I guess the waitress felt like she needed Justin "The VIP Host" and he comes over and doesn't say hello or nothing just goes into NO YOU CANT MOVE TABLES and I told you over the phone that the tables seat 6. I said No, you didn't and he proceeds to say yes he did. (Issue #2) So, I notice my attitude turning the wrong direction on my birthday so I decide to let it go. Also, had we left he would have still charged me for the $300 minimum on my credit card. I was pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, I let it go and proceed to enjoy my Birthday. The staff was super slow. Justin the "VIP Host" was super rude. Oh yea, so as I am leaving to my car the waitress runs me down talking about I have a tab for $50 and we didn't meet the $300 minimum. Now, between 12 people everyone's tab was well over $55 EACH how did we NOT hit the minimum? Plus, my guests bought my drinks so how did I have a $50 tab? Oh yea, the waitress once again ran and got Justin when she chased me outside and brought him to my car because I told her once again that the lady at the door said that all of the cover charges would b deducted from the tab. Justin told me that I wasn't told that and he is not talking to me anymore and turned his back to me. (Issue #3) My friend just ended up paying for it but I will be calling today to talk to a Manager about all the discrepancies.  I have never been treated so horrible by a restaurant that should be catering to its customers. From the moment we walked in I was in a bad mood by the unprofessionalism of the staff at Sandbar Desert Ridge.
Sal's Tuscan Grill=Here's what I learned from my journey to Sal's:1.  When your husband commits to meeting his cousin for dinner who is in town for business, get an address of where he is staying before looking for restaurants, because when your husband says Glendale, he really means Avondale.2.  Expect that many of the area restaurants close at 8 pm.  Sal's was the welcome exception.3.  Do not, I repeat, do not follow GPS from Scottsdale, unless you like a half dozen unnecessary freeway changes.  Why the hell did I need to get on I-17 or State Rt 143?4.  Skip all the research and just go to Sal's.  Who doesn't like a good wood-fired pizza?5.  Order Sal's Special Pizza...pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Something for everyone.6.  Do not stuff as much pizza in as humanly possible, as they will box up the leftovers.  Skip my advice, and it's a long ride back to Scottsdale.If I lived in the area, Sal's would be a go-to spot for me!
Whiskey Jacks Saloon=Ever since Mad Ave was shut down, Whiskey River has stepped up to take the crown as the trashiest bar in town. Overrated is the only thing that can describe this hotspot of guidos and girls with fake tits. The door is manned every night by a couple of self-obsessed meatheads who think they own the entire sidewalk in front of the building, and the godawful fratboy music blasting out of this place on every weekend night should be considered a threat to the safety and well-being of the general public.The employees at this bar are the most unprofessional people I have ever had experience with at a bar in Madison.  My horrible experience started with a bartender, who literally threw ice at someone who was waiting for their check but not looking.  They threw ice on a patron!  Later that night my purse was stolen.  I had set it down on the stage next to my friend and walked to the bathroom 5 feet away.  Upon returning it was gone.  Shortly later, at bar time, my friend and I were looking for my purse near the back of the bar when the bouncers started screaming in their usual rude-tone to "GET OUT OF HERE".  I politely told them we were looking for my lost/stolen purse and was told that 'we had plenty time to look'.  Ends up he grabbed my friend by her arms and carried her across the bar (a good 50 ft) to the door. She did not incite this attack, and told him she would walk out herself-yet he would not let go. She has DARK bruises on both arms.   Come to find out that was the second purse stolen that night.  I will not be going back to this bar and will tell everyone I know how horrible of an experience it was.My best friend came to visit from Mexico, and wanted to go out. A couple of friends said that a band was going to play at Whiskey River so we decided to head over there. there was a line and we only waited around 15 mins to get in.  The man at the door checked our id's and my friend presented his Mexican Passport to prove age. This bouncer, started going through the passport  pages and I told him the age was in main page of the passport. He said he needed to find the "Visa" to let him in because he wasn't a US Citizen.  This upset me because it is none of his business to look for the visa stamp, I can understand if it is and police officer, TSA, government official, but not this "bouncer" who gets paid to check ages.  Very unprofessional and just plain racist from his part. After finally going in, the music was good and the band was great! until someone vomited in the middle of the dance floor (not the place's fault). it was cleaned right away. Drink prices were reasonable and the place is big. But the bouncer ruined our experience and I will not be back to Whiskey River. Incident happened 01/16/2011 around 11pm.Creeps on creeps on creeps.Whiskey Jacks (or Whiskey River if you refuse to acknowledge the change like myself) is a great bar in concept.  It's big open space that can literally accommodate hundreds of people, and yet there is usually still a line if you get here past 11:30. They have two bars along the right and left walls so your line to the tapper shouldn't be very long. If you are into games at the bar they have quite a few billiard tables, darts and even some basketball hoops games. They do have a dress code (essentially you can't be wearing workout attire) which helps limit the creeps in the summer - they usually travel in hordes and one of them has to mess up, but in the winter everyone's so bundled up that anything goes.The dance area is the best (if not the only real dance floor) on campus, and they have live music or a DJ every weekend. If you're here during live music you are bound to have a ton of fun, apparently a pop country sing along is not the scene for a creep. You're in the clear until after the last set when the DJ takes over, then ladies you gotta watch your back (no really, that's where they come from, try to make it as inaccessible as possible). There are lots of cute guys here, make sure you pick one to dance with, don't get prayed on. If you do, you're going to turn around to a mustached Adidas tank top that smells intensely of Indian food or body odor, you won't be able to tell which. You can have a great time at Whiskey Jacks, just make sure you go in with a big group, your big strong boyfriend or incredibly low standards.Oh how I wished I would've read reviews before the girls and I picked this place. Idk maybe I looked like I wanted to be grinded on (at least buy me a drink). After 45 mins we left, too many creepy guys and the music kinda sucked *maybe I'm just getting old lol
Ernie's Restaurant & Bar=I love this dive bar.  Here's why:+ They have outdoor pool tables!  Yes, on the patio, you can play pool....awesome!  They also have a pool tournament on Thu nights.+ They have a Karaoke night....no, I don't like to sing, but I love to people watch, and there's nothing better than Karaoke for people watching, ha!+ They have Firestone IPA on tap.+ Plenty of parking in the shopping center it's located in.+ It has that old bar feel to it....it just feels right!Can't wait to go back and shoot some pool!Return Factor - 100%
Shakespeare's Grille & Pub=Check in on yelp and you get 50% your second entree you order!This place is a casual pub/ bar located right next to sushi wa on Coronado and Eastern. I cannot really rate the beers since I was here for lunch and it was too early to drink. I ordered the fish n chips  which consisted of two large pieces of battered fish and coleslaw and potato wedges. I was very impressed how the fish was battered and fried to perfection. The fish itself was crunchy and not soggy. The potato wedges and coleslaw was delicious as well. The service was great, she was very pleasant and had a great personality. She did not forget about me even though i was sitting outside enjoying the beautiful weather. Overall I had a great experience with this place, I definitely  will go back to dine in the evening and to try out the beers. This looks like a great place to relax and chill with friends.Heads up: HH is only Mon-Fri, even though their website advertises it as daily. Staff is aware of this, yet no one has bothered to update the site in (their estimate) 2 years?!The Yelp Book Club timed our visit for HH, so being rudely informed that it didn't exist wasn't the best start to our visit. Our server came by twice in 45 minutes and drinks took 20 minutes to come out. We had to go to the bar to place an order- and we were the only table. With such aggressively unhelpful service, the food did not make up for our experience.POUTINE: This spot goes the extra mile to bread and fry the cheese curds. So the dish is basically cheese fries with cheese sticks, with some underwhelming Guiness gravy. Fries were unseasoned, gravy was lackluster, dish went unfinished split among three people.SOUP OF THE DAY: $5 for their daily bowl, which was chicken curry. It was mostly rice and had no spice, as though this were Campbell's interpretation of a curry. Not thrilled.SCOTCH EGG: Sausage was eerily reminiscent of a breakfast sausage, but the mustard aioli on the plate kicked things up a level. This is sided with a heap of spring greens they call a salad, but nothing else. Odd.STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Spiced and sauced bundt cake, with a bit of whipped cream. This version does not come close to comparing to any others in town. Go elsewhere for your fix. Another unfinished dish for us.Dismal food and shitty service make for a large empty bar in the middle of the weekend, despite large screens showing multiple sports games. I wouldn't recommend this spot and I won't be back. Crown & Anchor has friendly service, a similar menu, and better quality.A fun night at Shakespeare's this past Thursday w/ other Yelpers who all came to attend a UYE - Unoffical Yelp Event, to play Cards Against Humanity.More than a dozen of us exchanged funny answers with card questions, ate plenty of British bar food and indulged in several drinks over a 4+ hour evening.*This bar/restaurant is big inside and able to accommodate large groups w/ ease. **Smokers welcome outside on large parking lot patio to commit suicide as they choose. ***Loud background rock music, several large screen TVs showing the Thursday Night Football game, pool table and dartboards also added fun to our Unofficial Yelp Event.I tried a couple of food specials offered during the football game including 16 chicken wings w/ Honey Sriracha and Buffalo sauces. I liked the Honey Sriracha better than the Buffalo sauce. Wings were very average in size and taste. Discounted game special price of $15 was kinda high. Underneath the wings was a bed of skinny fries drowned in buffalo sauce from above wings. Came w/ blue cheese & ranch dressings, and a side of celery & carrots.Also tried a bucket of 6 fish n chips w/ seasoned wedge fries. Pretty good tasting battered cod which was a bit larger than average in size, moist and cooked to golden perfection. Served w/ a very good tarter sauce. Wedge fries were better than the skinny fries that came out w/ the wings. This football food special was a fair price @ $15. A bottle of English HP malt sauce on the table was a nice touch. Drinks were reasonably priced. I liked how my Guinness beers were served in a Guinness glass.*Long bar w/ video poker machines, excellent draft beer & liquor selection served from a friendly designated bartender. **Cooks in the kitchen are obviously talented to make the battered cod to perfection and heard compliments from others they enjoyed the poutine, nachos and other food dishes ordered. ***One friendly guy multi-tasking the floor as a server/busboy/etc who showed effort. An extra server would've been very helpful to everybody's night, but overall was a good time.A couple of early evening group photos have been posted by others. (see photos section)2015 Review #303
Tuscan Oven=If you want to over-pay for a mediocre meal and spend most of your visit wishing you were somewhere else, I highly suggest Tuscan Oven.We should have known right from the start that we were in for a less than stellar experience  - Tuscan Oven was the only spot in Westgate that did not have a 45 minute wait.  Since we had fantastic tickets for the Coyotes/Sharks game and didn't want to miss any of the action (our seats were great!), we went with the restaurant option that could seat us immediately.  Ooops...We ordered a half carafe of the house Pinot Noir - while it arrived quickly, it came complete with two straight out of the dishwasher hot glasses that tasted like soap and really did not do much to enhance the flavor of the wine.  Yum...Our waitress apologetically replaced the soapy wine (she is the only reason to add a star to this review - she was trying her best).  We then ordered baked ziti and a wedge salad to share - and proceeded to wait an incredibly long time for two seemingly simple dishes.  While the ziti was OK (how can you mess up pasta with cheese & sauce?) the wedge salad had the skimpiest portion of bland disappointing blue cheese dressing I have seen.  Now I know iceberg lettuce is not exactly flavorful, but due both to the wimpy dressing (flavorless even after adding more) and practically nonexistent garnish (bacon, blue cheese crumbles) this salad was like eating crunchy water.Blech.
Flowrider Truck=Flow Rider is the New Truck in Town, they have a pretty solid menu offering burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches.The first thing you will notice about Flowrider is their Portions, let's just say they're BIG, and every order includes fries and a drink.The menu is pretty expansive, I had D Porker, which can best be summed up as a deli that exploded and ended up on a bun, D Porker includes: Fried pork, beef, bacon, ham, sliced hot dog, beans, egg, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, served on a grill french bread.It was a huge sandwich (camera on my phone doesn't work so I was unable to snap a photo), but trust me it was impressive!The fries were rather forgettable, but it's nice that they were included along with a drink, other trucks are a la carte and the price can add up quickly.My friend had the 12" Loco Dog which includes: A 12" beef dog wrapped with bacon, grill onions, jalapeno relish, special sauce, and guacamole on grill bunHe said it was really good, a little messy, but good.I liked Flowrider, they still have a few kinks to work out, but given time they could become a contender for the vegas food truck crown.Ok...here's my few complaints so they can work on improving and getting 4 or 5 stars on my next visit.1- The fries are weak, they were under seasoned, a little soggy, and were rather blah. I may have just gotten a bad batch, but they were pretty forgettable.2- The Toppings, there is a point when you reach overkill, when a sandwich has more than 10 items on it you might be going a little overboard, all of the ingredients in my Porker were great, but they got lost when they were mixed all together, I actually dissected my second half and ate it piece by piece, all of the meats were amazing, but it may be a little overkill.3- Location I know finding places is hard when you start you, and the place you were at had a ton of traffic (rainbow and russel), parking was ok (hospital lot across the street), but there were no tables, benches, grassy areas, or anywhere to sit, I don't mind eating in my car, but if a group of people want to eat it can be a little hard.4- Your Hours, I know you're new and you are still getting things worked out, but being open 3 hours a day 11a-2p is not enough time for people to get a chance to try your grub. I really think with your portions and prices, you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck, you could corner the post bar greasy food market if you found the right location and got the word out!!!I will give flowrider truck a few more tries, and hopefully they earn a few more stars, the more quality trucks this town gets, the better!!!
Round Table Pizza=Well, there are only so many places to eat in Terminal 2, the oldest and smallest terminal at SKy Harbor Airport. There are more since they remodelled it a few years ago at least.When the young freckled red head that is "always fresh" and "always juicy" seems to be a little tired an old to you, you can opt for the Knights of the Round Table to fill your hunger. ROund Table pizza, that is.1 combo #3         $5.751 slice cheese    $3.35Total                      $9.95I don't remember what the combo thing was. Soda and what?
Steak 'n Shake=Yelpers on Talkback know that I've been waiting for this day.A tear nearly rolled down my cheek upon the news several months ago when I discovered that Vegas was getting a Steak 'n Shake.  I had fond memories of the place when I first discovered in in Florida several years ago, and the burning jealousy that later formed once I moved from my home state of Texas only to find that, surprise!  They put one in right after I left.  I tell you, isn't that always the way?Personal story aside, I waited and waited until lo, this day has come, and the Steak 'n Shake has landed in Vegas.I went to the South Point Casino to get my "Tron Legacy" tickets when I saw the line.  It was well around the corner.  I just wanted food.  I didn't need to sit at the restaurant.  So I asked if I could do take out.  They promptly sent me to the front of the line as I wasn't needing to wait for a table.  The manager was there and he greeted me warmly.  I guess he knew in his heart of hearts that this was a special day for us all.I ordered two of the double steak burgers and some "Buffalo" style sliders.  The prices were reasonable, all things considered, and the wait wasn't that long.  When I got my bag, the server girl was all friendly and smiles.So away I spirited my treasures like how Rumplestiltskin covets....  Well, whatever it is that Rumplestiltskin covets, I was like that, but holding onto my prize even tighter.  As I was leaving, some woman pointed to my bag and said "Look!  He has Steak 'n Shake!"  This helped to further my feeling that I was the coolest kid in the casino.Away I dashed home, eager to eat my steaky, shakey goodness, nibbling their fries all the way home.  I can be a "fry snob", but these are tasty.Then came eating time.  It was like an angel descended from upon high and said onto me: "You've been a reasonable sort of late.  Here's a hamburger for being so well behaved.  A hamburger... MADE OF STEAK.  Because you are awesome!!!"  And so, I ate my angel laden steakburger, and was thusly full.Is it truly that amazing?  Honestly, I'd give it a four star experience, but the service was so helpful and friendly, I'm giving this place a five star experience.  My enthusiasm for being there "Day 1", coupled with the wait made it a fun and tasty experience.Tomorrow I go see "Tron".  I'm also going back to Steak 'n Shake before the movie starts.Could the day get any better?What the HECK SnS??? You totally let me down today! Being the "Yelper" amongst my friends I convinced a group to wait in line for an hour to be one of the first to try this hot new place....and you made me look so bad.Downers:1) They forgot our shakes and brought them after our meal was served and almost finished2) They forgot our order and we had to hunt someone down to get it put in.3) Everything was wrong on everyones order except one burger. YIKES! No cheese, no bacon, forgot to take the onions off... disaster! When we asked for the cheese the waitress put a cold slice of cheese on the burger and brought it back. WTHeck.4) When the manager came to the table he was not at all concerned about all that went wrong with our experience and did not want to take care of us at all. Finally he suggested giving us our shakes for free (the ones they forgot to order and brought after our meal) Really??? 5) The meat in the burgers were really small, nothing at all like the photos. It similar to the size of the kids meal McDonalds burger. Disappointed for sure!6) There is no bathroom in the restaurant and you have to go out to the casino to go..if you have too go :)Some Pluses:1) The shakes were awesome - once we got them :)2) The taste of the meat in the burger was really good....just really small....3) The hostess at the front had the best guest service. She was the one who noticed that no one had brought our food or shakes out and rushed around to make it right. She was awesome and should be manager!4) Price - the price was decent. They even had $4 menu that gave you a burger and fries for $3.99. Thats a pretty great deal!5) I love the South Pointe and think it is a great idea to have it inside the hotel.Overall - this place has nothing on In-n-Out. Not worth a hour in line wait at all. I might give this place a second go in a month or so and see if anything has changed. I totally understand that bumps have to be worked out in the beginning but as of now......not impressed. Steak - n - Shake.....I'm still not over what you did to my good name today...not yet anyways.Jumping on the current bandwagon and braving the crowds...the Husband loves steak, and I love shakes...so we headed to the grand opening week of Steak 'n Shake at South Point Hotel and Casino in Vegas.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, "Do you know when they are going to open?"On Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!  The Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt "Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough."  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.  Meanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.Of course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact! I also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.And yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)Overall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.They are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).  Happy hour: Weekdays only, 2 pm to 4 pm, and 2 am to 4 am - Half off shakes and drinksMy love letter to Steak n' Shake:Ever since the first day I saw your picture online I have thought about you...longed for you. Love at first sight? Perhaps. I am a hopeless glutton, and the fastest way to my heart is through my stomach. The more I read your menu and explored your website the more I was drawn to you.  I dreamed about you. I imagined what our first meeting would be like. I knew what I would order and knew exactly how it would taste. I wanted to meet you in person but the closest SnS was in Texas...just like Romeo and Juliet, the universe was keeping us apart. Yeah, sure, I explored other options...In n' Out, Five Guys...but while I was with them, I was thinking about you.You can only imagine my excitement when I heard that you were coming to Las Vegas, my home away from home. My heart soared. I didn't want to appear too desperate so I gave you a week to get settled in to your new home. When I arrived I knew exactly how it would be...how you would look...what I would order. You made me wait 30 minutes, but what was 30 minutes more of  a wait to meet my soulmate. And it was indeed worth the wait. It was a love connection! We spent two amazing nights together...nights I will remember forever. And although I had to leave you, I will return to you...soon, and often.OK, now that I have totally creeped you out here is what we ordered. We actually went twice in 2 days...yeah, it WAS that good:Wisconsin Buttery Burger-two delicious crusty perfectly cooked steakburger patties, one slice of gooey melty cheese, all covered in butter. Yeah, this was pretty much heaven.Guacamole Steakburger-the same two delicious patties, jalapeno jack cheese, and yummy guacamole. So good!Triple Steakburger with cheese-more of the same goodness...3 patties and two slices cheese.The burgers come with amazing shoestring fries. They are thin and crispy and the seasoning salt is awesome!A side of chili- A bowl of luscious chili flavored reddish-brown liquid filled with perfectly cooked kidney beans and ground steakburger meat. More like chili beans than standard chili, but you can pay a $1 for extra beef. It was really delicious.Hershey's Special Dark Shake- Creamy, fluffy, frozen, chocolate heaven. The shake was gigantic and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips.Peppermint Chocolate Chip Shake-This was one of the special holiday shakes they had on the menu (Along with white chocolate and egg nog.) It was a minty, chocolately Christmas celebration in my mouth! We had great food and great service both times we went. It is in the casino in the South Point Hotel, and there was a 30 minute wait each time. I am just so sad there isn't a SnS near Los Angeles.My Fiance who isn't much of a foodie actually wanted to try this place. I guess she saw a grand opening sign a little while back that caught her eye. Well, thats wonderful because I'm glad I ain't always the one trying to dine somewhere new! This place is located in my favorite Vegas Casino, South Point! I just really like the ambiance in this place and I won my first and only (so far!) Royal Flush here!! Enough of the small talk,  we got here starving and had to go in the "To Go" line since it was about 5 times shorter than the "For Here" line!!! Yes, the line was sooo looooooonnnnnggg, that at first I thought they were giving away free burgers or something??!!After about 10 minutes in line and then another 15 minutes to pick-up, this is what we literally inhaled:My order:Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger and Fries: I love butter, probably as much as Paula Dean does.. Maybe?! Wisconsin butter, never had that before.. I'll take one of those! Wow! I've never tasted anything like it before. First off their meat was unique to my taste buds but without a doubt one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had - in a small package! The butter, sloth of onions and their meat just.. just made me happy!Western BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger and Fries: I always love this type of burger. Now, their take on this one was humbly satisfying. I mean its their meat that sets them apart, its thin and cooked well yet not dry at all. Edges are purposely crisped on some sides and it just adds another positive attribute to the burger.. the slightly crunchy onion rings, a bit sweet/tangy bbq sauce and cheese all together made me an instant fan off one bite! Fries (Skinny and Crunchy): I did have 2 orders of fries and I did demolish both of them with ease, along with the burgers! The fries may had been skinny and crunchy but they were perfectly cooked where there was still some evident soft potato meat in each fry. My Fiance's order:Spicy Chipotle Steakburger and Fries: I saw here unwrap it and literally within a minute and half at most, the thing vanished!! I knew she was hungry but dayum! She ate that thing like I was gonna snag it from her! She did say "That was the Best Burger I've ever had. My Grandma used to make me something that tasted just like this Meat when I was young. It brought me back to that time. I want another one!"CONS:- Ridiculously Long Line and Wait- Burgers were sized for light eatersPROS:- The Burgers tasted Unexpectedly Outstanding- Prices were Inexpensive - Atmosphere made me wanna ' Eat Steak 'N Shake, RATTLE and ROLL!!'I was eager to sample the offerings of South Point's newest culinary addition, Steak 'n Shake, but until very recently was deterred by reports of huge lines just to get inside the restaurant.  On this night we were lucky, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were admitted to the inner sanctum.  The place was bright and lively, and packed with happy people.  Servers were scrambling quickly about delivering steakburgers and tantalizing-looking milk shakes to the eager awaiting diners seated at white-topped tables and booths.  Huge photographs of food preparers clad in white 50s-style uniforms with cocked military-style caps adorned the back wall, looking not much different from their present-day counterparts.Diane and I were both quite hungry after a long drive from California; we hadn't eaten for several hours; and of course I had to order mightily to round out a good review of various kinds of fast food fare.  So, we showed little restraint.I noted that canned chili was sold on premises.  And, I logically reasoned that any restaurant that cans and sells its chili out the door must make a memorable species of the hot stuff.  And, I am a sucker for good homemade chili--with beans or not.  So, I opened with a side of Genuine Chili with onions but no cheese.  As luck would have it, this chili came with beans, which is the way I prefer.  It was quite good, with a lot of liquid goodness, and a noticeable but not extreme backbite to tickle the throat on the way down.  As a testament to the quality of this chili, I ate all that was set before me, and took a can home that I enjoyed as part of my lunch the very next day.Next up was a Chicago-style Frank & Fries.  The dog contained a slightly split all-beef wiener, classic emerald green relish, chopped white onions, two sport peppers, and a slice of ripe tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  After downing one complete sport pepper, it seemed like my stomach had turned into a hearth with a log fully ablaze inside it.  So, I elected to bypass the second pepper.  The hot dog was very, very good.  But I would have preferred an untoasted soft bun, and some juiciness had probably escaped where the meat had been sliced.  But the dog was still juicy.  Fries were shoestring style, slightly crispy, and tasty enough.  And, although I couldn't get my Original Double Steakburger with Cheese & Fries (I told you I lacked restraint in ordering on this night!) made even close to medium-rare, it was still fairly juicy and tasty with two hamburger patties, crunchy circling strands of white onion, a tomato slice, a couple of pickles, a slice of orange cheese, fresh lettuce, and tomato ketchup added.But the real highlights of this particular meal hands down were the two majestic milk shakes.  We each had a hand-dipped "specialty shake"--which means the most expensive variety served.  Diane selected Double Chocolate Fudge, which was really chocolatey and naturally enhanced by hot fudge; and I chose Butter Pecan.  As luscious as that shake was, it had a surprise in store for me that made it probably the best milk shake I have ever had the pleasure of savoring.  For, it was dotted with small bits of pecan.  But these tiny pecan pieces were unlike any I had tasted before.  They were more like pecan seeds that when bit into simply burst with the flavor of pecan.  When at last I got through the cherries, whipped cream, and tall milk shake itself, about 100 of these morsels lay at the bottom of my milk shake glass.  And, I just scooped them up repeatedly with the long spoon provided, and crunched them on the roof of my mouth in spoonfuls, letting the bursts of intense pecan flavor lazily wash down my throat, until at last all were gone.  A heavenly end to a fine fast food meal!This location always has a ridiculously long line out the door.  You'd think they were going into a niteclub.  We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.  SOOOOOOO..welcome to "plan E".  We opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  "Save it for the burger" I told myself. Finally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.    What the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets.If you order the royale, you cannot request an over easy egg. Fried only and over done.So I have this love, hate affair with all things diner. I love the nostalgia and the feel. I typically hate the food.The burgers here were just okay for me. It was hard for me to love and/or enjoy because I so bad wanted the Royale burger with my egg yolk all nice and runny but they couldn't and wouldn't make it like that. Something about health regulations. Must be all the old people and kids that eat there or something. Please explain why some places can do this and others cannot. However the patty was pretty moist and juicy and the toppings fresh and good.The fries were good, as long as they were hot. Once they got cold, forget about it. It was just not good.I also ordered a milkshake and I have to say one of the worse ever. I don't know what I was expecting because everyone was saying that their milkshakes were bomb. But they truly were the nastiest part of my lunch.I took it to go to be polite and threw it in the trash when no one was looking. It was like it was made from old ice cream that had melted and was refrozen, three or four times over. YUCK!I would only visit again if you twisted my arm and were a guest visiting and really, really had to go.I will say that this place is super cheap and super budget friendly.A good choice for quick cheap eats at South Point. We were in Vegas a couple months ago & stayed at South Point.  Once we got to the hotel,  we had lunch at Steak & Shake. I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger which was very yummy.  The flavors were really rich.  The burger itself is a medium sized burger.  For the average eater, it is definately filling with fries & shake. The cookie dough shake was yummy with lots of chunks of cookie dough.My favorite thing about this restaurant is the decor.   It felt like we stepped back in time to the 50s.Tip: they have a to go window on the side of the restaurant. Recommended for yummy burgers & shakes.Ever have one of those moments where the experience doesn't exactly live up to the hype? Unfortunately, that was Steak 'n Shake. Which is so sad, since I've enjoyed many a late night meal at Steak 'n Shake across IL and MO. And since Las Vegas is as far west as this diner chain reaches, was VERY excited to have a taste over the holidays. Maybe it's because we actually dined in (vs. pickup or drive-thru)? Or maybe it's because this Steak 'n Shake is inside a casino? Or maybe it's because it was bright as hell inside? Something just didn't feel right. (I was about to blame it on the clientele, but let's face it: Steak 'n Shake tends to attract the same type of customer no matter what part of the U.S. they're located. Overweight, loud, eating with their mouth open kind of people. Hey, it's cool, I'm from the Midwest!)Was the double steakburger as good as I remembered? Pretty much. I will say that it tastes WAY better from the comfort of your own home. After a night of bar hopping, of course. I did appreciate the two sides of melted cheese for dipping fries. I only asked for one and was given a second... Yay to gluttony squared!This particular location was extremely clean and well-lit, no complaints here. It just didn't feel like a slice of the real deal. But hey, that's why it's in Vegas! Next time, I'm getting it to-go.I can count with one hand the times I've been to a Steak n Shake. Everything is just super salty, greasy and blah. I'd wake up the next day with a huge zit on my face from all the nasty grease.I've tried a burger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries and Parmesan herb fries = salty, greasy and blah. Not worth the calories even for a cheat meal. The only saving grace is their milkshake. But how hard is it to make a good milkshake? Flush away all the bad food from my system! $15 for a bad burger/sandwich, bad fries and a milkshake? You might want to go somewhere else for better quality burger and fries for less or pay extra for better quality burger and fries.
Robertos Taco Shop=Stopped into Robertos for the first time the other week after a binge study session at the Starbucks next door. I have heard mixed reviews about the franchise and decided to just find out for myself. I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I just got an order of carne asada fries to go and ate them outside and enjoyed the weather while people watching. The carne asade was a little too salty for my tastes and the fixings with the fries were alright. I think the saltiness of the meat threw it off for me. Way too salty. The portions were great though. It was huge and I had enough for a whole other meal the next day. Granted it wasn't as good the next day since the fries were a tad soggy but hey a meal is a meal sometimes. Honestly, I'm not sure if I would come back to any of the chain locations. Maybe out of convenience if I'm ever near one and I'm craving some Mexican food. There is also an ample amount of parking at this location so that's always nice too!
Le Ragazze=tucked away in the illustrious ahwatukee foothills lies an exquisite new addition to the phoenix restaurant scene. it's exactly what was lacking in this neck of the woods. or neck of the desert, if you will. it's a place to come for cocktails after work, a place to enjoy a delicious italian dinner and a place where you can dance the night away to live music. the kind of place you go and spend about 3-4 hours at a time, just savoring your night. they just opened a few weeks ago, so we had no idea what to expect..... but when we walked in, for the first time since i left san francisco, i felt like i was home again. it has a sexy, loungey, elegant but urban feel. the kind of restaurant you would find in a sophisticated world class city, not the remote desert foothills of arizona.there's a small, intimate patio area set up outside (think couches and candles) but with the temperature in the 100's we opted to sit inside close to the sprawling bar area. the live music hadn't started yet, but we wanted to be near it when it did.for starters, we shared the au gratin potato dish with pre-dinner cocktails. it was so cheesy and good. for dinner, my dining companion ordered the lobster ravioli and i actually ordered something not on the menu at all. i described what i was craving (a linguine in a light cream sauce topped with chunks of grilled salmon) and they made it exactly how i described. i took half of it home, but then kept thinking about how good it was and ended up finishing it later that night anyway. haha during dinner, the proprietor of the restaurant stopped by our table to say hello and we ended up chatting for awhile. she's just lovely. apparently her and her husband opened the restaurant and named it after their 4 daughters. hence, the name "le ragazze" which means "the daughters" in italian. she also told us she was from NY, which explained so much about why i liked the overall vibe there. service was top notch, just enough attention without feeling like she was hovering.after dinner, we stuck around for a few hours with our cocktails to hear the live music which had started. at one point a few giggly girls (who seemed to have consumed a LOT of wine with dinner) got up and started dancing around. it's a happy, festive kind of place though, so people just looked on amused. we didn't stay too late into the night, but i can see things getting really fun in there towards the wee hours.i may not have lived in arizona for long, but i have been exploring the restaurant scene here quite consistently.... and this was the first time i got excited about a place. i couldn't wait to go back. in fact, we're going again tonight.ok so, it might be a little out of your way (ahwatukee isn't exactly centrally located) but i assure you it's worth the drive. i promise.
Sunshine and Spice=I have been out to try each food truck vendor that shows up at the Downtown Phoenix Market whether it be for the Wednesday evening market, the Friday Food Court or the Saturday market, they are pretty consistantly the same vendors.  However some show up more than others.  Well and I am not all that consistant as well so we keep missing each other.  Today I took a walk to the Friday Mobile Food Court.  And since I have tried almost everyone else there it was their turn.  I ordered the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos and their crab rangoon.  Yes this was my lunch.  I got some veggies, dairy, protein in... The jalapenos were roasted sliced in half and each half was filled with a cilantro lime cream cheese and wrapped with a piece of bacon.  The crab rangoon tasted like the same cream cheese filling with crab in a wonton. Both were very tasty and the rangoon came with a home made citrus sweet and sour sauce  that was really good. I like the touch of the girl taking your order and then placing it with the chef in the truck.  I would have liked to try their chicken curry burrito but it was sold out so obviously everyone else wanted to try it too.
McDonald's=This is THE McDonald's that everyone wishes were in their neighborhood.  Probably the newest one in Las Vegas, it definitely sets the bar of what you hope all McDonald's could be like!Located on S. Rainbow with its major cross streets being Warm Springs and the 215, it has generated quite a buzz!With a flowing fountain to welcome you, the inside feels more like a coffee lounge.  Cool color tones welcomes you to take advantage of their free WiFi and the large TV has you hanging out longer than you normally would.  Instead of the typical outdoor play area for kids with those plastic balls (an area rarely ever cleaned), this location has an indoor area that looks like it could be cleaned and inspected on a regular basis.  There's also a few larger tables set aside for what could be private parties - birthday parties at Mickey D's are coming back perhaps?Nonetheless, this fast food joint and design are a welcome addition to the neighborhood, even if there's another McDonald's less than a mile away in the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.
Halcyon Flavors From The Earth=Another Charlotte Restaurant Week experience!Again, it is my personal belief a participating restaurant should put their best foot (or dishes, for that matter) forward during restaurant week. It's two weeks out of the year, folks. Do it up and do it right.That being said, I was absolutely jacked to try The Mint Museum's newest addition - Halcyon! Their fresh (no freezer on site) farm to table concept is just as lovely as their decor. Gorgeous twig chandeliers, lots of deep, rich browns, ocean blue wall, interesting silverware and more. Plus, that patio is going to be stunning during the warmer months. Service was friendly and efficient and we were in and out within an hour. I can, however, imagine staying a while once CRW is over. The food, however, is where Halcyon fell a bit short of wondrous, both in flavor and in portion sizes. I see on their Yelp biz categories they listed small plates and new American, perhaps I should have paid more attention to the small plate mention. Listen, I don't expect grandiose portions, but I left Halcyon hungry. That's sayin' a lot. Here's what I had:Amuse Bouche - Hummus w/pita points: 3/5: This was actually a generous helping of hummus, especially for an amuse bouche. Our server brought us extra pita points because the heaping pile of hummus only came with three. Ha. I love carbs, I'd like some extra pita. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the hummus,Farm Salad: 4/5: Local butter lettuce with a few sunflower seeds, tasty tomatoes and a delicious mustard vinaigrette. Great texture and full of color. I really, really enjoyed the dressing. Short Rib: 3.5/5: Let me put this out there right away - I love the flavors on the plate. Loved the tender short rib, the tasty glaze, the potato puree and the root veggies. My problem with this dish? There wasn't much of it. At all. Three very small slices of short rib, two bites of potato and the equivalent of two baby carrots diced. Normally I offer hubs a few bites of my dish, but I didn't have any to share. Color me disappointed, but they said this was supposed to be a main course*? Maybe I got the runt of the short rib  - it was very short. *In the same vein, hubs ordered the chicken and I chuckled when they set it down. The chicken was the size of a kiwi with a protruding bone. Creme Brulee: 2/5: Very cold inside and the texture was pretty off. Not smooth, creamy and delicious as I had hoped. Plus, the flavor was lacking. So, maybe I should have paid more attention to the small plate classification? I'll take a bit of the blame, but that could have been advertised a bit better on their CRW menu and website, for that matter. I know I'll come back to Halcyon as I really adore the concept, but I'll be sure to have a snack before I arrive."Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese." -- Benny & Joon (1993)Wow this place is gorgeous. I mean, it seems a shame to actually eat in this place. I feel like I should be dressed up and drinking champagne and looking at the decor. But truly, it isn't like that at all - talk about first impressions being off.Another business trip dinner and this place was highly touted on Yelp (thanks, guys!). So my co-workers and I made our way over after making a reservation. Uptown was not close to where we were working, so we made a later reservation. Luckily, they took us early. We ordered cocktails immediately and started sipping and deciding on the menu. I got the Sow Not - a rye cocktail that was not at all sweet - yay! We did our usual ordering of the cheese board - 3 cheeses, one was local. The server rattled them off so quickly that I have no idea what they were. One was a blue goat - I was not a fan at all. I think that was left on the board as my friend Mike hated it too. The others were devoured.As for dinner - here is what we ordered:Bleu cheese souffl√© - Mushroom Veloute. Roasted Shallot. CognacDuck breast - Foie Gras Boudin Blanc. Sweet Potato. Spiced Turnips. BrusselsPiedmontese Ribeye - Spring Onion. Garlic Scapes. French Horn MushroomsSwordfish - Shrimp. Razor Clams. White Mirepoix. Potato Saffron Rouille. PersilladeCharlie ordered the souffle as he was not having any of the cheese plate - he was a big fan. I had a taste and enjoyed it immensely.  The veloute was rich and creamy without being too heavy while the souffle was the right hint of cheese without being over powering.  Our entrees were both hit and miss. The duck duo was Charlie's - he loved the breast, but the boudin - which was like a sausage - had an odd texture and he really disliked it. The rest of the plate was good for him, but he could not get past the foie at all. So over all it was 2.5 stars. The Swordfish was Mike's - he enjoyed it but it was heavier than he was expecting. He rated his higher than Charlie did his. The razor clam was a hit, as was the swordfish. The sides were just okay. 3.5 stars.  As for the ribeye - they did a song and dance about this beef and honestly, it tasted like every other cut of beef I have had. Nothing special - not greass-fed or anything. Seriously, the server did go on about it being local and special. I could not tell. It was delicious, and cooked properly. I enjoyed the scapes and mushrooms - but it was not worth the upcharge for fancy beef. 3.5 stars.Since we were all disappointed in our entrees - we ordered desserts:Brown butter cake with roasted pineappleLayered chocolate cake with hazelnutsFrench toast & gelatoObviously I could not taste the chocolate cake, but both the brown butter cake and french toast were good - again, nothing to write home about. I would have liked the cake to be more moist. Mike loved his chocolate cake.Overall service was good, at times a little slow, but not too annoyingly so. We were in no hurry. Oddly, a table came in not once, but twice, sat and looked over the menu and then left. This is a place where posting the menu outside the front door might help. It is odd to be a patron and watch that happen a couple of times. Trust me - this menu is not for everyone.
Alibaba=Was essen Syrer respektive was erwartet mich in einem syrischen Restaurant? Mit diesen Fragen betraten wir das Alibaba und bevor wir auch nur einen Bissen gekostet zu haben, weiss ich nun, dass das syrische Essen hier beliebt ist. Doppelt gebucht sind am Wochenende die Tische, so dass wer ohne Reservierung aufschl√§gt, erstmal keine Chance hat. Dass wir doch noch zu zwei Tellern fanden lag an unserer Hartn√§ckigkeit, daran dass die M√§dels m√∂glich machten, was irgend m√∂glich war und sicherlich auch darin begr√ºndet, das wir bereits um 19 Uhr aufschlugen.So fanden wir nicht nut einen Platz, um uns rum war es sogar ziemlich leer und wir konnten uns in Ruhe   dem Alibabataller (Kufta mit 5 Vorspeisen) sowie der Grillvariation widmen. Dazu kommt Brot und wir hatten noch eine zus√§tzliche Vorspeise - wer bin ich, dass ich Hummus widerst√ºnde!Extraw√ºnsche in Sachen no bread, no milk waren kein Problem, die Speisen, die dann kamen waren interessant gew√ºrzt, leicht s√§uerlich mitunter, nussig und mit gutem √ñl angereichert.
Nacho Daddy Henderson=I'm on the fence about this place still. It could go down to 2 stars or it could go up to 4 stars. I'm currently exercising some forgiveness since it just opened and a few kinks are pretty much inevitable.When I walked in, I was greeted by 4 hostesses. Yep, 4. I'm assuming it was part of some kind of training. And, technically, I was really only greeted by 1 of them. The others just sorta looked on. I was asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or dining area (bar area includes high tops). I replied that the bar area was fine. The hostess then went back to the other 3 hostesses, conferred for a bit, and then led me to a high top in the bar area.The bar and dining areas aren't really divided at all. It's all one big room with no physical division. The dining area is all booths for the most part. The bar area is a long bar with stools and then a cluster of high tops, including some high tops that are part booth.Upon seating me, the hostess explained that the only part of the menu available was - the nachos. The rest of the menu is not available until after January 1st.And so I sat there for awhile. No one even so much as looked at me. Though, I counted at least 12 staff (hostesses, bartenders, and servers) milling around and there were only 4 other customers in the entire restaurant. But ok, I was waiting for someone, so maybe they were waiting until that person arrived. Nonetheless, seemed strange that no one took my drink order, brought water, etc.After the person I waiting for arrived, we continued to wait for about another 10 minutes. At that point, a woman who I assume was a manager came over and asked if we'd been helped yet. She then promised that our server would be right over and she took our drink order (stating that the drinks were on her). She was incredibly sweet and friendly. Things were looking up.The bartender, after being all befuddled at how our drinks could possibly be on the manager, brought us our drinks one by one. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the draft beer selection was rather decent. They have the standards (Bud, Coors, etc.), and they have the slightly better (Blue Moon, etc.), and then also have the way better (Snow Cap, 2 Below, Dogfish Head, etc.).After a few more minutes, our server arrived. She apologized for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. The nacho list is quite extensive and inventive (and you can also build your own). And all of the nachos are available as a half or full order. We settled on two half orders - the Buffalo Hot and Sloppy Daddy. At this point, we were informed that they didn't have the chips the Buffalo Hot is supposed to come with. Ok then, we'll just have it on regular tortilla chips.Our server was very nice and was good with timing, checking on us, etc. However, it definitely seemed like she was very new - new not only to this new restaurant, but new to serving. She was super sweet, but seemed a little flustered. In fact, I think the same could be said of the majority of the staff here. And by staff, I mean young, thin females with a strong preference for blondes. Possibly trying a little too hard for a Hooters feel.It seemed to take a while for our food to arrive, especially considering it is nachos. But it didn't take too long, so all ok. The nachos were pretty good. Good enough to warrant us coming here again. The chicken on the Buffalo Hot was just the right size and perfectly spicy (which in my book, is on the very hot side). The pulled pork on the Sloppy Daddy has a great flavor. And the best part was that they didn't skimp on the cheese. Unlike other plates of nachos, we were not left halfway through eating with a plate of chips and no toppings. The cheese permeated every inch of of the chips. They weren't the best nachos I've ever had. In fact, not even close. But they were different and they were yummy. The prices, though, did seem a little high for what you get. You can get full orders of nachos elsewhere for less than the price of the half orders here.The manager came over two additional times, asking what we had ordered (and making some small talk) and then again after the food had arrived (asking how everything was). Major props.The decor is nice and everything was very pristine. Several large flat screens in the bar area tuned to different sports channels. Even a couple of flat screens in the corners of the dining section. No gaming. No smoking. Music was neither too loud or too soft - primarily all Top 40.Overall, a decent experience and a decent place. I fully intend on patronizing here again, especially to see how it is after the kinks are ironed out. And ok, yeah, I might already be craving the Buffalo Hot nachos a little bit.I have to give Nacho Daddy some credit where credit is due now. There's a new chef in town and you can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients and the food is much more interesting and enjoyable to my palate.We ordered:GUACAMOLE- Fresh and flavorful.3 Kinds of SALSA- A tad watery and not enough bite for my liking. Didn't care for any of them. Side of White QUESO- The only thing that would make this cheese better is if naked Ryan Gosling was feeding this to me with his fingers while whispering sweet words in my ear.ENCHILADA NACHOS- Not a huge fan of the red enchilada sauce they used, but overall still grubbed big time on these. Nice huge chunks of white meat chicken.CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP- My partner in crime loved it.Dessert Nachos/FRIED ICE CREAM- I was lovin' on the chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips! Delicious ice cream, too!Not only was the food a huge improvement from my last visit a year ago, but the service was spot on, too. Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu and offered up her recommendations and also made sure our cups were at least half full at all times. Just a doll. (Only small complaint was when I was walking to my car in my VS yoga pants the cactus bush was strategically sticking out into the sidewalk and scratched me below my belly button with her big ass bush! Ughhhh. Please trim ya big bush!)Now I definitely don't think the food is five stars and is really closer to a three stars, but when you throw in the awesome service, cleanliness and UNLV on the tvs, I'M THERE.  Nacho Daddy does not suck balls anymore. He actually gave up ball sucking to make some nachos! Good stuff!Ok, this is the first review that I have felt the need to update on Yelp. It looks like Nacho Daddy has achieved the impossible... they blended chips and cheese!! Actually since I wrote my initial review (rated them a 1) they have hired a new GM (#4?) who knows what he is doing, they have a new kitchen manager (# who knows) and have cut down the menu to a point where they can actually achieve a high level of execution. I think they have finally reached a level of competency in which a business can begin to win over customers and become successful. For this I will move them up to a 3 of 5... but that is because I still hold my breath when I walk in and order. I keep expecting them to mess up my order, but they seem to have a renewed energy and I think its because they are finally on the right track.Lets be clear. The service was never the issue here. It was always that the Management staff (GM and Kitchen Manager) could never find a consistent formula that worked. Now that the issue seems to be solved the food is reflective and its worth giving them another chance. Its now save to eat the Nachos!! PS. Keep it up and I will have no problem changing the rating to a 4... its that much better these days!Had a 10 for 20 dollar Living Social coupon so me and the fam decided to try it out. I guess I went AFTER the improvements were made all around because I had a very pleasant experience. Half the reviews were not too positive, but until you actually experience it for yourself, then you can reflect it here on Yelp. So my expectations were neutral.As we came in, the hostess greeted us and were sat down right away. About a minute later, Victoria, (who was our server), came by to take our order. As soon as we informed her we were noobs, she politely gave us a little overview of the menu. As we were deciding she got our drink orders and left to get them. When she came back, she gave us a small order of the Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins! I gotta say it was good and just the fact that Victoria gave us some to try was very commendable! I got the Fajita Nachos, my two kids got basic kids items, (chicken fingers, bean n cheese burrito), and my wife got endless chips and salsa. Good thing I only ordered one plate of nachos because what they give you is a lot! All for of us shared it after they ate their meal already and we still couldnt finish it! The chicken fingers were basically cooked like Katsu! For those that don't know what that is, its a chicken breast lightly breaded and deep fried to a golden crisp. For dessert, we had two choices: Deep Fried Ice Cream or a Churro topped with Ice Cream, Chocolate Drizzle, and surrounded by different colored tortilla chips. We chose the Deep Fried Ice Cream! Again, we all had to share it because it was a pretty good sized item.So props goes out to Victoria and the rest of the Nacho Daddy staff. I wouldnt mind bringing new people to this place especially if they are craving nachos.This review is for 4.5 stars.If you love nachos, this is THE place for nachos. I'm not a health fanatic, but a real person who believes in exercise and moderation, so going to this place does not make me feel guilty- I do not have something like this everday. Some people love chocolate (my husband), some people love meat and potatoes (my older brother), and some people love nachos- yes, I AM that person. (Ok, I LOVE ice cream, too.) Ok, enough disclaimer, on to my review. At the top of the menu, it reads "Home of the Gourmet Nachos." And I totally agree!There were some interesting combinations (I'd like to try the thai nachos sometime), but the one we really wanted to try was the Enchilada Nachos- pulled chicken- very tender and seasoned perfectly, very cheesy, and well-topped with pickled jalapenos (I love medium-spicy). I'm a bit of nachos enthusiast, so I like when toppings are evenly distributed, just saying. I don't like when there are chunks of something, like sour cream or guacamole, in one spot only. Oops, I almost forgot to mention the mini jalapeno corn muffins- so warm, fresh and delicious!!! Now, that's a starter. And we did have the fried ice cream for dessert- talk about huge. I thought the nachos were over-the-top, but in a good way. Some of the chips were chocolate, and everything was topped with raspberry sauce, which I normally don't really like, but it sure worked here. Well, I had to stop because I was too full, and couldn't eat another bite. I don't think my husband wants to go anywhere else for nachos.  So, we went here again, this time for lunch; the crowd is smaller, compared to dinner. We chose the pulled pork nachos- complete with a white cheese sauce, bbq sauce, and topped with fried onion strings. This is a combination that you wouldn't really picture with nachos. But the savory combination did work very well, indeed. I did think that the topper (fried onion strings) was very generous. Anyway, what I am trying to say, is that there are ten types of nachos here and it sure is fun trying new things. There is the appetizer version and the entree version for a couple dollars more (we always choose the entree version because we share it). I think the next time we will try the "nacho average burger" nachos.  The decor is pretty casual. The servers are nice too. Clean place. Seats are booths as well as chairs & tables. The baby gets his own sling. All games are on the tvs (it's a sport bar), as well as videos for the music lovers. The womens bathroom (located up front) is unique, there are three different mirrored sinks, each with its own partition. But, since I am a new mommy, I did notice that there is no baby- changing station. Also, check out the picture booth, 2 strips is $2.00.Oh wow, what a find. I've always made jokes about the large Nacho Daddy billboard currently at I-215 and Eastern but I'm not laughing now. I'm smiling from ear to ear and planning a return visit. Where to start? First off the wait was short, they quoted 10 minutes and it was barely 5. From there things only got better. From a big bowl of guacamole that was priced right and was made with fresh ingredients to hot chips that were replaced without fuss with more hot chips when we ran low, the appetizers were good. As I had my fiancee and my son with me we ordered a soft taco off the kids menu, a Supreme Tostada nacho for her, and Florentine Nachos for me. The only thing in our carry out bag when we left was the soft taco as it was huge and my son loved the rice and beans and was full on that before even making it to the taco. Both of our nachos were loaded, and when they were brought to the table we were impressed. You definitely get a good value here, and these nachos were good all the way to the bottom, you were not left wishing you had more cheese or toppings to scoop up at the end. The chips were thin and crisp but strong enough to hold a lot of toppings without breaking apart. The Supreme Tostada nachos is their classic take on a loaded traditional nacho plate, it is everything you would expect to find, done right. But the Florentine Nachos...when I read the menu I was skeptical. But anything with sun dried tomatoes, prosciutto, and asiago, romano, and parmesan is usually not going to be a disappointment and my plate was left empty when I was done. This is the stuff that has you thinking that trying to explore the rest of the menu on a return visit will be very hard to do! On and on I can go with this but the best part of our experience was the service. It was incredibly good. From start to finish, we were taken care of. My 3 year old ended up touching our server's arm by accident as he was reaching for his drink and I was like uh-oh. Unlike some places where the server would recoil and freak out if they didn't like kids that didn't happen here. With 2 different servers they made my son feel comfortable and treated him right and even picked up a toy he dropped. But my fiancee and I were taken care of too...again chips were replaced on time, tea was taken care of. It was the way it's supposed to be. I try and not just hand out 5 star reviews. I'm known for my Absolutely Not and Jackassery lists so calling it as I see it is something I've clearly established my ability to do. But based on how good the food was, coupled with hands down the very best service I've received in Las Vegas in the past 2 years, 5 Stars is most appropriate. And I can't wait to go back and am already telling others about this place. (Our server was Chelsea, and I rarely name names in Yelp tips or reviews. But Chelsea raised the bar for me regarding how servers can be, and the customer service experience in general.)(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #23)After my first visit to Nacho Daddy I didn't think I'd ever come back (see the reason here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-henderson?userid=UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw#vvSCsR6z5ae2NEu_XkqxWQ). Nearly two years later, we returned for trivia night and it was a much better experience. Bordering on 4 stars, but not quite. We arrived around 6:30 for trivia that starts at 7. One of the great things about this place, unlike other places in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserve tables. That's awesome. Service was incredibly slow as trivia got underway. Understandable since they were pretty busy, but honestly, if the restaurant knows they get busier on these days they need to staff accordingly. We decided to share some Nachos Florentine and they were so much better than our previous visit to Nacho Daddy. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were nice, but I still wish they would spread out the toppings better so that you're not left with tons of plain chips on the bottom of the stack. I appreciate all the different nacho offerings. They are quite creative. Service was slow throughout, albeit friendly. We won trivia that evening, which was a blast, so we'll be back next week to spend out $50 in winnings. Hopefully I can try some of their other offerings.Omg when I am craving fish tacos, Nacho Daddy is my go-to. The fish tacos here are grilled and they come with a delicious homemade mango salsa. Everything tastes really fresh and the waitstaff is very nice but also casual.The location is right up the road from my office and they were very efficient with their take out service. But when you dine-in, I would definitely recommend the margaritas. My favorite is the Daddy's. Order it.I wish they were closer to Summerlin but I heard they are opening a second location in downtown Las Vegas, so I will definitely be visiting that one soon ;)I always give in to my honey and his obsession for Nachos. He talked about this place for days. So as our first meal in Vegas we decided to go here (of course). The atmosphere inside the restaurant is a typical sports bar. Filled with multiple TVs. On this day it was perfect, since it was a Sunday = Football Day!! We decided to sit at the bar area. We were served by a lovely waitress. She was very friendly and always asked us if we needed anything. We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in offer of free salsa and chips. They brought us two types of "colored" chips and salsa (hot & medium). We ordered the VEGAN NACHOS. If your expecting nacho cheese sauce. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's basically chips placed on a hot skillet they topped with Crumbles of veggie patty, Daiya cheese, beans, corn, saut√©ed peppers and onions, guacamole and a small amount of green salsa. This nacho was DRY as hell! It seemed like they put everything together and then slapped it into the oven. The nachos stick together. Making it hard to pull apart.Just when I thought the Nacho was dry. I was "served" the Driest Tex-Mex Burrito. Is there a shortage in sauce? I won't go into detail with it because no amount of sauce can make this taste good. It's like eating dry rice and beans. The sad thing is both Burrito and Nachos are not cheap. I did think the massive Bloody Mary bar was cool. Other than that I don't think I would come back unless my honey begs me to. Then maybe just maybe, I'll give in!
Annie's Gourmet Italian=First off, the waitress seated us and immediately poured oil and balsamic for the bread and yet, no bread came until after we ordered 15 minutes later.  (I hate when restaurants wait for you to order to bring out bread/chips!)  The bread they brought out were breadsticks that I swear I've had at some other restaurant.  If you're called 'gourmet' I expect you to be making and baking everything from scratch.  We ordered a cheese plate that consisted of cheese and crackers that I'm sure they bought at Wal-Mart.  Three different types of bland cheddar and a bland brie.  The Caesar Salad was literally the best part of the meal.  Shaved parmesean and what looked like homemade croutons.  (Really?  Homemade croutons but not homemade bread?)  I got Spaghetti and Meatballs and my wife ordered Fettucine Alfredo and we could have had less bland and much better food with the Classico that is in our pantry.  My meatballs were dry and the alfredo was very runny.  I went here because I had a Groupon and it's near my house but I probably wouldn't go back again.  I read the other reviews and let me say, the service was fine and we were seated right away.  The appetizer, salad, and entres all came out within a reasonable amount of time so there's no complaints there.  The decor and music were just fine but I really can't get past the food.Came here with a friend that lives in Henderson.  I liked the decor and the music they were playing (Andrea Bocelli) during dinner. The restaurant was also packed on a Tuesday evening, but luckily we made a reservation and did not have to wait too long.We ordered their fried calamari and the Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) as our appetizer, and since the restaurant was all out of chicken we ordered a Veal Marsala.The Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) was something I have never had before, and it was the highlight of our dining experience here.  I recalled reading another comment about getting two orders of this and have that as the entire meal.  I too think that is an excellent idea.The Fried Calamari appetizer was an EPIC FAIL. It came out looking like it was left unattended in the fryer, and was rescued from the scolding oil after it was completely crispy and dark brown, but not completely burnt. If it was a kitchen mishap by inexperienced culinary students learning to fry food, I can totally understand.  Newbies tend to overfry/cook fried calamari, instead of flash frying them.  But after tasting it, and discovering the not-so-pleasant fishy after-taste, indicative of seafood that has started to turn or already completed the left turn, I believe it was intentional and to mask the lack of freshness in the calamari.  I usually finish everything, but we opted to left half of the calamari on the plate and asked to have it taken away.The Veal Marsala was okay.  It came with a buttery Marsala sauce and pieces of sauteed white mushrooms, and a side of spaghetti.  The consistency of the sauce would be graded a C+/B- at best in my Saucier class, and I definitely have had better Marsala Sauce at the Cheesecake Factory. Overall, there is nothing to really complain or praise about this dish.  It was just very "homemade".  Service was good.  We did not take too long reaching a decision for what we were going to order, and the bread basket and order we brought out in a timely manner, even when the restaurant was packed.  So if service was an issue in the past, it has since been resolved.In conclusion, I thought we had a decent dining experience in all aspects of dining out, excluding the food.  The food experience spanned the full spectrum of "Oh my gato, that's terrible" to "it's alright" to "Yes, I would totally recommend that!"But with the overweight on "food" score, it only gets a 2 stars.The restaurant does have potential. And I respect the fact that they want to honor their family's recipes, but taste change overtime as should some recipes. Clinging to the sacred family heirloom recipes for the sake of doing so, is IMO a mistake.  If the customer constructive feedback is decidedly less than positive, it is only wise to be open-minded and see if updating the recipe is needed. P.S.  Thank you Andy T and Li Ly.This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Don't waste your time or money.in detail: arrived with my hubby and three kids around 7pm. There was only one other couple dining there at the time. I walked in while hubby gathered the kids. No one waited on me at first, then a hostess came up and asked in a very snooty tone if I had RESERVATIONS. I pointedly looked around and said 'Do I NEED them?"  She then proceeded to argue with me as to why I should choose a table that had high stools. I told her my kids are too small for that, they need a table for five. She insisted on a stooled table.At this point I walked out to find my husband about to enter the restaurant with our three kids. I shook my head and said "I dont think this is a good place for kids." because I thought the reason she was treating me thusly was because I had kids.A woman going into the restaurant overheard me, asked me what had happened, and ushered us in, insisting that they serve children, she went to the hostess and fussed at her, saying "people do NOT need a reservation to eat here." I didnt really want to eat there after that, but my kids were hungry and the woman (I guess the owner?) insisted.unfortunately, the owner/manager left after that, and the hostess then proceeded to seat us at a four-topper table (we needed a five) and pulled a chair up so my sons (ages two and three) could sit next to each other. WTF? I TOLD her we needed a five topper. If you dont have one give us a six topper, or an eight, but this was just unbelievable. The restaurant, as you may recall, was mostly empty. The restaurant started to fill up with other patrons and there were other people with kids, and also a kids menu, so at this point I didn't understand her attitude.If got worse as the night wore on. We waited and waited for her to take our order. She finally took it, and then we waited and waited and waited some more for it to come out. When it finally did, she didn't deliver it, someone else did, and they didnt wait around to see if it was correct. I was busy getting the food ready for my kids (the side dishes were all wrong), so it was a few minutes before i tried my own food.It was the totally wrong order.So was my husbands.But no wait staff were in sight.We were starving by this point, so we proceeded to eat it anyway. But my husband has a bad stomach and can eat only certain things, and he couldnt eat his meal.the waitress didnt check on us for THIRTY MINUTES. We had to wait for everything.At that point my meal was finished, though it was the wrong thing (the food was totally immemorable), my kids were done, and my husband hadnt eaten his food. She offered to bring him his original meal. He said ok.She went into the back and brought out the original ICE COLD plate he had ordered!!! I could not BELIEVE this!!! My kids had sat there for about two hours at this point and they had had it, so I took them to the car. My husband followed after paying the check. He was FUMING. This woman had had the GALL to charge us for three entrees!' The bill for this fiasco was EIGHTY-EIGHT DOLLARS!!!I have NEVER had service like this, anywhere. the waitress was argumentative, but did it with a smile on her face as though that made it OK. She was snooty the entire time we were there and acted like we were unwanted. Her whole attitude SUCKEDI hope to God the owner reads this. If I had an employee like this, I would fire them immediately. I was so upset by this, I couldn't fathom why on earth we were treated this way except perhaps that my ten year old daughter has downs syndrome, so I was actually relieved to read that other people had similar bad experiences here just so I knew it wasnt just us.If I could, I would give this place a negative five stars.
SLICE on Broadway=Okay, what did I do wrong people?  I am going against the grain... I didn't like the pizza... Is there a secret to ordering here?I had to go El Boro with a regular pepperoni and mushroom pizza to please the masses.  Should I have ordered something else?  I admit, I do like Chicago style, deep dish the best, but I've had my share of thin crust that I've dug.  Now, everyone's really going to hate me... the pizza crust was like cardboard, the cheese was rubbery and there was hardly any sauce on it.  There, I said it.  Sorry!So is there something else I should be getting here or did I just come on an off day?  I'm open to suggestions... this place is in my hood and rocks so many of your worlds, what's the secret!?
Francesca's Al Lago=Huh. Huh, huh, huh. All in all, a fine experience, but will I go back? Eh. If people wanted to go there, sure. But I feel like I did it and it's done. (And I should have gone to Nostrano.)Our waitress was nice, she had some good things to say about the menu and about her personal preferences. She also let us swap out some pancetta with scallops in a risotto starter so that was cool. It was good, lacked depth though in my opinion, and the scallops themselves were a little over cooked yet didn't have much of a crusty outside from the sear. I'm going to say the pan wasn't hot enough and they were in there too long. Cesar salad was probably the highlight. Salad? Yup. Roasted red peppers should come on EVERYTHING and this salad proves that. The dressing was mild yet tangy, and dressed the romaine enough that each leaf was coated, but not overly so that it became soggy. And theeeeeeeeeeen my entree. Whole wheat pasta with vegetables and sausage in an "herbed broth". First of all, I have no idea what "herbed broth" means. Is that like chicken stock with thyme? Second of all, there was no broth and thus there was no flavor. Third, the amount of pasta was overwhelming. They don't make it there because nobody would send out (I'm not joking) nearly a box of penne in a bowl. It was nuts. I ate around most of it but found the veggies to be way overcooked and the sausage while made in house lacked the flavor profile that I'm used to from Nostrano and Underground meats. My biggest pet peeve though is being told I'm supposed to leave, without being asked. At about 9:00pm or so a bus boy came by sweeping the dining room into a dirty little pile of the evening's food scraps, bread crumbs and dust. Then he started to re-arrange furniture. Then the music faded. Look you guys, tell me it's time to go and I'll go, but we made a reservation for 9:00pm, we got there at 8:30pm which you were excited about and you told us you close at 10:00pm. A few months ago I stopped at a Culvers just as they were closing, asked if I could grab a burger and they said, "As long as our doors are still open, we're here for the customer." Culvers!
Nikki Beach=WOW!  Tropicana has done it I tell you.  The Casino is completely remodeled as well as all the rooms, but my review is not about the Hotel.  Tropicana recently opened its new day club (Nikki Beach) and night club (Club Nikki) on May 26th.  This place is off the charts!  The beach club is an all white theme, with white day beds everywhere.  They even have some kick ass white "Tee Pee" cabanas.  The pool is a little small but the day club is simply amazing.  The vibe is much more up my alley compared to other day clubs like Rehab and Wet Republic.  In these two clubs there are numerous drunk college kids and what I like to call Guebos (Jersey Shore type guys that are completely ripped and like to do monkey dances as they try to attract the opposite sex).  Not at Nikki.  They are a little more strict there (dress code, no drinks in the pool, guys cant dance on ledges, etc).  Don't get me wrong you can still have fun Vegas style. but the rules tend to not attract that "party till Im retarded" type crowd.  The service could be better honestly, the staff was all incredibly friendly but I felt like it took an hour to get a drink once we ordered it from our cocktail waitress.Now the night club....    Again....wow!  This is a smaller club compared to most but the atmosphere was very similar to the pool, chill but people are here to party.  They have an amazing light show to dance with, the dance floor is fairly good size, and they have plenty of tables.  They also have three bars around the club which makes it nice ordering a drink (you dont have to wait forever compared to other clubs that have one bar).  Elaine was right, they have a wood platform around the dance floor that girls can get up and dance on, but if you are of the male sex security will grab your ass down within a heart beat.  NOW HERE IS THE BEST PART OF THE CLUB: They have a champagne muse (looks like a circle chandelier) that goes around a track on the roof and will drop down from the ceiling to your table if you order certain types of champagne.  Their is a beautiful girl on it dressed like an Angel and she will literally deliver the bottle to your table while being dropped from the roof!  Awesome right!?!?  If you are debating about going to check out these clubs because they are located at the "ghetto Tropicana" I would wait no longer.  Tropicana has outdone itself and I can honestly say these clubs are among the top clubs in Vegas.  GO!!! =)It's a great mix of people and a fun time!THE DIRTY:While there were "cocktail waitresses," not one came up to us, ever. We were there for 4 hours..... just saying.The people who work at the walk-up bar are soooo sweet/awesome/amaze-balls!THE SCENE:It was pretty random. I was def the hottest chick there, but that's not to say that there wasn't eye candy. It was just a true blend of people and social diversity. But, the main focus was that we all wanted to have fun! LOVE it!OVERALL:Someone jacked my sunglasses, whatev...Poor chair-side service....The pool water was chilly....A good vibe from the people there....Order a Mojito! Sooo Good!!I can't say if i recommend or not, bc i was there on e Wednesday and it wasn't crackin'.xo-andrea
Fatburger=Dang, where is the crackhead ghetto speaking midget counter guy as was described in another review?  I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thingI wasn't there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn't want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. So I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  Then I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like "Da!! I lost my money" we said, "Yum, we're gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger" and it was good. With a soda, it's over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn't run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble.
Lin's Grand Buffet=I thought that this place was pretty great! Rand H. another great Yelper had recommended it,so I always wanted to try it.I came here with a friend to celebrate her Birthday early (crazy Schedules we have.)Anyway ,the first thing I noticed about this place is how absolutely Beautiful it is!Honestly,it has 2 of the most beautiful Chandeliers. The place is done in some gorgeous tile,and some beautiful statues as well.The food is fresh and a lot of great selections. They even have a Mongolian Chef,as well as a Sushi Chef. All very good.I wish they brought a tea pot with hot tea. But instead they bring you a foam cup with a straw and lid. But, my friend got Ice Tea and she got a glass with a straw. I thought that procedure was a little odd. Lots of parking outside, and the service was good. He kept coming to check on us. The Bathrooms however, could use a little attention.But, all in all, the place was beautiful and the food was great.
True Food Kitchen=This restaurant lives up to its name. They are really true to their concept here. I've dined at the Camelback True Food several times and so when I learned that the new True Food Kitchen was opening at Scottsdale Quarter, I couldn't wait to check it out! A couple visits later and I can rightfully say...Fox, you've done it again! Believe it or not, I actually like this True Food better than the original location. The vibe is a lot cooler and more "natural." I really feel healthier when I walk in. With the garden out back (or is it the front?) and the airiness and open feel, for a brief moment I feel like I'm on the countryside near a stream rather than in the middle of fashionista central. Yes, it's the same exact menu as the other location and maybe because newer always tastes better, but I taste a different for the better in this menu! Everything has a bit more flavor and that's saying a lot because the flavor at the original location is pretty darn good! The hummus here is my favorite starter dish. They add olives and the pita bread is soft and chewy. One of my favorite go-to lunch items here is the Turkey pita sandwich. YUM. It's just as good if not better as I expected. In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of either the hash or the kale salad. The hash has also been kind of blah and the kale salad tasted like I was eating a leaf. But, here...I like both! I don't know what they did, but the hash has much more seasoning and taste. I had the sweet potato hash so that might have something to do with it. And the Kale salad wasn't quite so leafy. As for the sides aka drinks and dessert, my favorite drink there is the Medicine Man. It takes a pretty spectacular non-alcoholic drink for me to pay $6, but if there's any drink that lives up to par, it's the Medicine Man. I could probably drink 11 of them, but I hold back. As for dessert, I normally don't opt for dessert at True Food because there's something anti-climatic about it there, but when I do splurge, the Carmel brownie is the way to go. So welcome to the corridor True Food! You've made it just a little tastier here!True Food Kitchen did not live up to the hype I was expecting after ready so many good Yelp reviews...  It was A-OK at best for this Fox Restaurant.   We arrived for lunch and the True Food Kitchen was very busy so we opted to sit on the patio in 109 degree weather.  We were shaded and they have misters, so we were relatively comfortable.  Restaurant ~ there has plenty said already about this place on Yelp and the pics are a slide show for you to enjoy.  It's a nice looking restaurant both inside and out.  The decor and color schemes are nicely done.  I did not care for the flow since there are really two main entrances, one on the north side and one of the south side.  We entered the north side and stood in front of the bar area for a while until one of the bartenders informed us we had to go to the other side of the bar to see a hostess for seating.Service ~ This was one of the more disappointments during our lunch. We were off to a bit of a rough start but that really didn't matter, it was the service we received throughout our dinning experience.  It started off great with placing our order and receiving our drinks but after we received our meal... our server must have checked out.  We tried to stop a few other passing by servers however they they too seemed disinterested in their customers as if they were all having a bad day.   We did not see our server again until we were ready for our bill.  Food ~ I ordered the grass fed Bison burger, which had shiitake mushrooms and onions, mayo, parmesan cheese on a flax bun. It was supposed to be an Unami burger but it was more of a Tsunami burger.  The parmesan cheese was too much for this well cooked and seasoned bison burger.  It over powered the taste so I had to remove it.  I ordered the sweet potato hash as my side, which was good for the first few bites but then it became somewhat blah...We also order the shaved turkey sandwich but they were out of shaved turkey.  It was 11:30am... So we opted for the turkey burger with a side of kale salad.  The turkey burger came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, provolone cheese, and mayo on a flax bun.  The burger was cooked very well but could have assembled better.  They placed the tomato's on top of the not so ripe avocados which were on top of the lettuce.  This made the burger like a pin ball machine, with every bite out shoots a chunk of avocado.  Bite  ~ ping, out shoots a chunk onto her blouse.  Another bite ~ pang, out shoots another chunk and it bounces onto the table.  They should consider making an avocado aioli spread for this burger.  The kale salad was also good for the first few bites then it tasted blah.Since this was our first visit to the True Food Kitchen I raised this review up to 3 stars.  I am hesitant but will consider going back for another try in hope the service and quality of food is better.  I will be sure to select something different on my next visit.I've been to this TFK more times than I can count, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now.  (I have reviewed the Biltmore location).I've been here alone, in small groups of 2-4, in larger groups of 5+, with and without my toddler.  I've never had a bad experience.  That says a lot.  The food is consistent, healthy, and delicious.  The service is attentive.  The atmosphere is lively.  The bathrooms are clean.This has become a go-to place for us to meet friends that live in North Scottsdale as it's kind of half-way...Standout items on the brunch menu in my opinion are the johnnycakes and the open faced egg white omelette.  I enjoy the "bright eyes" drink as well.  For lunch/dinner, you really can't go wrong but some of my faves are the vegetable crudite appetizer, the kale salad with salmon, the pan seared sea bass, teriyaki brown rice bowl.  You can't go wrong with their turkey burger either, and their pizzas are great for kids!On the FRC website, they say that "At True Food Kitchen, we want you to feel better, live longer, and make your mouth happy in the process."  I'd say they are making good on their mission - one meal at a time!****It's worth noting that the parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter is either in the big lot or valet unless you have really good parkma and score a spot on the street nearby.Okay, this place really got on my nerves, and this is why: I went there for dinner at the hotel receptionist's suggestion for a local vegetarian restaurant. I walk in around 7 pm and sit at what looks like a juice bar. I pick from the menu something called "medicine man" which purportly contains pomegranate juice. I ask the 20-something server, "This is real fresh juice you make yourself, correct?" "Everything you see here is made here," he says - a brilliantly vague answer considering the sham he is about the serve me. "So you actually have the pomegranates and then you juice them yourself?" and he nods affirmatively. I see a commercial juicer so I believe the little punk.Guess what I got? For $6 + tax, I get this pinkish watery thing in an 8-ounce plastic cup, at least half of it filled with ice. No, this gotta be a mistake. Maybe it tastes like heavily watered down Kool-Aide because the ice has melted. So I send it back and ask for juice without ice. I am informed that without ice I would get half as much, which was fine with me, thinking now I'm going to get something that actually tastes like fruit. I watch him return almost instantly with a smaller glass cup. Wow, he's gotta be the fastest juice-man on the planet, I joke, but inside I am cringing because freshness and instantaneous don't go together and the realization that I've been had is beginning to settle in.  Yes, it tastes the same. It's the same pinkish watery crap with all of four blueberries floating on top. "I thought you said you have fresh juice.""It is fresh," he insists matter-of-factly. "We just sell so much of it that we have to make it in the morning." "And why does it taste so watery?""Oh, we top it off with soda water."I ask to see how it is done. He shows me a large dented metal coffee urn, labeled "medicine man." He pours the now day-old "fresh juice" and then tops it off with a soda gun. There is nothing fresh about the pomegranate either. It's right out of a POM bottle. I paid, even left a tip, and strolled out, hungry but polite. Even thanked my server. The kid wouldn't know fresh if it crashed into his forehead. But I was more anguished for not having the guts to do what needed to be done: refuse to pay, throw the "fresh juice" into the little pissant's face and hollered curses at the corporate jackasses that pull this off on the unsuspecting public.Why am I such a chicken? Oh, I'm in some fancy shopping mall with all these model suburbanite's cluelessly huffing down soda and old juice and congratulating themselves for being healthy. Doing what needed to be done would've precipitated the painful jamming of my head between the floor and the flabby but insistent ass cheeks of the nearest security guard.By the way, there is absolutely nothing vegetarian about this fake of a place. My quick scan of the menu didn't spot a single meatless entree. And to add insult to injury, these shameless lovers of the planet serve sea bass!True Food, my ass. Or maybe they're just being ironic.Stung by audaciously corrupt capitalism, I took refuge at a true vegetarian place, here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/organic-shores-phoenix?hrid=6Unfw6K79UO3B6q1edEjzAOoo, i am most certainly a fan of True Food Kitchen! The restaurant is basically one big open box with the patio wrapping around 3 sides of it. Definitely a great place to take a lunch break when you are out shopping in this really cool area of Scottsdale. The staff all seemed really fun and cheerful. To start off with I had a honey infused lemonade that was fantastic! Then came the vegetable crudites, wow, there's a show stopper for you! I huge bowl of absolutely beautiful vegetables - you can order a half order and I highly suggest it, between two of us we probably ate about half. Then for my main I had a perfectly spiced Panang curry rice bowl with wonderful jumbo prawns. Mmmm! I would order that again in a heartbeat! Thanks so much to Gabi M for taking me to this really fun spot. I can't wait to go back and actually do some shopping along with the eating!100 times better than the True Foods here in Fashion Valley. Service went ABOVE and beyond, I wish I knew the name of our server for a shout out... she was AMAZING! She was such a great help she really knew her stuff and made great recommendations (a healthy brunette with beautiful blue eyes) and way on top of her game. The drinks came out slow but I am sure that was not her fault. I had the scallops and they were SO DAMN GOOD and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish! All of our party of 12 seemed very happy with their meals. I tasted the curry and it was very good. We had a great crudette appetizer with a beautiful and delicious variety of veggies and hummus and pita. Everything was fantastic. I have to say I was not very excited when the boss wanted to go here because I have been to the fashion valley one a couple of times and was not impressed with any meal or beverage. This location changed my mind about True Foods. It's just the fashion valley one that sucks.okay, so this place is part super healthy, part experimentally interesting. and the bathroom is outside.we had the edamame dumplings to start. excellent.my colleague had the mahi mahi special - she was underwhelmed. she gave me all of her vegetables. I love veggies, but the tough, half green cauliflower I wasn't feeling. (apparently it's a half breed of another vegetable i'm not familiar with.) I had a spaghetti casserole thing with a bison burger on top. i wasn't mad at that at all. dessert. we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. it's made with 72% cacao, 0% sweetness. meh. I also got the squash pie. I was into that, until the crust that was so hard I needed a knife and brute strength to cut, cut the roof of my mouth. it's still healing. if that crust wasn't so hard the pie would be fairly amazing.Always a hit, my bad experiences here have been very limited, almost always leave a happy customer. So I returned to True Foods a couple days ago after having not dined there in about a year or two and I think this last visit was my favorite! There is so much variety here, healthy food and the vegetarian options are bountiful. I noticed that the menu was a little different since the last time I'd been there, but they still had my faves so I was happy!It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, but luckily I was able to get a seat right away. The server there was super nice and attentive to us. I absolutely love pizza, and I get the mushroom pizza almost every time I come here. However, I decided to change things up this time and went for the butternut squash pizza, and I am sure glad I did. I love both of the pizzas, but I think I prefer the butternut squash pizza. The walnuts definitely make it infinitely better, so good! Plus the fresh arugula on top is a nice touch. The spaghetti squash here it good too, but a bit pricier. I still have yet to try a Juby true juice, for sure on my list of things to try. Gives me reason to come back!
Brasserie 33=My wife and I had a Groupon to this place.  We were pretty excited about an outing here for dinner on a Saturday night.  I checked out the menu and had high hopes because this appeared to be a classic French brasserie.  We were greeted by our very cheerful waitress.  She warned us up front that it's "team service" so if we couldn't find her, to be sure to flag down one of the others from the wait staff and it would be no problem to get what we might need.  Unfortunately, it went all downhill from here.We started with the rabbit rillettes ($11).  The rabbit meat was tender but watery and tasteless.  There were capers and some watery sliced black olives on the side.  I just didn't get this dish.After that, there was an ENORMOUS wait for our entrees.  I nursed my glass of wine waiting for our entrees.  My wife ordered the Bouillabaisse ($27) and I ordered the Steak Frites ($30).  From what we could gather, the table next to us did not like one of their entrees.  The person next to us re-ordered a Bouillabaisse.  We suspect that my wife's order was given to the table next to us by accident as her entree came back pretty fast after the re-order.  Oh well.During this waiting game for our entrees, nearly every single waiter was missing in action.  If they did come out to the dining room, they didn't make eye contact with us or pretended not to hear us call for some help.  Not a good sign.Then, I overheard some ruckus between the owner or general manager raising his voice to one of the busboys.  He ordered him to take off his bow tie and just go home.  Our waitress told us it was her favorite busboy that was fired right in the middle of our dinner service as well as someone else.  Therefore, even longer wait...Finally, both entrees arrived.  My wife was pleased with hers for the most part.  She was needing a spoon to get at the broth in her dish.  After so very many attempts to get a spoon (someone in the back got fired so we can assume it was a dishwasher), it finally arrived as we were wanting to leave.  As for my entree ... the frites were good.  The steak was horrible.  I ordered it medium.  Well, it came out charred on the outside and raw in some spots.  It was a very cheap piece of meat and it was absolutely prepared by someone who I assume was drafted to serve in the kitchen.  There is no way a professional cook cooked my steak.  The good news: we had a Groupon.  For some reason, not having to pay full price took a little of the sting out of this dining experience.  I think mangling the classics like rillettes and Steak Frites are totally unforgivable when trying to pass off as a French brasserie.More good news: besides dinner, we were treated to a show with all the drama in the dining room.  Even more good news: we won't be wasting anymore money here.  Stay away.This place was terrible. It is a good thing it closed down. They didnt do any justice to the french. The food was dry and pointless. The atmosphere was useless. I could see the people at all the tables making that face of disgust. Each plaint appeared on the table as though it was just thrown together but a terrible team of kitchen workers. If there was one chef in the kitchen then things probably would have been better.
Fiesta Filipina Cuisine=Fiesta Filipina is another good Filipino restaurant gone bad.  I was in love with this place when it first opened!  Everything about this restaurant was legit, from the theme, food and decor. Not baduy, or bakya at all, looking classy with all the Filipino paintings/decor. After more trips, and a few months later it went down the same horrible path as other Filipino restaurants.  Shit service and a shittier smell. The service is always good, unless you get the female worker.   Beware of the female worker!!!  Trust, she is not hard to spot.  She's the cashier queen.-Tore up from the floor up-Caked up face thicker than the earths crust.-The most vibrant, electric, blinding eyeshadow. Whenever she takes our order, or rings us up she always rushes.  Rushing leads to confusion, confusion leads to pissed off customers and bad reviews.  She kept on saying "extra charge for credit,  so i give turon .50 cents, .50 cents!!" In her mind that means, I'll say the charge is .50 cents, but its really a few bucks, and I wont give you any turon- ___-  I felt raped, robbed and broke after leaving the restaurant.  The food was shit too. -Barbecue is good. But  DONT use the same brush you use to baste raw meat, to baste the cooked ones too :) Big mistake and health hazard. -Carioka was hard, tough to chew and over priced.-Ukoy was (excuse my language) the worst fucking shit ever. Honestly, do yourselves a favor and never make it again.  Paste is what it is, thick pasty batter that was slightly fried.-Puto was pasty, and a few were rotten, before the sell by or expire date.I guess if you need a Filipino food fix, come to this place early, and stick to simple dishes.Filipino food super close to my house in Henderson... shooooooot.i even took my boy from manilla here, and we went nuts on some pretty good pinoy grub.the GRUB:- chicken adobo... salty, soury, peppery chicken stew... a good version of a very philippine food staple... mix the sauce in your rice with a little patis for the real deal.- chicken bbq stick... red like tocino or char siu sauce, sweet and charred over fire... very tasty- they dont have Sisig on the line up ever (because you have to order it in advanced only) but they do have lechon kawali - fried pork belly - which is pretty dang awesome with hot white rice and mang thomas sauce- lumpia (shanghai) was standard fare - dip in the spicy jufran for a kick- my friend ordered chicharon bulaklak and mung-go beans... and said it reminded him so much of home... it was that good- HIGHLIGHT: CRISPY PATA !!! nothing like the picture on the wall... made to order (done in like 5 mins) - but a deliciously deep fried pig hip with crispy chicharon skin, soft roasted-like pork meat on the inside, and on the bone w tendon attatched for extra eats - so much flavor... it is accompanied with a house dipping sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and hot chilis... so awesome.- turon (banana fritter), babinka especial (rice cake with cream cheese), leche flan (caramel custard), halo halo (filipino shaved ice and ice cream sundae), and calimansi or ube or mango shake... all yummy choices for dessert- they have canned soda only (booooooo!!!) - but at least they have sarsi soda... or the fresh cantaloupe juice drink.the JOINT:- best comment from my manilla friend: "ferds, this might be the cleanest pilipino restaurant ive been to here in the states... actually, anywhere for that matter."- plenty of seating, plenty of light- very filipino decor... including a small seating section that looks like a backyard (barrio) fiesta / straw islander hut / hawaiian lanai- there should be alot of available parking in the strip mall- 3 46" LCDs - usually showing TFC, but i have seen sports on too - like the NFL playoffs (49ers) or NBA games (Lakers)the SQUEEZE:- about $9 for the combo and the drink- $14 for the crispy pata - but i think it feeds a family of 4 - ha!- everyone if very helpful and friendly- cash and card is acceptedFINAL SAY:for Henderson, especially right off of Eastern and St Rose Pkway... this is a great find... and probably a good place to meet single pinay nurses on lunch break from the Hospital across the street. ha!2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #8We found ourselves at Fiesta Filipina for our 8th Halo-Halo taste test.  I can't believe that we just started this challenge last week and we are now only 2 contenders away from completing this challenge.  Terri and I met up with Ian A for this challenge.  We had some eats, but our primary reason for this stop was obvious...how is their Halo-Halo? Fiesta Filipina has a regular Halo-Halo for $3.99 and their special for $4.99.  The only difference between the two is ube ice cream.  Since we are maximizing our craving, we decided on the special of course. So, what's in this special Halo-Halo.  You get ube ice cream (two scoops), condensed milk, shave ice, nata de coco, macapuno, pinipig, azuki (red beans), white beans, and some legit ube.  This is our only 2nd stop that had real ube in it.  What's missing is the flan and lanka.  After mixing my Mix-Mix and sampling it, I already knew that Fiesta's Halo-Halo is ranking up there in my book.  The ice was just right, taste superb, and the mix was almost perfect.  I stress almost perfect because flan was the one missing ingredient that I was looking for.  By the way, you can order flan on the side (about $5) and add to it if flan is a must have in your Halo-Halo.On a side note, I did have some food here too.  The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the Flip joints in SF, SoCal, and Daygo.  I loved it and felt at home.  But I wasn't too impressed with the food.  The food is cheap and for $5.29 you can get two Chicken BBQ Sticks with rice. Sounded and looked appealing, but I'm no fan of rubbery chicken. Overall, I am a fan of their Halo-Halo and see myself coming back just that. Food...well, that's a different story.PS:  One thing I learned during this quest for our favorite Halo-Halo in the valley is that real spoons (not the flimsy plastic ones) are ideal when mixing your Halo-Halo. These plastic spoons work like catapults when you're mixing your Halo-Halo. Last thing I want is an ube shot in the face.  Stay hungry, my friends.  2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WATook em down a star for their rude azz f*ck pushy attitudes behind the counter.

Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place=After reading about the wait most people have at Babycakes Cafe I decided to give another breakfast place a try (I'll try Babycakes one day...). So I Yelped a spot and was instantly intrigued by Rise and Shine. It was the location-not far from where I live- and those darn cute flower umbrellas that they have hanging from their ceiling.It was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!!Anyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!The food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though...I loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!!I will be back and the BF can wait in the car....I love it when locally owned and operated restaurants survive in LV.   The place is absolutely cute with their huge flowers spinning from the ceiling and the servers in their pajamas.  This is one of my favorite spots to do breakfast on the weekends.   Everyone I bring here raves about the place too.  The food is really good.  Some of the notable things I've had here include: - Chicken Fried Steak (Thick and delicious gravy.  Steak might be a little too thickly battered.  Feel a little guilty eating it =)  Tasty hash browns on the side)- Two Egg Breakfast (Think grand slam, but much tastier!  Not crazy about the kielbasa, so I'll stick with the sausage or bacon next time)- Corned Beef Hash (Not like the smushy corned beef - its "real"!)- Southwest Turkey Panini (Panini's here seem like a good option for lunch!)- And always get their cute little pot of bread! (A light and fluffy Cinnamon roll - Yum!) Like everyone else says, the service here is good.  Always kind with a smile.  I wouldn't say the food is OMG, but its solid.  Prices might be a tiny bit on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it for the lovely experienceVery cute breakfast place. Amazing food!I'm sitting here drafting this review as I watch my son finishing our breakfast. It makes me a bit sad that this place is so far from my home. I drove here from Henderson, its located on Southern Highlands Pkwy & Cactus. If it was close, I'd be the Duchess...fast! And weigh much more, probably...I was a waitress back in the day at locally owned restaurants like Rise & Shine, and as I giggle watching these ladies serve food dressed in flannel pajamas, all I wondered was "Why didn't I work at a place where pjs were the uniform?!?!" How much more comfortable can you make it, right?! So you can imagine, it definitely has a warm feeling. The smell of French toast and coffee and cinnamon gets your nose up as you walk in the door. The menu - you can order your standards. Omelets, pancakes, bacon & eggs. Then you see Crunch Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and Spiced Rubbed Rib Eye Chilaquiles, Fried Chicken and Waffles, and homemade Corned Beef Hash. What else? Most egg plates come with your choice of toast, biscuit, or the ever popular pot of bread. Very adorable little round loaf of slightly cinnamon gooey deliciousness seem to be on many tables during my visits. The drinks - freshly squeezed orange juice is always a favorite of mine I share with my son. But I had to try their French press coffee after reading about it. A generous serving is brought to your table, accompanied by a sand hourglass, with three separate colored sands. You decide which sand to follow to determine how strong you want your coffee. Love it!! (see photo if you can't picture what I'm saying)I haven't dined here for lunch, but I slightly glanced at it while drooling over the breakfast choices. If you're not in the mood for breakfast, like their current special, Baked Blueberry Pecan French Toast Casserole or my personal favorite, Make-Your-Own Yogurt Parfait, you can choose from burgers, salads, panini sandwiches, and daily specials like meatloaf, fish & chips, and chicken broccoli pot pie, served until they run out. They also offer a few kid's plates, however, if you have a toddler like me, the generous portions they serve is more than enough to share! Prices are decent, the service I've received have been warm, inviting, and prompt. I think if the next few visits are as awesome as my previous ones, they definitely warrant a 5-star review. For now, it is far to drive to, and I do wish they offered lighter healthier options, too. Do I end up ordering them? Not much. But I like having the choice when I'm feeling weight-conscious on those rare occasions. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Rise & Shine's yummy breakfasts!hello LV Yelpers!Came here last week for breakfast the morning it poured/flooded.One of my coworkers love coming here so a group of us made our way through the rain and flooded streets to rise and shine.I was excited to try their pot of bread from reading all of the reviews. I don't live close to R&S so I really hoped for a good experience.It was mid morning and they already ran out of pot of bread! really?! :(I had the corn beef hash with biscuit which was really tasty. My coworker comes here for the steak and eggs.If you're in the area and looking for breakfast stop by here! I wouldn't drive out of the way for R&S.Casual dining. No frills.Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive. Here's the rundown:French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee. Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats. Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious. Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER. Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm. If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it. I'm rating this a 5 star plusI'll definitely be back.Your first thought when walking in? "Look how neat this place is!" Servers in pajamas, upside down flower-print umbrellas hanging from the ceiling (some even spin!), and overall relaxed vibe. The wait for me is usually about 10-20 minutes depending on what time I get there. Like Marie T., this place USED to be my favorite breakfast place. It was also icing on the cake that it is walking distance from my abode. I keep giving them chances to change my mind, but I get disappointed every time.My favorite thing to order is the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. Thankfully, its taste consistency has remained the same and is always "good." My second favorite would be the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle. I was never a fan of Chicken & Waffles until I ate it at this place. The New York Steak, Spinach, & Benedict-Bagel was the worst thing that I have ever ordered. The presentation was extremely lacking.. The words Hot Mess came to mind; which made my food unappetizing. The Pot of Bread for a side is one of the reasons why I keep wanting to come back, but for the last THREE times they have been unable to keep up with the demand and simply say "they're out." Instead, customers have to choose between getting toast or a biscuit. Ugh. If you're a server and you see that my hash browns are either burnt or undercooked then do not bring it out to me. I will say something. Also, we keep getting handed other people's tabs.. get it together guys.It had been over a year since our last foray to Southern Highlands to dine at Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issues that had kept us away for so long; the ineptitude of the hostess staff.  We added our name to the list when we arrived and were given a 30 minute wait time.  At the 45 minute mark, I asked about our table and was told that there were still 8 parties ahead of us and that they were seating the larger parties first.  uh, okay...  I asked if we could sit at the counter and was told that the counter was part of the wait list, but it was empty.  At the 1 hour mark, I inquired again and was told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  I asked again about the counter (now with one patron sitting there) and was told that it was closed today.  Weird  Even though I was annoyed, I felt committed to stick it out after waiting so long.  We were finally seated after waiting an hour and 20 minutes, but only because two parties of 2 in front of us gave up and left.  Maybe they did not appreciate being told that larger parties were more important than they were. On to happier subjects:  The food!  I ordered the Ultimate steak & egg breakfast: $12.95 for an 8oz Rib Eye, two eggs, and hash browns with the pot of bread.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, the eggs and hash browns standard, and the pot of bread (basically a cinnamon roll) was good. solid 4/5  The BF had the Fried Chicken & Waffle: $11.95 for a boneless chicken breast coated in buttermilk and fried sitting on top of a Belgian waffle.   I didn't try this, but was told that it was just okay. 3/5  I also used the Chamucos Jalapeno Hot Sauce on my eggs and saw that it was made in Henderson.  The waitress noticed that I was reading the bottle and advised that they had bottles for sale for $6, so I scooped one of those up for home use!I can't really say for sure if we'll ever go back, but I hope they work out their front of house issues.After a rather lackluster first visit to the other Rise & Shine location on Flamingo, it's with disappointment that I note that the original location also failed to rise to the occasion of a great breakfast.All puns aside, I do really want to like this place. Service is spot on and incredibly friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired for me I'm afraid. I found the fried chicken flavorless and dry, the waffle was a soggy mess and the chilaquiles were as well. The only thing from my meal that I halfway enjoyed were the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. They were good when paired with the flavorless and over-battered chicken to help make it more palatable. Aside from the pancakes, the service was the only other saving grace about this place. I don't see myself making any extra effort to come back when there are much breakfast spots near me that have cheaper prices and better food.I always love trying new places for breakfast in Vegas before the ride back to Cali and I definitely made the right choice in stopping by here. Very friendly staff and super cute that they wear pjs as their work attire.I ordered the Rise & Shine Chilaquiles and by the pics on Yelp, it seriously did not look like it'd be such a large serving. It could probably feed at least 2 adults in my opinion and for only 10 bucks. I loved how much cheddar cheese it had. I wish it had a bit more beans though. The flavor of the chili was very different from what I'm used to. Sorta had a Tex Mex type flavor.
Harvest Moon Grille=Sometimes hotel restaurants are at best mediocre. Harvest Moon Grille at the Dunhill is off to a great start.  Located in the historic Dunhill Hotel uptown. From what I can tell, it's a simple menu, focusing on local and seasonal produce and meats.  My eggs benedict, with a southern twist of toast and sausage were delicious, served with potato and sweet potato hashbrowns .  It's a little bit on the hotel expensive side, but easy to pay for when you know it's good products and made with care.  Can't wait to try dinner! Two pluses, were good service and decent coffee.After my first good, but not great, meal at Harvest Moon Grille many months back, I've returned for two more rounds - another lunch and a delicious breakfast. Because of these return visits and some kinks worked out in the kitchen, Harvest Moon Grille has certainly earned another star.In July I enjoyed a quiet and lovely breakfast to myself which included an iced tea and a delectable, uber fresh bowl of yogurt and berries. A first when the kind and efficient waiter set down the bowl, I thought it was a smidge shy on the portion. But oh no...I couldn't even finish it. The vanilla yogurt was perfectly creamy and accented beautifully with their house made granola. Which rocks. Big time. I left happy, full and healthy, indeed.More recently, I trotted back over for another healthful meal when I ordered the farro salad. I don't think I've ever made farro at home, so I was anxious to try this groovy grain. Again, a small-ish looking bowl of whole farro and seasonal vegetables with lemon-garlic confit dressing arrived at the table. And true to form I finished it but I left happy, full and healthy. The farro wasn't overdressed, peppered or salted and the confit dressing was the perfect light touch. This is the one time in my life I think I would have liked a bit more dressing, actually. If you're traipsing around Uptown and looking for a great meal with a fantastic local focus (all items sourced with 100 miles of Charlotte), Harvest Moon Grill is a great choice. They have defined eating local.
Golden Grill=The Golden Grill is the 24 hour cafe in the Gold Spike Hotel and they are really known for one thing only - their $5.99 12 oz. Prime Rib dinner.Yes, this $6 dinner is available daily from 4 pm to 11 pm!  It also comes with a baked potato and veggies (in our case, corn).  Sure, it's not the fancy kind of prime rib you find at Lawry's Prime Rib, but it's also less than six bucks!  And as far as I'm concerned, that's a pretty sweet deal!Walking into this brightly lit but small cafe, you really don't need to even look at the menu since this special isn't even on there.  Most of the waiters know what you're there for anyway, so they are used to the majority of their dinner guests coming for prime rib only.  For late night eats, they also offer a $4.99 7 oz. Top Sirloin and Eggs which is available daily from 11 pm to 6 am.Great upscale lounge Downtown that boasts a modern decor and feel. Located in walking distance from El Cortez parking garage in the heart of Downtown. We were pleasantly surprised by this venue that marked the start of our Project Dinner Table experience with a cocktail hour hosted here. We enjoyed handcrafted signature drinks and exquisite appetizers while mingling with other fellow foodies and playing corn hole along with other games like shuffle board, large Connect Four, extra large Jenga etc. Ample seating is everywhere that also features a large bed for lounging or taking silly pictures and cushy love sacs in the middle of the room. This place is like the dream adult version of your favorite after school hangout if you were a kid in the 80's. We would have never known of this ultra cool hangout if it weren't for Project Dinner Table. Downtown is all a buzz right now and this gem is a place you must try out when in the area.
Cave Creek Smokehouse============= WORST RESTAURANT ENCOUNTER TO DATE ============10/31/13 - To be brutally honest It's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever. Mine happened tonight. I've had a lot of bad experiences in restaurants but this one experience tops them all. in fact none of my previous bad experiences even compare to what I'm going to tell you now and that is out of all the 64 restaurants I have visited and reviewed so far. This being said I drove a little more than a half hour to Cave Creek with my wife Carol, Grandson Michael, my sister Mindy her husband Jon and his brother Howard to get here. Our waiter Matt took a while to take our drink orders then once he delivered them to our table and then took our dinner order. He wasn't seen or heard of again for at least 24 minutes. We didn't realize this at first because we were all talking. Two people in our party wanted beef ribs but they were told there was none. Our order was as follows: 2 filet mignon (medium) 2 rib eye steaks (medium) 2 pork ribs and 1 corn bread. Once our food came out things went down hill from there. First off our waiter Matt couldn't tell the difference between a filet mignon and a rib eye steak so he placed the wrong entrees in front of the wrong people. One rib eye went to my sister it was more on the well done side than medium but she ate it and said it was delicious. The other rib eye went to my grandson. He asked before he ordered it he asked if it was fatty and the waiter told him no. Well it was in fact half it wasn't edible because there was that much fat on it. Then my grandson asked 5 times for A-1 sauce and was ignored. He finally stood up  as Matt was walking by and said he wanted to talk to him and was told to sit down and just relax for a while. My grandson replied he just wanted some A-1 Sauce before what was left of his meal got cold. My sister got up and went to the bar and asked for some A-1 sauce the bar tender handed her an empty bottle of A-1 sauce.  Mean time two people who ordered the filet mignon, me being one of them cut into our filet. Both were well done. I sent mine back but Howard didn't because he had to get on the road because he was going to Rocky Point. We asked to see the manager who came to our table dressed as a hippy wearing marijuana leaf glasses. She didn't introduce herself or remove her marijuana glasses as she spoke.. We explained to her our filets were well done and the problems we encountered and she offered to get me another one. When my filet came back the potato was so cold the butter wouldn't melt and the steak came back well done again.Meanwhile the two people who ordered the pork ribs received their meals. Both pork rib dinner were lukewarm, the broccoli that came with them was cold and the potatoes were warm. My wife opt'd not to eat her meal because she like her food hot. So once again we called the manager to our table who was in a defensive mode, crossing her arms as she spoke. We also told her how the bartender refused to serve my grandson (22) another beer stating he already had two drinks within a half hour. I never heard of this before so we told her he isn't driving but she still said no. We told all this to the manager who ended up giving us a comp on one steak dinner and an additional 15% off our bill which ended up being $135.00 after every thing she did. They even added a 16% tip to the bill.  FOOD: Food Is terrible. Very disappointed.  SERVICE: Worst service I have experience so far. PRICE: The price was in line with other BBQ touristy restaurants / steakhouses.  I would say they were even on the high side. AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!!  This place  is a joke. If you want to go eat at a restaurant where they couldn't care less, then try it out for yourself. RETURN FACTOR 0%. Bottom line don't waste your money.************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
Smokey Mountain BBQ=I love BBQ and I'm always looking for a new BBQ joint to try.  Thanks to @keith I found this place.  I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was shocked that the place was dead.  Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.I decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.After a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.I went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.Next up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!I had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.Overall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.Will I return?  Hell yeah!  I want to try the Ribs next time and there are two interesting pseudo-BBQ Sandwiches that I want to try.
Bistro Japonais Furusato=Furusato is simple, well-done, authentic Japanese food (which is what my Japanese language school told me as well about this place). Don't expect any fancy presentation √† la "Jun I" or other high end Japanese restaurants, but expect quality ingredients full of flavor, prepared expertly. The beef teriyaki, as pedestrian as it sounds, is superb - just the right balance between sweet and savory, full of beefy goodness, and perfectly cooked - Japanese comfort food really, and the teriyaki sauce is definitely not from a jar. The Japanese salad with seaweed and octopus is a great small dish to start with, and the Yuzu mixed with rice vinegar and soy sauce was a fantastic dressing I was even tempted to drink (thank god I had plenty of sake instead). The Yellowfin collar was perfectly cooked and something you won't find elsewhere. We also had eggplant in a nice tangy broth, and an array of some of the best sushi I've had in Montreal, included the tuna hand roll, and the melt in your mouth unagi and ikura. The service is efficient and very friendly, and this more than makes up for the slightly depressing, dilapidated interior. They should move the dish washing station away from the sushi bar, move the fridge to the kitchen, and have the sushi bar be more of a centerpiece. Still, other than Kazu (which reigns supreme), this is the best place for authentic Japanese I've found in Montreal. Itadakimasu - bon appetit!Not being a big fan of dynamite rolls with tempura flakes, I was looking to find a restaurant that serves fresh fish and authentic Japanese dishes and here we are!I love the place; nothing fancy, very ordinary but clean, small but cute and cozy. The fish is extremely fresh you can taste them even sweet (no fish odor at all). Katsudon was very tasty also, will definetely return to try more.
JaiHo Restaurant=I just had to be an Indian foodie today.  Lunch buffet at India Palace, now dinner at Jai Ho.-Chicken corn soup:  Was very creamy and flavorful.  The sweetness of the corn paired with chunks of chicken made this bowl of soup so good.  Because we like it a  bit hot, we asked for some soy sauce and hot sauce.  This took the soup to a whole different level. -Goat Karahi:  yep yep, love my goat.  The first bite I had, it was a bit tough.  I was a  bit disappointed.  But nope, I didn't stop there, I can't give up on it yet.  I took another bite, it was more tender.  So what did I do...I was on a hunt for the more tender pieces in the pot.  I wish they were ALL tender.  It's ok.  I might not order this again though.-Chicken Tikka:  I am used to more flavorful chicken tikka (I am from Houston where there are many indo-pak restaurants...)-Keema Naan:  It was decent-Garlic Naan:  lots of garlic on this naan.  Very good.-Kulfi Faluda:  I have been on a hunt for a Faluda ever since I came to Las Vegas.  This has been the only place that have something similar.  The icecream that was given to me was the pistachio icecream (hence the kulfi in the name).  I am used to the vanilla icecream.  It changes the flavor by alot.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but just not as good as I remembered it.The server actually gave us a free order of chicken boti because he did not mention to us that the chicken tikka may take 25 mins since they made to order.  This free order was actually my favorite.  The chicken was nice and tender.  I place this on a garlic naan, some onion, a squeeze of lime, then dunk this bad boy in the tamarind chutney sauce and WALLA!  Made my night!Service: 5 stars!Food: super close to 4 stars!Results:  Definitely recommend and I will come back Fo SHo!
Nacho Libre=Nacho Libre's sexist and scary jokes on their signage and social media lose me as a customer for sure. http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/toula-foscolos/sexist-jokes-women_b_4815632.html?utm_hp_ref=tw
Athena Greek Cuisine=I should've known better when I entered Athena and it was hotter inside than outside. Yet I was craving some gyros and hummus and had heard good things about this place. I should've walked out when the host grabbed the last few crayons from the bowl for my son and the bowl was lovingly garnished with dead fly bodies. Man I'm an idiot.I should've gotten up from the table when after five minutes we were completely ignored by several servers waiting for a glass of water, but I thoroughly enjoyed not only the company that I was with, but also the dozen or so extra diners that joined us by landing on our napkins, forks and faces. I should've sent back the dip platter that was finally delivered thirty minutes after ordering. Especially because I find warm tsatsiki gross, hummus that separated into an unrecognizable film probably sometime the day before and the feta dip thoughtfully studded with wilted olives. But I digress, at least my son's fries were accompanied by ketchup so wonderful and distinct it had broken into a clear layer of oil and another layer of powdery grit, but that's probably just because it sits out in the kitchen for several hours to fully mature.I should've asked for the manager and demanded my check to be waived, but I didn't, I just didn't. I should've gone to Arby's.
Simplee Sushi=I've been here twice since it was renamed.  One time it was a five star experience, and the next it was more like three.  Interesting, since I ordered the same thing (teriyaki beef and tempura bento) both times!The first time, the beef in the bento ranked in the best beef anything I'd ever had.  The flavors were so savory and delicious, they blew my mind.  But the last time, it was clear that either the chef was having an off day, or that it was made by a different person entirely.  It tasted charred and strange.  While it wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't great.That said, their sushi was pretty good both times, same with the tempura.  The miso, though, demands special notice.  Both times I swooned.  It's savory and delicious, a tad salty, with fresh seaweed and scallion bits.  Usually miso has a bit of bonito powder in it, but no fishiness was detected here.  In that sense, it might not be as traditionally Japanese, but I don't care.  I can't stand fishy miso, and I love (love) their version.  Enough to go again.The service is good, the atmosphere is cute, and the prices are, well, maybe a tad high.  The waitress helpfully handed us a Clipper Magazine with a buy one entree, get one half price coupon on the back.  But  that was on our way out.  The full price of my gigantic, splittable bento was 20 dollars before tax and tip.  This place can do some damage if you're hungry.
The Edinburgh Larder=Stopped in for lunch after landing in Edinburgh. All their menu items use locally sourced ingredients from all over Scotland. I ordered the Ramsey's ham and mustard sandwich with 2 side salads. The salads were fresh and tasty, but very small. The sandwich was disappointing. Literally a slice of ham, lettuce and dijon mustard on wheat bread. Approximately ¬£8.5 ($14.20), it was incredibly expensive. Had I stopped eating at this point, the place would have warranted 3-stars. Tops. However, I made the decision to order a tea and a scone with clotted cream and housemade strawberry jam. BEST DECISION EVER. The scone was slightly crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside. It went wonderfully with their clotted cream, AMAZING jam and a cup of tea. Overall, a decent place to grab lunch if you live in the UK. Tourists with horrid exchange rates find food elsewhere. However, if you choose to dine at Edinburgh Larder, save room for their scone and tea. It's wonderful!
Waffles Cafe=This waffle joint is a half mile from Aliante Casino.  When my relatives start hitting the slots, they say I'm bad luck if I watch, so they tell me to scram."We'll be here a half hour, see you then..."  They say they kinda feel sorry for me, but they get over it, and so do I.  Why?  It gives me an excuse to head to Waffles Cafe. Carbs rarely ever taste this good.  I love waffles, and this waffle by itself is near perfect -  light, slightly sweet, tender, and slightly crispy all at the same time.  When it comes out warm, no matter what it's topped with, it's heavenly.  This time, I opted for the peaches and strawberries.  The peaches were sliced canned cling peaches, which I like, but I loved the sliced fresh strawberries with a dollop of whipped cream in the middle.  I decided to get it to go and eat it in the parking lot of the casino, well aware the Casino videotapes the parking lots.  All I can say to the security staff watching my one tape, "Get your own!" The aromatic, juicy berrie slices were naturally sweet with the waffle, the peaches were a good contrast visually, in taste, and texture. The variety of waffles is fantastic, you can order one of their pre made concoctions, or create your own.  There is nutella, pumpkin, pecan, apples, blueberries, and so many others.  They have a great $5.49 breakfast waffle special with egg, bacon or sausage, and can add hash browns for a price. Of course, waffle sandwhiches are popular, too. They had some bobas and teas.  But I had their Columbian coffee to go, it was decent, though I prefer my coffees bolder (i.e. French Roast) but it was a great accompaniement to my sweet dessert.  All told, it was about $8.  Definitely, I'll come back again.  My relatives didn't win this time, but in a half hour, I was far happier and my wallet was heavier than theirs.
That's a Wrap=Thada boy That's a Wrap...you opened yet another tasty location that's perfect for a quick lunchtime bite! While in the middle of meeting mania today, I entered into the lunch hour on the road and in Phoenix. I knew I wanted a sandwich and I'd been itching to check out the new That's A Wrap location. My experience was top notch! I parked right in front, entered the quaint little shop, ordered, got a seat, got my food, ate it and went on my merry little way within a half hour. The service was quick and friendly. They have an open kitchen so you can see your creation getting made and they have desserts tempting you as you order. I went with the Fiesta wrap which was onions, green peppers, avocado, pico and chicken. Delicious! It's the perfect blend of Mexican food in a sandwich and it's a light lunchtime option. It filled me up without stuffing me. The shop is cute and quaint but has enough seats to accompany a decent size crowd. If the weather wasn't so cold today, I would have opted to sit on the patio in the front All are good options. This is a great treat for lunch and it gets you in and out in a timely manner. And that's a wrap for me!I fell in food love at the original That's a Wrap location, and I fell once again at the new location today... I'm a huge fan of the casual atmosphere, modest prices, and of course the wraps, sides, and salads at this place.I went for lunch today and had the Greek Salad and black bean soup as my side.  One friend had the albacore tuna on a wheat wrap with a side of fruit and another had one of the specialty wraps with a side of pasta salad.  We were all pleased with our food.The only negative is that I don't think this place has air conditioning, so I hope they get some fans or install a/c before the temperatures rise.  Regardless, I'll be back, even just for carry-out or to check out their "wrappy hour."
Wildflower Bread Company=I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done. First, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location. Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds. So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service. Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!Wildflower Bread Company has grown on me through the years... What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it's quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.  Due to this convenient WBC location, I've been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!  Lately I've been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.  I'm currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  I'm also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.  While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table.  I'm sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.I learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more "private dining" for groups.  I may just have to look into that in the future.  Keep up the good work, WBC - I'm sure I'll see you again soon.This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize. It's worth reading. Please share.After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen.  He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong. By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture. A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation.Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review.I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate. The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing.The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more.On the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply....great. This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly. Last time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off-morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent.I am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot.Louis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people.When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit.
Swish=The Skinny: the switch to new management has really hurt this place, that includes the rather poor details in the food (2) service: I'm not sure what was worse, our absent-minded waiter or the rather brusque attitude of the waitress (1) this place really went off the deep end on service and food within a year (2).It may be a surprise but shabu shabu and sukiyaki isn't rocket science. But the lack of attention to essential details makes this place on my no-go list.Enticed by a Groupon Now! deal, the hubs and I headed to Swish for dinner. When we stepped in, we put in a drink order. And waited. And waited. Essentially we entered into the building at 8:05 and didn't get to put in our order until close to 8:30pm and that's only because we flagged him down.I guess that is the running motif around Swish. If you want to get service, you not only have to signal for service but you have to ask for everything. When I mean everything, I mean things like plates.But how could the food be possibly bad here, you may ask? Isn't it just veggies and raw meat that you cook in a pot yourself?Even though the food is simple enough, it can be disasterous if not prepared appropriately. Take for example my order of Chicken Fiesta ($12.95 healthy portion) sukiyaki style which came with one small plate of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. The chicken, was carelessly cut into various shapes and sizes - some as large as a 1 inch x 0.5 inch x 1 inch cube. The uneven size makes the cooking time highly variable and uneven. Plus trying to cook really thick pieces of chicken in a little iron skillet with minimal liquid takes forever. Added to the fact you don't want to cross contaminate the raw chicken with the other food, it ended up taking a long time before I could eat.The haphazard plate of vegetables were also cut unevenly (some were really large pieces of napa cabbage and carrots which were hard to eat) which also exacerbated the above stated issues. The vegetables itself were okay, but I was a little irritated by the fact they put less than 15 leaves of spinach on a plate to make it look full. (For those in the know, that amount of spinach cooks down to less than a mouthful.) It's a total turn off because they charge another $3.95 for a miniscule plate of poorly cut vegetables.My hubby ordered the hungry sized Kobe Chuck ($20.95) portion. Although his meat cooked better than my stuff because it was thinly sliced, the accompanying dipping sauces were horrible. The sesame sauce was musty, weird, and watery. Tasting like swamp water and looking like the crappacino they serve on Fear Factor, it was a horrific combination. The ponzu was okay but nothing you can't get out of a bottle from the supermarket.To cap off this experience, the servers at the restaurant were poor. Our waiter, who was nice, appeared to be very absent-minded. He'd frequently forget to start the cooking pots, plates for food, cooking utensils, etc. Running the cheque took way longer than it ought to. The waitress on the other hand was more on the ball but had a poorer attitude towards the patrons (ie, sounding exasperated because someone didn't know what the meat choices were, grilling me on why I wanted a second set of chopsticks - because it handled raw chicken and we had no cooking utensils... that's why!... to name a few examples.)One might argue the joint was busy. However I'd like to say something about that. I normally don't make comparisons but I just have to in this case. Shabu Shabu Paradise (Henderson) not only has one waiter in the whole joint but she handles the same number of customers all on her own. And, the service is way better than what we received here. Plus she has to deal with refilling unlimited plates of correctly cut vegetables, bowls of salad, condiments and rice.Although the food was edible, the service and the improperly prepared dishes really ruined this place for me. Plus, the rather lackluster portion sizes given the price of the meal is also a big turn off. Even though our other favourite shabu/sukiyaki place is 30 minutes away, I'd rather go there than suffer through another round of Swish. (2 starred review).
Nobles Cafe Bar & Venue=What's up Doc? A rabbit burger on the brunch menu, that's what. I've never seen a rabbit burger on any menu, anywhere. So when a group of Yelpers rocked up here for our monthly brunch, I was already excited about trying the famous Nobles Benedict - eggs benny on black pudding. So when my eye first of all noticed the duck sandwich, I was excited. And then the RABBIT BURGER. Oh lordy.I went for the rabbit burger (without the bun, as I'm wheat free) with a portobello mushroom and gruyere cheese on top, fries on the side. It was a great portion, and filled me from breakfast, lunch and some of dinner. The other dishes around me seemed very hefty too - the full breakfast were impressive, the Eggs Nobles on black pudding swiftly demolished by Joe A, and Susan M was very proud of her clean plate that had contained eggs with smoked salmon. Everyone, except those who ordered pancakes, were really happy with their brunch. Now I can see why it's so famous in Edinburgh.The bar itself is beautiful. Not one most folk will walk by, given it's out-of-the-way location on Constitution Street, heading into Leith. But through the small doors you'll find a big, open, airy space that is constrasted with the dark wood, and then some stained glass windows. The only thing I found amusingly awkward was that getting into the ladies toilets are difficult as the space between the two doors is tiny. But that amused rather than frustrated me.I really liked everything about Nobles. It was busy, almost full, of Sunday brunchers in the morning and afternoon. They host a weekly open-mic night on Wednesday's with The Black Diamond Express' Toby Mottershead - I'm a fan, so will probably come and check that out soon.The staff were very, very helpful, lovely and friendly, and really were the cherry on the cake of this lovely Yelp brunchy munchy out.
Uncle Bear's Grill & Bar=The Shops at Pecos Ranch have been empty since I moved just down the street a year ago.  Finally a couple of months ago we started seeing signs of life!  When I first saw the logo for Uncle Bears I thought is was a store for dogs.  Don't laugh....look at the logo....does that say sports bar to you?  But I was pleasantly suprised when I checked their website and checked out the menu.  I had the opportunity to check it out on a recent evening when my daughter was on vacation with my sister.  When I'm on my own I like to sit at the bar and this bar is awesome.  It's a nice long bar with pleanty of room and three giant flat screens.  And there are screens all over the restaurant.  There is a beautiful patio and the bar also opens up to the patio.  Nice!  The bartenders were friendly and attentive and they have lots of nice beers on tap.  All I care about is that they have Guniess and they know how to pour a good one.  They do.I had some nachos which were good.  We will be coming back since I know it's family friendly and my daughter will love the dog theme.  I hope they will keep up the good work and become one of our "go to" places for a decent bite to eat.
Crab Corner=I am may be picky but I can tear apart a blue crab like nobody's business. I consider myself an expert in this area as I grew up around the Baltimore, MD area - home of the Blue Crab if you ask anyone who knows anything about how to get it done.I told one of the owners, John, that wouldn't it just figure that 3 weeks before I am leaving Las Vegas....I would find Blue Crabs after 20 years. I actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here. I am not even kidding - but then John offered to ship the crabs to D.I.A. for me and I decided to stick to my plan to move to Denver.But I digress (as usual)....this place is LEGIT. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT if you ask me. I went with my dad, who is in town from the MD area, I knew that he would be the one to experience Crab Corner with me. We already knew that we were set on splitting an order of #2 males. But what else to get....BOARDWALK FRIES? Stop it right now. As I bit into the fry, I was immediately taken back to Ocean City, MD. And then the crabs came that were SO fresh and prepared perfectly with Old Bay sprinkled all over their bodies. H-E-A-V-E-N.And then I just read below that Utz Potato Chips are on the way. All I can say about that is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I already have 2 dates set to go back and visit the Crab Corner before my departure from Vegas on January 8 and you better believe that every time I come into town to visit, this will be on my list of Top Stops. Thank you, Crab Corner, for bringing a little piece of my hometown to my homeplace, Las Vegas.I was very excited when Lisa L. chose this as the location for our double date on Saturday. I have had it book marked for nearly a year now, so I was thrilled to have an excuse to try it with friends! I can honestly say it lived up to my expectations in every way - if you are a blue crab lover, you must try it!My husband's family has a house on the water near Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. My husband grew up eating crabs from Maryland, and I got to experience to go crabbing with their property last summer. Watching the little crabs squirm around while being steamed to death isn't really a fond memory, but the taste of those fresh crabs is something I will never forget!!Eating at Crab Corner really replicated the Maryland crab-eating experience for me. The crabs were very fresh, and they were prepared the same way as they are in Maryland. I really love that they used an Old-Bay-like seasoning, and didn't go the douse everything in freaking HEAT route that way too many places seem to go. I love tasting the seafood so it kills me when places like Hot and Juicy ruin a perfectly good crustacean with mouth burning spice! The other awesome thing? When you leave here your clothes, hair, and skin won't REEK of garlic for days! I didn't need to take a bath after eating here, so that really rocked! The special price of $35 for a dozen was more than fair, and the beer prices were reasonable as well. There were several enticing sides priced at $1.95 as well! MMMM sweet potato tots....Whether you are from the East Coast or just a fan of all things crab, don't screw up like I did and wait a year to try this place! I will definitely be back now that I know how fabulous this place is!You need to know right now that my Wife grew up on the Atlantic Ocean very near the Chesapeake Bay. Her family were all Watermen. They fished and raked both clams and oysters. Just what do you think she ate every day of her life? Right, seafood. Ok, me too.Crab Corner food is what I remember from my Maryland and Virginia peninsula days. It is absolutely authentically prepared each day with 'flown in overnight" fresh seafood.Our meal last night (Monday) :Appetizer  -  Calamari.     Fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating. This offering is cooked quickly. The crispy coating is light, brown and in place. The squid inside is hot, tender and clean tasting. Remember, if you cook squid over a minute you get rubber, These folks know how to do it.Soup:   -   Cream of Crab.     Hot, creamy succulent, and filled with blue crab meat. This is something Libby's Grandma would make.Entree   -   Crab Cake Platter.     Let's start with the fact that these huge cakes are nothing but blue crab. There are NO FILLERS. They use a very light bit of coating and then broil them. Nothing but taste here. Excellent menu item. Comes with two cakes and two sides.Entree   -   Soft - Shell Crab Platter.     The best you can get. They have a number of sizes. the three we had were called Chesapeake Bay, MD "Prime Size". Crunchy, sweet and juicy. Very "home style Maryland".Sides   -   Don't bother to fool with the regular old frozen fried. Pay the extra $1.00 for the wonderful Boardwalk Fries. These are hand cut and fried in peanut oil with a hint of crab spices. Then you make them swim in some great malt vinegar. Just like on the Boardwalk in Ocean City Maryland. I can almost smell the salt are as I eat them.Mimi's Potato Salad is the home made style that is uses by Mom's and Grandma's all around the Chesapeake Bay. Seriously flavorful, rich, and creamy. The Cole slaw is creamy and filled with that course slaw you want. The texture and flavor is right there.Drinks   -   Iced Tea was fresh made, cold, and clean tasting. A fine thirst quencher.We had no room for desert. I think for my next trip in I will start my meal with a Baltimore Shaved Ice "Snowball" with about a dozen flavors to choose from. My Wife did manage to get out the door with two packs of Tasty Cakes. (that's a comfort food from MD)The menu is extensive. It is going to take us a while to try everything. You see above what we had on this first trip in. Go on line (CrabornerLV.com) and take a look at their menu. It is extensive. Their claim to fame is the "flown in daily" Maryland Blue Crabs. They are steamed with Crab Blend Seasoning and the dumped on your table. You just use your mallet and pick to bring that sweet crab meat right on to your taste buds.My next meal is going to be fresh single fried oysters and a bunch of steamed hard shell blue crabs.For the quality, quantity, cooking, and freshness of what you get at the Crab Corner the cost is very reasonable.You want a great east coast seafood meal? This is the place to be.It is incumbent upon Rex to apologize for his long absence...let's say that Rex was training for the Olympics and now that is over he can get back to writing reviews...his true passion. (That is a much nicer story than coming to the realization too late that apparently old folks homes don't want to see Rex's erotic version of Winnie the Poo...especially the poo part...and that it took 4 arrests and 5 stints in county before he realized this absolute truth...yes...olympics is nicer.) In between...um...workouts for the Olympics...Rex aways would crave seafood. Let's just say where Rex was...um...working out...they didn't have access to the freshest seafood...damn jail...Rex means London...whatever.The powerful pull of amazing seafood is one that Rex is often subject to...but in Las Vegas Nevada there is a very low...VERY LOW chance of being able to find that great seafood. Even at the classiest restaurants their dumpsters are filled with leftover subpar seafood. Also, in these recessionary times Rex...like all of us...is ever conscious about finances...when he makes his own roofies...he uses immitation Mentos...that is how broke Rexy is right now...but that is another story.  So, where does a budget conscious foodie who is desperate to get that sweet meat from the sea...(ironically Sea Sweet Meat was Rex's nickname in the Navy)...well...Rex has found the best possible place. A place that isn't just good for Vegas...which many places could be labeled...no...this is GREAT for anywhere. Where is it...Crab Corner. Even the words are great...Crab (not crabS...that isn't good)...and Corner...which we can all agree is better than a square. First and foremost before we get to the menu...which is all brilliant...one thing must be said...ALL OF THE SEAFOOD IS FLOWN IN FRESH EVERY DAY!!!!! Really read that and understand what it means. FRESH EVERY DAY!!  Not this frozen crap that is sold in stores...that isn't seafood...that is a waste of money. Since Rex has spent his time in the east coast...he knows great seafood...and you CANNOT FREEZE SEAFOOD AND THINK IT IS GOOD!! The fact that these two brothers (great guys, they don't even mind when Rex licks their dumpster) would go to this extent to provide great ingredients is a testament to their commitment. At this point it would be almost impossible to screw up and they dont.Let's start with the greatest dish they have and the FINEST bowl of soup in town...the lobster bisque. Proof in one bowl there is a God. There are no fillers, it isn't some cream filled monstrosity with some frozen crab thrown in it. NO!  This is the real deal. The depth of flavor they get is just out of this world. No life can be complete and NOT eat a bowl of this soup. Rex wants his ashes to be thrown in the soup and then served to unsuspecting customers...that is how good the soup is and how bad Rex is.The rest...is all great. The crabs are obviously amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. The jewel of Rex's heart is the FRESH, hand battered oysters. Salty, briney, sweet, perfectly battered. Just amazing. Rex could go on and on but there is nothing bad.  If there is one minor complaint, to nitpick, their cole slaw is uninspired, the sweet potato fries are sometimes too soggy and one of Rex's lobster tail was extremely overcooked to the point of rubbery. Sometimes the attention to detail in the more delicate culinary pursuits are just not done as well as they should be. Still, on the whole this is the BEST seafood restaurant in town and it won't break your bank.As the great Rex Marvin says..."does it smell like fish....then give her to Rex!"  Enjoy!One of the best compliments you can give a restaurant is to say that it reminds you of home -- provided, of course, that you have fond memories of home. Crab Corner is that kind of place. I spent the first thirty-plus years living in both Virginia and Maryland, where it was routine to buy bushels of crabs on the weekends or go boating and crabbing with my father. Being the lazy person that I am, I opted for the crab cake platter instead of the steamed blue crabs. The platter ($25.95 for 2 crab cakes) came with two sides. I upgraded to a cup of Maryland crab soup (an additional $1.50). It's served with half of an in-shell crab. The second side dish was an order of hush puppies -- some of the tastiest ones you'll find in town.The crab cakes were excellent. They had all the marks of a good crab cake -- very little filler and loosely formed with plenty of lump and jumbo lump meat that falls apart with little effort; enough seasoning to enhance the flavor but not too much as to mask the sweetness of the meat. They're the best crab cakes I've had in Vegas, by far.They do have a kid's menu that consists of chicken tenders ($5.95) or popcorn shrimp ($6.95). Both come with fries and a drink.The place is owned by two brothers from Maryland who also own and operate Nevada Seafood Wholesalers, which supplies much of this town's seafood for restaurants and markets like Seafood City. And with those imports comes a slice of nostalgia for any east coaster used to eating fresh seafood.This place has been on my radar for a while, I finally made it over!  We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!The decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. So as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking I luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram/tutorial to help you crack them!  They have a Yelp Check in offer good on regular priced orders and beer and wine.  I will be back! :DNever had blue crabs before...Read the reviews, and decided this would be a good place to try them out!$3 Thursdays....the crabs as well as all the beers they sell for $3.  Can't go wrong price wise!  So how does the food fare?The crabs were very good.  A bit of work to get to the goods, but worth it IMO.  I tried the brains/stomach, and it didn't do anything for me....gave them to my friend.  But I did enjoy the leg joints and claw meat.  And for $3 each, solid choice!Also, the jumbo shrimp/prawns (head on) are very very good!  First of all, their "pound" seems a lot more generous than other quick seafood places I have tried.  Obviously it should be the same, but maybe it is because they are larger and you get more meat than shells.  The seasoning is the winner here...very very good and not super salty and overly done like some places in comparison!  You have to try them!  The crab dip and crab cakes were also good, but I felt like they were a little spendy for what I got.  Although they were good, I will probably put that money towards more shrimp and blue crabs truthfully.Tip, the blue crabs are cooked to order, so if you plan on ordering a few at a time, plan it out so you aren't sitting without in between sessions.  I think they took appx 15min between orders, so plan accordingly!This will be a regular spot for us!Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.10 dollars to smell.  Well, that's what they should charge.  Amazing for the sniffer.I got an order of Blue Crab, halved and cleaned, in garlic butter.  $11.99/lb....eeeee owww.  Served with rice.  Awesome.It was gorged in butter, parsley, and Old Bay - it was delicious.  The problem is that with all the necessary work, the food turns cold after bite #3.The service, gents, were very nice and gregarious.  The ambiance turns a corner of a mini-mall into a pretty good Maryland-ish vibe.All in all, save yourself the work.  Go for crabcakes or a crab salad sandwich, and call it a day.I'm in this area of town for work for the week and bookmarked several places to grab lunch. Crab Corner was my #1 pick. Sadly, on Monday, I got out at 11AM for an hour lunch, only to find this place closed. Looked it up later and they don't open til 11:30AM for lunch. Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open. Highly suggest they open a smidge earlier, they're losing out on business.In any case, I managed to make it in and service was polite- placed a to go order for a crab cake sandwich, had a little bit of sticker shock at the $13 price tag that didn't even include fries or an add-on option for a discounted soup (as other menu items do). Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.Crab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed. Filling portion, though.Would come back for some fresh seafood or other menu items. Their website indicates that they have various discounts and promotions, and Tuesdays in particular they offer $2 male or female blue crabs and $2 beers, which I sadly could not take advantage of during work hours.Was feeling like seafood tonight so me and my girlfriend decided to try this seafood joint.  It close to where we live which is a plus.  It's literally on the corner.  Upon entering the restaurant it has a divey feel to it.  It's pretty small as well.  We let the guy know it was our first time there and the next thing they tell us is that they are out of Blue Crab.  I checked in to yelp after that and there was a special check in for Blue Crab. So I had crab cakes and calamari for appetizers.  They had oysters as the daily special for 1 dollar each.  I finished the meal off with king crab legs that were delicious.  The tab was around 80 bucks.  Normally when we spend that kind of money we are at a fancy restaurant.  Service was ok for a small restaurant.  Would I try it again....maybe....but when I or my lady spend that kind of money it's normally at a all you can eat seafood buffet.I've had a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place for nearly year and just now finally got around to using it. I wasn't too excited going in. I've been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.It's a small and unassuming restaurant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.We were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.The menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.After ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)We opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it's called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have "regular" up to "jumbo"), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.The soup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).We will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?
Locanda de Gusti=*swoon* Era squisito! From the olives and bottle of red waiting for me on arrival to the complimentary shot of limoncello on departure, Locanda de Gusti delivered, and then delivered again and again, all I hold most dear in the world of fine food.I have had a longing to go to Italy for over a year now. The cities, the culture, the history, the sunshine, the coast, the wine. And the food. Oh the food. Italian food and me should really get a room. And Locanda de Gusti, as Mike S has already said, serve up real Italian food which was only confirmed by the waiter we were chatting with. The head chef and 'boss' is from Naples and the food, served in Naples portions, was as authentic as you can get. Scan the menu and you'll see no pizza. And limited pasta options only as starters / middle courses. As it turns out, in Naples pizza is more like a biscuit rather than the large pizzas we get here. I have now added Naples to my Italy-trip list to try these types of pizzas.The menu was largely made of meat dishes. Anyone who knows me can imagine the glazed look of sheer joy at this fact. I eat meat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and between-meal snacks. So it was only obvious that the boy and I were each going to choose from the specials menu the two main meat platters. He opted for the red meat, and I the fish.The red meat platter served up a sirloin steak, lamb chop, pork loin, spicy sausage and some chicken. The fish platter proffered sea bass, tuna steak, swordfish steak, a scallop, and two langoustine king prawns. Both served with some fresh vegetables, roast potatoes and salad. (See uploaded photos).Words cannot do it all justice. From the cured meat starter, the melt-in-your-mouth mozarella, the rare cooked tuna (the first time I've had it served properly rare in Edinburgh), the charcoal-grilled flavour to the fish, the giant langoustine prawns, the very generous servings (we are told this is the Naples-way), to the so-sweet and delicious balsamic vinegar on the salad. I must have eaten about 2 1/2 whole servings of fish. After a giant platter of cured meats to start. And yet I didn't leave with the dreaded 'food baby' that some Italian meals can give when they serve up an unhumanly large amount of pasta slathered in creamy sauce. Now I know how Italian woman stay so svelte and stunning. Because they don't eat British-Italian. They eat real Italian.And oh that berry liqueor I had as a digestif was just divine. It smelled of herbs, wonderful herbs, and tasted of berries and was just all good things in a dark, sweet liquid.Can you tell that I'm a little bit in love with this place? Tucked away at the very bottom of Broughton Street, on the corner, it had avoided the tourist-crush of the Festivals which was pleasant but I also hope that they do get enough customers through the door. Locanda de Gusti is far too good to go unnoticed, so at once I want to tell everyone about it, but keep it as my little secret.So go, eat real Italian food, mop up oil and vinegar with your bread, order the tiramisu (I was too full to, but am told it is excellent), enjoy the limoncello and toast Salute!
Blue Burrito Grille=First visit yesterday- I ordered a burrito.  Whole wheat wrap, no lard black beans, steak asada, shredded cheese mix, lettuce, jalape√±o slices, and sour cream.  $8 and change. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2#ejrnr7b_7ryVNTisxMGpvQ  Tiny wrap, since I had omitted many fillings, but delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2?select=NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ#NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ  I'd like to return, but $8+ is a little pricey.  I'll have to make sure not to be/become hungry while at the mall...
Patisserie Manon=I had this bookmarked since I saw Nelsons review, but until I saw people saying there are French macarons, good French macarons, I about suggest this place to the BF every chance I get. We finally made it a bit before closing so there was a lot sold out, but we managed to get a few of the "must try" on my list from stalking the pictures and reviews. French macarons are a big deal to me since they're my favorite confection. These are smaller and sloppier made than I'm used to but it's the taste that matter. The flavors are decent, but this was not quite there on the texture...I think the size is partly the reason. We both bought 2 of ginger, pistachio, cherry, peanut butter since it's too small to share.This is a hard thing to perfect so even though I'm a bit disappointed, it's not gonna effect me coming back. I'm happy to finally have a neighborhood bakery. I just will go to Bouchon or have my macarons shipped from Los Angeles. The BFs mom is obsessed with finding pastries/croissants with almond paste. Nothing has fit what she's looking for which I think she's looking for a marizpan consistency with a strong almond taste. None the less, we bought a slice of pithivier and a almond croissant for her to try. They were too eggy and not enough almond which I was expecting to happen so they were then for me. The pithivier was good specially when eaten warm. The almond croissant is the star. It was almond and chocolate which at first I was disappointed since I haven't ever liked chocolate croissants, but then I took a bite. Then I just wanted to shove the whole croissant in my mouth since it was delicious and addicting. Nice croissant texture, the right kind and amount of chocolate to compliment the almond. We got the BFs grandma a puff pastry with berry in it and she disappeared off with it so she must've been very happy if she didn't share.I also got a plain croissant to make a sandwich at home.  It's crunchy and flaky outside and then the inside was just soft, buttery. Based on that, the pithivier and the almond croissant that they really know how to achieve the proper flake. A almond shell with what I was told was hazelnut cream caught my fancy. It was good buttery cream but it was not hazelnut....more like sweet cream. I liked it- definitely better than a cream puff. Petit Four was the BFs pick and it was like a black forest cake sans cherries. It was really goof cake texture and moist and the right amount of chocolate and liquor flavor. The prices are reasonable for what they are. We spent about $25 for all of it. The almond shell w/ cream being the most expensive treat at $4.50, $1 macarons, $2ish for the croissants, pithivier and petit four.Will be back very soon to try the savory side and come early so we can sample of the bread!First of all, I have to say thank you to Lisa L. for her review of Patisserie Manon -- in particular, her mentioning that this place is in the complex behind Roy's. That saved me time and probably quite a few trips up and down Charleston to find this gem of a shop.When you walk in you'll probably be sucked in by their display of sweet treats. Yeah, they all look delicious. But once you get past that, you'll see a counter and display of some of their savory options. I opted for a simple ham and swiss on a baguette (about 7 bucks). It's made to order and is quite large -- at least a foot if not more. For the price and size, I think it's a good lunch time bargain. The only negative is that the bread was a little too hard for my tastes. Instead of it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it was just hard all around.On my way out I just couldn't resist the macarons ($1 each). My mind was saying no, but my stomach was saying, "hell yes!" I figured a little treat couldn't hurt so I got six of them (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, chocolate mint, blueberry, vanilla). All were delicious with a light and crunchy shell and soft, creamy center. But, the standouts were the pistachio and chocolate mint.I'll be back to try more of their savory dishes, but I'm sure I'll walk out with a few more macarons or pastries as well.My wife and I have been here 3x in the last month!  That NEVER happens.  This place automatically gets 5 stars for sucking us into their French culinary vortex filled with delicious quiche, croissants and pastries.Everything looks great here.  I swear we're looking at the choices for a solid ten minutes everytime as the lunch crowd continues to ask us "Umm..are you in line or just looking?".  Then we do the same thing for dessert.  The $8.95 lunch combo is great bang for your buck.  You get your choice of a soup (usually more than 5 choices), sandwich (baguette, croissant or panini) and drink.  The baguette sandwich is HUGE.  They cut it into quarters and could easily feed 2.  I'm still trying to perfect my ideal panini but prosciutto, swiss, onion and mustard did me fine.  My wife loves the quiche.  We've tried the four cheese, veggie and bacon and the mushroom.  To have one of these everyday would be amazing.We always try to save room for dessert and usually split a tart or some kind of cake.  Eclairs, black forest cake, assorted macarons, fruit tarts..I feel like I'm on a game show and need to make a choice asap.  But alas I shouldn't feel pressured! I will be back for more!!Are you French... no??  THEN SHUT UP!!!  Who remembers that??  Anyway, this has become a spot I love to go to lately.  I wish it was open a little more late though, I've been several times that it's been closed.  Having said that, this is a great choice for lunch.  Their lunch combos are cheap, delicious, portions are big.  I never had beef bourguinon until coming here.  And to be honest, I would never have ordered that unless I was with my friend, but by golly that beef was tender!!!Everyone that works here is so nice as well.  Staff is so polite, I love that.My one critique is that they can make their macarons look better.  With so many competitors around, they don't seem to have much attention to detail put into them.  But who am I to say?  I've never made a macaron in my life, I just eat them.A macarOn is not a macarOOn.  I learned the difference when I ventured over to this quaint French pastry shop in my neck of the woods.  Macarons are meringue-based cookies with buttercream filling; think a French Oreo, but they come in all flavors and colors. So many choices, but the pleasant young lady behind the counter helped me narrow down my selection.  I ended up leaving with the chocolate mint, lemon, chocolate, and pistachio--d√©licieux!  With bonafide French chefs creating these delectable works of art, Patisserie Manon also offers other treats like Black Forest cake, tarts, pain au chocolat, candies, croissants, breads, and more. I'll be back to try the bistro offerings--the quiche looks good!  √† bient√¥t!So they are not the sexiest macarons but what they lack in beauty they make up for in sheer macaron goodness!  The "cookies" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!True Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.Outstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).Great looking shop.  Friendly and passionate service.  If this small sampling is any indication, tout est bon!Meep Meep!!That was my first thought when I first walked into Patisserie Manon for their macarons.  I remember being out on the golf course in Palm Springs a few years back.  I remember seeing a bunch of mini-birds running across the fairway.  I asked my friend, what the heck is that?  He stated, those are what you call a Road Runner. Funny, that was my first time to ever see a Road Runner in real life and never expected them to be so small.  Yes, I was one of those that thought a Road Runner was the height of an ostrich.  I guess I watched too many cartoons as a child.  Now fast forward to my first macaron.  The only thing I ever knew about a macaron was what I've seen in pictures or what I've seen on Yelp.  I honestly expected a macaron to be the size of a burger slider.  You can now see why I thought of "Meep Meep" when I first walked into Patisserie Manon.  I didn't expect a macaron to be so small, like a Road Runner.Small, but huge on taste.  These little road runners tasted so good and I don't even have a sweet tooth. Tried their Orange, Lemon, Cherry, Blueberry, Cafe, Vanilla, and Caramel.  All were good and would have to say that Caramel had to be my favorite.  These little treats are served cold and if not kept cool, will begin to break apart.  Because they are bite size and so tasty, it was easy to finish the box.  Sorry Honey, Daddy still left you a few.  You snooze, you lose litte girl!!Service was great and the ambiance reminds me of a cafe.  But not like one of those fast paced cafes ala Starbucks, but one where you can kick it and enjoy your macaron.  The macarons have a certain bite or kick to them.  You will notice it a few seconds after your first gobble.  Their other desserts also looked good, but I didn't try them. Maybe on my next visit.  Thanks Yelpers...you guys got me here.  You guys helped me realize that I actually have a sweet tooth.  Now looking forward for my next Road Runner, I mean Macaron. And of course, I recommend.  Meep Meep!!These pastries are not to be trifled with, no comparison comes to mind.I've been to plenty of places, but amazing apple's hard to find.You can quote me, if you'd like.I'd suggest you take a hike,To Manon, a destination to unwind!Manon came highly suggested for a sampling of their $1.10 French macarons, of course I couldn't pass that up, especially since I was just a half mile away. I took a quick look through their displays and discovered they had some pastries with apple, and some filled with cr√®me, a few with raspberries, and chocolate too. If there is a dessert filled with Apple, you can rest assured I'm going to order it, and Manon had two. I chose to the French apple tart this time, I'll save the other for my next time through. It's not often that a pastry makes you blush, but this French apple tart sure did ;-)The macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise. Rest assured I'll be back for that one when I visit again. If you've not been to Manon yet, I would strongly urge you to check your reservations and come by for some of the best pastries I've ever had.Happy Yelping!French lesson of the day...did you know macarons are pronounced mah-kah-r≈çn and not like macaroons (the coconut chocolate chunks).  Of course the uneducated people selling the items won't say it correctly either and they may look at you like you are crazy if you do pronounce it properly...but deep down inside you can know you are right :)Onto the review, this place is macaron heaven!  They probably have 12-15 different flavors of macarons! (rose, mango, salted caramel, lemon, blueberry, orange, ginger, peanut butter, coffee, pistachio, mint chocolate, and the list goes on....)  Okay, are these bad boys as good as the ones from Bouchon.... that's a resounding no, but they are only $1.10 each.  They aren't the prettiest macarons I've seen since they seem to be put together haphazardly, but they are still delicious little morsels.  They have tons of other cakes/pastries/meringues to choose from as well.  I didn't get a chance to sample their food, but they seem to have a good selection of sandwiches and comfort French food.  I will definitely be back to try the food.Seriously. Top-notch quality macarons for $1.10 each? Patisserie Manon's macarons were definitely worth my visit here! While there are lots of other pastries, baked goods, and delectable looking cakes in the front of the store, my eyes were set on the colorful macarons behind the glass display that greets you the moment you walk into the store. These macarons are a little differently shaped than the ones I am used to (more flat and cookie like) - these are strange puffed up shells making them longer and less wide than I am  used to. The color of the shells also look a little artificial because they are so bright. BUT, they were amazing. I bought eight macarons, trying to test all the different flavors. Overall, I felt that the macarons had a really puffy texture upon first bite, but then became chewy afterwards, making the perfect combination of shell and filling to give you that great macaron enjoyment. My favorite flavors were: Rose - not too heavy. It contained the perfect flowery taste to delight my tastebuds. And the shells were pink and white! Salted Caramel - I loved the flavor of the caramel! Not too sticky, but had a good consistency that worked really well with the shells.I also really liked lemon and strawberry. They didn't taste extraordinary, but they had very good taste. The strawberry even had bits of real strawberry inside of the filling. Flavors that were a-ok: Ginger - Interesting flavor, but not my cup of tea. I love ginger candy, but I thought the taste was a little weird for a macaron. It was also really sticky. Mango - It was interesting, but a bit too artificial for my liking. Pistachio - I thought the pistachio had good almond flavor in the shell, and the filling was also decent. I'm not a big fan of pistachio macarons, but these were okay. Mocha - It wasn't too strong on the mocha taste, but I liked it. Not memorable, but something I would try again!When I was buying the macarons, they informed me that they had salted caramel and mango in the back. I don't know if they would have told me this if I hadn't asked them about the flavors, but as I am a big salted caramel macaron fan, I would definitely have been bummed out if I missed out on this flavor! If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be coming by a few times a month to pick up macarons! And their cakes! They were gorgeous and very elaborate (but expensive!)! Patisserie Manon is located in a quiet plaza next to the Whole Foods market plaza. We weren't sure at first where it was, but we saw a man standing outside with a sign. I also saw another location for this place down the street. I guess they have two storefronts? They have lots of seating inside the restaurant, and I believe a caf√© where you can order drinks and sandwiches further inside the store. I definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!Let them eat Cake.Although I've never been to France, I tried to envision myself in a Paris cafe with a cup of coffee and French pastry enjoying the food and scenery.  Alas, I just had to contend, for the moment, with my wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon as a substitute.  Ah well, c'est la vie!A friend and I decided to venture to this location, which is located quite a trek from the Las Vegas strip.  And though we did take a wrong turn here and there, we finally made it to this French bakery in the middle of the desert.The pastry showcase is just a plethora of sweetness.  Glucose levels will rise surely just by the mere stare of the variety of pastries and macarons on display.  I admit I wanted mostly everything that morning, but I figured I had to settle for just one thing as there were many places yet to visit on this recent Vegas foodie adventure.After finally making a decision, I chose the strawberry cream pie.  Now of course, this does NOT resemble any version of American "pie."  Sandwiched between two flaky layers of croissant-like texture are sliced strawberries and whip cream, while the entire pie is finished off with powered sugar, MORE whip cream, and a whole strawberry.  The entire pastry was simply divine.  The BEST way to start the morning paired with a cup of coffee.   I was reminded of that cafe scene in "Inglorious Basterds" where Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are having coffee and pastries.  More so for the pastry they ordered, with the topping of whip cream, and the flaky crust of the pastry itself.  Before leaving we took an assortment of macarons to go.  My favorite was the salted caramel.  There were any flavors, but truly that was the most memorable.....and the blueberry, of course.BOTTOM LINE:  A wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon.  Bon App√©tit!!My plans to rampage the strip in Vegas were dashed when the wedding party reserved rooms about 20 mins away. The silver lining was that I was pushed out of my comfort zone and forced to find new things. One of those things was Patisserie Manon, a French bakery close to SunCoast. I wasn't sure what to expect but we were greeted by giant display cases jammed with every kind of pastry known to man. Rainbows of macarons, custard filled eclairs, fruit tarts, lemon cremes, pies, cakes, cookies. It's a sugar addict's dream in there. The bistro is in back, an order counter where they'll pile a plate with a giant croque madame or some goat cheese quiche or a big salad. The soups need some help but then, when it's 115 degrees outside, soups aren't a big priority. Our service there was great (it's order window) and they've got a cute kids table for your little ones. Definitely a find if you're in that area or are looking for a little (or a lotta) sugar.Ever since I read Michael C.'s (Yelp Hawaii) review of this French bakery, I knew I had to go there. Then, I read LA Yelper, Tiffany C.'s and Rod U.'s (Hawaii) reviews -  I was even more encouraged!  When I saw Vegas Yelpers' reviews - Norm, Sylvia, Nelson, Terri, Mel, Ania, Stefany, and Philip -  that put me over the top!I just wanted a little dessert. I ended up with a Kiwi Raspberry Tart, a Mango macaron, and a Peach Rectangle Tart. Wow. The crust, the fresh fruit, the quality of ingredients. ..I could tell that it's authentic! Then, I ventured to the back of the shop... oh, no!  There is a separate cash register for the savory goods: soups, sandwiches, lasagna, French Hot Dog, croissants, and QUICHE!  OMG - I had just had dinner,  but I NEEDED a Quiche. ..but how to decide between Ham and Cheese,  Spinach, Goat Cheese, and many other flavors?  I went with the most popular: Quiche Lorraine. Ahhh. .. it was THE BEST quiche I had ever had!  That buttery, flakey crust and the "broke da mouth" combination of bacon, cheese and eggs made me continue my feasting! It was so fluffy and decadent! !I'm quite sure that I'll be back for more quiche and other goodies!  Vive la France!
Einstein Bros Bagels=Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.Thought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe. It's been a rough morning. Needless to say, my therapist is not going to be happy about this.See photos.When it comes to bagels, Einstein Bagels is 3 5 star good. However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.
Carl's Jr=Even through all the crazy menu items CJ has had over the years, the taste is still the same. The burgers are consistently good. I miss the days when you could get a Famous Star WITH cheese for just .99! The fries are horrible sice they changed them. My favorite fries were at CJ but not now damn it. I came the other morning for breakfast with a coupon and tried the Maple Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuit. The sausage was freaking good. It reminded me of the Johnsonville breakfast sausage my wife cooks. The biscuit was hot and damn good for a fast food place. The hash browns are nuggets and surprisingly not too greasy. Now if I could just get them to bring back their baked potatoes and original fries all would be right.
Short Leash Hot Dogs Food Truck=After a trip to the Market, I was roped into trying a short leash dog. I generally as a rule of thumb, refuse to eat hot dogs, but I decided to make an exception, because Sean S. said they were sooooo good. I decided to have a vegetarian dog with mango chutney, jalape√±o, and mayo. It was pure heaven and served on a delicious piece of naan. Kudos to the creativity of the dog topping combinations. The combinations are named after the owners pets, dogs none the less - how cute is that? Delicious, filling, and unique. What more can I say? Stop by the Market on Wednesday night or Saturday morning and try one for yourself!Great sausages (from Schreiner's), creative and tasty combinations for fixins, on hot naan bread. And wonderful, friendly people - they made sure that I enjoyed what I ordered. A great meal, definitely. I wish there were more than one truck, and I wish one were stationed closer to where I live.I am a HUGE fan.  Partially because this was the most filling hotdog I have ever had.  I 100percent put my taste buds in the hands of the owners and just said give me whatever I should have.  They brought me out two halves prepared in two different styles,  One had beans and was delicious (the Miko I think)  and the other was spicy (the Aiko I think).  I was absolutely in love with both.  They apparently will be at Shady's every Thursday night and Public Market more often.  From now on every time I see them I'm stopping.  YUM!I'm not really a hot dog guy (not that there's anything wrong with that). When I crave a hot dog, I might get one and one is always necessary at a ball game and once in awhile i will get a hot dog at the gas station when in a pinch, but in general, I am not the sort of guy to go out of my way to find a wiener.That being said...The first time I went to Short Leash at the Public Market with Ayesha S. It was damned good but ya know...still a hotdog, not my thing necessarily. Second time I went was with Julia T. and I think "yeah I kinda get it, if you are into hot dogs..." Third time...something just opened inside of me...something magical and warm and I felt like Belle in Beauty and the Beast, my heart opening up and for the  first time not viewing it just as a hot dog (There must be something there that wasn't there before) but as a sandwich, a meal, a real step above what I am used to in the hot dog department.The actual hotdog...it is...How do i put it?...the texture and flavour are like BAM. Then the toppings...pick your own or go with one of the choice combinations they list...also they run specials with pet dog namesakes. You probably aren't going to get it wrong no matter what you go with.  The toppings are fresh, tasty and they are not stingy with em. It all gets loaded up into a flatbread which sounds odd but works.Here is the real kicker...these people are effing rad. I walk up and guy says to me "I'm sorry, I forgot your name." I had been there twice and not that recently I didn't even expect him to remember who I was at all. So then I go pay with my card and realize I forgot to get a bottle of water for my dog. The guy gives me a bowl of water for him and then the lady behind the counter asks if he can have a hotdog. She even assures me they are 100 percent beef. Gives my dog a free hot dog! Mind you I think they appreciated the work he was doing gathering signatures for the DT dog park. *ching* I felt tingly all over and knew it was true love. Cray good. CRAZY good.I have no doubt that Brad and Kat could put just about anything on a hotdog wrap it in the wonderful flatbread and it would be absolutely amazing! While I usually don't stray far from the Aiko (fresh diced mango, cilantro, onions, jalape√±os on a beer hot), I have become quite fond of their Corn Pups (corn dog with spicy jalape√±o cheese inside).  Recently tempted to try something new here while reading their Specials board I was drawn in by a hotdog topped with blackeye peas, onions, green chile, old fashioned english cheddar and crumbled Fritos corn chips.  FRITOS...*drool*...I couldn't decide! Seeing my dilemma, and not being too busy at the moment, they offered to do half of each the Aiko and this daily special.  Needless to say I was yet again BLOWN AWAY with Short Leash's delicious creation.Don't doubt the Masters!  Brad and Kat know their stuff!This is the first review I've written where I wish I could give more than five stars.I was so hesitant to try this place based on all the hipster reviews and and the preconcieved notion that is overpriced stuff that appeals to granolas and hipsters. Well, that may be true, but I think it appleals to everyone as well. I ordered the Noki, a dog with green chiles, pintos, cheese, and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog. They serve the dogs on flatbread which is awesome beyond belief! The taste and quality was definitely there and the portion is enormous. Where I really want to give this place more stars is the service. I want to say they have worked in high levels of service industry before because name usage was constant. They took my name for the order and used it at least three times in conversation with me. I noticed they had a catch for bottle caps from the sodas they sell, so I asked if my girlfriend could have them for an art project she is doing. Not only did he say she could take them, but gave her a ziplock bag for them, offered to save them from future days, and tried to refuse when I recognized the great service and gave a tip. in short (get it?) these guys get how to run a business. They are friendly, helpful, serve high quality food, and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs. They take credit cards as well through a Droid app the guy has on his cell phone, and you sign with your finger on the phone's touch screen. I don't go to the market much, and I try not to eat hot dogs, but if I'm ever out and about when this truck is there, I'll definitely stop by again.One hundred stars, thanks again guys!My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart? Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!Wiener wiener wiener!I can't freaking believe I haven't reviewed Short Leash yet!!!!!!!  I go pretty much every Friday to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market food truck court.  Is that a mouthful or what?????I make a beeline here.  Not only are these people totally kick-ass but so are the hot dogs.I try to get a different one each time, but I always end up with the one that's got the jalapenos on it.  I don't remember the names ever.  I am there to eat, not read, but I think it's the Igby.They have a new one I learned about last night, the "Lady," and my mouth is watering right now at my desk.  I will be trying it out today for lunch. :}Oh, and when business owners remember the names of their customers, they are tops in my book.  After all, I may be eating their hot dog, but it's still....all about me.  ;}After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday. Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs. I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day. I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway. WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG! This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric. Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too! P.S. For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.There has been plenty said already about this crazy hot dog wagon ~ Short Leashed Dogs, and most of it true!  Their hot dog creations are  creative, tasty and just freaking awesome!  Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.  I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalape√±os, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.They have bottled H2O and soda in bottles. I found the diet black cherry goes well with any hot dog. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations around town.  Look them up on FB, find them and enjoy a creative and delicious bite to eat.Imagine every hot dog you've ever had. Ok, now throw every image out the window because you haven't tasted anything until you've had a hot dog from Short Leash Dogs. Everything I heard about Short Leash Dogs is true and today I finally got to experience one. I visited Short Leash Dogs during their Pop-Up lunch at 335 W. McDowell today (a location which is pretty cool and I can't wait to see what it becomes, by the way). I studied the menu and had major menu anxiety while trying to figure out what to order. I wanted my first Short Leash dog to be perfect! I noticed that the special was called the "Sunny." It has peaches, goat cheese and prosciutto. They told me that it's only on the menu for a limited time, so of course I had to order it, especially since it has everything I love in life on it! I anxiously awaited my order and envisioned the luscious flat-bread engulfed in the goat cheese and prosciutto on top of the hot dog. It finally appeared and it took just one bite for me to be in a scene of "All Dogs Go To Heaven." I got the chicken hot dog and it was seasoned perfectly. The flat-bread complimented the meat and toppings and the prosciutto, peaches and goat cheese were the perfect summery twist on this hot day. After my visit to Short Leash, I decided that I will tie my leash to their food cart and follow them religiously around town. Not only are the owners two of the nicest people around, but their hot dogs are an extremely tasty addition to the Valley. Now if only Old Town allowed more food carts to post up shop. You'd think with the amount of bar and foot traffic, they would want gourmet food carts like Short Leash!Short Leash Dogs is amazing, for sure.The owners could not be sweeter and more friendly, and that is the secret to their success. In addition to buying an amazing product at good value, you get to meet and become part of the extended family with Short Leash. Even on the busiest of days, the SLD crew has time to say hi, chat, and make you feel like you're a good friend visiting their home. On a recent order I messed up what I typically get, and Brad stopped me and asked, "Hey- you usually get a beer hot, do you want something different?" Nope- I just spaced it, and he caught it.The food is as amazing as the service, and I highly recommend getting a corn pup (with mustard, NEVER ketchup) and an Aiko dog with beer hot, or as I am trying to get it renamed, the Baiko!Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT miss this amazing little food truck. Every visit I make you will see that Short Leash Dogs is the busiest and most popular, and that is for a good reason. Don't stress if there is a line, the SLD crew does not screw around- and the food is more than worth it.Keep up the amazing work guys, I hope someday you guys have a brick and mortar location- because I will be the first one in line.Since I discovered shortleash's gormet spin on the dreary old dog, I have dreams of coming back time and time again. Pick from one of the solid regular menu options, try and experiment by making your own custom dog, or mix it up by adding toppings to one of their menu choices. Choose your dog, such as bratwurst, spicey beer hot (my personal fav), a regular dog, veggie dog, etc. Choose from toppings like Fried pickles, cole slaw, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, fried onions, sauerkraut, mango chutney, sliced jalenpenos, and so much more, all of which seem to be fresh and extremely tasty. Wrap it all up in an indian naan flat bread. This is the stuff of legends.I think I read somewhere that this weeks feature of the week comes with bacon - I think I know what I'll be eating for lunch today. I almost always make my dog custom. Sometimes I will change pace with the featured dog of the week, which are usually a little different and exciting. Check them on facebook or their website for their weekly schedule, they usually hang around down town for lunches through the week and dinner on select days.... I think "food truck friday" at the phoenix public market should be re-named to "shortleashdogs and the food trucks" - expect a 20 minute wait in line to make your order if you show up around 12pm on friday for lunch. I promise it's worth the wait!Quoted in the weekly Yelp newsletter 7-4-2012: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=L5AQHJ8yFfPtBRNI_xIRyAThe Ultimate Phoenix Downtown Destination!On a day where it's 106 degrees in the shade, 30+ people standing in line can't be wrong. If there's this many people willing to risk 2nd degree burns from the scortching sun waiting in line for their turn to order up a hotdog, there really must be something to it. No where else in Phoenix will you find people this dedicated. I just couldn't help myself; I was drawn to get in line with everyone else.Brimming with excitement from all the possibilities, the wait in line seems miniscule compared to the payout I am about to receive from such an amazing dog! Will I get a Mokie and add fried pickles? Will I order a Lady and top it off with green chilies and pinto beans? How about the Oliver and throw in some of that tasty coleslaw? Wait, no, I'll have the Bear, naked style. Maybe instead of the Bear, I'll get a corn dog, with some of that awesome chipotle cream cheese. The possibilities are endless - I guess I'll just have to keep coming back until I've had them all!Oh no!! after getting closer to the front of the line, I found out they've even got a featured dog of the week with customized specialty toppings and this week it's Beef and Bean Chili topped with Fritos and Cheddar! What will I choose?!?!?A quick visit to Food Truck Fridays in downtown Phoenix (McKinley and Central) between 11am and 1:30pm will prove there's Short Leash, and then there's everyone else. Don't make the mistake and get stuck ordering from "everywhere else."Happy Yelping Phoenix and go grab one of these awesome dogs!Ode to Short Leash.I once heard a whisper of a much beloved hot dog; of island dreams come alive atop a six inch bun. I dared not believe there could be another to even compare against my precious. I feel as a guilty lover drifted away from his one true love in a moment of weakened convictions. The hot peppers and spicy caribbean sauce left me breathless and weak in the knees. As a guilty lover always does, he comes crawling back from rediscovery of what he once knew to be true. Short Leash's love is ever lasting, and how dare I even consider another. I have faith in our bond; Short Leash, and our ties are not easily broken. I regret even the consideration that there could be another out there to quench the lunchtime desires for hot dog delights. I promise I shall not stray again, with a conviction of the strength of stone.From hence forth, I promise to remain faithful to the lovingly topped gourmet hot dogs. Available with sauerkraut, cole slaw, pepperoncini's, jalape√±os, mango chutney, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, diced tomatoes, fried pickles, grilled onions, peanut butter, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, blue cheese, green chilis, smoked gouda, relish, bacon and barbeque sauce.Happy Yelping Phoenix, don't stray far from your one true love.This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart! No sirree Bob, if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water, steamed buns, and French's mustard you may want to keep driving.However, if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook, then this is your place. Hot dogs with gouda cheese, bacon, and even peanut butter as toppings. I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious. Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed them.Additionally, at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as well.Finally, the service was great! Despite the crowds, service was friendly, attentive, and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucks.Short Leash Dogs - we will be back!Went to a Sit Stay UYE Friday night with my daughter & a friend, I had been wanting to try Short Leash Dogs for awhile now, so this opportunity sounded like the perfect time for that!I found them in an alley way off Central & Camelback, and when I walked up it had a nice cozy feeling, couple of wooden tables, a fire pit and plenty of cool people.I knew that this would a hot dog eating experience that I haven't had before; I ordered the Pippin Style Brat, came with grilled pears, prosciutto, watercress, goat cheese & topped with some honey & pepper severed on naan bread.  Ok sounds interesting right? Let me tell you, it was amazing, who would have thought, everything blended so well together, what a great treat!My friend and I had been lil standoffish about the Bear; I just couldn't get my head wrapped around it. Friend asked if I would be up to splitting one, that we came this far and to not try it would just be an epic failure on our behalf, so I said yes!The Bear, it's interesting, has peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon & bbq sauce on a brat wrapped in naan bread. The peanut butter sort of melts and mixes with the bbq sauce and it kind of reminded me of Thai Peanut sauce, which I just love!   Over all the hot dog was good, just was unsure of what to make of the cracker jacks, would I order another one, Heck yea I would! Glad to have finally had the chance to try Short Leash, look forward to my next run in with them!
Miller's Las Vegas Ale House=This is a great place to come have a few beers and watch some games.  There's tons of TV's, tons of seating, and ton's of beers on tap.We ordered the stuffed jalapeno's for an appetizer. When I bit into one, hot cream cheese spewed out and burned my lip. Those things are dangerous! Tasty though ...The entree food fell flat. My summer salad was drenched in dressing. My friends shrimp scampi was super bland, and my BF's salad looked wilted and just not good.Come for beer or sports, not food.Props for having Oregon's "dead guy ale" on tap.Good Service, quality food, decent prices, fun restaurant/bar scene with pool tables and an awesome atmosphere overall.I had lunch here with one of my gal pals who actually introduced me to it and who bragged about their food.She ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and I opted for fish and chips. Both meals were tasty and great quality to say the least, lots of food for a great price! They have daily specials as well. I will be back to check out the bar and have something on tap for my next visit. This place is fun!I am on the late freight with checking this restaurant out however better late than never!I have to say...I am a fan of Miller's Alehouse.  But I'm only a fan since it's a great place to catch the game and there's enough of a selection for everyone on the menu.  When you go to most places to watch a game, you're stuck with your usual bar type food.  Miller's has all the fried foods, burgers, and nachos if that's your thing.  However, Miller's also has other options from fajitas, soups, salads, and steak.  Even though they were known for their super-sized nachos, we didn't partake in any of it during our most recent visit.  I've had it before and they are pretty damn good.  They're perfect to share with a group if you're not counting your calories. I ended up with a bowl of chili and a steak/chicken fajita combo.  Both meals were decent, nothing spectacular.  But I'm still giving Miller's Alehouse 4 stars because I see myself coming back one day to watch the game.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (499/500)Thank you for being good sports and taking care of our extremely rowdy table of 25 . They knew ahead of time that we would want separate tabs and there was no confusion in the end on what was supposed to be on whose bill. The drinks and food we ordered also came out quickly and efficiently.Yessss! Someone ordered the gigantic nachos and I was able to have some. Actually, everyone at the table was able to have some because there was just so much to go around. The calamari and wings were other standout items that I was able to try. They have more than just bar food available so peruse the menu and I'm sure you will find something to strike your fancy.Overall, a good sports bar or hangout spot with buddies.Located in Town Square, it is a great location for some food and drinks!We stopped in after our shopping excursion to appease our appetite.  They were very friendly as soon as we walked in the door.  As soon as we sat down, our waiter was over with happy friendly service. Our entire table spilt the fiesta nachos.  As an appetizer for 4, it was perfect.  The plate of nachos were piled high with plenty of toppings all around.  Something else to share is the Miller's Steak Sandwich.  I split this with my husband.  It was filled with marinated steak, onions, mushrooms and provolone.  So delicious and filling!  Tip~ if you order sweet potato fries on the side, it is a HUGE basket and can also be shared.  This location has good service and good food!  Just a great option when in the area!
Pastitsio=So...I went when Pastitsio first opened and was a little disappointed. There weren't many options, the portions were small and pricey and my bf and I were just "meh" about it. I haven't been back since that visit until today....All I have to say is that I am disappointed in MYSELF that I didn't return to this place sooner! It is super close to my house, and I had no idea I could have access to fresh, DELISH hummus all the time. Hummus is a food group for me, and being a vegetarian, it is one of the only things I can order at a lot of restaurants/bars besides salad. So I love it, I never get sick of it. Pastitsio's does it FRESH and RIGHT! It is so good paired with their warm pita! You can also buy containers to go, and now that I know this, I will probably be back frequently!They also have an array of fresh (vegan/veggie) salads like Tabboulah and potato salad with olive oil, not mayo. They have daily specials (bf got the carved chicken sandwich) and many other fun things in their to-go fridge. BF loved the salad dressing as well!Plus, they were so friendly when we walked in! Super nice people, they brought everything to our table on nice plates, and just made the extra effort. Can't wait to be back for my weekly hummus fill!I cannot believe I've waited this long to come here!  I passed it on Butler for months and months and never went in, but always thinking I had to go.  Now to think of how many delicious meals I have missed out on makes me sad!I tried to order the lamb sandwich but they were out, so it could have ended badly.  But don't you worry, they still had veggies, so I opted for the roasted veggie sandwich.  It. Was. Incredible!  I loved the soft doughy pita, the delicious perfectly roasted roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant with a creamy saziki sauce. Of course, I also couldn't resist a beet salad side.  When you order a beet salad you never really know if you'll get (I mean, unless you read the menu...I just see beets and get excited!), greens and beets or just beets.  This time it was just beets, but it was still great with a slight taste of orange and vinegar.   The place is super tiny, but wasn't too crowded.  The one negative thing was it was hot as hades inside.  I believe it was probably around 40 outside, so when I walked outside it was refreshing.  I even started fanning myself with a City Paper at one point!  Other than that, killer meal and I will most definitely be putting this on my lunch rotation in Lola!
Vie et Nam=Double rainbow all the way* at this Vietnamese eatery.Try the Rock Star. Vie et Nam's rendition of the popular banh mi sandwich is filled with a medley of moist pork and chicken chunklets plus cilantro and jalapenos, atop a respectable baguette. Their pickles are sliced rather large, but I'm still a fan of this rock star; it holds its own against competing sandwich places.Don't like banh mi? Don't worry: They offer dishes besides sandwiches.* My obsession with Vietnamese sandwiches borders on the unhealthy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX0D4oZwCsA
Fresh Attractions=Before you eat here, know that there's a Starbucks just up the way, and a Sbarro just across from it. Both are better options, kids. I was attracted to the idea of freshness, but that's not at all what I got. My turkey and pesto panini was salty, and although they had grilled it it was still cold. Very unappealing and gross. For an $8 sandwich, I expected a lot more. There are very few food options in this terminal, but believe me when I say you're better off eating at any other than Fresh Attractions.
Pinky's Westside Grill=If opening night was any indication this will be a great & sorely needed addition to the West side. The strongest thing about Pinky's is not the car on the roof or the airbrushed hood by the bar, it's the menu. Yes, there are fried pickes, yes they serve burgers but there is more than that. For my first visit I ordered the Pterdactyl (their standard size burger). As more patties are added the name changes to a larger dinosaur. That should explain the concrete triceratops you'll see on Freedoom Drive. Standard lettuce, tomato, etc is available but I really encourage you to try the other topping combinations like Ding-Dong style: a ginger slaw, with crunchy peanut butter, and sriracha sauce. Cost: $3.75. They're still experimenting with some menu options so the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette I had will be replaced with a better value. When I go back I'll be trying a basket of popcorn shrimp that's paired with their waffle fries, and more of the slaw from my burger. Outside of fried food & carnivores there are multiple filling salads available, as well as sandwiches, and hot dogs that all had tempting descriptions.Layout of the space maximizes seating options with a long bench along the glass wall of tables for 2, high backed booths as a row in front of the bar, and more tables by the roll up glass garage doors. The vibe of the interior does have some automotive elements of its former home but I wouldn't say it's as dominating as the motorcycle theme is inside Mac's Speed Shop.The staff was very friendly and already had opinions on favorite menu items. One of the partners sat down to talk and shared their enthusiasm for the space. Their liquor shelves should be stocked by the end of the week and but I forgot to look at the beer list to have an opinion.I think they'll earn a 5th star, but a few more visits will tell.I didn't even know Charlotte had a Westside. YeAH, WESTSIDE!! in my best gangsta voice.Pinky's is heading for success, it already has a comfortable feel, I can't believe they have only been open for a week, already feels established. I sat at the bar waiting for friends and this nice guy beside me shared his pimento cheese, seasoned waffle fries. He has a friend for life now. Sharing is caring. Guess what?  They passed my french fry barometer. Need I say more?My hot dog was delish, I tried a bite of a corndog- soooooooo good. The outer heavenly shell was sweet, light and a little bit of crunch. Corndogs are sent from heaven. Pinky's had a nice mix of customers, single fun drinkers, the child slingers and nice men who sit at bars and share their food with the ladies. P.S. I told him to start Yelping.  Our check average was $13 without tip -food and adult beverage. I think that is flippin' fantastic.I can see we are heading for a beautiful relationship. Crush factor: OrangeJust.What.This.Area.Needed.Yep, Pinky's fills the quick, tasty, cheap food void in the Wesley Heights area with a stacked menu, cool place and really, really great staff. A bunch of yelp peeps dropped by Pinky's for a grand old time and I got to taste a smattering of stuffs. Some of my faves from the menu...Crab Hush Puppies: ZOMG. If a little crab made love to a hush puppy, this is its delicious baby. But it's also a big puppy. And served with a delicious tartar sauce. Oh, and there are 13 per order for $4.95. If that's not love, I don't know what is.Pimento Cheese Fries: A heart attack in a basket, and delicious. I don't know if I could (or ever should) eat an entire basket by my lonesome, but these were magnificent. Pterodactyl burger: A seemingly basic burger, but nicely seasoned and well cooked. Oh, and it's a steal at $4.25. Veggie Corn Dog: The only reason I tried this is simply because I didn't believe my buds that a veggie corn dog could be delicious. Oh, but it is. Veg heads celebrate!Fried Pickles: Perfectly fried with the light, crispy breading we all know and love. With the saucy sauce. Oh I'm a fan of you Pinky's and I'll be back soon...Last night was my 1st visit with fellow Yelpers... I'm happy to say finally some cool dining/hangout options in that side of town.  I remember driving by this corner with the old service station, can't believe they got it all pretty up.  Heads up peeps, parking in the front is PRIME, but they obviously work out with the lot owner across the street (coming from uptown, go down Morehead, past the light @ Freedom, immediately on the left) for additional parking.  Be careful when you dash across toward the yummy smell of fried food.My 4-stars is a little... skewed.  Explanation: I am a fan of the restaurant but I didn't eat much.  But the fried pickle was good, a little thick in my opinion, but heck, it's fried and came with ranch... what more can a girl ask for?? The Crab Puppies were HUGE, as in size and portion.  For $5, that's a great starter to share.  OK, let's be realistic here, 5 bucks will NOT get you a mouth full of fresh crab meat.  But I could taste the crab taste.  My fav of last night visit, $1 Miller Highlife, the champagne of beer... with a twist of lime, and I got myself a poor man's corona!  The $3 cosmo was good, as in it was not weak :)  One day I'll update my review on the food... but for now, 4-stars for the location, the ambience, and the drinks.Can't believe it took me this long to make it into Pinky's! The crown jewel of biker bar/dive bars on the west side of Charlotte. Packed full of personalities, tattoos, the beer flows like wine, and tons of cardiac inducing treasures to be had. The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind. I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives. Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last. Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job. White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time. Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?I'm just going to reiterate what those who have been fortunate enough to experience Pinky's have said in their reviews here:White Trash Burger: Yes, you should get it at least once but be prepared for a gut bomb for real. (I haven't had the Ding Dong burger but have heard it's pretty dang good as well. I might be adventurous enough to try that someday... Maybe.)Cheese fries: Yes, get those also. But again, gut bomb.Corn dogs of any sort: Hell yeah. Get those too.Atmosphere: Super laid back, hipster, casual and diner-ish. I went there today after not showering for 2 days and no one seemed to care. (Let the judging commence...)Pricing: Average, affordable diner food pricing. ($22 for 2 meals and 2 soft drinks)Service: Spot on! Did not have to ask for anything at all as our server was seriously on top of everything. Also, on our way out the door today after lunch, we were told "Have a good one!" and "Thanks again!" by several of the employees. That really goes a long way for me.And lastly... Why are the "Shrimp Corn Dogs" not called "Shrimp Puppies"??!! It is just beyond me. It would be such a cute little name for those delicious morsels of fried battered shrimpness. It just makes sense. (Yeah, go ahead and get those too.)**Oh! Almost forgot... park behind the building in the gravel lot or else you won't be parking anywhere.
Smashburger=FINALLY I made it to @smashburgerlv and boy was I glad I did!!!GREAT Burgers!! Excellent selection of Sides & Fantastic Shakes!!!1st time out I had to try the Mushroom+Swiss Burger which was OVER the TOP good, 2nd time I had to go for the BAJA Burger which was great as well.The burgers remind me alot of Fuddruckers with a great selection of fresh toppings but the sides are unique and quite incredible especially the pickle chips and veggie frites.BEEFY CHILI IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!Since this location is right across the street from the Village Square Cinemas its a good spot to fill up before seeing a movie instead of paying $12 for a popcorn & soda :) Prices are fair for a sit-down burger joint and service is SUPER-FriendlyStopped here for lunch the other day and decided to order a 1/3 lb Spicy Baja Burger ( Pepper Jack, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Chipotle Mayo, and Fresh Jalapenos on a Chipotle Bun, $5.99), Chicago Dog ($3.99), Fried Pickles ($1.99).  Yes, I was starvin' like Marvin!This was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.The first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.Next I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.Next up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.Overall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.Will I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour.Finally hit up the Smashburger to see what it is all about! I joined the Smashburger club via their website and in return they emailed me a voucher for a free entree. Hell yeah a free burger of my choice sounds like a great time to give them a try! I did not have to manually print the coupon they accepted it via looking at and deleting the email from my phone.I am glad we did as I was very happy and satisfied with my meal! The service is Amazing as well, all of the employees so helpful and sweet always checking on us to make sure everything is perfect! Andy and the crew at this location kick ass!!! They were even patient with me while I stood at the counter trying to decide what I wanted to order as the menu is neat how you can add stuff on to your burger. They have their own creations and they have the option to create your own burger or chicken burger. Lots of free toppings! Mmmmmm yum!I decided on the "Classic" and decided on the "big smash" size which is 1/2 pound Angus burger. Includes American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion, pickles and smash sauce on an artisan egg bun. I added sweet relish and extra purple onion as a free add on. The sweet relish on my burger was divine, it just took the flavor and taste to a whole new level. Reminds me of when I was a kid and would order a burger from an old school diner my Mom would take me to in San Diego, CA, they put sweet relish on their burgers, I will never forget how good it was! Thank you for the trip back in time and fond memory Smashburger! :)My boyfriend ordered the "Spicy Baja" which includes pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo, fresh jalapenos on a spicy chipotle bun. He added for .75 more fried pickles on the side and haystack onions to his burger. He really enjoyed his burger, his only complaint was that the meat patty is smashed out further than the bun. I said babe it is called "Smashburger" lol That is what I liked is that the meat patty was bigger than the bun, I enjoyed that meat hanging out on the sides mmmmm yum!The Angus beef so juicy, flavorful and literally was running down my mouth and chin. They make a messy burger and they have plenty of napkins available on the tables. If a burger is not messy then it is not a well made burger!We also ordered smashfries to share which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic, mmmm delicious as well.This was truly a treat for our lunch today! I enjoyed it very much along with the Outstanding service we received from Andy and the crew!We will be back! They have a burger worth sucking silly and I want to do it again!Our total for two burgers, two drinks and fries was $25 after my coupon for my free burger it brought it down to $18. Had a great lunch, tried a new place and saved some money! WIN WIN WIN!Thank you for the happy ending Smashburger, my tummy thanks you! :)Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.Lots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.Re-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#afd8gM9iwR4AZ1mcdECpygI think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my "Berger knows Burgers" list, http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).The Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRwIn summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of "Smash", "Sizzle", and "Savor" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country.I have been torn about trying Smashburger since some of the reviews for their locations have been less than smashing.  Last night, we decided to try something different and decided to try Smashburger.I looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.Sarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.A short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.I'm not going to make Smashburger a regular on my rotation schedule, but it was good enough that I'll be back sometime.  I need to try the nutter butter shake.This place is a good location,but during lunch you have to park far away because, it is a little crazy. That is OK because,you need to walk after all those Calories right.  The staff is friendly and very helpful. Since I had never been before they explained everything very nicely.The menu is quite large for a burger joint. I got the Mushroom Burger sin mayo. It was very good. The fries are so so.Next time I will try the Sweet potato fries or the Smashfries. They look interesting.Prices are not too bad at all and the place is very clean. Which is very good!In reading the menu I see you can even build your own Burger.Choosing your own type of Bun as well. It only took 10 min to get my items to go! I thought that was pretty good as the place was packed and they make it all from Scratch.I have driven by it 100's of time,so now I am glad that I finally stopped to check it out.I've been a big fan of the Smash*burgers* for a while. The Arizona burger with jalape√±os is one of a kind for quickie burger joints like this one. Add on a side of smash fries and I walk away a happy carnivore nearly every time.The other night, I gave the Arizona Grilled Chicken a try. The meat was surprisingly good for grilled. Cooked through. What made it remarkable were the spicy toppings. I don't consider myself a "heat wimp" but the peppers had me chugging coke after each bite. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but I was still satisfied with my choice. Aside: One of the cashiers was quite pleasant while the other guy, who took or order, acted like it was forced labor. Or, like he was too good for taking burger orders, literally taking a long swig of his beverage as we concluded our order. Smashburger is not the best of the best in terms of burger establishments, but for the speed and price, it does the trick.Sorry kids , I  have to give this one a just okay .  nothinbg terrible about the taste but nothing mind blowing as well.  And a word to the wise the smashburger Fries are dripped with a rosemary grease. Now rosemary grease I am sure has a place somewhere in fooddom...but I am thinking it's not on the plain fries. YThe burger was okay , tasted like the kind dear mother used to make , fried on a skillet. Hmmm  for 9 bucks ..not my thing. Oh and heads up ..one size on the togo cups....and it's not big.I have been dying to try this place because I am a big fan of the burger. I will keep this review very simple for you. Three wordsOversaltedOverpricedOverratedCheeseburger, fries and drink at Smashburger= $10Cheeseburger, fries and drink at In n Out= $ 6.59How's that for simple?Found a BOGO deal and I wouldn't come roaring back here based on what we ordered.  What we had was OK but OK just doesn't cut it in a town full of great burger choices. Got the Spicy Baja which was described on the menu as with "pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalape√±os on a spicy chipotle bun."  Not spicy enough for me.  People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.I liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with "fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun." I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.  What's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?  A plate would've been better.  I found them awkward.  Stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off something without holes.As Austin Powers would say, "Smashing baby, yeah!"I have tried every one of their burgers and my favorite is the Spicy Baja! With that said, for you noobs and/or connisseurs, your perfect starting burger and sidekick should be the All-American or Classic Burger and Smash Fries.All their burgers are made from 100 percent angus beef and come in two sizes. Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.The fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.For a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.comService is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. Random story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.
Barro's Pizza=Sometimes I just want a slice (or two!) of pizza.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing wood-fired or artisan.  No three hour wait.  No ingredients I can't pronounce.  Just pizza.  Pizza with puffy crust, red sauce and gooey cheese.  That's it.That said, I was looking forward to the opening of this Barro's location, as it is within lunchtime range of my office.  Thanks to Alexander C's review, I knew that the 'Coming Soon' sign finally changed to 'Now Open'.  Yay!  To be sure this new location was just as good as the other Barro's that I have grown to love, I had to try out a couple of pepperoni slices.  After all, quality control is important, right?  I am happy to say the 'za was warm, soft and cheesy - just what I wanted.
The House at Secret Garden=I feel like less of a person for being a resident of the South Mountain community and having eaten at the Secret Garden for the first time last night.    My friends took me here for a  birthday dinner......they had made reservations and had a table set up for our group that seated us comfortably.  The service was IMPECCABLE and the food.....oh the food.....was so ridiculously good that I have no words.   I'm sad that there were only two other tables in there the entire time that we were there, for  a total of four more people.    This place is easily the best restaurant on the south side of Phoenix...potentially to include downtown.   Frankly, this made for an even bettter experience for my group - but I don't want this place to close.Highly recommended.  A+.   Go.I came here for lunch and what a pleasant surprise.4 stars for atmosphere. This is an old house (hence the name) set amongst a garden right around the corner from the Farm and South Mountain. This reminds of a place in Napa that you'd stop in for. A nice, rural out of town feel not to far from central Phoenix.While there was nothing on the menu that immediately jumped out at me, I settle for a ham and cheese sandwich. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! And the sweet potato chips were a fantastic side considering that I HATE AND DESPISE sweet potatoes.The salads and greens all look amazing. I will definitely be back.I've been to this restaurant for lunch usually, but I stopped in for dinner on their "famous" patio.  Here's my take on this place.Service:  Incredibly professional and wonderful staff.  Every time I have gone, the staff's attention to my every need and concern was a priority to every single person that I have encountered.  I can not say enough of how professional their staff is.Food:  again, wonderful food that bursts with flavor.  I've had several things here to eat, my favorites are the polenta fries and the Wild Boar sausage with the pasta (I forgot the name on the menu) - incredibly delicious and bursting with a warm exotic flavor that is both satisfying and filling.  I have also enjoyed a popular dish there, the shrimp and grits.  This dish was ok for me, I think it could be better if the items on top of the grits were all placed in the middle with the cheese.  Patio:  this is why I give them a. 4.  Needs live soft music on the weekends.   The ambiance is a bit dry without it.The name says it all. This truly is a house in a secret garden. Hiding within a working farm, The House is true farm to table. It's intimately hidden within a large orchard filled with well-grown trees and it's hard to believe you're in Phoenix. The patio is a perfect place to dine on a nice night or breezy day, and the indoor seating area is just as charming. Believe it or not, my favorite thing to get here is their burger. Their burger is freshly made and tastes delicious with every bite. Their salads are also delightful. You really can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Make sure you try anything pumpkin that they offer during the fall season. Note that as you're driving to The House, you'll question whether you're going the right way. You are. It's just that hidden!Who doesn't like secret gardens?  Especially secret gardens that are lovely, romantic with food that is charmingly delectable!   You don't even feel like you are right next to a large city with a farm and South Mountain as a backdrop.  I made a reservation on the patio because my sister was in town from the Bay Area and I knew she would want to enjoy our warm AZ weather and watch the sunset.  Honestly if you are coming here I would just sit outside, the house is cute, but the patio is much better.  The server placed us in a perfect spot shaded by palms overlooking the koi pond and not far from the fire!  Gentlemen, talk about a place to bring a hot date, would definitely set the mood for me!  But, it was also perfect to laugh and catch up with the sister too!  We ordered a cheese board to start and a bottle of Salneval Albarino to cleanse the pallet!  I HIGHLY recommend the Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese!  I am not even a cheesy kind of person, but I could eat a whole wheel of that stuff.  This is going to sound funny, but I came to this lovely restaurant with a big black/purple/blue/violet eye-cheek from an accident and trust me for the last 2 weeks I had been getting domestic violence and thug looks from various 'service providers'...  Well our waitress Megan didn't even bat an eye at my whacked face and my glorious bruise was even on her serving side!  So extra bonus points for that, which is why I rounded my 4.5 star rating up to 5 instead of down to 4.So after asking our poor server a million questions about the menu, because it is really hard to decide, as everything looks good and unique, we finally ordered.  I opted for the seasonal house special: hand made ravioli.  It was a spinach ravioli topped with an interesting lemon cream sauce, with almonds on top.  The raviolis were delicious, the sauce was quite good, and the almonds brought it all together.  I think I was expecting a little bit more POW to the dish, but it was still very unique and delicious.  I have to say my sister chose the right dish!  The New York strip with Red Chimichurri Sauce is AMAZING!  The thing they don't tell you on the menu is it comes in a corn puree of sorts that is mouthwatering!!! See picture.  It sounds weird to go with a steak, but it completely made the dish and set that steak apart from your typical steak at a nice restaurant.  I was actually trying to talk my sis into one of the other dishes and she trumped me...I am glad she did!!  The corn puree sauce was so good we asked the server what was in it and she said she would ask the chef who was in house.  She wrote the recipe on a note for us!! Sorry I promised not to divulge her secrets.  But the last ingredient was cute:  Love :)If you are skimming just do the following:  Sit on the patio, select Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese on the cheese board, somebody order the steak.  You will come back for more and if you are on a date you will get lucky!
Bliss ReBAR=The place is simply beautiful. The venue spans two buildings. The North building is Bliss (restaurant) and to the south is ReBar (the bar). You can go back and froth between the two venues (with your drinks in hand). And you can't beat the view of Downtown from their circular bar that is outside. There is also a beautiful full bar in the building to the South.  We were served some samples of the Coconut Chicken and Sausage Ravioli and they were freakin great (at the "VIP" pre-view event we got invited to). But I can't speak to anything else on the menu.The menu looks Damn good. And although the prices aren't cheap they do look fairly reasonable. Certainly better then what was here previously (FATE). The drink prices also seem reasonable ($4 for bottled beer and $5 for most draft).The hamburgers buns are made of pretzel dough and they also have Mac & Cheese (with Chicken and Bacon) both of which I'm dying to try.And the best of all, the place is 3 blocks from our house so I'm very excited to try the full menu.A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently "comfort food" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the "vip opening." c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.I don't like the food that I've had here so far. the fries are just plain disappointing. they play awful, terrible popular music that makes me want to slit my wrists. the music is interspersed with several-second gaps between songs, so my friend's slightly aghast exclamation ("i would *never* shave it!") echoes throughout the bar and garners our party some awkward glances. the reason(s) i'm offering Bliss/reBAR 3 stars is b/c of the bar staff and the drink prices (at the bar, specials seem to be different on the restaurant side).I like the bar's space, other than the echo issue (get some local art on your walls,  your neighbors will love you for it), and will return, but it would really make it easier and more enjoyable if they actually played good music.This review is strictly for reBAR, because I did not eat at Bliss. I very rarely give out one star ratings, but I very rarely get terrible service. I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables.I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, "you will wait your turn" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service.I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back.Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. Eggplant.Ohhhhkay then. It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. Just UGH in every way.I used a groupon for lunch at this place which was a smoking deal. And I really wanted to like it. I really did. But unfortunately the food was just not good. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The tortilla was very dry which made the whole thing fall apart. I had to cut it up and eat it with a fork. And if it wasn't for a few drops of buffalo sauce that I saw but couldn't taste, I probably would have sent it back thinking it wasn't what I ordered. It didn't taste like it had any sauce what-so-ever in it. I would've guessed it was a grilled chicken wrap with no sauce. And the little "salad" that came on the side was more like some leaves of lettuce with a drop of oil on them. There was no flavor at all!This place does deserve some credit for the atmosphere. The place is super cute and the service was good. All of the staff was very friendly and I really liked the feel of the place. Which made it even more upsetting the food didn't match the ambiance. But I will give this place another try. Maybe in the evening because it looks like it might be a cool place to chill and have a drink!I have been to Bliss Rebar a couple of times now. It is a pretty cool place in Roosevelt district.  Every time we have come the services has been great.  The servers are pretty quick and our drinks are always full.  Every day they have a $3.00 cocktail drink and the happy hour specials are pretty inexpensive too.  So far the Mac & Cheese and the Meatloaf sandwich are really good.  I know I will be back to try more.  If you are ever in the Roosevelt district during First Friday or just in the area, you should try at Bliss Rebar.The food is amazing, especially anything on their pretzel buns.  The staff is all very friendly and dangerously close to too good looking.Most places I frequent I end up finding one dish they make that I just stick to.  I can't do that here, with the exception of the Shrimp BLT I have loved everything I've tried and can't pick a favorite.  Try anything on a pretzel bun, you won't be disappointed.The wife and I have been here enough times for me to write a real review of Bliss, and ReBAR for that matter. I've been for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, for drinks. I've been on a Monday, a Tuesday, probably a Friday or two, likely Saturday and definitely a Sunday. Heck, lets just throw in Wednesday and Thursday for good measure.It's the type of neighborhood bar where every one knows your name, as long as you happen to know everybody who's there that is. One of the best Macaroni and Cheeses in town - the best? perhaps, you should judge them on that one for yourself. The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are poured 'well' ;-), the food always comes out tasty, and the friends are always here. What else could you really need?I wouldn't exactly call this a dance venue, but there's generally always dance music playing in the bar and on the patio over the weekends; I've seen some people get down. They've got a cool patio for brunch when it's nice outside, an interesting outdoor bar with heat lamps for those chilled "winter" evenings, and indoor dining in the bar as well as the restaurant.FYI, this is a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), so if you're looking to pickup on the opposite sex, you might have some trouble with that here, but it's a great spot for gathering with your friends.Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)"Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." ‚Äï Ron Swanson, Parks and RecreationRich women?  Diets!?  That's why I had a Bloody Mary with lunch.  #WerkBitchStrolled in for a lunch date with four guys because I'm a pimp and boy were things hot!  It was 111¬∞F outside and it felt about 90¬∞F inside.  Ick!  Anyways, it seemed like a slow day inside the bar area which was great since there was only one or two people working.  Drinks were ordered, food was ordered, and a lot of waiting ensued.  I'm the type that like to sip at a drink throughout my meal but the wait was so long that I was staring down an empty glass, olives eaten, before my macaroni and cheese was out.  The food was delicious.  Cheesy gooey goodness!  I had ordered another drink to go with my meal after Tom D. tempted me... that seducer!  I ordered a Strawberries & Champagne and what I got was a super flat Shirley Temple.  Where's the bubbles?  The champagne!?  I couldn't even taste the vodka.  After a few tiny sips, I abandoned it.  Tom had it sent back since I wasn't feeling it and it was taken off my bill.  One of our lunch companions also received the wrong order and had to endure another torturous wait before getting his sandwich.  I had originally wanted to try the cr√®me br√ªl√©e but with our meal quickly approaching the two-hour mark, it just wasn't worth it.  And so we left!Service was so-so.  Granted, there was only one true worker but they should hire at least one other person to help. The food was delicious but the cocktails were a let-down [did our Bloody Marys even have vodka in it!?].   I was digging the Lana del Rey tunes though and the ambiance was nice.  Also, please turn on that A/C.  It's the desert!  My make-up was melting!   Bliss is more on the 3.5 stars side.
Maryanne's Breakfast & Lunch=I adore these little out of the way places that most people never realize exist.  According to our waitress, Maryanne's has been in business for 30 years.  It seems implausible considering that I grew up a few towns over and had never known of its existence until yesterday.Primarily a restaurant serving area truckers (and there are a ton, considering Stowe Twp. is Pittburgh's industrial mecca), this place is as hometown blue collar 'Burgh as you can get.  That's what I loved so much about Maryanne's.  The food is simple breakfast/lunch fare.  Typical breakfast options (eggs, meats, toast, waffles, french toast, omelettes, and potatoes), but in ginormous portions!  A whole back menu of breakfast and lunch hoagies.  Our waitress, Evelyn, informed us that the place is packed with truckers and day laborers in the morning. They get their MASSIVE hoagies and eat half, saving the rest for lunch.  After seeing these hoagies (of which I had a hard time even eating half), I completely understand.  Btw, the hoagie was tasty, fresh, and on Mancini's bread... yum!Other than that, this place is set up like a truck stop out west - with a Pittsburgh flair of course.  Little gnomes, fountains, decorative brick-a-brack, random benches and outdoor seating, etc.  The bathroom is around the side, but it's not an "outhouse"; Clean too!  Our waitress looked like a trucker herself, and had a gruff friendly demeanor.  She was awesome!  The coffee is serve yourself and the homemade iced tea comes in a giant pitcher which is left at the table.  You'll see lots of local color.  Oh, and it's cash only.Go here!  Immerse yourself in the culture of Pittsburgh.  And, get some really tasty eats!
Salvatore's=This place is 5 stars good but the walk through the smoky ass casino is gonna cost them a star. My meal and I'd order the exact same thing again was some complimentary fresh baked bread, a side salad with some of the best Italian dressing I've had and the most excellent clam linguini in red sauce (the red sauce was a tip from the waiter).  The piano guy playing in the background was a nice touch.
Island Paradise Jamaican Restaurant=Ya mon'. Sorry, I couldn't resist. So the location might appear a lil' shady or eclectic, depending on your perception. It's nestled in a little strip mall near some empty suites, Club Kiss, Red Door and some kinda ahem, 'gentlemans' club. My kinda place? Eh, who cares, the food's good.So I've been a long time fan of Carribean food and Jamaican curry has always been one of my faves. Jerk Chicken is great when it's done right and I think Island Paradise does it right. Nicely spiced, both spiced and spicy, chopped up with a big cleaver (bones and all), and piled right on top of rice and beans, cabbage, plantains or even mac n cheese (huh). Yum.
Stiegeles=Asia meets Europe. Das sagen zwar viele, aber das Konzept ist extrem durchdacht. Asiatische W√ºrzmethoden verbunden mit europ√§ischen Garpunkten und eine absolute Frische der Produkte.Mittags gibt es "nur" das Mittagsmen√º f√ºr 25,80 f√ºr 3 G√§nge. Aber was f√ºr welche. Das hat mich echt umgehauen. Auf der Karte sieht das unspektakul√§r aus, weil man sich hier dem Trend zu hochtrabenden Wortspielereien verschlie√üt, sondern mehr oder weniger die Produkte aufz√§hlt die verwendet werden. Das klingt lieblos, aber die Ergebnisse sind meilenweit davon entfernt.Als Vorspeise hat ich eine Stubek√ºkenbrust (hauchzart) auf einem Bett von Perlgraupen mit Mango, Sellerie etc. Top angerichtet, top gew√ºrzt (ich tr√§um jetzt noch davon).Als Hauptspeise hatte ich (bretonischen) Seeteufel auf einem Hummerschaum mit winzigen Pfifferlingen und unglaublichen Schupfnudeln. So etwas habe ich noch nicht gegessen. (Ich glaube da war auch etwa Vanille drin)Als Dessert gab es Ingwereis (toll), Passionsfrucht, Schokomousse und ein weiteres Eis (das ich vergessen habe und auch nicht auf der Karte stand)Herr Stiegele ist ein bescheidener und angenehmer Gastgeber mit dem man prima auch √ºber kulinarisches plaudern kann,In der K√ºche steht seine Frau, die diese unglaublichen Geschmacksexplosionen zaubert.Baden meets Thai. Eine wunderbare Kombination. Mein neues Lieblingslokal in Karlsruhe.Ein Wehrmutstropfen sei nicht verschwiegen. Es gibt keine feste Karte, sondern eben nur die jeweilige Tageskarte. Daf√ºr aber mit topfrischen Produkten. Anders kann man so etwas nicht darstellen. (Die Alternative ist eben, dass alles aus dem Gefrierschrank kommt. Das gibt es schon zuviel auf der Welt.)
Happy Buffet=Happy Buffet should change their name to happy 420 buffet, cause they are a stoner's paradise.a gajillion different options, and all of which were delicious and not greasy in the least!I walked in the door with my best friend, who resembles the most accurate real life depiction of james franco's character in Pineapple Express, and we were shocked to see almost no one inside! It was a buffet ghost town! sad news for the owners, great news for my belly!I shoveled lbs of tasty grub into my craw! plate after plate, the few people working there smiled uneasily as I'd gotten up and waddled to the buffet for my third go round. coconut shrimp, pork shumai, drunken chicken and mushrooms, garlic string beans, crab legs, you name it, it was probably there. As I finally reached my breaking point, I thought of Adam Richman, and my loathing for him turned to a begrudging understanding, I'd fought that buffet with a relentless intensity that only his fat sweaty brow could fathom, and I'd won. A quick victory lap to the soft serve machine and we left conquerors like two young mongols after the sacking of some prosperous northern chinese village. When I got home I looked in the mirror to survey the damage done, I resembled a starving ugandan child with skinny limbs and bloated stomache, only I wasnt starving I was sickeningly full! Come to Happy Buffet and be prepared to make a cow of yourself!USA!!USA!!USA!!godblessamericalandthatilovestandbesideherandguideherwithahmmsomethingsomethingfromabove!!
SEA: The Thai Experience=The food at SEA is definitely good.  I don't know if it really is worth the price you pay for it though.  I never thought I'd pay $16 for Pad See Eiw ever.  Most Thai places only charge about $8, and in Thailand $1.50.  Seems like an overpriced Thai restaurant to me, kind of like P.F. Chang's is to Chinese restaurants.  In any case, the food here is delicious, price may not be a deterrent if lady luck is rolling with you in Las Vegas.The decor of this place is surprisingly trendy, especially since it's located inside an older Bally's casino.  There are nice tables beside a pool of water that centerpieces a nice Buddha statue.  Pretty cool for a Buddhist, like myself, to see such a remembrance of belief.  The restaurant looks very much like a few Sukhumvit restaurants and lounges I've gone to in Bangkok.  The bubble seats, in particular, that hang from a ceiling mount at the entrance reminded me of the trendy & cool Bangkok nightlife.  Personally, I just like sitting on them.My family and I ordered:Pad See Eiw w/ Chicken - $16Chicken Wing Lollipops - $9Green Curry w/ Chicken - $17Queen of Thai Basil w/ Beef - $16Tamarind Whole Fish (tilapia) - $32Everything tasted great.  Even, what I thought, was an overpriced Pad See Eiw had my mouth drooling for more.  The tamarind-chili sauce from the tilapia was exceptionally tasty.  I poured a lot of that saucy goodness all over my white rice.  Combining the sauce to an already aromatic jasmine rice made it even better.A note of warning though, SEA charges 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I didn't really like that since I thought the service was mediocre at best.  Fifteen percent would have sufficed since our waters were not refilled even once.  And, I'll be damned if I order another $5 Thai Ice Tea.  Anyways, I'll come here again if the dice are rolling my way or if I want to bring a date to a nice looking restaurant, otherwise I prefer to go to a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant on Spring Mountain Road that's just as good.She sells seashells by the seashorehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/personLiving out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.Fried calamari($12)-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiALightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUAWinna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight dealYelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #14 - #365My family was craving for some Asian food and did not want to walk too far from the hotel. So we found the SEA Thai Restaurant just across from rj hotel elevators. I never heard of this restaurant in Bally's so I'm assuming it just recently opened. The wait was around 15-25 minutes and the inside looked full, so it must be that good. The decor was modern and also had a small fountain inside the restaurant. I love love Thai food with their different uses of curry on their entrees and chicken barbecue. Lighting was pretty dim and I see they were going for an intimate setting. Flat screens were around the dining area and was Putin the Vevo channel with no sound. The food had taken about 30 - 45 minutes because it was so busy. Speaking of food, the chicken barbecue, curry beef, spicy rice and pad Thai were all a hit. It reminded me of the small Thai restaurant not too far from our place that serves good food. Our waitress forgot to fill up our waters and we were so thirsty after eating he spicy curry beef. The prices were typical for a Vegas strip hotel at $$$. I wouldn't call this place fancy and I have eaten at fancy eateries in Vegas. I would rate SEA Thai in the middle. I prefer to go to China town for some cheap eats compared to eating in the strip.This place sucks now! 2 years ago they had a Vietnamese menu with pho, vermicelli, rice plates and bun rieu. They changed their menu and we asked the server about the old menu, he said (in broken English) the chef "went away" (we thought he said "ran away")... And that's exactly what we should have done when we heard that there's a new chef! RUN AWAY NOW!! They still have Vietnamese pho but more Thai now. The WORST pho ever! My sister found a hair AND a bug in her soup! She asked them to take it back and they took forever for another one, she wasn't hungry after waiting another 30 minutes for pho. My other sister found a hair net in hers but she decided to just eat it. The pho was lukewarm, the broth was salty and since it wasn't even hot the meat didn't cook and it stayed raw. My friend asked if they could just microwave her pho for it to be hot and cook the meat, again it took forever. How long does it take to microwave it? The only good dish was the drunken noodles, which wasn't exactly hot as well. We also got the seafood soup and it was cold, and too sweet. It's like they let it sit out... I don't think the chefs in the back are actually chefs, they probably hired a chef school drop out... I mean, pho soup should be hot, not lukewarm. You probably wondering, why are we getting pho on the strip? And not go to china town... We didn't have cars and were hungover and SEA is across from our hotel, trust me, paying $21 dollars for nasty ass cold pho with hair and bugs was not what we were looking for... This place should close down, it's a disgrace to Pho restaurants out there. I'm ashamed that I ate this.
Tuck Shop=Getting an RSVP at one of Montreal's best restaurants has become difficult. Liverpool House? Three-week wait. Le Hangar? Sure there's room, if you want to eat before 5:30pm or after 10:30pm. Bremner? No matter how early you plan, making an RSVP is difficult if no one answers the phone or calls you back - well done on joining Opentable. Ah yes, planning a night out is currently necessary even in Montreal, especially since popular restaurant trends promote smaller, cozier, bustling restaurants that fill up fast.That's how I finally ended up at Tuck Shop. I've wanted to try this place for a while, so I called a week early to reserve for a group, and opted for the dinner-table-style menu that includes 4 appetizers and 2 mains (a steal at $45 per person). A taste of everything for everyone? Aww yeahhh.We started with a salad - white beets, coriander, mango, arugula, radish, cucumbers and parmesan. It was yummy and refreshing, especially with the tart lemony dressing.Next, we had the most delicious smoked salmon ever. At Tuck Shop, the salmon is wild, house cured and smoked, and comes with "potato rosti", trout caviar and cr√®me fraiche. And I repeat - delicious.Our third appetizer consisted of cheese tacos. Made with fried mozzarella, coriander, corn and lettuce, they were soft and delightful. Awesome, because tacos can easily be flavourless. It might be surprising, but it's true.Our last appetizer included caramelized salmon with bok choy, root veggies and quinoa. The salmon was crispy on the outside and prepared to the point of a perfect soft pink on the inside. The veggies were cooked but crunchy. Delish.Having forgotten how many dishes were included in our menu, we thought our meal was over. Lo and behold, the waitress came over to tell us that our mains were on their way. Oh baby! These included the most mouthwatering jerk chicken accompanied by black bean pur√©e and fried okra. It was spicy and juicy and everything jerk chicken should be. Perfection.Finally, our last main consisted of hanger steak with chimichurri, wild mushrooms and rapini. Again, so good. And the best part? We didn't even have to say "medium-rare".We wrapped up our meal with three delicious desserts to share. Tiramisu, warm apple pie, and caramel fleur de sel "cheesecake". The tiramisu was good, but not something to rave about. It's ok - a tiny bit of sub-perfection makes Tuck Shop human. The apple pie was amazing - warm and so satisfying with its crumbly crust and just-sweet-enough apple center.  Needless to say, our favorite was the caramel fleur de sel "cheesecake" that was more of a silken cheesy-caramel-y-salty-cream than a cheesecake. Whoa.Yes, I absolutely loved Tuck Shop. It made me think of a smaller Orignal and a non-pretentious Garde Manger. The music was super fun (Tom Petty and Gypsy Kings, anyone?) and added to the bon-vivant vibe that permeated the small restaurant. The service was good and the food was varied and delicious. I do hope that Tuck Shop's tables continue to be difficult to book for a while - it would certainly be well deserved.Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere 9.5/10, Pretty people 9/10, Music (superfun, goodvolume) 9.5/10, Service 8.5/10.Pictures: http://www.belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/tuck-shop/What an incredible meal I just had last night at Tuck Shop! After a long wait to finally try this place out, I managed to snag a table for four just a couple of days before we wanted to come by. For starters, the team at this resto is probably one of the friendliest, most hospitable I've found in Montreal! The service was perfect: approachable but professional.Taking a look at the one-page menu I spotted starter items like beef tartare (a must), market salad, fresh burrata, cured salmon with homemade tzatziki, crispy pork belly,  just to name a few. Reading over the mains: Rib Eye steak, Ricotta Gnocchi, Duck Magret, Arctic Char, Hanger Steak, all served with fresh, seasonal sides -- a very tough decision! Our group decided to start with the Beef Tartare, Cured Salmon, and Crispy Pork Belly. Boy, did we clean off the plates! The beef tartare is served with a type of celeriac slaw and matchstick fries with aioli. Incredibly delicious! The salmon was oh-so delicate, served with paper-thin crisps and veggies, and the homemade tzatziki was just right. The Pork Belly (an obvious hit at the table) was out of this world! A cube of perfectly crisped pork belly served in a creamy morel sauce -- a dish that will remain in your memory.On to the mains. Dishes ordered around the table included a 16oz Rib Eye steak, the Duck Magret, and Arctic Char. As I couldn't decide which main to order since it all sounded incredible, I let our waitress surprise me. The Rib Eye was a beautiful cut, cooked to perfection (medium), and served on a creamy bed of mashed potatoes with a side of grilled Quebec Asparagus. I'm not a big meat lover but this dish was perfect! I could not say anything less about the duck that my friend ordered. It was served with a sort of fresh, citrus salad which balanced out the gaminess of the duck amazingly. Also, cooked to perfection. My first time actually trying arctic char, and definitely not the last, this dish was not lacking in taste. My surprise dish was their homemade Ricotta Gnocchi served with a very hearty vegetarian "bolognese" sauce consisting of carrots, mushrooms, etc. -- meat was not missed on this dish! The portion was spot on as gnocchi tends to be very filling. Fresh shaved parmesan was a great addition.Of course, a meal this flawless must include dessert -- especially if said dessert is homemade by "la maman de Theo"! One of our party was celebrating a birthday. The waitress brought out an incredible platter of brownies, apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and a pot of (if I remember correctly) caramel cheesecake. We enjoyed these desserts with some dessert wine and porto. Honestly, this whole meal was so perfect and I'm certain that my dinner mates would agree. I cannot encourage anyone more to dine at Tuck Shop as it really is an experience -- from the service to the atmosphere to the perfect food reflective of what is in season....Go! I must add that I am a big fan of creative cooking with ingredients that reflect local produce and seasonal ingredients. All over each of our dishes we could spot in-season asparagus and fiddleheads (or t√™tes de violon as they are called in French) -- loved it! Please, do yourelf and someone special a favour and go eat here if you haven't been yet. And, if you have, go again since the menu changes often! (Note: I would say that the price range is about $$ - $$$ depending on how many dishes you order & wine. For our group of four with one bottle of wine @ 44$, four starters, four mains, dessert and digestifs, the total was about 80$/person w/ tip. I would have gladly paid more than that for the meal that I had! The dishes are well-priced as is the wine list.)
Jet's Pizza=I don't know about you, but a move is not complete without pizza delivered. Recently I moved and just didn't have the energy to make anything to eat or go anywhere. I remembered getting Jet's Pizza coupons in the mail and decided to give them a try.They do a fast delivery! I got a basic special: pizza, breadsticks, and wings. It was all so good...greasy like crazy, but delicious! They have a great price point, deliver, and make my taste buds happy, what more can I say?I live in a pizza Bermuda triangle where almost all my options are chain stores.  I'm outside the delivery areas of Intermezzo, Libretto's (both locations), Pure Pizza, etc. *shakes fist*  The few non-chain places that deliver (looking at you, Wolfman) fail to impress.Jet's Pizza was my last ditch effort to find good delivery pizza.  The reviews were good, the website was decent, and I could order online.  Looked promising.  Everything went smoothly until it came time for the actual delivery.My apartment complex is gated, so you have to ring a call box and be buzzed through.  The delivery guy reached me on the call box and I hit the number on my phone to allow him in. I am literally (proper use) the first building on the right after passing the gate.  It takes a car 10 seconds at most to get to us.10 minutes go by.  No pizza.  No sign of the car outside my window.15 minutes go by.  No pizza.  I call the pizza place and ask where their guy is.  The manager said he hadn't gotten into my complex and was still waiting outside.  I politely corrected him by saying I had successfully buzzed the dude through.  The manager would give him another call and see what was happening.20 minutes passes.  I called the restaurant again.  The manager was getting irritated with me and gave me attitude, as if it were my fault that the driver couldn't find my apartment.  In an antagonistic fashion he finally barked, "What, you want a credit?"At this point I gave up hope on getting a hot pizza.  Or a pizza at all.  "Sure," I replied.  Manager confirmed the credit and hung up.  25 minutes later, I hear a knock at my door.His excuse, "My GPS took me the wrong way."  Normally I would have given him the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I had written turn-by-turn instructions on how to get to my house on the order.  I could see them printed out on the ticket he had in his hand.  The one he chose to ignore for 25 minutes.A 10 second trip past a gate became a 25 minute odyssey of crappy customer service and lame excuses. It's a real shame because when I finally tried the pizza it wasn't bad for lukewarm deep dish.  Even with a credit waiting for me I'd be hard pressed to give them another chance.  Crap customer service always leaves a bad taste no matter how good the food.
Mattie's Diner=Mattie's deserves another star...why?Fantastic flapjacks, folks. Freakin' fantastic. I kid you not, I indulged in one of the best breakfasts I've had in quite some time. I'm a total pain in the ass and ordered my flapjacks with more toppings than a deluxe pizza. Yes, I went with flapjacks with bananas, pecans and chocolate chips. It was a mass of amazing. The flapjacks were chock full of those delicious morsels, light and fluffy on the inside and had a nice, light crisp on the outside. Oh, and let's not forget the sausage patties. Taaaaasty little patties, they were. I have been thinking about those pancakes every morning. Thanks Matties, now in addition to your incredible milkshakes I'm now addicted to your flapjacks. Hello my name is Nicole and I am a Mattie's flapjack addict.How have I not reviewed Mattie's before?! I'm pretty much a regular over at Mattie's Diner and have had lunch there plenty of times. The service is always on point and friendly - never had to wait more than the standard time to receive my food which is basically unheard of. I tend to always get the Big Holla with tomato, which is a massive grilled cheese... no no, understand the word massive. This is definitely a big kid grilled cheese and it is STUFFED with cheese. As soon as you pull apart the sandwich the cheese is falling off the slices. Awesome sauce. I also dig the California wrap (I think that's what it's called) which is actually served on a pita and not a wrap. But it's turkey, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce and tomato. Also a winner and tastes fresh every time. I tend to pair these with either the mashed potatoes or the mac and cheese, which also doesn't skimp on the cheese and as an avid cheese lover, hey, I appreciate that, Mattie's! Another favorite is the buffalo dip - mighty tasty although the dip is a bit runny and I prefer my dips a bit more thicker but still worth an order. All in all, if it is your first time remember it is an old-fashioned diner which means it's a bit small and the grill cooks are right in front of you cooking up your order - which doesn't bother me but just a heads up. The diner is open 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays so great for a late night bite after running around the Music Factory. They also served about 8 selections of bottled beers and about a dozen different milkshakes as well. Nice  : )It's been awhile since I ate here. We stopped by on Sunday for lunch because I was craving breakfast food. I was expecting more expensive menu but was surprised to find a breakfast plate for $4.99. It was the SOS, the gravy on toasts caught my eyes. I live and die for sausage gravy and theirs was pretty good. They layered half a toast and half a sauage pattie and covered it with gravy with 2 eggs on the side. Lots of food for the price. The picky eater ordered wings, and the wings are of good size. Our lunch tab was less than $15 for 2 people, not bad not bad. The service was good as well, and it seems like they have a good crowd of regulars. I may just have to come here more often.
Jimmy Woo's=I've often used the word Chinamerican to help describe food being made at some Chinese restaurants. This type Americanized Chinese cookery usually includes the same suspects like sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, lo mein and can be found pretty much anywhere except Old Town Scottsdale. Now the owners of Geisha A Go Go and Stingray Sushi have opened another Asian concept capturing the essence of Chinamerican, Jimmy Woo's. While cool and modern inside, they somehow managed to pay homage to the type of Chinese restaurants I knew when I was a kid. There are no white and pink table cloths here but the half moon shaped black leather booths, dim lighting and old school Chinese menu evokes a 70's mod vibe. Be sure to check out the enormous abacus, it'll be the largest you'll ever see. Outdoors, Woo's has a fantastic patio that faces Scottsdale Road which is great for people watching.Woo's offers a daily happy hour that starts at 3pm, which gets you drink discounts and a well priced small plates menu. Offerings such as plump and juicy Pan Fried Pork Dumplings ($4) and a plate full of fork tender, lightly fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($5.25) are stand outs. If you pair these with a carafe of hot Sake ($4), happy hour could be a meal in of itself.Looking over you'll notice that it's all about the classics and these classics are done pretty well, starting with Hot and Sour Soup ($5.95). Yes this is on every single Chinese menu around town but Woo's version adds tofu, mushrooms, egg, bamboo and chicken making for a hearty robust soup. Be sure to ask for some chili paste, the nose clearing effect is like tasty medicine. After one bite of the Chinese Chicken Salad ($8.95), you couldn't help but notice that while well dressed in a peanut ginger dressing, it lacked any sort of flavor punch. Made with napa cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, snap peas and scallions then topped with fried noodles and almonds, the ingredients were vibrant and fresh. Hopefully they reconfigure their dressing since the added brightness from citrus juice or vinegar can be key to taking ho-hum to wow. Slightly crispy, tender, sweet and sour tossed with bits of chili and citrus peel, the Orange Beef ($13.95) was decent. For me this is what Asian style cooking is all about, appealing to many of my senses without any one being overwhelmed. However on another visit this dish was so overly sweetened and gloopy that it was pretty much inedible. Different chef?I thought it was funny the veggie only, Eggplant with Tofu and Mushroom ($15) dish was one of the most expensive on the menu. Don't get me wrong, this dish was tasty with its slightly sweet sauce and well cooked vegetables it's just priced oddly high. I found it  funny that many of the shrimp and scallop dishes are priced less than this one. Go figure. Jimmy Woo's may woo you with its sophisticated yet fun atmosphere, but for me it was the friendly service and their ability to make Chinese hip and cool. I only wish the food was as hip and cool.
South Beach Cafe & Deli=On my way to the Classic Gaming Expo at the Tropicana Hotel I decided to stop by this deli for lunch while I waited for a friend of mine to show up.  I ordered the Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye and a side of Fries.The place wasn't too busy, but it took forever to get my order.....it was pretty slow.  I knocked off 1 Star for that.  The Pastrami Sandwich was very good and the Fries were a little too salty and nothing to write home about.The prices here are pretty high, I paid $15 for a Sandwich, Fries, and a bottle of Water....ouch!  At least the Sandwich was good, otherwise I'd be a little pissed.Will I return?  Maybe.
Brick=This place is a little like the white kid in Scottsdale who listens to way too much rap.  It's in AZ center which will always have a pretty corporate feel.  Second it's in the old Pizzeria Uno and there was enough of the old decor left to still feel like one.  They did do some updates and the bar looks great, but the updates do just enough to make it feel like it's trying to be something other than what it appears.  The music that was playing was great and I heard plenty that was on the playlist I had going before I walked in.The service was fair.  It started off a little spotty but quickly picked up.  Servers are definitely the stereotypical hipster  type.  Take that as a positive or a negative but it definitely goes far in setting the tone of the place.The menu looked incredible.  I had a white pizza with jalapenos, onions, and chicken.  It was tasty but I felt the jalapenos were a bit overpowering and I love spicy food.  I saw lots of items with pork belly which is exciting and my update will definitely include something along those lines.All in all I will give it another chance but was a bit underwhelmed the first time out.Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous! Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!Terrible service. Had a bachelorette party of 14, they took our reservation and did not honor it as "they got too busy". They did not apologize, nor make an offer and worse... did not call us to inform us they gave away the table. We even arrived early and they said "We got busy, you can go somewhere else". Absolutely Terrible!So we went to 1130 which as a restaurant next door to them, and they were AMAZING! Great service and even gave our party a discount and free drinks for the inconvenience and terrible service we received at Brick.
Lakeside=Steve Wynn is a radical vegan these days, so all his restaurants feature vegan options. I am most definitely NOT a vegan...but I like to try new stuff, so a friend took me out for a little sampling one night. We started with appetizers at SW steakhouse (see my other review), and then walked across the hall for dinner here.Food-wise, the vegan menu was about the same as at SW. We ordered the "clam" chowder, which was ASTONISHINGLY like real clam chowder -- they use chopped oyster mushrooms to give that rubbery clam mouthfeel you know and love, and I swear even the crustiest old sea dog out of Nantucket wouldn't know the difference.For entrees, we had the "crab" cakes and the "fried chicken," which was made from this weird protein substitute called Gardein. Whatever it is -- it is AWESOME! Tastes like chicken, feels like chicken, looks like chicken...who knows what the hell it REALLY is (knowing the capitalist kingpin proletariat-grinders who frequent the Wynn, probably Soylent Green).The waiter (actually, now that I think about it, it was the sommelier...the waiter wasn't too engaging)  was very attentive to our desire to try vegan stuff, so he had them send us a vegan bread basket, with vegan butter (more soylent green). It was great! We also had some wine, and then strayed from the vegan shtick for dessert, and ordered a few fun fruity little things that were fantastic.Atmosphere-wise, I appreciate the fact that this restaurant is half open-air, on a sort of patio overlooking one of the fake lakes at the Wynn, facing a giant waterfall. Every 20-30 minutes or so, a cheesy 5-minute "show" takes place on the waterfall: two balls of colored light dance around, cooing and making weird sex noises until a little baby ball pops out. Weird! Another show features two giant steampunk-esque mechanical flowers that bloom and sort of flirt with each other in a creepy flowery way. Another mini-show is a weird avant-garde 80s pop-art extravaganza set to that lame-ass 80s song "Oh Yeah" by Yello. YOU know the one. And the last vignette (or whatever the hell you want to call this weird/lame-ass shit) is this SUPER-cheesy giant frog in a UBER-corny black Stetson who sings Garth Brooks's "I've Got Friends in Low Places." W..............T.....................F!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know Steve Wynn is a vegan.....but maybe he should lay off those MUSHROOMS a little...ya know?!?!?!?!!!!!!The typical New American seafood restaurant, with the prerequisite fresh raw bar and delicious, fish offerings sauced and dressed to turn the good into the sublime.  Solid.So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other "services" in Vegas)Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.  The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.Good wine list.  Resort prices.Indulge.  It's Vegas!We dined here at Lakeside on Saturday night with two other couple. It's located inside Wynn right across the SW steakhouse. This Restuarant is beautiful & has a waterfall outside. They played a laser show every 20 min or so. It was so nice. The lighting & the colors of the restuarant is just perfect. The bathrooms are so nice with orange sink. Very unique & trendy ambiance.They have the Rib Eye Glatt Kosher steak!!!! I personally asked to see it, it was sealed & had the OU sign. I was so happy that they had this service. We ordered the Glatt kosher Rib-eye steak, the black bass & 2 of our friends ordered the regular steak with chili & crab on it. All dishes were very delicious. Mine was a bit more well-done than what I wanted it to be but I was so happy I was having kosher steak in a Restuarant like that with the beautiful ambiance, I didn't care at all. Usually when we go to restaurants, my husband & I are forced to get sea food because they don't have a kosher option. We just have to sit & watch our friends eating their yummy steak while we eat our boring salmon!! So the fact that we could have our kosher steak with everyone else was just priceless.I also heard all restaurants at Wynn have vegetarian & vegan menu.For desert, we ordered the coffee creme br√ªl√©e (very unique), orange chocolate & macadamia donut with tea & coffee. The desert was so delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness. Not too sweet.We asked to be seated outside for the desert part so we can watch the waterfall show better. Jason, our waiter was so nice, respectful & he made that happen. The service was outstanding, I highly recommend this place & will go back to it next time I go to Vegas.
Stick E Rice=What a pleasant surprise !Probably give the place 4.5 stars but round down because it's a STUPID NAME FOR A RESTAURANT !  also, not sure i understand the location - would've loved it 5 months ago when i worked about 200 yards away - even then, the place is way off the street so it's not easily seen.the space is clean  comfortable.We orderedThom khaThai beef saladyellow chicken curryregular rice and sticky rice (or is it stick E rice ?)sticky rice w/ fried banana and coconut ice creamNothing over $10 ( the curry might be if you order shrimp ) the standouts - the curry was excellent ! Dessert also very good.  I liked that the beef in the salad was tender and the dressing had a nice citrus-y tang to it.  The Thom Kha was "standard"Not sure where this place fits in the  Las Vegas Thai restaurant order - i put it above the "chains" - Pin Kaow / Archi's, better than Kung Fu, definitely better than Krung Siam ( that place has really dropped for me ) , I'm waiting to see how Mix Zone does under the new owners ( first visit - ok )  - I still gotta hit Komol and yes, I'm still a fan of LOS.crappy / blurry pics included
Kickstand Burgers & Bar=Something had to be done at the mess formerly known as the Common House, and it seems they've found a new formula that should work.Kickstand is a burger place at its core, but it also served as a pretty decent neighborhood bar, complete with reasonable drink specials and TVs for all the sports fans.  In fact, they've got so many TVs in there it's a bit outlandish.  They've got TVs on their TVs.I got the New Orleans cajun spiced burger and asked them to spice it up with a bunch of jalapeno pepper.  They did a really nice job with the burger.  I got this "potato cake" on the side, which turned out to be a type of cheeseless au gratin, if that makes any sense you you.  It was pretty tasty.  The whole meal was very satisfying.  My wife got a turkey burger and declared it quite tasty.  She opted for a side of tater tots, half regular and half sweet potato.  I'd never had sweet potato tots before, but I discovered I like them a lot.  They serve the sweet tots with this butter sauce that really is a little too rich and over the top.They had a bunch of good beer on tap, and on Tuesdays, several draft choices are $2.50/pint.  Also, they've got trivia on Tuesdays at 9 p.m.One little hiccup was that about half the tots on my wife's plate arrived cold.  The waitress got a hot replacement order to us right away.  They seem very eager to get the food and the service right.  If they stay focused on food quality and service, they will hopefully avoid going down that long downward spiral that finally spun the Common House out of business.Where can you find a juicy and delicious burger, friendly staff and kitchsy atmosphere? Kickstand!I was really intrigued about Kickstand so when a business contact suggested lunch here I jumped at the chance. What I walked into was a really relaxed vibe with bicycles all around - in their menu, on the premises, etc. I like it! Plus, they are working through some great events that will benefit local nonprofits through this bicycle feel, so that's just grand with me. So, I bet you're wondering about the food, aren't you? Well, here we go...Beer selection: Nice selection overall...lots of seasonal brews, too! Specials looked pretty super, too. Fixed Gear Burger: Their juicy classic cheddar cheeseburger cooked to absolute perfection - I had a bit of pink in my burger which made me practically drool all over the table. Total noms. Plus, the cheese was super duper melty - total win. With these two qualities, plus a toasted bun I was a very, very happy camper.Sweet potato tots: I love me a tot and these have potential. They are eponymous: sweet potato tater tots and served with a mapley buttery dipping sauce. I just wish that they were a bit saltier -  some kosher sea salt added to the mix would be delicious, as I'm a huge fan of the sweet/salty combo. If Kickstand boosts the flavor/richness/saltiness and I'll have to restrain myself from turning into a tater tot. Parfait desserts: These were on the house as they asked my dining partner and me to give them a try. There were three kinds: chocolate brownie, strawberry cheesecake and key lime. As I'm such a sugar head as it is, these were pretty damn tasty. Creamy parfaits (no, not yogurt) topped with deliciousness of all sorts. My favorite was actually the key lime. These are listed for $3 each and they are a really generous and sweet (ha-pun) end to the meal. I truly enjoyed Kickstand and I'm very much looking forward to coming back.I have a personal rule whenever I visit a restaurant - everything deserves a second try. On my first visit to Kickstand, I went with a friend and we sat outside on the little patio area. The food was decent but not exceptional. The burger itself was pretty plain, but the toppings and bun made up for it. I had sweet potato fries and they were a decent compliment, if not a bit squishy. They were served with a thick sludgy brown sugar syrup that was more sweet than flavorful. Decent service balanced it out, and I was ready to give it a second shot.On my second trip, the service was beyond great. The wait staff turned our in-booth TV to the Virginia Tech football game because they saw us wearing our school colors. The food on the second trip was... Well, again, mediocre. I got the Hungover Cyclist which is a variant on my personal holy grail of burgers - the grilled-cheese buns hamburger. I've had it in several places that all put their spin on this cheesy miracle. I really hate to say it, but the one in my neighborhood did the worst. The grilled cheeses were enormous Texas toast slices that drowned out any flavor of cheese or burger with gummy bread. In addition, the only topping on the burger was tomato - even though I asked for some lettuce for balance, I didn't get it. Just a meat patty and a tomato slice between two incredibly awkward grilled cheeses.So I gave it a third shot as a rubber match. I went solo and sat at the bar and left Kickstand completely frustrated. I happened to be there at the same time as another customer that came separately and sat down shortly after. The entire time I was there, the bartender never addressed us individually - he took our orders together, brought our food together, checked in on us at the same time, and brought our checks together. He spent the rest of the time leaning against the bar watching the news. In a complete class-act moment while watching a report about Obama in Indonesia, he remarked that Obama said "It's great to be back in my birth country of Indonesia once again." I'm not a political person, I don't care what your side is, but if you're going to make completely idiotic and aggressive statements then we're done. I've got better things to do with my time than eat a mediocre burger served by a mediocre staff.Planned and hosted many an event here. Must say that this is our go-to spot in Plaza. You really can't go wrong with $1 PBR every night of the week. (Hipsters UNITE!)The staff has always been so kind and willing to get to know us as regulars. Derek, Justin, Telley, Jenny, Sunny and Jessica are always smiling and busting to make sure everything is running shipshape. My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here and Bryson did an amazing job serving our group of close to 50 people. One server, one room. He conquered it. I've had my last two birthday parties here. Flawless as well. The private dining room is awesome. You can shut the doors and make it more intimate for your group. Great option. Been to many a catered event here as well. They have a great system down. The Food: You can't really find a burger on the menu that you won't like. (I recommend the cuban, running machine or the pocket press) Recently tried the sliders and they are rockin'. Wings are awesome. Head over on Wednesdays for $.50 wings. Great flavors. Especially crazy about Barbalo (Buffalo/BBQ)Definitely one of our staples in the QC. Can't believe I'm just now writing this review.We came to kickstand for a Wednesday night because we heard it was trivia night. We arrived around 7:30 to get a good seat and boy, did it pack up quick. We ordered a really delicious bbq chicken flatbread and a bottle of wine to keep us company while we took a stab at the trivia questions.I have to say this is the best trivia night at any restaurant around the area that I have been to. What is great about the trivia here is that they had a mix of questions that anyone could answer (e.g Candy Slogans). I actually left trivia night not feeling like the dumbest human being in Charlotte. The only recommendation I would suggest is that they read off the top ten names for every round, since we spend so time marinating on a humorous name.Definitely need to come back here again for trivia night and a delicious meal.
