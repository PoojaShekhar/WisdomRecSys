(file:/home/poojashekhar/Downloads/CS5560 - Tutorial 9 Source Code/Spark_KMeans_FV/data/20_news_group/sample,Restaurant name Wild Thaiger sentiment positive review text the Wild Thaiger be one of my new favorite place every dish I have try as be excellent they accomodate with some grace a friend with food allergy and be polite too polite in serve I as I unknowingly arrive just at close the peanut sauce on the satay be amazing pad Thai be a standby at a Thai place but it definitely do not disappoint here the beef curry be excellent the ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good Coconut ice cream dessert be good for put out the fire good place to go after a Art or Heard museum visit I actually like this place I find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right the food be well prepared and the alcoholic drink be fantastic Martinis my one complaint they need to add some more vegetarian dish I find myself order this great appetizer every time I go there because it be the only thing with tofu on it anyway it be a great place for a date the wait be pretty long but I m not a very patient person I ll admit I go during lunch with my family so I be able to taste a bit of a few dish First of all they lunch menu be really small when I sit down and realize that my favorite dish weren t even on they menu I be immediately disappointed I have they papaya salad and honestly it wasn t that great it be actually one of the worst one I have ever have the flavoring be really off how do I know I be Thai and grow up there so I know what som tum be suppose to taste like and it really do not taste like that I have some of they pad thai also and be really really disappointed I mean for the price they charge and for the wait time and horrible service I be really expect something really good the mood be actually really nice they decoration and open kitchen be a really nice touch which be what they be get the star for however it do become very loud very fast when the room fill up it be difficult to keep a conversation going for all the hype that people have make about this place I honestly expect a lot better but even if I walk in without any expectation I would have still be disappointed oh Wild Thaiger how I do love thee actually to be more specific how I do love pad thai I hadn t be to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigate around Central Avenue these day but it be my co worker be birthday and she want Wild Thaiger I m so so glad we go there and I be double happy this afternoon when I eat my leftovers for lunch the best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger besides that it be so good be that there be so much I always have lunch the next day which be just lovely a note for those south of McDowell try to get to Wild Thaiger drive up rd Street and turn leave on Roanoke you ll dead end into a strip mall parking lot park there and walk a few step south to Wild Thaiger Viola I give this place star instead of because I order a Coke and it taste funny like way too soda watery when I tell the waitress she sort of shrug and say a lot of people say that yeah I have to ask so can I get something different please but my pathetic Coca Cola aside it be a great lunch and she even bring my co worker toast coconut ice cream in a coconut dish with a candle how sweet over price over crowded designer Thai joint I have only be there once and for lunch but it be the kindof underwhelming experience that make it not worth the trip back first off if you come at lunch time you have to deal with hoard of suit who come here for it be lush interior design to serve as the backdrop to they loud and uninteresting war story next you have to accept a very short and unimpressive lunch menu that have next to nothing that I usually get at a Thai restaurant finally you have to sift through a very bland and unauthentic entree with excellent presentation I really should go back and try it again but with the likes of Thai Hut now open I don t know why I ever would unless I be force through a work trip especially with how bland the food be for a Thai restaurant I prefer Thai food that light I up like a Christmas tree I like this place although it get really busy around noon my favorite dish be gapraogui I love how the kitchen be visable while you be dine and you dont smell like the kitchen when you leave I mostly go for the food its not a place I would hang out there with people and drink the Wild Thaiger be the best keep Thai restaurant secret on North Central Avenue my first culinary experience at Thaiger be several month ago with co worker my omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I have be habitual customer since Office employee flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friend or relative back at night or on the weekend to share they secret the restaurant atmosphere be very friendly and unpretentious the food be where the adventure begin for a flaming start Tom Yum Goong be a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger The soup be a concert of spicy hot lemony flavor that leave you want more Don t fret you can always order more to go Dragon s Eggs be paramount on we list of favorite s starter these dumpling be stuff with pork and crab wrap in tender wrapping nestle in fresh vegetable and come with a seasoned dip sauce the lunch and dinner menu be delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit order hint each plate be make to you specification if you want more curry spicier or hotter you only need to ask Desert Hint The Coconut Ice cream be make onsite it be delicious and contagious drink hint a nice compliment to the food be a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea it be very common for the olashawn owner and head chief to leave the open kitchen to seat greet and serve she guest she be the heart of the Wild Thaiger as Marcial and I leave and thank she for another wonderful meal she gracious smile hand clasp and graceful bow keep we come back note METRO Lightrail construction have impact this restaurant and you need to follow construction sign carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger Drive slow this Tiger be worth hunting in the concrete jungle ok I didn t want to go here because the name sound like wild thingy which sound like bad porn movie also look pretty sketch from the outside but I have learn that be pretty common in Phoenix my Thai craving kick in and I have to have some thingy it be pack inside for a weekday night which be a good sign my tom yum soup and spicy basil chicken be right on the mark I think this would be a great carry out place and from all the sack line up I guess everyone else like to eat thingy too bland blech barf that be pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger the food here be the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venture into lean Cuisine territory I suppose though it be the closest we downtowner have to real Thai until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant move in you be on notice Wild Thaiger I think I give it a fair shake I eat here a total of four time with different people and different food I be not impressed once in fact I be pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weave itself through my molded mound of rice no spice no life no business from I UPDATE finally I and the Thaiger be purr like happy kitten I have discover they yellow curry at lunch and it be dee lish price be insanely low tho the lunch menu be limited service be upbeat and more polished now a purrrrfect place for I to lunch hello Kitty I think hello Kitty be wildier than this cat veggie tempura I have have crispier wafer from a priest pad Thai Wouldn t say it be bad but hmmm what be the word I m thinking of oh I know bland I have have tastier wafer from a priest I love the chef very approachable and like totally super nice wait staff on the two occasion I have be there be a little inactive I have have more action from a priest I ll go again try new thing but only after I do the Rosary have lunch here last year I be presently surprised the building be unique the location sublime and the cuisine be way above average I be big on the yellow chicken curry Yum have dinner here recently I be somewhat surprised that it be not the same tremendous experience I have remember at lunch so long ago perhaps they be slip or more likely I be I have to go with a solid star on this one because even if the food be not spicy enough for you there be so many other reason to love it the atmosphere be great I like everything from the table and booth to the patio it be easy to hang out and have a good meal with friend or to tuck yourself away in a corner the service have always be top notch for I I have be there when I be in a hurry and I be able to eat and run without have to beg for service i also have have long leisurely dinner and be always happy with the attentive but not pushy service I love they pad thai it be a little different from the other place I have go in a good way I m only sorry they have have such a time with the construction outside they door a nice place doesn t deserve that hassle I have hear quite a bit about this thai place that be down the street from my office after mo of hear about it finally we decide to walk over and pick up some food then I read some of the yelp review and almost change my mind the review be pretty bad several report of poor service and the the most alarmingly one of all point out how bland and flavorless the food be also there be description of it be a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent server do the tempe pita jungle server moonlight at wild thaiger I be surprise because all the time I drive past it before realize how popular it be I think it look typical of a thai asian place the name be silly and cheesy and the giant purple banner that take up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest have just the eye of a tiger stare at you from they very purple perch how can this place possibly be too cool I check out they web site which I be surprise to find they have one as this place look pretty hole in the wall so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up the site be pretty slow and I almost give up but I be pretty stoke on the option and the price Grilled peanut chicken sound great spicy chicken curry I ll take it tiger prawn salad ok all for about sound pretty reasonable I go with the curry chicken and the spring roll all lunch item come with either soup of the day or the roll unless you take out as they win t can t do soup to go off we go and when we walk up I be surprise to find that the ramada like large patio with high wall and iron bar take up the entire front of the building we have to search around for the hidden entrance once inside it be busy with a downtown business casual crowd but a scurry waitress still hold the door and ask if we want a table for the record she be not in skinny jeans flat and sport ton of eyeliner and a fauxhawk as I figure she would be we walk up to the bar to collect we food and pay and the lively atmosphere make I sad we be go back to the office and not eat there the bar area have a flat screen tv there be lively if a little over the top asian pop music and the healthy crowd be a nice change of pace alas we be in and out they be not even put out by we ask to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately even though they be obviously busy in under minute the food stay pretty hot for the minute walk back and they double bag each styrofoam box thank god as half my curry sauce come out of the box it smell great and the veggy look good but I brace myself for disappointment perhaps because I be expect it to be bad I be pleasantly surprised it be pretty good Mine be just enough spicy as be for I though and I m a wuss so if you be into hot hot hot ask to punch it up a notch or three and the serve be plenty for the price the veggie spring roll be great not even soggy from the trip how do that happen I think the curry sauce be a little thin but it wouldn t keep I from order it again my coworker be ginger chicken sauce look thin as well but she say it be still great the tiger prawn salad have green fresh lettuce look like a spring mix and come with lot of scrimp that be fat and juicy however they list that the salad come with crispy wonton but she box be san any wonton really the only foil in the entire experience all in all I would say it be a score the three of we agree that it would make a good hh spot it be no yupha s but certainly better than thai basil and not a chain plus they be still busy busy despite be smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central they must be do something right my husband and I just move to Phoenix from Northern California the land of good Thai and Wild Thaiger be the first Thai place we try in the Valley of the Sun let s just say that the quality ingredient and entice flavor make we feel a little less homesick the price be not rock bottom but I be always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portion both of which Wild Thaiger offer the papaya salad be refreshing and really authentic although the shrimp be a little fishy for we taste the soup we have be also very flavorful and best of all the chicken in it be actual piece of chicken breast often the chicken in soup be small piece of dark meat the Mussaman curry be also a lot better than most place we have have it often restaurant use piece of flank or strip steak but a more authentic version like the one we have here have more stew like cut of almost braise beef also a real winner be the spicy clear glass noodle with vegetable and chicken and lest I forget alcohol the crowning glory of any meal the specialty drink offer seem like they would be too sweet or weak so my sister and I get Cosmos they be appropriately strong and actually quite good all around a really great experience ok I have try this place a month or so ago at lunch and be unimpressed but the other day a friend say she want it for dinner I oblige I be blow away by the Panang curry Rich thick spicy we have it for take out and it survive the trip home fine I now need to go back and try some other dish just to make sure it wasn t just a freak occurrence be a bit of a Thai fan I have drive by Wild Thaiger a number of time only to find it next to impossible to get reliable access due to all the light rail construction I suspect my frustration and quitter mentality be pretty commonplace during the construction now that the rail be almost up and run and get to Wild Thaiger isn t such a chore I go with a group of to try this place out when you walk in you immediately notice how dark it be as the lighting give off by candle and the kitchen in the back I have be to plenty of restaurant that do this to set the mood of the place so I don t mind candlelight however this place be almost pitch black at time to where I couldn t see my dish so they could improve on the light a little bit the booth be small and set up very nice if you be just out on a date with you special someone the menu selection isn t vast but have all the usual suspect curry noodle tofu dish etc I have the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggy on the side while the presentation be very nice the dish itself be just okay almost everyone in the group I be with also have a currie dish and agree the presentation be more impressive than the taste itself the one gal who get a noodle dish however say hers be terrific most of we get dessert to finish thing off I get a slice of the mango cheesecake very tasty another person get the lemon ginger cheesecake and be very happy everyone else get slice of the chocolate cake which be huge by the way they also have drink special on Monday and wednesday we go on Wednesday for wine glass night I be gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine but strangely the waiter strongly recommend against it I have a Shiraz instead which be fine most everyone else get a white wine overall the service be a little bit slow especially get we we check but it be adequate the waiter be knowledgable about the nuance of each dish which be good because two people in we group never have Thai food before amazingly when we originally sit down the restaurant be just about dead but after pm the place be packed not sure if this be normal but seem like alot of the folk who live in and around the downtown area need a late Thai fix Bottomline good but I have have better I commend Wild Thaiger and they people for survive the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt cripple they business base on what we have see this place have a pretty solid local follow so clearly they have do something right this place be okay if you be look to go out with a group but I d probably enjoy this place more if it be just I and my girlfriend we go back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and like it just as much as we do when we try it a few month ago my Cosmopolitan be just as big and tasty as it be last time and the service be still attentive and friendly my friend be a pescetarian flexitarian doesn t eat meat except for fish and we be really pleased to find that all of the dish we order that we usually get with meat be still absolutely delicious specifically the Pad see ew which we usually get with chicken or beef be still savory with just the fry tofu and perhaps even more amazing the Mussaman curry which usually come with a deliciously braised beef be still really flavorful and be compliment nicely by the tofu even after try a decent number of other Thai place in Phoenix we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar consistently good flavor great service and fun atmosphere and we will definitely continue to come here often wild thaiger be a convenient choice for quick and easy take out on a Thursday night I have no interest in cooking the menu be somewhat limit in my opinion no masaman or choo chee curry and no crispy duck which be my favorite Thai staple so I get a order of beef panang a order of pad thai and be intrigue by the dragon egg app the dragon egg be atrocious but the pad thai and beef panang be both good not great not mind blow but not horrible and for around each they be pretty good size portion I could see myself order take out again or actually dining in for a casual meal love this place for some decent Thai Shrimp Chicken Pad Thai be always good and never disappoint the soup be great I also really like they beef Panang they dessert always sound good and they usually have something that involve mango how I have escape never try one be beyond I they over all menu be a bit limited and be keep to the basics but what they do have be do well I have be craving Wild Thaiger for a year now last time I be in town they be close the flavor be perfectly blended the food be artistic and the food choice be unlike that I have see at two other Thai restaurant I have eat at recently they Thai Iced Tea have to be some of the best I have taste thus far its typically quiet which be perfect for girl s day out and chat Service be unpredictable sometimes it be very good and sometimes it be very bad the pad thai here be delicious but have way too much chicken the kiew wan curry be very spicy and very good the spring roll be also very tasty the hot pot be just ok a little too much coconut milk it make it a bit too sweet for dessert the coconut ice cream sprinkle with peanut be a great end it be open sunday which be rare downtown I have high hope for this restaurant it be a minute drive from Laveen as all be the Thai place in the area I order two of my staple Tom ka gai soup and green Curry and try a new dish for I holy Basil I get everything takeout I ll start with the Holy Basil it be very good a nice balance of Thai flavor and I think it be quite similar to a Ayam Basil dish I use to get at a malaysian place in Mt View CA my only complaint be that the chicken be big thick chunk like a fajita style I expect delicate tender meat at a high end Thai place I open my green curry and say WHERE S the sauce I be very upset at the lack of sauce there be so little I can t comment on the flavor of the curry and they have different type of green bean in there chinese long bean and american green bean the larger amercian green bean weren t cook that suck the beef be tender enough but the peice be too big the one redeeming part of this dish be the fact that they have eggplant in it there be something about eggplant in green curry the Tom ka gai soup be fantastic my only complaint would be the chicken which again be large fajita style slice Doesn t make sense to I while I be wait at the bar for my order I remember look into the kitchen and wonder how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space now I think I know I suspect they prep all of they meat ahead of time and use the same size shape cut for each dish to save time this result in a fajita style cut of chicken that leave I less than thrill overall the menu be brief and the food be good but I don t think it be worth a long drive I don t expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to swadee which be just fabulous I give this place a because the Tom ka gai soup and Holy Basil be very good I be however disappoint in the green curry the cut of meat and by the way they completely ignore my request for Thai spicy everything be rather mild in my opinion recently go back with a party of for a bday celebration it be my pick and I do consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small ish we be just a hole in the wall that happen to be really popular place like WT and sure enough we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least min before be approach by anyone in that time a friend who have arrive early and stake out at the bar inform I that as soon as she sit down she be tell that she couldn t order food because the kitchen be temporarily shut down because they be too busy at the time we arrive it be maybe percent full and she assure I that that have happen minute ago so they should be back on track by now the host finally show up and say she could seat we but it would be a while before the server would take we order bc they be recover well that be better than people block a entryway so I m not sure why she seem hesitant to seat we even if we have to wait for a server she assure we that we could order drink from we table until the kitchen be ready it be only downhill from there thankfully we be a jovial bunch under any other circumstance this experience would have be disastrous min to get drink order another to get the drink another min later he take we food order min later they start come out sort of seven entree come out stagger over a period of five minute but three entree all pad thai didn t arrive until at least min later when everyone else be finish I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of but they didn t even come close and at the time we make we food order it be at least a hour if not more after they allege huge rush that shut down the kitchen I get the peanut chicken grilled chicken with peanut sauce rice and grilled veggy the sauce be too citrus y for a peanut sauce and too thick funny that I complain in my first review that my curry be too thin chicken underneath be completely flavorless and be dry and veggy be scant good thing it be only Didn t get detail from anyone else except the bf who get the Kao Pad Jay and keep say over I m so glad I get this all these issue seem to be circumstantial except the chicken dish but then again how long have WT be a restaurant come on I m sure they have deal with many a Saturday night rush and someone ahem manager should have at least come out to explain apologize for they issue Don t think I ll go back to dine in ever I be at you grand opening I be there after and I m not there anymore Wild Thaiger be never a great option for Thai in the valley there aren t really any terrible aspect about the restaurant it be just that nothing really make you say wow this be good my last visit be with a friend who doesn t get out much he wife like good ol steak and potato so I think I d take he somewhere he couldn t go otherwise bad choice we order the peanut chicken and it taste more like peanut butter chicken it be overpower and also one of the first time I have ever send a dish back and ask for something else of course the service be good they never have anything better to do when back twice and the service be excellent both time and the pad thai be still pretty tasty but still too much chicken in it stop in for the first time after a show at the Phoenix Art Museum it be late but the staff be very accommodate all we end up order be some beer and a bunch of app but everything taste great and the service be pleasant we sit out on the patio which be a little noisy form the road noise but not bad we plan on go back for a full meal next time I call four time last night to place a to go order p p and get they recording each time either this place be so busy they can t get to the phone or they have close up early and go home I m still craving Thai and look for a great place in Central Phoenix any other suggestion or should I give this place another chance go to lunch at the Wild Thaiger yesterday after have no luck order to go a couple week ago we sit outside on the covered patio which be pretty busy we server be prompt and pleasant the food I order chicken with peanut sauce and jasmine rice the sauce be very flavorful but no heat at all I m use to peanut sauce with just a bit of heat and be mildly disappoint with this dish my friend order the pad Thai and it be good but again not much heat now we server do not ask we about star or heat at all if I be to go back I would order the pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce and add more heat all in all a affordable lunch good service and decent Thai food I would like to go back in the evening to check out the inside as I never set foot in it maybe try another dish too Phoenix Yelpers any other awesome Thai place to try I have have some good digestive experience here also I have kin who work here so that s another incentive for you to step in I be not a huge fan of Thai food mainly because I have not be expose to enough of it but I crave the beef panang from Wild Thaiger I have have it twice along with the pad Thai and Kimowi sp the iced green tea be refreshing and wish I have save room for the lemon ginger cheesecake I have try dine in and take out both dinner only and the only reason I don t go star be the very slow but friendly service plan to wait at least minute to be greet by you server and once the food be finally serve you on you own I have only be here once but what I eat be awesome I love that it be right off the light rail too we do a rail day not too far back where we just jump on the rail and tweet as we go follow recommendation from fellow twitter user we stop here for lunch and end up at the hear museum also right off the rail all in all a really great day good food good people and a ha beer I order the same stuff every Thai restaurant Coconut Ice cream be good eat at the bar they let I have the remote to the tv too perfect totally yummy food I love they appitizer veggie sampler and they dessert be good too I recommend the thai custard Wifey and I hit the Wild Thaiger up after a trip to the Phx Museum of Art great choice friendly service and modern decor the food be excellent Phoenix be lucky to have this place excellent Thai food consider sit out on the patio there be nice table and heater for the winter I be usually pretty bore with the spring roll I order at other restaurant but these be really good they offer some unusual menu choice as well such as corn fritter it be basically deep fried corn which sound awful but taste heavenly they be good about suit the spice level to you preference the staff be friendly and can offer good suggestion also they have a decent beer selection I meet someone here for dinner one night they have the best pad see ue sp that I have ever taste they sprinkle fried garlic over it and I love the burst of garlic every time I bite into one service be decent and the wait staff be very attentive we have papaya salad beef salad chicken and beef satay and green curry everything be delicious I live in the very northern part of Phoenix but do not mind the drive it be worth it great food and generally good service Lunch time can turn into a loong wait but it be always worth it Green Curry mmmmmmmmmmm oh Gaprao Gai how I love thee Nom my nd time here last time be part of a big group this time be much better able to relax and enjoy it have kimow chicken and must warn it hot but I like my Thai food hot my date he have the beef panang red curry beef also have Thai iced tea for drink definitely need something cold and refreshing and for dessert omg have lemon ginger cheescake be fantastic love this place and plan to return my second attempt to dine here as it be so busy the first time and so noisy that I have to leave it be during lunch hour and I don t like to wait arrive a few minute shy of the end of lunch so I be able to dine in peace order the tofu green curry and the fry banana and coconut ice cream for dessert I find the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price and I have have much tastier and creamier curry sauce elsewhere Tottie be Thai Elephant even Yupha s need I say more seriously wt s green curry taste about the same as Thai Hut s but at a portion that be about half or less of what I could get at th or any of the other place I have visit but I suppose the atmosphere be what I m pay for here that say I must admit that the fry banana dessert be delicious love the toast coconut on top well on top of the banana but under the syrup topping coconut ice cream whip top and maraschino cherry on my next visit when I m craving for something sweet I will ask to have the syrup topping whip cream and cherry omit the dish be perfect w out they Galee gai be the cure all for allergy the flu or a hangover Trust I I know hangover the waitress be all amazing and beautiful and nice Friday and Saturday night usually yield a awkward wait who be really here first I have never have a bad meal or experience here I love the Wild Thaiger it be the best Thai food I have experience in Phoenix they have plenty of vegetarian option and I have order just about all of they they be all equally delicious I love the corn fritter mmmmwent to Wild Thaiger two night ago I have be before but my girlfriend have not I love Thaiger so I want to share the tastiness I figure I would write a review since I have not yet wild thaiger be in the heart of uptown Phoenix Central and Thomas area Cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside Food be great and very fresh I like that you can see the entire kitchen from most of the table in the restaurant they have nothing to hide price be pretty standard at between for dinner entree great food and wonderful service nice change from other Thai restaurant in Tempe Chandler Mesa etc I be surprise at how good this place be a friend and I go on a whim and the crowd inside be a lot older s s and mostly just drink we order the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it be the best I have ever have in Arizona it be spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice be gloriously sticky we also try the hot tea I order the gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she get the Lemon Souffle and both be beautifully prepared and flavored the pad Thai and Panang be both spice to perfection and the service be great and we waitress be so friendly and helpful I want to come back the very next day they also work with you on how spicy you want you dish so if you prefer a extra kick just ask but I d recommend try the dish how they prepare they first since I like spice and think they do a great job of make the dish spicy but not to the point where the spice overpower the dish the food be honestly star worthy SO tasty but because they accidently glutenate I I m go to give it a bummer three star I ask the waitress if anything be gluten free and she say the pad thai all the people ask for it it be safer I know after the word safer I be in for a real treat the pad thai be amazing but then after feel strange I call back and ask probe question about what be in it I argue with the woman over fish paste and she say the fish paste have wheat in it and it be in the pad thai yet the pad thai be gluten free EEK if you be a celiac be careful and just go through the ingredient of what you want to order the hot tea be amazing and they offer the honey sugar packet great if you be not gluten free for sure go here for thai it be amazing if you be just be very very careful usually when my friend go on and on about how they love a restaurant I can t wait to get in and try the food we taste be often a match the first concern I have from the beginning be the fact that there be only one person of Thai descent working and she be sling the stuff they be sell we open the menu to find reasonably price fare a soft spot for my wallet many of the dish you would be accustom to find in any Thai restaurant could also be find on the menu here since it be my first visit to this establishment I decide to go safe and order the Pad see iew with Chicken once it arrive I be please with the presentation but in my many year of eat I have learn just because it look good fo show don t mean it goin da taste good to be fair it wasn t horrible but I certainly have have better the waitress could have be quite a bit more attentive something just seem a little off about she I couldn t quite put my finger on what it be that be off but if I do I ll let you know perhaps one thing could have be the fact that a table of come into she section about minute after we arrive and we seem to have be just forget to sum it up folk if you be in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and st St amazing food serve by the people that invent the stuff and prompt extremely attentive service one night we decide to look for a good thai restaurant in CenPho and upon some search and previous good review we choose to try the Wild Thaiger we start the meal off with the corn fritter they be crispy and delicious and have a yummy cucumber chutney with they for my entree I have the Tofu Mangone and it be awesome I love spice and not just a little I like a lot and my dish certainly turn up the heat we finish the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake it be creamy cool and a wonderful way to end a meal I m so happy to have find a good thai place I have be to the Wild Thaiger several time and I decide I should write a review because it be such a great restaurant I go for lunch this time and the service be great although it be slightly loud the food more than make up for it start out with lettuce wrap and end with pad Thai it be amazing very tasty I use to go here once every two week for lunch with my coworker it be extremely delicious Thai food if slightly difficult to get a table if you be a group of or more understandable pad thai curry be excellent ambiance extrememly fun hot sauce and pepper extrememly available the drink here be highly recommend Lychee Gin Martinis YES YES YES YES YES I m not sure why I havent start make this at home I have my union go away party here on the patio so awesome in the fall and winter oh also the staff be awesome not only be the waitress extremely attractive but also very nice and always remember we big gang of fool crave Thai I wasn t willing to drive all the way up to Siam Thai on st ave and northern to get my fix and I have yet to try the Thai my own neighborhood have to offer decide on Wild Thaiger I choose to save Thai Hut for another time they offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose see no one out on the patio yea it be warm out but not that uncomfortable I enter the restaurant and be greet and seat quickly choose a spot at the bar Thai iced tea in hand I review the menu Hummm ok pretty standard menu but be a fan of curry I note my choice be limit I guess I could have have they sub the beef for chicken in the dish but I wasn t feel up for the hassle after a process that seem like forever I decide to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settle on the Green Curry with beef the tofu tower be well present with a cucumber chutney salad that be fresh with a vinegarette that still didn t do much for the tofu the same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai be more clean and crisp while green curry s be not generally my favorite I often find they bland and less flavorful than a red the beef green curry be tasty the heat be one that build up slowly as you eat but be never overwhelming to the overall dish the jasmine rice be cook perfectly while overall I can t complain I can say I have have better but it be a worthy option when seek a quick Thai fix still craving a good curry I guess I know what I will be make at home this weekend or maybe I will try Thai Hut Food be alright Service be the worst I have ever experience I take almost two hour for we to receive we food i haven t and will not go back thai hut be MUCH BETTER CHEAPER BETTER SERVICE i ve have a few dish here the veggie curry hit the spot for I but the one dish that stick out in my memory be the seafood panang even though i be put off by the texture of some sea creature especially squid and mussel i love this dish the sauce be savory spicy sweet and rich the assortment of seafood in this panang consist of salmon scallop mussel and squid the salmon pair quite well with panang sauce as do the tender scallop the mussel taste wonderful in this dish despite they graphic texture the squid be rubbery and i can t recall a time when i ve not eat rubbery squid be there a way to make its texture more palatable despite the squid i probably order wild thaiger s seafood panang once a month when i can afford to do so and when i be craving a protein rich meal the veggie spring roll here be okay but not amazing the thai iced tea be standard which be good the tom yum or be it tom kah soup be unique as it have a sharper flavor than i m use to more spice seem to be use and it taste fresher than some of the thai soup i ve have in other thai place overall i have to say i love this restaurant when i m in the mood for thai I always eat here since a the food be great b it be super close and c the wait staff be really friendly I have never have bad service here and I come all the time although maybe that s why I get good service because I come all the time I must admit though I only rotate through maybe four dish on the menu if it ain t break don t fix it this place be highly recommend by we friend and we be hope to also like it first off I call and ask if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband be birthday the lady on the phone say it be not a issue we get there and it be pack on a Friday night the hostess say it would be minute for a table literally two seconds later there be a four person table clear I ask for the table and she get someone to clean it for we the place be busy and noisy the menu be limited and average price for most item I crave noodle so order the pad Seiw the noodle be alright somehow seem like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower the hubby have the bbq chicken with coconut rice later we server later come back to tell we that they be go to charge we dollar for bring we own cake nice how that be not mention on the phone or when she first take the cake to the fridge for we so sadly we will not be return Thai Rama have much better food and service I be a huge fan of spicy food and this stuff knock my sock off if you aren t as adventurous with you spice or just don t want you tongue to die simply ask they to make it mild all in all super yummy will def be back oh and you have to try the thai iced tea its mental how good it be I give it star because I don t want to throw around star and save they for those rare awesome moment when food knock my sock off denjoy i haven t be in a while but I remember be impressed nice ambiance especially for a Thai restaurant finally get to eat at this place after drive by so many time it be great great food great set up great vibe great server everything be just great go for lunch and get great meal off the lunch menu and we total bill be can t beat that the iced tea be a little different but in a good way I think it be a green tea iced tea very impressed will definitely be go back it be fine a fine thai meal to have before a rock show downtown would I go again if I be in Phoenix probably not maybe so the service be fantastic the food be fine the place just have a weird energy or maybe that s just a Phoenix thing Wild Thaiger be very cozy and invite this be my first time eat Thai food so I be look to have a great experience unfortunately the service or lack there of almost ruin it for I they be not very busy but it take about minute for the hostess to seat we the server take another minute to take we drink order the Thai iced tea be really different but very good we order some chicken egg roll and when they finally come or they be amazing we main dish take forever to come out and it be just ok I think I like Thai food but I will not be return here this place be really we favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far the corn fritter appetizer be so yummy and I love they pad thaus which I usually get vegetarian with tofu I have not have any veggie pad thaus that be better anywhere else Wish it be closer to we we d go a lot more often if it be I have eat at a number of Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area and this definitely be in the top the food be great as be the service and it have a cozy patio if you enjoy eat outside or be a smoker the price be also reasonable they do serve alcohol although I m not sure if it be full bar or beer wine service only Husband and I decide to try this place out base on the great yelp review and it do not disappoint we order takeout and weren t too adventure I order the beef panang and husband order a peanut chicken dish both be delicious the chicken be moist and flavorful and the Panang have just the right amount of spice one of my main complaint with the local Thai eaterie be that they generally do not provide much spicy kick but Wild Thaiger know how to pack the punch definitely do not order the spicy dish if you can t take the heat go there on a first friday night they be slam but the waitress be still very attentive we order pad thai tom ka gai and sticky rice all three be delicious great patio too very mediocre there be two better thai option in the downtown area Thai Elephant and Thai E San Wild Thaiger have mediocre curry i have try to enjoy dinner there two time and horrible slow service check out the place I mention above in the land where many of the Thai restaurant simply rotate protein carb and a standard vegetable medley Wild Thaiger dish out more authentic version of traditional Thai specialty I m a huge fan especially give that it be proof in and of itself that Thai food be more than just a combo plate it be a explosion of flavor amalgamate into unique and colorful profile and texture it be a adventure Wild Thaiger offer some of my favorite that be not to be find at Thai Basil so mediocre and Thai Elephant good but standard Dragon s Eggs be a spin on Kanom Jeeb thai pork and crab dumpling similar to shu mai grace with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top Decha Boar celebrate the not often serve wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorn they understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot and there be a whole taste profile there just wait for you to explore best of all the presentation on the dish be a work of art ribbon of carrot and beet as edible garnish remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out if you be look for standard Thai without flair or panache I could see how this might be see as too expensive but for my money i d rather blow my tastebud out of the park with a mindful chef who prepare she curry and sauce with finesse and grace yum to the freakin yum I have be here numerous time and almost always get the pad Thai and always leave stuff and happy I like Thaiger because I feel very appropriate drinking wine with my Thai food because of the swanky interior of the place I especially love the open air patio where I take my mom to dinner when she come to visit some say this place doesn t have the best Thai food in the Valley and with so many option I would not be surprise if there be a superior Thai place somewhere however in term of classy Thai in Phoenix you can t beat Wild Thaiger also I love the pun in the name there I say it if you can get past the goofy name the food be please in every way how the staff behind the line can pump out delicious dish like the best pad thai I have ever have present each plate in something resemble high art and not explode despite a fast food pace be beyond my meager understanding it be a eastern thing dude also amazing the female wait staff just go you ll see what I mean yeah incredible anyway a good place to remember on North Central since enjoy authentic Thai food in Bangkok and particularly at the oriental hotel year ago I have wait for the day that a Thai restaurant somewhere else approach the delicate blend of flavor of those first taste it happen at Wild Thaiger The soup and the curry be wild and wonderful and this weekend we be dismay to find out that we couldn t get take out before pm but we will be back soon big portion highly recommend the food be super tasty the decor be nice but the service could be improve upon my husband and I try to stop here if we be in the area because the food be so delicious and elegantly serve the pad Thai and curry be tasty as be the Thai iced tea creamy sweet tea with ice I usually order the yellow curry with chicken Lunch hour be very busy so you might get stick wait for you server once we go after the lunch hour rush but still end up with sub par service because the staff be eat they lunch despite the sometimes slow service we come back because of the quality and taste of the food go on my birthday after St Francis have a hour long wait very happy with we decision have the ginger martini very sweet but very good then we share the vegetarian appetizer plate the corn fritter be mind blow good never have anything like that before I have the tofu pad thaus which be perfect the hubby have the mahi mahi which be good but could have use more sauce we friend split the yellow curry which be some of the best I have have in town great heat and flavor bathroom be clean and nicely decorate the whole place have a positive vibe and friendly though not the most prompt service will go back again for sure I can only say that it be amazing I be a fan and the service be really great I recommend try this place if you like authentic Thai food I will definitely be go back I have a surprising lunch at the Thaiger receive a royal welcome from a singularly beautiful Thai woman sit where you want move chair to be more comfortable we be so glad you be here etc etc then nothing maybe it be we fault as we choose outside on a cloudy cool day after no response I go in order food food be deliver minute later Didn t have a complete place setting and they never return so I trudge back inside and so it go then add insult to injury the food be bland when it arrive why ask about spice level another trip to the bar for some pepper they give I chop serrano pepper so I can only conclude the kitchen be not attentive to we choice we choose WT base on yelp review and have to say it look like they would know Thai food and maybe on a different day the experience would be better however on we visit we be treat as intrusion instead of guest and be not likely to be back not worth the time or money solid star MikeLet I say that this be by far the best Thai food I have have in Phoenix the atmosphere be great very friendly staff we be seat right away and make to feel right at home I have the strawberry Champagne Martini it be very well make I must say this place be great for a first date anniversary or valentine the owner be wonderful I recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple I will continue to go back as long as they be open you win t be disappointed we have eat here about time now and we be always delighted the beef panang be just killer the strip of beef be incredibly tender and of high quality I usually find that the strip be a perfect medium which I didn t know be possible in Thai cuisine the sauce ohhhhhh the sauce pour it over the rice if you get it to go and just love personally my favorite be the yellow curry look I have have Thai Elephant Thai E Sam Thai Basil and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can t remember yellow curry be my dish it be absolutely the best here every time I eat it my scalp tingle and I slip into a blissful happy place the steamed vegetable be so tender that they fall apart the little relish on the side be shockingly delicious and refreshing the duck sauce that come with the fry roll make they worthwhile I know there be something with peanut sauce satay that make I happy appetizer and dessert be up to you if you like cellophane wrap veggie roll they be great here if you like coconut ice cream do it if not you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entree another note don t come here think this be authentic Thai cuisine it be definitely Thai but upgrade in my opinion it be perfect it be also a good place to take someone on he or she first taste of Thai mediocre Thai food nothing

the man who tell I I be wrong be older and possibly a manager or owner they tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towel even when it isn t busy which can be pretty annoying they cardio room always have Fox News on two tv and then the middle tv have sport center on regardless of what else be on tv they recently haven t even be put pen game and stuff on must be too busy watch the inch

have be to papa j be a good handful of time so I know the menu decently well but the server couldn t explain any of the question I have about a couple new dish I be think about try I swear this guy must have just look at the menu for the first time a few minute ago n nbut it wasn t just the knowledge of the menu it be one thing after another with we server my wife ask for a glass of water time until she finally get it at which point the meal be over so we didn t care at that point I mean come on for a restaurant of this calibre and price be it too much to ask for a glass of water there be no one fill up water n nmy biggest complaint however be what happen with we meal my dad and I both order the trout special trout with roasted red pepper and lump crabmeat instead the meal that be deliver to both of we be trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushroom not what the special be at all and by the way that item be on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake be make by the server which we be sure it be or the chef who know for certain not to mention though that a good server wouldn t have serve we that regardless n nbut before you think we have a unusal experience that be all due to a poor server let I continue when we inform we server of the mistake he didn t really believe we until he check he order sheet and then he blame the error on the chef at

musician for instance Rubber Ducky and Gangsta be Paradise be both feature when I be there and both perform impeccably they also honor a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive and a request for anything else which they promptly follow the musician also do funny version of popular song and throw in thing like yinz instead of you n ni see in awe of the performer for a decent portion of the night it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this consider the energy confidence wit empathy boldness silliness cleverness and sheer talent a job like this require

haphazard people would order drink and food and get thing at wildly different time one person be do eat appetizer and drink when another be just get they first drink I know there be chaos to a big

and a few good dessert and appetizer and everything be competently prepared overall it be a fine enough meal for a large group before go to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable price but some of the service standard be poor in the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurant in the area and then move over to d b s for game n nBar Star n ndrink be predictably expensive but there be a wide variety the problem be that about half of they don t even kind of resemble what be on the menu and most don t have enough alcohol to even taste worse yet while you can get a drink at the bar in

n nThere be a lot of great game here to play and many that be fun with group or pair it be a great place for a large party because you can mingle with all you friend play many different very fun game

several time during the show the price be well above what I d consider reasonable give the quality and I d begrudgingly or even happily just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup but the food be bad you re force to either a buy extremely overpriced drink for a soda for example with no refill or ten dollar for one with refill or b buy moderately

unprofessional way to say goodbye to one s customer n since the soft drink don t come with free refill the server shouldn t ask would you like a refill on that or anything of the sort they should ask would you like another one instead they should also respond to request for refill by say we don t offer refill but I d be happy to get you another one just because there be a dollar refillable soda

there aren t really any bad seat they usually have a MC for the night who start warm up the crowd this guy be funny and so be the opening act before John Heffron my only complaint about this place be

everyone else in the place salad or dessert aren t the greatest choice when you be expect to eat dinner at the show I think the Improv should have waive the two item minimum on this occasion even if

fill the seat in the front by the stage first the seating be layer in tier each tier have a long booth with table and chair for seat it be very comfortable roomy and a interactive set up the stage be close to the seat some table be right at the stage with little space between you and the comedian which make it very interactive and fun we arrive at the Improv around pm for a show that start at pm with door open at pm we wait in line until the door open at about pm so they be really behind schedule the show start around pm with two open comedian before the main act the show be over around be the only negative be that the staff be not very friendly and immediately tell I that I have to buy a minimum of two item off of the menu ticket isn t enough I be not hungry and do not want to drink so this be a bit frustrating especially because it wasn t disclose on the ticket or anywhere else the server do not hold we to the minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I get away get drink for the night the food menu look great and the price seem reasonable though if you want water you be look at for Fiji or sparkling it be for a glass of wine for bottomless soda complete with a take home improv glass the other thing that I didn t like be that a employee take you ticket while you be wait in line and mark you hand with a dry erase marker after one bathroom trip the mark be go so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as a already pay customer since the employee take you proof of purchase these negative do not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most

use one of the many self checkout lane normally I don t mind this esp when I m only purchase a couple of item but the empty self checkout lane that I spot be one with a conveyor belt and I couldn t figure out how to use it not that it matter since I have only one item but the self checkout lane must be operate use a very specific procedure see below so I move over to one of the express self checkout lane similar to those in the Shadyside md which I know how to operate however I still manage to bungle the process since I forget to scan my one item before I put it on the scale that double as a bag station so I have to wait for one of the ever so slow employee to come over and key in a authorization code so I could pay n ni m not sure if the self checkout stand that GE use be standard in the industry since I have never use they anywhere else but I hate the whole weigh bag process in order to use the self checkout station each item must be scan and then place on the scale and if the weight isn t correct for any reason include use you own bag a employee be summon to check it I assume the intention be to prevent people from shoplifting but it be a major pita for both customer and employee most of the employee include the one I deal with tonight don t care and just key the code without even look at the error message explain why they be summon and I doubt most shoplifter pay for

when I be in elementary school and didn t really know how to swim I still kinda don t lol anyway it be in California at raging river and it be a traumatizing experience scream be toss around in the pool that push periodic wave at the sound of a loud horn and end up with scrape knee and foot not fun n nso to say the least I be a bit nervous come to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I be be drown luckily that do not happen n ni seriously have SO MUCH fun here I honestly be only expect to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf we hit up so many ride tandem and single ride I feel like such a big girl now definitely lean back while you be on those single donut on the water ride or else you feel like you be go to flip over while swish down the tube the new dragon ride they just open up be okay I be expect it to be so much more fun but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl you way down the middle hole and that be it n nthere be this one ride where you slide down the tube for a few seconds then you land into a pool where a worker push you into another tube and this continue about time it be weird Kinda awkward with the worker have to grab you and push you through although it be still fun the last dude throw I in backwards scare the crap out of I but it be fun n nthe food here be surprisingly pretty affordable plus who want to eat a huge meal while in you swim suit I don t want no pot belly n noverall I have such a fun time here it definitely make I rethink my fear of water park by the way we go on a Saturday in early June and it wasn t as pack as I think it would be so the line weren t long at all also go to giant Eagle to purchase you discounted ticket you save a few buck versus buy they at the water park oh and don t forget to bring sandal while walk around you foot will literally feel like they be burn from the ground now go off and have some fun type review business id ui

slide be great although you could always add more they be still fun the pool it be just pack so packed that you d think they d add a second pool look around it look like they have the extra space maybe a adult only pool swimming with zillion kid plus adult drink yes I like that you can bring you bevvie in the pool but it be kinda weird be around so many kid and you start to wonder how clean the water be I mean zillion kid you get ta expect a good amount of kiddo be pee in the pool n nthe sidewalk be also scalding hot i d assume since many of the people be walk around barefoot you d be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorb surface and I m not investing in those dorky water shoe sorry n ni m always happy to see a Potato Patch stand just as good as K wood they also serve chicken tender which be nice if you want a little meat to add on nothing more be need for I although the frozen drink look tasty and tempting it be so hot out I be just down water by the gallon you be also allow to bring in you own snack and food which I think be nice for family who want to save a little mola n nAgain Sandcastle be so awesome to have in the Burgh it would be nice to see improvement
